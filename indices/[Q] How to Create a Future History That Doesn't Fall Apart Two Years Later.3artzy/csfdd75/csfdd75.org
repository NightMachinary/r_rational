The easiest answer is to simply not set it in the light-cone of planet Earth, and avoid getting technical with the underlying physics in a way that advances in understanding would invalidate. On the other hand, feel free to get as nitpicky and technical as you want when it comes to physics you invent yourself -- just be consistent about it.

Making your own world not in our universe, with its own history, is an easy and popular way to accomplish this. If Earth scientists disprove a theory you were operating under, well, all you have to do is say that your world is different. Problem solved.
