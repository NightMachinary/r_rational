Star Trek has done surprisingly well, considering. As has the Culture 'verse.

(Although it isn't hard sci-fi, so that might be more difficult.)

So: firstly, don't pin down too much of Earth's immediate history. Star Trek has always had trouble with the whole "Eugenics Wars" thing, which fluctuates between "somewhere in the not-too-distant future" and "happened in the 90s in an alternate timeline to ours"; but it /does/ have the advantage of wiping out all information about the intervening years, preventing most of the gaffes you'd expect. Both the Culture and the Federation have only been shown visiting Earth in our past, or the fairly distant future, and the latter is kept very vague.

Secondly: high tech level. This doesn't necessarily mean "posthuman gods", or even transhumanism; but is does mean that pretty much everything should have been altered in some way by technology, and that technology should be /several steps above/ what we have now, so it'll take a while to catch up if it's even physically possible in the end.

Thirdly, generalize like mad. The least realistic part of both the Culture and Star Trek settings is that they're both filled with humanoids living in bizarrely earthlike societies; but it /works/, because that's an established minor scientific mystery/field of study in the setting. You could probably have Starfish Aliens just as easily (Three Worlds Collide does); as long as you don't base them on scientific speculation that might become outdated in the meantime. What matters is that you have a consistent vision for what kind of general rules we'll find govern planetary societies; that our world at least roughly fits those rules; and that they're acknowledged as in-universe things people study rather than giving the impression that you're just too dumb to imagine anything else.

That's my guess, anyway.

Oh, and one more thing: don't be afraid to handwave like mad if something /does/ come up. The Culture suddenly sprouted neural interfaces, and the Federation touchscreens everywhere, when the authors realized that they really should have had them from the beginning. And so /they did/, somehow, even though we never saw them; and they became an established part of the setting.
