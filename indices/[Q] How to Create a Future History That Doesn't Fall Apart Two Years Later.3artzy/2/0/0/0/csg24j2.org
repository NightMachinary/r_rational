From the article that I linked:

  The Laundry Files /explicitly/ exists in an alternate history to our own, okay? Word Of God speaking here. "The Rhesus Chart" is set in mid-2013, and "The Annihilation Score" in summer/autumn of 2013. I'm going to kick "The Nightmare Stacks" (or whatever book 7 is titled) down the road into a 2014 which will be well in our past and nailed down by the time the book is handed in, in autumn of 2015.

(I should also point out that CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN is a gradient, not a singular event; arguably, "The Rhesus Chart" was set at the beginning of CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN.)
