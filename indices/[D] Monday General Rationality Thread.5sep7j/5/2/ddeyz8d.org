I really like this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes rational stories about solving a puzzle, though I always thought the reveal as to why the characters were put through the puzzle was one of the weaker parts. It was still presented very well and had the intended dramatic impact, but I do think it's a bit silly when you take an objective look at the plot and what the puzzle actually accomplished. It's about the journey more than the destination.

SPOILERS AHEAD

As for your question, even just selling the product like normal would be a restriction on who gets it and, ultimately, what impact it will have on the world. It's something that /will/ save lives and should not be suppressed, but since it will also change the world the company wanted someone to help make the hard moral choices that will come up.

I don't think it's just about creating a strategic plan, but also having to deal with people who will use the product to pursue an agenda, righteous or not. Some will want it publicly released, some will want it regulated, some will want to profit from it, some will want it banned, and some will want it to be exclusively for certain people whom they trust.
