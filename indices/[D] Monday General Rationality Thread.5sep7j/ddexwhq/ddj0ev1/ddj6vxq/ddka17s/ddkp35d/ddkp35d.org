The /white/ working class are the ones who are uniting behind a leader, everyone else is uniting against them for supporting a leader we hate. That's not a recipe for destroying the political establishment, but an alliance between the establishment and liberals to take down the conservative populists. If we win the elites will probably make some concessions to liberal populists, but I don't yet see the odds being in favor of the system being heavily reformed to better represent the people. There just isn't enough of a consensus in the country as to what to fix or how.
