I read it back in middle school, which was the wrong age for me to find the story engaging especially since we were only reading to learn about the Russian Revolution, but today I understand it. In response to oppression they rallied behind authoritarian leaders because they didn't know any better and by the time they realized their lives were just as bad if not worse than ever their leader had become too powerful to stop even by his peers.

What makes it difficult for me to see how it relates to today is that the people rallying behind the demagogue aren't actually being oppressed by the people they're targeting, at least half the population doesn't support the leader which seems to only embolden the supporters, and our society is much better educated than the Russian serfs who backed Stalin. They couldn't have known the truth, but we do and are making the wrong decisions anyway.
