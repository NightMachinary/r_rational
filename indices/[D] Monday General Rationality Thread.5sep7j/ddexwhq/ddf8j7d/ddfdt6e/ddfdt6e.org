It's not the book's fault that I found those themes unwhelming, the novel is so old and influential that the messages have been analyzed and reinterpreted by nearly every political satire since then, but I'm still disappointed that the message about nationalism feels rote and somewhat undercut by the rest of the worldbuilding when compared to real history and modern social science.

Newspeak is one of the few ideas that I haven't seen explored in greater detail elsewhere, but I still don't understand what special insight it grants beyond the basics of information control and propaganda. The book's dystopia was groundbreaking for its time and is still respectable for taking the idea as dark and depression as any novel could while still resonating with political issues at the time, but it just didn't do anything for me that other stories haven't.
