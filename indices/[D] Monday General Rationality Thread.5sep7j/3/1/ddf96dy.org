I think this is harder for things like video games which entrench themselves into your brain with devious reward structures (on some level of abstraction), but it might be helpful to think about how actions can habituate.

Which is to say, if you avoid playing games for an extended period of time, the desire to play more might lessen. The preliminary research I've seen into habits shows that, for some things, you don't even need a reward loop-- repetition itself leads to habituation.
