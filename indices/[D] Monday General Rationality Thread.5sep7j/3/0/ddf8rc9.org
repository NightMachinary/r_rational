  The worst part is I'll be thinking "I am not enjoying myself" whilst I do this. Completely ridiculous.

I've got this same thing. It most recently struck me while I was playing HOI4, a WWII grand strategy game. I decided to use Cold Turkey to block the game until March so that it would become fresh for me again, and I've used Cold Turkey to block websites and games on other occasions.

I also set a series of alarms on my computer to pop up and tell me to ask myself whether I'm enjoying what I'm doing.
