I've got a bit problem with video games. My brain gets too fixated on them, and I hate the way that feels.

The worst way that I sometimes deal with this is going full Akrasic, and deciding "I just need to /finish/ the game, and then I'll be free." This recently resulted in me powering through 20+ hours of a game.

The worst part is I'll be thinking "I am not enjoying myself" whilst I do this. Completely ridiculous.

I'm trying to teach myself to catch that initial "I don't actually want to do this" and amplify it as much as possible. I bathe in this feeling and then don't do the bad thing, instead of ignoring it and jumping into the thing.

A month - 2 days ago I /swore/ not to play games for a month. Two weeks ago I decided this was a terrible idea, and wondered if I should keep it or not. After some thought I decided that I should do my best to fulfill my promises, as that's a useful identity to have.
