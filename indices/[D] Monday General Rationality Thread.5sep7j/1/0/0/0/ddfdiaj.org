  I forgot to talk to the potential PI I fanboy over at the other school, although I did mention him in my Statement of Intent.

Ah, yeah, that's a big one (unless you're golden everywhere else). It doesn't even have to be too strong a connection, especially at places that interview. Just a

  "Hi Dr. /Who/ever,

  I saw on your [[https://www.google.com/#q=lab+website+that+says+they%27re+accepting+PhD+students][website]] that you were looking for new students (or, if I didn't see that, wanted to inquire as to whether you were accepting PhD students at this time).

  I'm a statistician/computerScientist/clown/4thYearUndergradAtSomeUni/etc. with interests in [fields that they work in] and [methods that they work on]. Specifically, I'm fascinated by the prospect of [decent project description that will complement their own work]. I've done a bit of [relevant stuff], which I published/presented on in the nebulous recent past. Your work in [their paper] and [their other paper] brushes up against this, especially [something that shows that you actually read their papers].

  I'm interested in applying to [their institution and program] and would love to have the opportunity to chat with you about the possibility of us working together. I've attached my [fabulous] CV below, if you're interested.

  Thanks!

  [your name]

And then that would escalate to maybe an email chain a dozen long in which you demonstrate genuine interest and basic competence, and bam, you're good (even better would be skype conversations or, if you're nearby, in-person visits).

#+begin_quote
  I also think I'm just straight-up underprepared for this institution, since it is kinda the best in the world.
#+end_quote

Eh, imposter syndrome is like the most talked about grad student thing ever. You'd probably be fine!

  I seriously could not get my MSc advisor to write a fucking recommendation letter on-deadline. He sent one in a month and a half late. Goddamnit.
#+end_quote

Haha that happened with my UGrad PI too (my most important letter!). They kept dallying and ultimately sent it a month after the due date. Their reassurance that "this happens all the time, totally par for the course, don't worry about it!" wasn't very helpful lol.

  Because at the time I figured, hey, I have a nice stable job, why apply to extra programs when I really only want to work in one or two specific labs? Now I... don't have a nice stable job, and feel like I should have done more to make sure I can get into PhD school.
#+end_quote

Ah, gotcha. How costly was it for you to apply to additional schools at that margin? I mostly remember tweaking my personal and research statements a bit for each, and chatting with prospective PIs, but each additional one only took maybe an extra ~5-10 hours. Even if you're really confident you can get in somewhere, it's still good to apply to multiple places because funding packages can vary significantly.

  The latter sends admissions decisions in mid-February through March.

Hopefully their response is satisfactory!

  In related news, I got reviews for my research paper in cog-sci a couple weeks ago. One review withdrew their review, the editor says it's almost definitely a reject, and the other reviewer wants major revisions. Some of their advice is useful, though!
#+end_quote

Ah, bummer! So it goes! At least you got good advice! (my wife just got a paper rejected with one very positive, one fairly positive, and one super negative review, where the super negative reviewer clearly hadn't read it -- as in, they must have read the wrong paper, since their criticisms had nothing to do with hers lol).

#+begin_quote
  Actually, at some point, could I PM you, explain my situation in full, and just get some advice on what to do?
#+end_quote

Sure, feel free. My reddit use is pretty sporadic (sometimes I'll check it multiple times a day, other times I'll go months without going on), so if it's something time sensitive just use this [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/contact/][contact thing]] on my blog.

Also, start thinking about fellowship apps! If you've already thought about them, think about them some more! There's so much free money out there (the NSF-GRF, DOE SCGF/CSGF, FORD, Hertz, NDSEG, SMART, PDSOROS, GEM, etc. etc. etc... though IDK much about opportunities for international students) and people always totally fail to take advantage of it. And having a few hundred Gs in your back pocket skyrockets your appeal to admissions committees, too!

edit: also, I think your CS degrees are more than sufficient for the programs you're interested in. If you're still unsure, one way to clarify matters /and/ show initiative during the application process would be to ask your prospective PIs during the course of your dozen emails what they'd recommend in way of preparing to enter the program and their lab. Books/papers to read, MOOCs to take, etc.
