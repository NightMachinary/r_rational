  Eh, IDK that a degree in a relevant field is all that necessary for a strong PhD application if you're good on other measures (like the personal interest of a prospective PI, a strong GitHub profile, etc. Did you see my post on PhD Program admissions criteria a few days back?).

I saw your post, but I think I fucked-up:

- I did get interest from a potential PI at one school. However, it turns out their admissions tend to be nationalistic: they don't like foreigners (like me, from south of their border).

- I forgot to talk to the potential PI I fanboy over at the other school, although I did mention him in my Statement of Intent. Or rather, I spent my time preparing my application, having panic attacks, and trying to get my GREs rescheduled -- rather than talking to the PI like I should have. I also think I'm just straight-up underprepared for this institution, since it is kinda the best in the world.

- I seriously could not get my MSc advisor to write a fucking recommendation letter on-deadline. He sent one in a month and a half late. Goddamnit.

  Why'd you only apply to two programs? What's your undergrad in?

Because at the time I figured, hey, I have a nice stable job, why apply to extra programs when I really only want to work in one or two specific labs? Now I... /don't/ have a nice stable job, and feel like I should have done more to make sure I can get into PhD school. My undergrad and preexisting research Master's (with a small, B-grade-conference publication) are in Computer Science. Both are from decent institutions, but merely top-20 (undergrad: top 20 in USA, grad: top 20 in world) rather than #1.

The PhD programs I'm applying to are in a Brain and Cognitive Sciences department, and a Computer Science department to work with a professor cross-listed between CS and Statistics on probabilistic learning. The former sends out its interview invitations at the end of January, and I didn't get one. The latter sends admissions decisions in mid-February through March.

In related news, I got reviews for my research paper in cog-sci a couple weeks ago. One review withdrew their review, the editor says it's almost definitely a reject, and the other reviewer wants major revisions. Some of their advice is useful, though!
