Does anyone know an affordable way to get a second undergrad or Master's degree in statistics? I'm pretty sure one of my PhD applications for the year was a dud, and the other was probably an accidental dud due to preferring students from their own country.

I feel pretty stranded on pursuing the path I actually wanted without a proper Bayesian stats, probabilistic graphical models, and cog-sci background, as opposed to self-study.
