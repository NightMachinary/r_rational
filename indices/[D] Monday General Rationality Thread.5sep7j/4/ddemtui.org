Weekly Monday Update

--------------

Story is still plugging along, the first chapter should be done by the end of the week and the Pokemon Renegades Engine's feature list is still being worked out.

--------------

I was meditating on one of ScottAlexander's articles a while ago, and he said something that kind of stuck with me. He was talking about how he always felt bad as a psychiatrist when people had an injury that wouldn't let them work, and those people were in some mode of depression or suicidal thoughts. When trying to get them to not commit suicide, he mentions that he feels bad saying "Think about those that care about you" ie "Think of the affect it would have if you commit suicide. You're being selfish"

The intellectual problem trying to be addressed in a lot of those suicidal thoughts is the belief that you have no value and whatnot. From there, one of the problems of depression is an incorrect self-worth-appraisal. It's not just that you're a burden on people, it's also often that you're not contributing either, or don't feel like you are contributing. And if you rely on the "think about how your death would affect others" approach, what you're telling yourself or the other person, or they may see it this way, is that they have no intrinsic value to bring to the table, so they need to rely on others for their self-valuations, and I think that is wrong.

I don't have a proper response for it though, but my suggestion is to find something positive you can bring to the table and contribute from there. Then you can say "I did x thing" and "I can't let go because of project Y". You or the other person might not be able to get out from under the "I'm a net-loss financially" thought pattern, but it does help to direct your mind. And if you're able to run personal projects, and such, I predict that it will help you to come to terms somewhat with your problems that's the root of your depression (assuming there are any ofc)
