The Capital by Marx.

I started a couple of days ago and the insight is staggering.

However it's understandable, it is a critique of capitalism which is alive but not well and that latter facts makes the analysis really easy to grasp.

Note: i would suggest to brush up a bit of Hegel given that a lot of Marx comes from his critique/agreements with that particular phylosophy.
