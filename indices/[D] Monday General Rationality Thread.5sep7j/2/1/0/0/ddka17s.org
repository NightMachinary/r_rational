  They couldn't have known the truth, but we do and are making the wrong decisions anyway.

We have a decision-making mechanism which disproportionately empowers specific segments of the population. Thus, the demagogue has to target /them/ rather than /everyone/. In a way, this makes it easier for him to acquire power, but it also puts the major obstacles in his way that, well, 73% of the registered voter population and 2/3 of the nation's GDP now not only oppose him but /despise/ him.

A lot of leftists I know have been comparing 2017 to 1917, and I'm sort of starting to see what they meant. Our upper class did not actually intend this outcome to happen, and as a result is dividing against itself. The governing segment of the upper class are /blundering around/ because the functionaries who can run a vast, bureaucratic, federalized state efficiently just don't want to work in an openly abusive environment. Meanwhile, our working class is growing more strident and more united than any time since the 1910s-1930s labor movement that built the New Deal.

For instance, [[https://twitter.com/i/moments/829897770123268100][/this/]] is a live-tweet of a /town-hall meeting/ with the head of the /House Oversight Committee/. You don't normally even hear or care about the House Oversight Committee, let alone show up to its head's town-hall meetings and start telling him how to do his job properly.

The USA is getting to be ripe for revolution, and there's a fair amount of resistance to going down the fascist route. We're not even two months in and people are talking about [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/07/the-womens-march-organizers-want-a-general-strike-against-trump-could-it-work/?utm_term=.c252c157af36][general]] [[http://www.dw.com/en/the-audacity-of-planning-a-general-strike-against-president-trump/a-37481584][strikes]].

These efforts could indeed fail. Some of them will. However, this is a level of action utterly new in American history: even a /partial/ general strike will hit the ruling class harder than they are used to ever being hit.
