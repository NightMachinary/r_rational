I heard that 1984 has suffered a resurgence in popularity in response to the current political climate, so I decided to check it out in the hope I might learn something useful. Now that I'm finished, I really don't know what I can take from the experience. The worldbuilding and psychology of the characters was so alien to me that I can barely imagine how it applies to the real world or the implications it has for rationality.

I was specifically looking for insight into the ideology of authoritarianism and how social and psychological forces can lead to its rise. The book was instead about living under the ultimate totalitarian state and the psychology it forces it's citizens to adopt for the sole purpose of controlling them through fear and pain. I didn't get what I wanted or anything I thought I didn't already know.

Is there anyplace I could get the insight I'm looking for? It's possible I've already learned all I need about this topic from The Righteous Mind, my favorite sociology book that everyone should read, but I'd rather that not be the case since I don't think my current knowledge is helping me to preserve liberal democracy in the face of populism that rejects rationality. I'm holding out for some answer to my question that makes me less cynical and depressed about politics than I am now.
