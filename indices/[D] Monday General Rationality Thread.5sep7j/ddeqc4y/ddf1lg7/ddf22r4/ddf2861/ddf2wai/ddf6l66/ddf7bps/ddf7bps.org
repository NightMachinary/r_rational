Oh, the =>= was just to show that he was quoting you. That's not necessary at all. You meant "quotation operator" as in =>= but I meant it as in ="=. What I /think/ happened is that you used the wrong sort of quotation marks: =“= instead of ="= (since your comment prior to editing showed a link of =#s%20%E2%80%9= and =%E2%80%9= is the HTML encoding for =“=).

I guess I can test that:

[[#s%20%E2%80%9Ctest%22][curly quote test]]

[[#s][normal quote test]]

Markdown handles the two differently, as you can hopefully see. [[http://i.imgur.com/9z1Ctgl.png][(here's what it looks like on my end)]]
