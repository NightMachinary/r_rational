Eh, IDK that a degree in a relevant field is all that necessary for a strong PhD application if you're good on other measures (like the personal interest of a prospective PI, a strong GitHub profile, etc. Did you see my post on [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/11/07/grad-school-admissions-criteria/][PhD Program admissions criteria]] a few days back?). I'm ABD in a solid program(s) (top 3 or top 15 in the US, depending) doing, well, Bayesian graphical modeling, in a sense, and I had no relevant experience when I was accepted.

Otherwise, a few Master's programs /are/ funded (through RAs or TAs) but many are not. You could probably find a cheap one. You could also go to a less prestigious place for a PhD, Master out, chill in industry for a bit, and then reapply for a PhD elsewhere, but that's super-duper skeevy and highly frowned upon and may hurt you ultimately.

For a second undergrad, getting something from whatever state you have residency in would probably be the cheapest, especially if you can transfer credits from your first degree (or from some CC?). There are tons of scholarships and financial assistance programs that could help, but otherwise you'd have to take out a small-ish loan and best live pretty frugally (or work on the side -- relevant work, especially, would catapult your ultimate PhD app significantly). Dunno how undergrad financial aid works if you've already been through once (or if there are age cutoffs, etc.), but lotsa schools cover demonstrated financial need, at least your first time around. Apply to a bunch of places -- sometimes you can stack 10 smaller, niche scholarships atop one another, which is pretty groovy.

I hear going abroad to study can be pretty cheap, too, but maybe not for international students?

Why'd you only apply to two programs? What's your undergrad in?
