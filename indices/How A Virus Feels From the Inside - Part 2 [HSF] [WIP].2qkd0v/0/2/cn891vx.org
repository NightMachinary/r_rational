For a very long time, I believed that reddit was a waste of time and I didn't login to my account for 7 years (reddit was a fun community completely at the beginning before they even had subreddits).

Since then, I've discovered this subreddit and I actually get some value out of it. I get to read new stories and authors (like Ted Chiang but also Eaglejarl and Alexander Wales) and I find that sometimes discussion here is quite interesting (although I'm more of a lurker, same as in Less Wrong).

I need fun in my life and for me fun is reading interesting discussions and good fiction. I also work from home so having some place with a community around is beneficial for me I think.
