But this only makes sense if you think, like Altair, reddit is a bad site to be spending time on.

I perceive reddit to be one of the better sites for socializing online, and to further enhance the quality of my time, I put the people I talk to through a very basic test. Do they have similar interests, encourage genuine discussion of interesting topics, or introduce new viewpoints/modes of thought?

This test helps ensure that the time I spend on reddit is likely to be beneficial rather than addicting or a waste.

So far the test works to pass [[/r/rational]] (I have found the great Ted Chiang and learned to handle certain personal situations in a more mature manner) and fail [[/r/ScienceFiction]] (it's all about science fiction stories and not enough about the more interesting principles behind the science in the stories).

Sorry to have rambled for a bit, but my main question is, why did this story convince you to quit reddit?

P.S. For interesting discussion, is there any meaning to AltairX10's name?
