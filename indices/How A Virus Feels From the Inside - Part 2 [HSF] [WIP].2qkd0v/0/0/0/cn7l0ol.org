For me, reddit is something that primarily serves to distract me from being actually productive. As a procrastination tool, yeah, it's a bad site to be spending time on. It's also an addiction, which is, yknow, usually detrimental to freedom and life in general.

Socializing? I love talking with you guys, but I'll likely never meet any of you and it will have no bearing on my real life, which is already full of enough socialization tbh.

This story made me confront those things by making me actually think about it. Turns out that's all I needed.
