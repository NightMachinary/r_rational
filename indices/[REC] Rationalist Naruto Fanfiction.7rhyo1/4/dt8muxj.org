  Time Braid: I dislike Sakura, and don't want to read a story where she's the MC (rationalist or not). Reading it feels like a chore and isn't hedonistic (this may be due to my reluctance to start stories with female MCs (and I have much less patience in fanfiction).

If it helps, the characterization of Time Braid Sakura is very different from the characterization of canon Sakura. She kind of starts out the same way, but changes fast.

Out of curiosity, why the antipathy towards female MCs? Do the authors you've tried out thus far just write them differently? Or is it something more than that, like just simply knowing they're female makes it harder to identify with or something?
