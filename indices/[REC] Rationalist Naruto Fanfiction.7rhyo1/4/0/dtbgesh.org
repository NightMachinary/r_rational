Well I recently read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11953567/126/][Lavender Clouds]] (MC is Hinata), and I really, really enjoyed it (much more than I expected to (the grammar is horrendous)), even crying at times). I thought it might be because knowing they're female makes them harder to identify with (and the situation with Lavender clouds is very rare), I still think it is, but seeing as I could empathise with Hinata (though not fully insert myself as her (I usually inserted from the POV of the male characters she interacted with)) I think how the author writes them affects my enjoyment. I now believe that I simply cannot self insert in female characters though (this isn't the same as identifying with a character (which I can do)).\\

Time Braid sounds like something I'll read because I should read it, not because I'll enjoy it. Sakura as an MC is a problem (I have trouble with Chiaroscuro because Shikamaru is the MC). Excluding the fact I can't self insert in female characters, I dislike Sakura as a character, and reading her as MC (even with a different personality) is not something I *want* to do).
