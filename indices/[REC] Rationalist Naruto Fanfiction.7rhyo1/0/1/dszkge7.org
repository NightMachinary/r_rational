IMO /Team Anko/ turns Orochimaru into a villain sue, by making him a bit too moral among other things I picked up on in the narrative (it was one of those death of a thousand cuts situations where I can't really point to one thing). The hypercompetency I can understand since he's supposed to be at the absolute top of a very competitive profession in canon, but it confuses me how he seems to genuinely care about his people when there's no need to act despite being stated to have some sort of antisocial personality disorder, and at other times ot showing any empathy. Otherwise it was pretty enjoyable.
