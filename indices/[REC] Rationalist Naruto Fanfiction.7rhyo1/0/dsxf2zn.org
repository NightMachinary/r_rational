EagleJarl's Team Anko is Naruto Rational Fanfiction: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko]]

#+begin_quote
  (AU) [Rationality, meet Naruto] - Anko never wanted to lead a genin team. Sadly, the Hokage isn't okay with that; he hands her Naruto, Hinata, and Shino and orders her to "make them the best ninja and, more importantly, the best /people/ possible." She's got her work cut out for her. M for combat and occasional cursing.

164k words, complete. Naruto is the MC but there is another character who really shines here.

Many people liked it. Could be worth investigating.
