I think the goal here is maximizing the chance that you get to live ~forever /due to your own actions/. Every branch has an identical chance of resulting in a given outcome, after all, including immortality--but humans are very self-centered.

There's also an argument to be made that, just by using a QRNG, he's automatically increasing the chances of living forever by inflating the probability space, since he doesn't care at all about any other outcome.
