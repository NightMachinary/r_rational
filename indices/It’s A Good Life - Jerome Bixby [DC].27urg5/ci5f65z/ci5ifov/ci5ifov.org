Might have just worked if Anthony was a little older..

I could see him granting Administrative access to the first genuine peer he makes - whether they want to or not.

As time passes he would develop a longing for the interpersonal relationships he observes everyone else having. And then decide after many, many mindrapes that he needs someone who he can't edit on a whim. Or establish something so that he can't easily read their minds. And maybe create a scenario where they can interact like normal friends. Just so er, he could experience the novelty of the situation? If he can develop a strong enough emotional connection and trust with this person, he'd eventually turn them like him too.

You know, that sounds like some prime fanfiction exploration there.. !developingGod
