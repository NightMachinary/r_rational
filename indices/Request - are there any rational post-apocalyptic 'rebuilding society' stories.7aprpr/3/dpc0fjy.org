There's a worm fic called Setanta which might just barely count. Characters are not rationalists, but the setting is pretty well designed and realistic. Side stories go into decent depth about the process of building a town using a "flat-pack" building kit and a chemistry Bible created pre-apocalypse specifically to enable the reconstruction of society.
