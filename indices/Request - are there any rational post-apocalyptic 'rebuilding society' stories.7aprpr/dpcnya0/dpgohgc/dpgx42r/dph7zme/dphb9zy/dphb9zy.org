  Okay, if you like it, but I'm curious - is it that you don't think is a Gary Stu, or is it that you don't mind it?
#+end_quote

I certainly don't think that it's a Gary Stu. Yes, Rudi and his friends are certainly potent warriors, but I don't recall them pulling off anything more impressive than, say, Aragorn does. They get injured, they lose friends along the way, they fuck up, and in the end - even Rudi can't live forever. What's Gary Stu-ish about them, really?

  And to say the least, I definitely wouldn't call it rationalfic - though rationalfic about meeting some would be really interesting.

The later books definitely aren't rationalfic, but I was thinking mostly of /Dies the Fire/ and the rest of the initial trilogy.

(And: the Mackenzies go heavy Wiccan, but they're only one nation, aren't they? The Protectorate is definitely more Christian than not, and there's the Mormons, Mount Angel, the Dunedain, Corvallis, Boise...)
