Localroger has covered this a few times. If you'll forgive spoilers, the much-panned end of the novella Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect is a very "close up" view of this (an Adam and Eve sort of thing), while the entire series of (very) short stories /Passages in the Void/ details that from a "wide angle" view (robots seeding humanity on a new planet).

Both are good reads but I highly recommend /Passages in the Void/.
