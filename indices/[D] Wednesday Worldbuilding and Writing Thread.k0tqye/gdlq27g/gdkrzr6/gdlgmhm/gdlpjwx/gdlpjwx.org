In general, this is going to be most useful for materials that are otherwise difficult-to-impossible to cut through. Wood and flesh are not very difficult, but metal and stone would make for good candidates. It's also going to generally be more useful for materials that are more plentiful which makes stone likely to be the best choice for most cases.

From a combat perspective, metal might have a niche as the better choice since you can bypass metal armor and shields, and destroy any metal weapons that you parry. However, this requires being directly in hand-to-hand combat which is rarely a good idea. Sooner or later, someone is going to stab you to death.

Stone nonetheless offers an interesting potential role in combat. Instead of using it to attack people, you can use the knife to cut through stone defenses, like walls. For example, if you have an army assaulting a fortified city, you can build a portable defense platform to provide cover as you walk up to the wall and then use the knife to cut a hole and start letting soldiers through. As the attack moves through the city, you could use the knife to create unconventional entrances into fortified buildings to allow soldiers to bypass many of the defenses.

Aside from these, stone offers some substantial economic uses. You can use the knife to quickly make stone bricks for castle-building, or even hollow out stone pipe sections. You can also make various stone-crafts like mugs, bowls, plates, dice, candlesticks, jade rings, and even furniture like granite tables or countertops, and marble benches or statues.

One other advantage of stone is that, with the right gearing system, you could use the knife for tunnel boring. You could build a steam-powered machine which spins the knife to cut through the rock in front of it, and then spits it out the back with a conveyor belt so that workers can haul it away. A machine like this could be used to quickly tunnel under enemy defenses, or to build an escape tunnel to bypass an enemy siege. You could also use it to dig pilot holes to locate ore veins if you want to set up mines for coal, metal ores, and precious gems.
