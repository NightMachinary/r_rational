"the type of material" is conceptual, but must be common sense, and can only be decided once and for all. So for example, "wood" is ok, if you consider wood to be a type of material. "Carbon" could be conceptually a type of material, if you think that way. But "Love" or "nothingness" or "space time", or "quarks" are not really a type of material in most people's minds. So unless you are a very strange kind of physicist or a philosopher, you wont be able to code the knife for something ephemeral or non-obvious.
