I like the idea that the limitations on "type of material that can be cut" are entirely decided by the wielder's mind/worldview. So if you could train your mind to think in a much more literal/physical sense about how matter works, then you could potentially do something really cool and physics-y with the knife. (This scenario reminds me of the partial transfiguration plot point in HPMOR.)
