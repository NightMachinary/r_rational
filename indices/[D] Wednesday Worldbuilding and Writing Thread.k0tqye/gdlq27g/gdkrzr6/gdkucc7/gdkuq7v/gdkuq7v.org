You could split the diffrence. Just say that collagen fibers are yellow enough that green powers dont really work on them completely. It is probably more scientifically accurate to account for the mixing of waveforms of light. So white light has some resistance so you cant make say a photon thin blade and slice things unless they are in deep darkness.

So you can hit someone with a hard light hammer but you couldn't force choke them really.
