Worm fanfiction question. Should the green lantern emotion spectrum be treated similarly to the character Weld in respect to the Manton effect?

To further explain, some powers are limited in such a way as to only affect living things. Other powers only affect nonliving things. Hardly ever can someone do both.

In weld's case, he is a living man of metal. Things that affect the living don't affect him because his metal counts as nonliving. Things that affect the nonliving do not affect him because he counts as a living person. So he gets the best of both worlds.

How do you think hard light constructs made of will should interact with the Manton effect?
