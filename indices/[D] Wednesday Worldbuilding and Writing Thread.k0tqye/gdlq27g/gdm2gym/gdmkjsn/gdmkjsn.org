The idea of using the architectural magic (or for that matter, the other magics too) in order to duplication materials is something that I've been noodling, because if it's allowed, then it's probably the most important feature of the system, at least from a worldbuilding perspective. Architects would replace mines and forestry service, and ... that's not really that interesting to me.

I'm not sure what kind of patch is best (there are a few obvious ones), but it probably depends on the kind of story I'd want to be using the systems for.
