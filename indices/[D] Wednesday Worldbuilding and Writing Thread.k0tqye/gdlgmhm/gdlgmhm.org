rationalist optimization of a magical artifact:

If you could have a knife that perfectly cuts only one type of material (only wood, only rock, only metals, only flesh etc etc) what would be the most rational pick, and how would you use it?

For the sake of the argument lets assume that the knife looks like a standard steak knife, and its edge disintegrates the chosen type of material allowing the blade to slice through with zero resistance.
