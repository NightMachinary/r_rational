I'm a little confused about the question. Most non-worm superpowers can't affect humans internally. Telekinetics can't just create instability in the hear to cause someone to pass out, hydrokinetics can't affect the cerebrospinal fluid, portal creators can't create portals inside someone, and I don't off-hand remember any green lanterns that created stuff inside someone as their standard attack.

Maybe what you mean is whether green constructs counts as both living and dead? I think they mostly are energy taken physical form so I don't see why that would count as living.
