In that case, I think the best choice is a material that a regular knife cannot ordinarily cut through, so I'd go with either metal or stone (with wood as a distant third). But overall, I think the best choice would be metal.

Naturally, there are always going to be situations where one option is more useful than others. However, there are already available tools for cutting through wood (axes and saws) and shaping stone (chisels and hammers), but as far as I know, precise cutting or shaping of metal requires either a very high-pressure water jet or heating it in a forge and then hammering it. Thus, while tools for the former 2 substances can run off of elbow grease, tools for the latter typically require additional external resources and infrastructure.
