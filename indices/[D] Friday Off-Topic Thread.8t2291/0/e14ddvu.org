Someone laughs. You make an inquiry regarding the reason. Unfortunately, it isn't a quick joke or silly image but something that requires a fair amount of context (say, between one and five minutes of explanation).

Would you prefer to get that context, or just be told that there's a lot of context that you don't have and so it wouldn't be funny for you?
