Depends on the person and what sort of time I have available, but usually I'd rather learn something than remain ignorant. Even if the joke isn't funny once tediously explained, I'm still closer to being amused by such jokes in the future. And, more importantly, I have some degree of understanding of a cultural touchstone.
