I just got back from seeing it. I thought it was one of those frustrating movies where I could see the germ of something good, but it was obscured by ... well, action was a big part of it, but also a little bit too much pandering, especially with regards to morally reprehensible characters being set up for the audience to hate, then extended sequences where they all get killed by dinosaurs (which I'd call textbook torture porn if the movie wasn't PG-13).

Germs of good stuff:

1. Claire gets called out on her complicity in the events of the first movie. Given more runtime and less of a focus on action sequences, I feel like this whole movie could have been about her overcoming her guilt over what happened in the first movie.
2. There's at least some focus on the question of commercialization, which seems like fertile ground. The dinosaurs were initially created in order to be a tourist attraction, and in this movie there's a definite question of "but what are the dinosaurs /for/?", which gets a few lines but not much more. If they wanted to do a deep dive on animal rights, that would have been the way to go; dinosaurs cost time, money, and require a lot of expertise, which just isn't going to happen without some economic /purpose/, short of a billionaire bankrolling the whole thing. Admittedly, [[#s][spoiler]]
3. I actually thought that the little girl was a brilliant addition ... that was completely squandered. If you wanted to provide parallels to [[#s][spoiler]], then that's a great way to go, but it all remains unexplored subtext, probably because it's a little bit too divisive of a question for a Hollywood action movie, especially if it's not going to be a focus. The movie did basically nothing with it.
