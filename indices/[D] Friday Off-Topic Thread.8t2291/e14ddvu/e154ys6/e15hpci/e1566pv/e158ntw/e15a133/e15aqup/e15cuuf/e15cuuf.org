I put it on x1.25 for informational media and for certain music (I just think some songs sound "like they're supposed to sound" when they're sped up, y'know?).

And I'm not saying the longer the better, I'm saying longer gives the narrative some room to stretch out and breath. I think Fallen Kingdom might've actually been pretty great if it had been like 45 minutes longer (and maybe written by someone other than Colin Trevorrow; Jesus Effing Heck, can you imagine if they actually let him do Star Wars Episode IX?).

I'm basically saying that time constraints constrain the narrative.
