In an age of binge-watching an entire 10-hour season of a show on Netflix in the span of a few days and pouring 150 hours into a videogame over the course of a couple of weeks, 2 hours seems paltry in comparison. Hell, the youtubers-who-play-videogames I watch make videos almost that long on a regular basis. I've watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN-bvbdUc8E][a /three-hour/ game of Uno]].

I know there aren't just novels, there's also novellas and short stories, but I feel like a lot of movies are the equivalent of trying to crunch a 300-page novel into a 20-page short story, and the rest of them are trying to stretch a 5-page short story into a 15-page short story. Neither of those feel optimal to me.
