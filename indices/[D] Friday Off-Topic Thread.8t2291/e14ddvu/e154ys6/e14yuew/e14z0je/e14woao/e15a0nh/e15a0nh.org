Presumably the state would sue the company, and if the company doesn't pay up after the court case, the state that the company is based in would have their police/government help, just like how it works with any other court case across state lines.

If it's across country borders it becomes a lot more questionable, but it probably depends on the country's relationship with the US. If the other country is entirely hostile, what would happen is that if the owners of the company ever entered the US, they would be arrested.
