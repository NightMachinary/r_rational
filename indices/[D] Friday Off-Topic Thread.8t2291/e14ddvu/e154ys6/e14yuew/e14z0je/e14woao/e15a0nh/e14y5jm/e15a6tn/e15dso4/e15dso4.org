*If you think a comment violates the rules, please report it and move on.*

Note that the US-politics ban is a subsection of "Keep [[/r/rational]] pleasant and on-topic", and that as moderators we can legitimately do whatever we think will serve the purposes of the subreddit.

In this case, we judged that the parent comment is related to but not /about/ US politics, and unlikely to cause problems. If that last bit changes we'll just remove the whole thread.
