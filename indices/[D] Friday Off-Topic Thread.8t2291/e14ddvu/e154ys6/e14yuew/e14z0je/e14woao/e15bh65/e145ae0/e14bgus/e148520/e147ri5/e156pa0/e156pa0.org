  I can differentiate all these meanings: <i class="ship-name">Titanic</i>, <i class="book-title">GURPS Basic Set: Characters</i>, <span lang="la">et cetera</span>. Isn't it <em>awesome</em>?

So... you like it because it's inherently satisfying to include your actual, precise meaning into what you write? Because otherwise, if all your different styles are italics anyway, it doesn't really make a difference to the reader.
