How can anybody enjoy such works as [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Highschool_of_the_Dead][/Highschool of the Dead/]]? Desperate zombie survival and gratuitous panty shots [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Mood_Dissonance][fail to mix]], I think. It just smacks of trying /way/ too hard.

The key word, of course, is =gratuitous=. All this lewdness would make a lot more sense if, in this new, chaotic world, [[http://i.imgur.com/QdrLLo5.png][the male characters were scheming about how to rape the female characters, planning how to protect the female characters from being raped, and forming rape gangs and anti-rape alliances with each other (and, for the anti-rapists, with female characters---but is that "male ally" who just clued you girls in to the coming struggle actually a spy who's trying to lure you into an ambush? Or is he just some hapless schmoe who's been threatened by a rape gang /into/ luring you into an ambush, on pain of death if he betrays them, because they want to capture their meat unsullied in a quick ambush rather than damaged in a bloody battle?)]]*---but nothing of the sort is happening, so the effect is a complete /non sequitur/ for the viewer. See also [[https://komperaklause.deviantart.com/art/The-Fruit-Part-1-601172516][this interesting story]], which does an /excellent/ job of combining survival and eroticism.

*I frame this as a male-vs.-female contest because the anime's titillation (at least in the few episodes at which I glanced) is derived entirely from the girls. I once read a reversed-gender-roles hentai manga** and thought that it was fairly interesting, and I'm sure that a post-apocalyptic female-on-male-rape-squad scenario would be interesting to watch as well. (Someone probably has made a /Fallout/ mod for that, come to think of it...)

**It was somewhat funny. The male protagonist was a high-schooler who had somehow been teleported into a mirror world where women were dominant and boisterous and men were submissive and chaste (and, since this was a hentai manga, everyone adhered to stereotypes). He proceeded to confuse and shock all the girls in his school by acting forwardly in a manner totally uncharacteristic of mirror-world boys. I didn't bother to download it, unfortunately.

Speaking of gratuitous errantry from the beaten path, gratuitously-loose /translations/ make me angry as well. Why does [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][Project Gutenberg's translation of /The Three Musketeers/]] need to translate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cu][=écu=]] as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(English_coin)][=crown=]] when the word /actually/ means =shield=? (See also the English cognate =escutcheon=.) It doesn't translate =livre= to =pound=, does it? Yes, a numismatist will tell you that [[https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces27889.html][Louis XIII's French écu]] and [[https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces52427.html][Charles I's English crown]] were vaguely equivalent in value (3.23 vs. 2.06 grams of gold, according to those links, but [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Swashbucklers/][/GURPS Swashbucklers/]] lists them as being around $20 vs. $25* over the entire 17th and 18th centuries) and that the écu displays on its reverse side not just a shield but also a crown atop that shield---but =écu= is not =couronne=, and =shield= is not =crown=.

*A "GURPS dollar" [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/basic/][is defined]] as the typical price of a loaf of bread ([[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Low-Tech/companion3/][or a pound of grain---or, more broadly, half the amount of food necessary to sustain a typical character for one day---in an urban area]]). It's meant to be a constant measure of value that's valid across all campaigns.

One of the coolest parts of [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/][HTML]] is that you can remove the ambiguity of italicization. If I italicize something in Markdown, that italicization must have its meaning deduced from context: Is the italicized text the name of a ship, the title of a book, a non-English phrase, or a stretch of text that I want the reader to imagine me saying in an elevated tone of voice? In HTML (with [[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp][C]]S[[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp][S]]), I can /differentiate/ all these meanings: <i class="ship-name">Titanic</i>, <i class="book-title">GURPS Basic Set: Characters</i>, <span lang="la">et cetera</span>. Isn't it <em>awesome</em>?
