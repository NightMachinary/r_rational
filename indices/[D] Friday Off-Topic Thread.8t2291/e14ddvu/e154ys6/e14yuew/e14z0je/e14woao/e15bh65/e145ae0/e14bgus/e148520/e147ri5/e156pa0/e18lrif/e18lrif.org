The reversed gender roles hentai is: Teisou Gyakuten Sekai by Amahara

As for why someone would like Highschool of the Dead, I remember reading in my teens while I was going down the list of all ecchi manga, and enjoying it for its, in comparison to other ecchi and horror manga, level headed and intelligent characters. Now a decade later, I can still appreciate it for its dedication to pushing its ecchiness, its gun otaku-ness, and its self awareness as a b movie turned to comic form.

Too bad the writer died.
