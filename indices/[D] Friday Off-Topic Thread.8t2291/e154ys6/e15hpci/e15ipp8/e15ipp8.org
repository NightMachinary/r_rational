  I thought it was one of those frustrating movies where I could see the germ of something good
#+end_quote

That's how I feel about literally *every movie.

#+begin_quote
  Claire gets called out on her complicity in the events of the first movie. Given more runtime and less of a focus on action sequences, I feel like this whole movie could have been about her overcoming her guilt over what happened in the first movie.

That wouldve been plott, which this movie doent have.

  I actually thought that the little girl was a brilliant addition ... that was completely squandered.
#+end_quote

Her "thing" was a bit of expostion from the badguy and the the ending. "Squandered" is optimistic. Unless of course she's retained to Jurassic World III and gets some unexpected plot.

#+begin_quote
  The movie did basically nothing with it.
#+end_quote

Yeah, except for the very very very end where she pushes the button. Which is what made me like "what?" in the first place.

I don't drink often, but my Bday was a month ago and my brothers is in a few days and i'm in absolutely no state to say anything about anything because i got him some drink a month ago so i've got less than half a bottle of burnett's left, meaning i've had more than half a bottle lf burnetts.

I WILL say, it was an absolute waste of time two wait for the after credits sceene, that could have totally been integrated into the final montage and it was a waste of ten minutes to see a few pterodactyls flying around the eirfel tower replica inn las vegas. HPIO has sucked up all of my writing resources, but two years ago i had like 12 ideas for differnt fanfics, ad one was a novelization of jurassic qworld in the style of crichton (since i read those books when i was like 10 yersa old) and i have to say, like, a year ago i was antsy like "i better get this thing started befor ethe next movie comes out" but after seeing this movie i feel like it doesn'nt matter, like , *nothing( happens in this movie and i'm not going to be incorporating any of it at all whatsoever.
