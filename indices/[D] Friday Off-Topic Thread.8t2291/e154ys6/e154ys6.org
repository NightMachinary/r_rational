I've only seen it once so I'm not sure yet, but I think I might think Jurassic World is a better movie than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

That's not as much of an insult as it sounds like; I long ago came to the conclusion that movies are an inferior medium for conveying narrative (can you imagine condensing season 1 of Stranger things into a 2-hour film /without losing anything important?/ or BioShock Infinite? or /any/ book? the best book-to-movie adaption I've ever seen is /the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe/, and that's probably due to the fact that the book only takes about an hour longer to read than the movie's run-time), so I give movies a lot of slack and tolerate a lot of their irrational BS. /As far as movies go,/ I like Jurassic World well enough. It's definitely better than the train wreck of Jurassic Park III.

Fallen Kingdom was beautiful - better cinematography than Jurassic World, great CGI - but... idk. It felt empty, like the sole reason for its existence is simply to set up the next movie. I enjoyed it while I was watching it, but thinking about it afterwards... idk. It feels like Fallen Kingdom is nothing but two extended "the plot requires it" sequences; like there were a lot of short "the plot requires it" sequences in Jurassic World (like the I-rex escape - why no tracking in the paddock? why no landlines? why no cell service when it's outright stated that the I-rex is sponsored by Verizon and there's probably severals of cell towers on the island? why walk from the paddock to the car or drive the car into the woods when the I-rex could be 30 feet away? why not transfer the animal to a permanent paddock when it's still a juvenile?), but all the little "the plot requires it" sequences lead into something else (if only another series of "plot requires it" sequences), and in Fallen Kingdom... idk.

I'll need to see the movie again, maybe I'll change my mind after seeing it again. Or maybe not, because I felt like I'd already seen it before when I was sitting in the theater. If you've seen all the trailers for it, you've basically already seen the movie. The trailers basically used one shot from each scene and put them in roughly the order they occur in the movie, and that's pretty unbelievable.

There's one pretty significant thing they kept secret, and it has to do with the little girl. I thought she did a better job of acting than a lot of the adults, but the "twist" that centers around her... idk. I can't figure out the point of /"her being the thing that she is"/ other than having someone to do /"the thing that she does at the end of the movie,"/ because *for once* the main characters decide to do the rational thing but then the little girl jumps in and does the irrational thing and I guess the script required someone who would "have a reason" to do the irrational thing so they made her be the thing that she is... idk.

If I had to sum up my feelings about Fallen Kingdom, it'd be "idk." I'll need to see it again.
