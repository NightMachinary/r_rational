Movies give pretty good enjoyment value per unit of time spent watching them, and are cheap time investments. Yeah, a good book is amazing to finish, but if I spend 10 hours reading a book for it to end unsatifyingly, then I'm going to feel much more put out compared to a 2 hour movie that was similarly bad precisely because I had much less time invested in the movie.

Also, I think action movies don't have good translations into other mediums. There's action in books, certainly, but it isn't precisely the same to me, and live action movies are much better able to do action scenes well than similar live action TV shows. Mad Max: Fury Road couldn't have translated it's action scenes into a TV format, because a TV series wouldn't have made as much money, and thus wouldn't have had the same budget. There's animated action movies of similar scope, but that's basically a different genre given the relative budget and importance put into the different mediums.

You can somewhat consider the MCU to be a long running, expansive TV show where each episode happens to be a 2 hour movie, and given it's popularity I think that does lend credence to your idea that TV is better than movies.
