  I think action movies don't have good translations into other mediums.

Totally fair. You can't just write "and then Trinity jumped in the air and time froze while the camera circled around her," but then that's not narrative, that's action.

  I think that does lend credence to your idea that TV is better than movies.

I'm really hoping the His Dark Materials thing on the BBC shows this off. Like, they're going to give the Golden Compass about 8 hours where that piss-poor movie from a decade ago only gave it 2 hours. At an average reading speed of 200 words per minute, the Golden Compass takes about 9.5 hours to read. Two hours just isn't enough sometimes.
