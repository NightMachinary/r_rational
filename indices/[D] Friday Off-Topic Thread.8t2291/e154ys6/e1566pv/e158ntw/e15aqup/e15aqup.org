You're saying that like the longer something is, the better.

Speaking for myself, I've stopped watching hours-long let's plays, and moved on to formats like Ross's Game Dungeon, where the content creator spends time polishing the result instead of giving me a dull hours-long stream-of-thought. When I do watch stream-of-thought type media, I tend to accelerate it x1.5 or x2 or I lose attention.
