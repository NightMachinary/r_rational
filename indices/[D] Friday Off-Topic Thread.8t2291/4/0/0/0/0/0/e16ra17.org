Note that I'm not speaking as a lawyer here, so preface all my statements with "I'm not positive, but I believe that ..."

  In the preceding example, would CA sue the NY-based company in a CA court or an NY court? Or a federal court? (Why would you sue in federal court for breach of a state law?)
#+end_quote

CA would sue the NY-based company in a CA court. The NY-based company would be expected to send a representative to the CA court. This is the exact same as many other circumstances where companies/people get in law suits in places they are not located in. For example, if you get a ticket in CA and live in NY, you can't just not pay the ticket by not going back to CA.

  What really irks me is that Kennedy thinks that "sufficient connection" is that residents of the state send a company money (<= $100,000 per anum) or that the company sends residents parcels (<= 200 per anum). That stinks of a tariff, which, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure has been prohibited.

It's not a tariff because it applies equally to companies based both in-state and out-of-state.

  Another bit bothers me, that I think this sub might take interest in: Kennedy says that "Second, Quill creates rather than resolves market distortions." If we define "distortions" as undesirable optimizations, fine, but you'll get those no matter what the rule is. People will munchkin the rules if there is a profit to be made.

Quill incentivizes buying online instead of offline from companies across state lines, which is a distortion because the state laws shouldn't be altering the market nationally (or something like that - this is a point I'm very shaky on).

  That said, should I use a Montana based mail-forwarding service? I'm not sure if tax is based on mailing or billing address, but it would be easy enough to set up both of those in a state with no sales tax. This would distort markets even further, would it not?
#+end_quote

In cases like this, the answer is that it is based on the location of the actual recipient, regardless of mailing or billing address, just like how if you buy an expensive item in a no-sales-tax state, you are still supposed to report sales tax in your state.
