That still doesn't make any sense. I get that once you have a judgement there are mechanisms for collecting, but I'm still confused about how to reach a judgement in the first place. In the preceding example, would CA sue the NY-based company in a CA court or an NY court? Or a federal court? (Why would you sue in federal court for breach of a state law?)

None of what you've shown explains how an entity residing in one state can be beholden to laws governing another state. In his opinion, Kennedy says the following,

#+begin_quote
  It is settled law that a business need not have a physical presence in a State to satisfy the demands of due process. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 476 (1985).
#+end_quote

This is not terribly satisfying to me, as I'm not particularly interested in looking up thirty year old cases.

What really irks me is that Kennedy thinks that "sufficient connection" is that residents of the state send a company money (<= $100,000 per anum) or that the company sends residents parcels (<= 200 per anum). That stinks of a tariff, which, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure has been prohibited.

Another bit bothers me, that I think this sub might take interest in: Kennedy says that "Second, /Quill/ creates rather than resolves market distortions." If we define "distortions" as undesirable optimizations, fine, but you'll get those no matter what the rule is. People will munchkin the rules if there is a profit to be made.

That said, should I use a Montana based mail-forwarding service? I'm not sure if tax is based on mailing or billing address, but it would be easy enough to set up both of those in a state with no sales tax. This would distort markets even further, would it not?
