So, the US Supreme Court [[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-494_j4el.pdf][ruled]] this week that states can force companies outside their borders to collect taxes from the state's residents, or so called Internet Sales Tax. It was a 5-4 decision, but a mixed bag of liberal and conservative justices on either side, so the politics is somewhat a wash. The jurisprudence is an absolute disaster (Kennedy doesn't seem to have a strong grasp of the English language). In particular, the problem is that a state cannot force a company to collect taxes unless it has some connection with the state, like a physical presence. Kennedy decided that a /virtual/ connection is sufficient, like say, because everyone is virtually connected by the internet (hence my complaint that he doesn't understand language). He makes all kinds of arguments about "authority" to impose taxes, but isn't that somewhat different than power?

So, my question: How is a state supposed force compliance? Is a state supposed to send their state troopers into another state to seize assets from a non-compliant company?
