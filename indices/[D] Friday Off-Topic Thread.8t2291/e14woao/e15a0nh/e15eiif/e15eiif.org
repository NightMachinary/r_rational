  Presumably the state would sue the company, and if the company doesn't pay up after the court case, the state that the company is based in would have their police/government help, just like how it works with any other court case across state lines.

Can you give an example of this? Have the various states entered into an agreement to enforce each other's laws?

The example given in that article describes a man suing a Delaware-based comapny in a Delaware court. In the end, they could only enforce their decisions if the owners physically entered a cooperating jurisdiction.

So what happens if CA sues a NY based company for breach of a CA law? They'd have to do it in a NY court, wouldn't they? I can't imagine such a court doing anything but laughing and tossing the case in the bin.
