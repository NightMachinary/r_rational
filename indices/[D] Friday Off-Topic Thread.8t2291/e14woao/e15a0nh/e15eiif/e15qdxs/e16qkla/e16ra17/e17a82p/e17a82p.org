  CA would sue the NY-based company in a CA court. The NY-based company would be expected to send a representative to the CA court. This is the exact same as many other circumstances where companies/people get in law suits in places they are not located in. For example, if you get a ticket in CA and live in NY, you can't just not pay the ticket by not going back to CA.

Again, not convincing. A NY driver getting a ticket while visiting CA will have to deal with the ticket for much of the same reason he was able to use his NY license to drive in CA: because the states have an agreement with each other to cooperate in these matters. In particular, this NY driver will have been in CA while violating a CA law. I suppose I can imagine scenarios where someone visits a state, breaks a local law (not governed by an interstate accord) and leaves. I think the states have an extradition agreement for things like this. But I don't think those apply when the person in question /was never in the state whose laws were violated/.

I can also imagine cases where contracts are made across state borders. I'm certain there's something where the states have agreed to uphold contracts entered into in other states. Again, I don't think it applies, as selling something isn't the same as a contract.

Maybe there's an example of a company selling a product that doesn't satisfy CA regulations? Even though the company isn't located in CA, if they sell it to a CA resident and ship it into the state, the state can sue? Is this a thing that has/can happen?

  It's not a tariff because it applies equally to companies based both in-state and out-of-state.

... I think I see that. I'm not entirely convinced, but I'll probably come the rest of the way with a little more thought.

  Quill incentivizes buying online instead of offline from companies across state lines, which is a distortion because the state laws shouldn't be altering the market nationally (or something like that - this is a point I'm very shaky on).

/Taxes/ distort the market. This is a fundamental economic truth. Before you can talk about "distortion" you have to have a baseline -- distorted /from what/? The only baseline that doesn't seem totally arbitrary to me is "the way things are now." You might take baselines by considering historic norms, and that sounds okay, but it's also kind of arbitrary and demonstrates why "distortion" shouldn't be considered a bad thing at all, in a general sense.

    That said, should I use a Montana based mail-forwarding service? I'm not sure if tax is based on mailing or billing address, but it would be easy enough to set up both of those in a state with no sales tax. This would distort markets even further, would it not?
  #+end_quote

  In cases like this, the answer is that it is based on the location of the actual recipient, regardless of mailing or billing address, just like how if you buy an expensive item in a no-sales-tax state, you are still supposed to report sales tax in your state.
#+end_quote

That's fair. Thinking about it, I realize such a mail-forwarding scheme is straight up tax evasion, but in the same sense that not paying the use tax is tax evasion. Difficult to detect and difficult to prove intent. After all, there are legitimate reasons for people to use mail forwarders. On the other hand, such services also come with their own problems. (I know some companies won't ship to them, because they can't verify the destination, and foreign entities sometimes try to use such services to avoid international tariffs.)
