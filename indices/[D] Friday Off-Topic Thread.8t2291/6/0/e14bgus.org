  **It was somewhat funny. The male protagonist was a high-schooler who had somehow been teleported into a mirror world where women were dominant and boisterous and men were submissive and chaste (and, since this was a hentai manga, everyone adhered to stereotypes). He proceeded to confuse and shock all the girls in his school by acting forwardly in a manner totally uncharacteristic of mirror-world boys. I didn't bother to download it, unfortunately.

This one? It is a series so maybe you meant one of the other 5.
