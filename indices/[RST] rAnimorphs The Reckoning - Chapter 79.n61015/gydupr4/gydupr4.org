I'm lonely and sad so I'm going to type a bunch of thoughts and hopefully they won't come across as unorganized.

I feel like this last act of Reckoning has gotten somewhat bogged down. I'm going to write it straight in the thesis because the rest of this comment is brushing back towards the positive.

Even as far back as the post-Jake chapter after the Arn mission, I was feeling a certain sense of the plot losing the characters. In early adventures the rationalizing the characters did dovetailed with their personal arcs and felt grounded, like what a literate young high schooler would work through in a given situation. As the Ellimist and Crayak acts have heaten up, it's naturally been harder and harder to ground out the characters as they grapple with the changing nature of their challenge.

This is why I've particularly enjoyed Visser Three throughout the work. Recasting the Harry James-Evans-Potter hyperrationalist as the villain, as this completely alien figure contrasted against the more human depictions of "rationality" with the Animorphs has been the strongest element of the fanfic. And I definitely think he lead into the Animorphs pondering the same metaexistential questions he was pondering towards the beginning of the fic. Hell, I feel awful I didn't comment on the chapter where he was like "here, I'll just blow up the cube so we can get on with the plot" because that was legitimately one of the biggest "Oh my god!" moments in rational fic. Golden.

The comment that said you'd built up a ton of goodwill after the last Racheal chapter was spot on. Before that I was telling myself "okay, professional writers can't stick landings, don't pile expectations on this fanfic author" but I have to say, you still have me hoping. Even if you half-execute on a satisfying ending my reaction is going to be "Oh man, that was worth the time the whole way through. What series can you say that about?"

But I do want to be, real with you as a fellow author and as a huge fan of rationalist fanfic that maybe this chapter clusters with sections and bobs of recent chapters to be /a bit much/. That's a natural peril of writing by the chapter and far from a criticism of you as a writer - like I said, you don't have me pre-apologizing to myself for your ending - but I want to be honest with you. Might have left yourself with not enough character meat to hang so many chapters of endgame on when it's all so remote and divorced. I mean you had them coming to terms with increasing divorce from the heart of the war like half the fic ago. Did we benefit from all this time spent relitigating their internal litigations?

I post this more as a thought exercise for future rationalist fics, that when you have an endgame that's going to play out to this level, think about how far you can stretch the characters over it. TK17 should always be seen as a trailblazer to this community in its infancy, and we shouldn't be afraid to say "This could have been better", or else we as writers-reacting will never rise above. But we can say that kind of thing, because this fic is firing on more cylinders as you could hope from a fic and TK seems forward thinking enough to take it in stride.

If I'm wrong I can spend some time typing the gushing praise I don't bother with every week because I assume you have a discord full of it, dude. Sorry if I brought you down, love the work
