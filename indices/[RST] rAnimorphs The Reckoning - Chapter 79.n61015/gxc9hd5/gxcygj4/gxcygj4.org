#+begin_quote
  The board resets after every round, doesn't it?
#+end_quote

Oh that makes a lot of sense, I was struggling with the same problems until I read this. Funny enough, the actual text doesn't explicitly say this- maybe

#+begin_quote
  In the second round of the game, the board is reset, and the attacker is allowed to give two commands
#+end_quote

?
