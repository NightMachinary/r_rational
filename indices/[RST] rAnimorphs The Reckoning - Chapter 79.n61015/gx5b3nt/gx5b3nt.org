  Work has been busy, as has life (I got engaged!!!), hence the three-day delay. I will still try my best to get the next update out by May 16 (i.e. eleven days from now), but I may again need an additional few days. It will be absolutely no later than Sunday, May 23 (and if there are any late edits to this chapter, they'll go up then, too).

[[/u/TK17Studios]] I vote that you edit this to make the 23rd your default and the 30th your last resort fallback, getting engaged is a big deal. Chapter 78 was spectacular and earned you a lot of reader trust, so you can definitely afford to delay, and you deserve a nice break.
