Imagine you have to sacrifice five people to stop someone for whom there's a 50% chance he's a suicide bomber killing ten. Any time you spend thinking about it, your computation time is a loss in expected value.

This Marco only knows that he is bait and expects to die.\\
His predictable Georg-Elser style of rationality combined with him having no idea what he's doing (or if there even is something he can think of doing, where he is), maximizes the computation cost to figure out whether to call the bluff and not intervene [at the risk of him blowing something up] or to fold and kill him [at the risk of there not being anything that he could have blown up].
