It's because the stakes are raised way higher now. The Animorphs have one chance to act, and that's it. They either win, or Crayak kills them all and then goes back to eating galaxies starting with Earth as the epicenter. None of Cassie's or Elfangor's arguments about de-escalation and not crossing lines really apply in the face of that ultimatum.

So they need to pull on any and all levers that are available to them, and attempting to QV the Howlers is one of the biggest ones they've got.
