Congrats on your engagement, TK! That's huge :)

Another pretty abstract chapter. A lot of /talking about plans/, and /talking about talking about plans/, and /thinking about plans that are being talked about offscreen/. I think maybe I was hoping for something a little more concrete, narrative-wise, after the last one was such a major domino setup chapter - like, I'm probably just fiending to get into the really meaty fight-against-Crayak stuff. But this is fine too! Now I get to look forward to the next one.

Plus, like, it's hard to imagine I'll ever be /disappointed/ in a chapter of r!Animorphs. Everything here was great.

Livingstone's quiet, reflective sort of march to the grave was very somber and cool.

I REALLY liked Helium's /ko/ stuff - everything felt so natural, and the gameplay interactions Helium described were such logical developments of the ruleset presented. It felt like the author was casting around for some sort of metaphor for the situation with Crayak, some sort of streamlined translation into intuitively relatable game theory, and realized he could just make up a game that elegantly hits all the major points ("We move at the same time without knowing what the other guy's doing") instead of trying to force a comparison to chess or go or whatever. I vote someone fleshes it out - establishes the new types of walls and pawn moves per round, figures out a first-to-X-rounds win condition or something - and makes it into a real game. :P

Aaaand Cassie's freakin' out again. Poor thing. She's such an interesting character - she's like two or three (or ten?) people crammed into one head, fighting and jeering and sniping at each other. It was a little difficult for me to empathize with the internal conflict when it was all trotted out under hypersight, I think. (That Leeran must know so much tea by now. What's his story? Who is he? Why is he never in the mindmelds? I smell a spinoff fanfic.) I mean, with Cassie's fractured nature laid bare for everyone to look at, you'd think the others would see her and feel the way she operates, and it almost feels like they /couldn't/ do anything but accept her for it. And then you'd think she would feel their acceptance and feel a little better about herself.

It feels like the others would see her good ideas, and then they'd see her sneakily start second-guessing herself, and they'd think, "Well this second voice is obviously useless, let's just ignore it and go with the obviously good first voice." And Cassie would see how genuinely the others appreciate her ideas, and she'd be more able to discount the sneaky second-guesser voice.

I think this happens a little bit in the chapter, but she panics too quickly for it to take hold and be a good thing. I'm also confused as to how she had... time, maybe? ...to come up with that whole shower argument with fake Marco and fake Jake, when she was watching them not-have those reactions right in front of her.

I know that's all a confused jumble, but I have to eat dinner, not proofread.

Great chapter! Eager for more!
