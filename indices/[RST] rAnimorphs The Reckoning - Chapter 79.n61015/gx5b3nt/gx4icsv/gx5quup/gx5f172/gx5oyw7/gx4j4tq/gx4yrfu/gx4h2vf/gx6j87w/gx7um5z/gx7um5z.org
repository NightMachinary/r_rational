Great chapter. Short, doesn't really blow my mind too much, but you're putting the final pieces in place. Can't wait to see what the other plans are.

BTW, this isn't rational fiction but I found a podcast/ARG related to Animorphs called "Sporadic Phantoms" (it's an anagram). It's about three investigatory podcasters trying to figure out what The Sharing is...takes place in the modern day, and the three hosts do not have /any/ idea anything about yeerks, andalites, morphing, etc, so it's all from an outsider's perspective. IT's very well made for something that I can't imagine more than like 60 people listen to.

Sorry to promote something else here, but this rational fanfic and that podcast are like the two greatest pieces of animorphs non-canon content made, and they're being made simultaneously, which is pretty cool. I love finding these treasures on the internet.

Are there any other pieces of rational fiction that are as good as The Reckoning that I can read after this story is finished? I'm really going to fucking miss this story. It's been a wild ride.
