  I REALLY liked Helium's ko stuff - everything felt so natural, and the gameplay interactions Helium described were such logical developments of the ruleset presented. It felt like the author was casting around for some sort of metaphor for the situation with Crayak, some sort of streamlined translation into intuitively relatable game theory, and realized he could just make up a game that elegantly hits all the major points ("We move at the same time without knowing what the other guy's doing") instead of trying to force a comparison to chess or go or whatever. I vote someone fleshes it out - establishes the new types of walls and pawn moves per round, figures out a first-to-X-rounds win condition or something - and makes it into a real game. :P

/I've been hoping someone would talk about ko./ Actually, this is a preexisting game that I've been tinkering with for the past few years, and it occurred to me as I was wrestling with the chapter that I could make it an Andalite thing. =)

  I'm also confused as to how she had... time, maybe? ...to come up with that whole shower argument with fake Marco and fake Jake

... as somebody who does nonzero the-thing-Cassie-does, it happens /very/ fast and it's not always as explicit and spelled-out as that, but it's just, like, I AM READY TO CLAP BACK AT YOU when the other person hasn't even blinked yet.
