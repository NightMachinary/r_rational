Fair enough, Terra's the coalescion that has the most experience with Andalites after all.

I'm curious - in your headcanon, did Perdao rejoin Terra before it split off that part of itself?

If you end up doing extra side stories about the r!Animorphs universe after it's done, I'd be really interested to read a Terra interlude like Hyruk's.
