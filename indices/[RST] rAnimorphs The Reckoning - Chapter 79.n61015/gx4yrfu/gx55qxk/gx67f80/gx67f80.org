I don't think they are as much 'Crayak's personal army' as 'your values are stupid and you are stupid for having them' card. Like, when you can do the nonsense it can do, you don't need armies. It has quantum viruses and relativistic weaponry and a zillion other things.

They always struck me as, like, the devil rolling its eyes at you. Like 'oh, you think caring about the motivations of others makes sense? Here, have a billion billion genocide babies.

Totally up to you.'
