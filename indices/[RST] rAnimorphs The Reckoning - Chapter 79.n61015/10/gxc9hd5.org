Really though, /fuck/ being in Leeran hypersight.

I mean yeah, if the stakes are this high do it obviously, but argh it would suck so much and I completely get where Cassie is coming from. Knowing about the spotlight effect doesn't help, and people making soothing noises that you know beyond doubt are genuine just makes things worse. Love this segment so much.

In a fandom that regularly uses Cassie as a punching bag, I've always appreciated that this story depicts Cassie trying to be good as something hard and confusing instead of childish and stupid.

And Cassie changing her mind like that once she has to also mirrors canon, because /of course/ it does. In 43, when the group has a plan to blow up the Yeerk Pool, Cassie bows out. Then in 52 when they're past status quo and shit is really hitting the fan, she still thinks that it's just as wrong but goes along with it anyway.

--------------

Anyway, I want to talk about something more important, /Ko/.

+We don't have the full rules so maybe I'm misunderstanding the game, but moving sideways isn't about denying the block, it's setting up for the next move.+

+As someone who has thought about this game for ten whole minutes, my opening move as attacker is moving sideways, and I would not have expected the standard meta to be charging down the middle and hoping the defender doesn't play directly in front of the pawn (6-4). Moving forward as attacker seems like a meme opening, or if you're playing the same people regularly you do it just enough to force your opponent to play 6-4 against you just in case.+

+Is Helium just a /Ko/ snob?+

+This meta reeks of Ellimist/Crayak meddling-+

Blargh, nevermind. The board resets after every round, doesn't it? Yeah that makes much more sense and clears up the confusion I had about the rules and Helium's commentary.

Yeah I like the first round, even if it should be effectively meaningless and I'm playing X-4 as defender / move forward as attacker every time in a serious game.

I normally can't stand simultanious action board games. Someone eating my lunch with a move is fine, but having to watch the rest of my now worthless move play out without being able to change tactics sets my teeth on edge. But weirdly I don't think that would bother me with /Ko/, since that's the entire point of the game to begin with.

What's the victory condition for the defender? Holding off the attacker for X number of rounds? Or does a match have both players play take turns as each position, and the better attacker wins?

Speaking of victory conditions. The Ellimist's win condition has always been pretty vague, even in canon. It seems like the Animorphs are overestimating how much Crayak cares about certain things. Presumably all Crayak has to do is stop them from winning and run the clock out; the Howlers seem like something he doesn't need anymore.

Even if part of the plan is blowing up the exposed part of the hypercomputer, that may be annoying to Crayak but still secondary to stopping whatever the Animorphs are going to try to do to win the game.

So, okay, if the win condition is something along the lines of harmony between Yeerks, humans, and Andalites living on Earth... could you just kill every human and Howler on Earth, then send an infested Tobias and Helium to Earth and call it a day? That might be too dangerous to try though, killing /almost/ every human seems like an easy way for Crayak finish the job. Then again, maybe there just aren't any good options to begin with so take what you can get?

And bringing it back full circle, why is /Cassie/ the one going on the genocide mission? Helium even says that they were able to send people on missions suited to them, and Cassie is, well, maybe not literally the last person I would send but she doesn't make the shortlist.

  I can do this. I can get to Mars, and pull the trigger, if Crayak doesn't stop me.

  And then---at that point---

  I would already /be/ on Mars.

  Once more, understanding flowed outward, spreading throughout the circle, followed by acceptance, acknowledgement, agreement.

This seems extremely relevant, but I've spent some time thinking about it and can't figure out why. Cassie is going to Mars to genocide the Howlers, but that's only step one. She has something else to do there, something that will help against Crayak and be particularly suited to her and has to be on Mars paritcularly... yeah, I don't see it.

The other time when Mars comes up in this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  /There's also---uh---/

  It was very hard to not-think-something on purpose in Leeran hypersight.

  /---life, on Mars, these days./
#+end_quote

I had read this as not wanting to bring up the pure ick that is the human colony, but did Helium /succeed/ in not thinking about something, and pivoted to the humans still on Mars? After a quick ctrl-f of the story, the only thing on Mars should be the Mars base which has the bio lab, the automanufactory, the cache of earth military tech, the holochamber with the Howler morph in it, the ships and humans that were assaulting the base, and the human colony (along with Cassie's parents).

I do think the Howler genocide is a screen for a bigger play Cassie is going to make, but I don't see what it would be.
