  /If you're playing Magic or---or blackjack or something, I don't know---if there's no way to win/ unless /you draw a specific card in the next three turns or whatever---/

  The parts of us that were Aximili and Elfangor had nodded in recognition of a core military principle.  It made no difference whether the odds of drawing that specific card were one in three, or one in three thousand---if it were genuinely the case that /all/ of one's hopes of victory hinged upon it, then one should behave as if one were /guaranteed/ to draw it, and take only those actions which were optimal in that swath of possibility.

Hmm... came up with that one myself. Not sure where I needed it. Some turn-based card game I think. Also use that as a general life-strategy.\\
[justifying high risks, because I'm not terrribly interested in the futures, where I don't win all the things]\\
Does it have a name?\\
Seems somewhat related to convex vs concave dispositions, except it's something different:\\
