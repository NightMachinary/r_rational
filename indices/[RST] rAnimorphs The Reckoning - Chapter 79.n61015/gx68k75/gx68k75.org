So I'm commenting on this blindly without having read the chapter or other comments:

I haven't left feedback on the last few chapters because recent events in my personal life have made the r!Animorphs subject matter unusually triggering to me, and I just had to put it down for a while. I'm nearly at a place where I can start reading it again, and I'm really excited to finish it, but I just wanted you, TK17, to know that I'm still a big fan of this work.

Best,
