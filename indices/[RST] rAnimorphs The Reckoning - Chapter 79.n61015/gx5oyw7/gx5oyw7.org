Yeah, you know what, Cassie? You can freak out now. If there's any time to freak out, it's right after you watch a god die, and then a bigger god tells you to kill an even BIGGER god with nothing on your side but his turn at a game you don't know the rules of and a vague hope that you're being underestimated. This is without a doubt the appropriate time to have a freak out.
