I need to reread Livingston's section. What I tookaway is that morphing will draw Crayak's attention, because he's assuming that the Animorphs were poofed away, and also that Eddris is up to something but being secretive because Marco knowing the details means that Crayak know's the details.

I feel kinda dumb for underestimating Eddris as a resource. She's apparently gotten to play with the still-enigmatic Time +Matrix+ Lattus, and her story contains plot holes and contradictions which are being played off as the doing of C/E/T. I don't think this is the key to solving the problem, for meta reasons, but ugh Ellimist put in effort to bring Eddris into things, here; why /didn't/ I pay more attention to Eddris?
