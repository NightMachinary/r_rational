Wait isn't Livingstone /already/ in z space?

  I was caught like a fly in honey in the middle of the Z-space rift---had been traveling across it at a snail's pace for days

  in exactly---well, now it's four minutes and fifty-two seconds---your ship will launch into Z-space on autopilot, along the course I'm setting now.

If Livingstone is already in z space, new coordinates should just change his direction but he'll still be stuck in the rift, right?

Maybe just have him already across the rift at this point in the story? But then again my impression is that the rift takes months to traverse (or does it? Someone look up the reference), so there's no way he'd be able to have crossed it already...
