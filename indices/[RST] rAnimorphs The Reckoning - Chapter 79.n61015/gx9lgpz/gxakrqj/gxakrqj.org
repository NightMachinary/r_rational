Oh, yeah, I should tweak this a bit, thanks.

Basically, he's either going left in Z-space and should change course midstream to right, or if we want to pretend like there's no problem with what I wrote, he dropped out of Z-space to calculate a new jump.

(You can drop out of Z-space into normal space even in the middle of the rift.)

But yes, he would still just be not-even-in-the-middle-of-it, still subject to its effect. Wonder what's up with THAT, hmmmm?
