My read: Previously, her decision not to xenocide was directly influenced by Toomin, or rather assumed by Toomin and used to effectuate Toomin's final gambit to ascend the Chee. Now, having passed that phase of the plan and having used it to accrue brownie points for Rachel, there is less benefit to be had from keeping the Chee alive. Like, Cassie has just been told, "Your decision was explicitly suboptimal, and I just used your suboptimal decision-making to fool a God-being." If you've been told that your thought processes are so idiotic that God himself can't account for them, you're apt to reevaluate your life.
