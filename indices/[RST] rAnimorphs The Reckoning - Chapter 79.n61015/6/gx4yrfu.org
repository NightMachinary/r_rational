Oh my, what a chapter! Thank you so much TK17Studios.

Is Cassie's plan to aggro Crayak and die, or does she really want to xenocide 2*10^{9} hyperviolent babies?

(I'm guessing the answer is 'yes')

It feels like it kinda makes sense in a weird way, but also what? Could someone please put into words why the previous desperation-fueled xenocide looked like a bad idea to her, and this one does not?

Obviously a lot of things changed between the two answers, but I fail to model her thought process and locate the tipping point.
