The Howlers are Crayak's personal army, more or less. When the conflict was Howlers Vs Humanity, Xenocide was suboptimal. Now that it's Crayak Vs the Universe, the threshold for acceptable cost has skyrocketed.

Which makes me wonder ... when you're put in a situation like this, is Pascal's Mugging a remotely applicable concept? It's like a trolly problem whose stakes have gotten so enormous that normal huristics fall apart.
