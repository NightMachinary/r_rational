Well you can be really paranoid about it , send the information from multiple Internet connections and trying to do everything possible to avoid the cia getting to you.( I don't know exactly what things you can do to avoid intelligence agencies but I'm sure someone else here knows more about how to be paranoid on the internet and things you can do to avoid people finding you). Also you can use the launch codes to bluff so they won't want to touch you because one of your ( nonexistent)colleagues whith the same machine (this is a crazy idea and will probably cause a lot of chaos , so it's better to only use it is really necessary , or maybe just don't use it). Another less crazy way to protect yourself is becoming an public figure trough a pseudonym , making cia seem evil if they try to take your machine , and ensuring a public uproar if it happens.
