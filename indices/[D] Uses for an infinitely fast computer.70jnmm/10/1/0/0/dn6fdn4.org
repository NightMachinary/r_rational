No, stop this.

Any program equivalent to ourselves (that is, simulating the entire real-life generative process and generating equivalent outputs to everything we can measure) /can't/ be changed to be equivalent to ourselves in some neat counterfactual situation, /unless/ we know /every change to a base-level physical parameter/ necessary to bring that counterfactual into being. Otherwise, we're just conditionally simulating ourselves given the random noise of our conceptual uncertainty. That is, we're rejection-sampling possible universes, where the rejection criteria are sampled from our intuitive conceptual models of things we don't actually understand, ie: they're map-noise.

DO NOT CONDITION ON RANDOM NOISE AND CALL IT INFERENCE. In fact, remember, probabilistic inference follows a conservation of information law: you /cannot/ get information out from inference that did not go in via the generative model or the conditioned evidence.
