How large is infinitely large? For example, we can try to solve large [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver][Busy Beavers]] to figure out limits, Σ(12) alone has a lower bound of g1.

Assuming we can solve any large problem we have a trivial solution to P = NP: both are O(1). Almost any graph problem that can't be brute-forced today can be solved instantly. This alone is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars in optimization problems.

We can encode AIXI or a reasonable approximation (it's not clear to me how uncomputable AIXI would be in such infinite computer, probably it would still be uncomputable but we could use the Monte Carlo AIXI or something, maybe a Gödel machine) and run it for arbitrary problems. One fun thing to do is ask it to find arbitrary turing machines that solve physics problems for us, eventually it'll find the "true laws of physics" and we can simulate from then on.

We can probably get free energy (or destroy the universe maybe, this is way outside my knowledge), by just using it to compute huge proofs that contains arbitrarily large amounts of information and throw it in black holes, I have no idea how the information erasure models would deal with this.
