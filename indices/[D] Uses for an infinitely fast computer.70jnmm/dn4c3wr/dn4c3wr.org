My plan would be get money by mining bitcoin and other criptocurrecy , and whatever other ways I can find of more or less anonymously get money for computing things without people noticing I have absurd amounts of computing power(maybe I can find some way of predicting the stock market or anything like that that doesn't destroy the world or creates sentient beings? if so I can just do it in a way that seems that I just got really lucky).

Create an identity as a group of people or maybe a millionaire who prefers to remain anonimous. Maybe once I have enough money buy a supercomputer so if people traces all back to me it won't be suspicious , It would seem that Im just an eccentric internet entrepreneur that got rich and invested in a lot of computers to mine criptocurrency and whaterver other things I can find to get money on the net. I should get a really good internet connection.

Also I should spend a lot of electricity so people wont notice I'm not using my supercomputer at all , maybe even use the supercomputer an send everithing to the internet trought it. Then I can start anonymously donating my computing power to different distributed computer projets to benefit science and medicine , but avoiding making people suspicious by using too munch on any particular thing (If i can do that anonymously better , i don't want people realising my total computing power is unreasonably big if they start adding all the things I'm doing at the same time).

I would ask questions like this post on the internet to find out other things that I can do with the computer , but treat it whit the care that a device that can easily destroy the world deserves(If I manage to not give in to the panic I would be feeling because of that) so most things would have to be discarded , and i certaily wouldnt try to run a genetic algorithm(or any kind of optimisation process) with unlimited computing power even if it seems that it cant do anything harmful with the possible options , there are a lot of fun things that I could do whit it if this wasn't a problem but I wont risk destroying the world even if I'm really sure that specific search space doesn't contain anything dangerous .

Or maybe I could just destroy it before accidentally ending the world , that seems better unless I have a clear world optimisation strategy that is worth risking that or if the method to make the computer is goin to be discovered soon.
