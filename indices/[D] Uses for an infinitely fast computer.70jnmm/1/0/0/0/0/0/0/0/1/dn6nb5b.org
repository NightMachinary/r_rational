Note that if you can bootstrap from efficiently checkable proofs for the correctness of algorithms that run in super-polynomial time, to using those algorithms to generate and verify further proofs of correctness, your character may /eventually/ be able to build up large bodies of proofs and tests suitable for ensuring that brute-force searches found the right answers without bugs.

But ultimately, a Turing machine with limited output tape /may/ actually be equivalent to a linear bounded automaton, which actually nerfs the Infiniputer.
