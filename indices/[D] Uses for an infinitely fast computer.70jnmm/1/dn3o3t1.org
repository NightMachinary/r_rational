  All code is specified in a minimal combinator calculus, because it's the only thing you could embed into the exotic quantum state that is the computation medium.

Since it's possible to write a generator backend for the compiler of your favorite conventional programming language, this point is irrelevant.

Otherwise, any problem that can theoretically be solved via brute force can be parctically solved via brute force.

When an expression does not have a normal form? Is it when the computation it encodes doesn't ever terminate?

Is this brainstorming for /Si Vis Pacem/? :P
