Look into the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox][Black hole information paradox]].

As I said, this is way above my understanding, but this infinity computer is made of physics, therefore it must have a physical encoding of the information being computed. The physical encoding of the information is weirded out by what we think black holes do, so depending on what actually happens we could create a huge computation with large amounts of information, throw it in a black hole and get an equivalent amount of free energy (or total destruction of the observable universe) at some point (maybe the black hole evaporates continuously, maybe it explodes, nobody knows for sure).
