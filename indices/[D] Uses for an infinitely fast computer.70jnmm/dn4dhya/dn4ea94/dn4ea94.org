I would mine more bitcoins instead of stealing them, otherwise people would notice and suspect bitcoin are no longer secure.

Also I would give money to fhi , Im not sure if miri would know what to do which that amount of money, while the fHI can distribute the money better between multiple Ai safety organizations ,create prices and things like that . And some fraction of the money would go to givewell.
