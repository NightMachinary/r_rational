A problem that has truly infinite runtime cannot resolve, no matter the speed of the computer, so we are being handed programs that run in some finite length of time. The computer running the simulation can pause it for however long it needs to run the program it has been handed, resuming once the output is produced. In the "outer" universe, the simulator computer need not be infinitely fast, it just needs to be left alone to figure it out.

As an infinitely fast computer cannot exist (as far as we know) , the discovery of such a thing would in my mind decent evidence of the universe being a simulation.

Correct me if I am wrong.
