Wouldn't that simulation create a lot of people briefly existing ?

Also I would be careful about simulating random things, you have to specify exactly what you want .The most fuel efficient vehicle might not do all the things you want a vehicle to do and it could be even harmfull in some way or another,did you remember to specify that it can't produce waste products that are harmfull to humans or the environment? , did you remember to make it comfortable and safe for humans , did you remember to make it possible to make whith current technology?. If you brute force it you have to code in all the things you want the vehicle be , in precise mathematical terms , and it becomes a AI safety problem, or at least you will have to spend a lot of time ensuring the vehicle/engine / tool is what you want and is not going to fail in some aspect of it you didn't even realise was important .
