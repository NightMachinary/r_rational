Honestly, all of these rational folk are coming up with complicated solutions, and I just want to know who the Fourteenth Doctor will be for Doctor Who.

(Also, a good test for the machine is--who is the actor who played the 13th Doctor? The answer's already been revealed, but feed the machine information on Doctor Who, all from the time 2 years before the casting was revealed. See how long it takes to get the correct answer, which is not that difficult compared to building whole worlds, but not immediately obvious. Check the result. Fine-tune from there.

Then do it to predict all the future castings of roles. Depending on your scruples, get rich based on bets)
