Well obviously you'd have to constrain it. Available fuels, building materials, acceptable exhaust, the output you want (rotary motion?), the definition of "efficient".

The nice thing is that you wouldn't have to do any approximation tricks, or work by iteration, just generate all possible engines and pick what you want.
