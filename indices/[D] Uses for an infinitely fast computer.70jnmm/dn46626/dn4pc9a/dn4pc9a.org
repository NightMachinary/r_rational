  For example, you could ask your computer to design an extremely fuel-efficient or inexpensive rocket, brute-forcing all possible construction materials/methods/designs, with limitations on maximum size and construction time to make it practical to build.

Sounds dangerous, since you could brute-force an unfriendly AGI into simulated existence, that promptly figures a way out into the real world and paperclips you. All it needs is to find some exploit in your code, which can't easily be solved with performance AFAICT.
