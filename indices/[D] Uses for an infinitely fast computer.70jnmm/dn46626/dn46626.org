It seems like this would be an engineer's wish granting device.

You don't know the true laws of physics, sure, but the laws of physics we know certainly seem to approximate reality well enough. Plug in those laws of physics into your infinitely fast computer, and then ask it to design whatever items you need.

For example, you could ask your computer to design an extremely fuel-efficient or inexpensive rocket, brute-forcing all possible construction materials/methods/designs, with limitations on maximum size and construction time to make it practical to build.

Repeat for every possible tool and every possible optimization. The most effective washing-machine. The most durable building. The most fuel-efficient vehicle. Etc. etc.
