We already know entanglement is a thing. The fact that we have quantum computers (albeit small ones) makes the physics for that pretty clear. I don't see any reason to think anything isn't entangled. The rules for systems becoming entangled and ceasing to be entangled are complicated, arbitrary, and suspiciously similar to what you'd expect if it were just decoherence. By Occam's razor, I think we can safely say MWI is correct. Quantum physics is deterministic, but not in a useful way.
