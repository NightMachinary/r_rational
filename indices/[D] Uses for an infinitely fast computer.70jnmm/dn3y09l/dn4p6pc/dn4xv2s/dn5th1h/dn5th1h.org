QM is turing computable; you can simulate it to arbitrary precision. The 'indeterministic' nature of QM lies in the fact that measuring a QM system is paramount to making it interact with the much larger outside word in a non-trivial manner.

In other words, the 'indeterminism' arises when /you/ become part of the otherwise isolated QM system you call an experimental setup, by virtue of some electron and photon interactions or some such, if I were to guess. Modeling several septillions of hadrons and associated force carriers is understandably a bit more difficult than a few photons.

The apparent random nature of Born's rule is probably down to the fact that we have not yet discovered a fulfilling model of anthopic 'measure' to mesh with the generalization of probability that is QM.
