It will work, but figuring out which part of the program is the laws of physics and which part is just specifying where to look is difficult enough in a classical universe. Having it also have to specify which Everett branch you're in will make it much harder. If you don't give it enough information it could just give a universe that's close enough that it could have that result, but the more information you give it the more will be specifying which Everett branch you're in and the harder it will be to find the actual laws of physics in the code.
