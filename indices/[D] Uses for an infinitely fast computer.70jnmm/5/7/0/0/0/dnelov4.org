I was going for something along these lines further up the thread... apparently a lot of other commenters think simulating an entire universe and extracting Wikipedia is supposed to be simpler than a compressed representation of Wikipedia itself? Or else they don't understand Solomonoff induction, or they halo effect trust EY, or EY thinks Solomonoff Induction and uFAI are magic.
