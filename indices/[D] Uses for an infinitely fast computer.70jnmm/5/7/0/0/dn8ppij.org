So... just not computable within the confines of this universe. And even then the assumptions are pretty sketchy.

Let me try again:

You think that the simplest algorithm that can generate Wikipedia to date is a superintelligent unfriendly AI? In the whole realm of possibilities, that's it? Not some decompression algorithm based on the Kolmogorov complexity of wikipedia, but a superintelligence?

Even if this were the case, how would the algorithm account for the fact that wikipedia is not, in fact, riddled with actionable information about how to develop AI?
