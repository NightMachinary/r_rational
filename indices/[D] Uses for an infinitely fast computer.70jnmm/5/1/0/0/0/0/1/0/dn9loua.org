Why not? You're missing the "near-infinite amount of time" part of the question.

Imagine that there was a software defect in your own mind, where every time you thought about a butterfly with more than two wings, the image in your head was not a butterfly with that many wings but instead some other piece of information. Now, imagine that that other piece of information was not random, but deterministic based on the previous four thoughts you had had, and that there was some specific sequence of four thoughts that would [the analogy breaks down here because I can't think of a good way to describe access to privileged system calls or network access].

How many years, decades, centuries, millenia would it take you having random thoughts about random things before you thought about a butterfly with four wings? How many more until you noticed the pattern? And then how long for you to methodically enumerate every possible preceding sequence of four thoughts you could come up with? Billions of years? The AI in question here /has that long/, in subjective time.
