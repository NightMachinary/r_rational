  The UFAI located by Solomonoff induction has enough computing power to simulate all possible universes under our physics
#+end_quote

Well no, it doesn't. It has a finite amount of mass-energy within the simulated universe, by virtue of being in a simulation of a physical universe by hypothesis.

If we claim that a UFAI is always shorter than a program for /just/ simulating the universe and getting the page, there's something wrong. Thing + UFAI needs to have more bits than just Thing. Unless the claim here is that the simplest program for doing Thing is always "run all possible programs and pick out one matching Thing, plus possibly according to some other criteria." That sounds like an infinite regress, though.
