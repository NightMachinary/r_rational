  Another Solomonoff hypothesis class is AGIs with utility functions over the mathematical multiverse. They might simulate many universes, filter for those that contain minds that might attempt Solomonoff induction in this manner, and overlap the Wikipedias of the pasts of those minds in a Tetris-like manner in order to elevate their Solomonoff probability above the first hypothesis.

Wouldn't such hypotheses be significantly more complex than the universe hypothesis?
