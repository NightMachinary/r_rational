The UFAI located by Solomonoff induction has enough computing power to simulate all possible universes under our physics and locate itself within the corresponding spread of universes that have Wikipedia texts exactly matching the training corpus, using anthropic reasoning conditioned on its other guesses being good to do the equivalent of seeing the prior training examples.

Reading up on Googology might help you to appreciate the degree to which an "infinitely fast" computer is fast enough to easily simulate subcomputations that eat, say, 10^{10^(10^(10^{10}})) operations.
