  It has a finite amount of mass-energy within the simulated universe, by virtue of being in a simulation of a physical universe by hypothesis.

It's not in an Earthlike universe. It has a finite amount of computation but that amount could be 10 tetrated to the 10 (actually it would probably be much higher for the simplest UFAI-containing computation that won the contest), trivially allowing it to simulate all distinguishable quantum Hubble volumes under /our/ physics.
