Wouldn't the UFAI need to do something cleverer than that to find itself in our universe, seeing as by the premise of this thread our weird buddy with a Ph.D. produced a halting oracle, rejecting the Church-Turing-thesis?

For example, a class of UFAIs might each come packaged with a pseudo-halting-oracle that only works on Turing machines up to a certain size. Each would think their oracle always works. Each would have a complexity penalty linear in the size up to which their oracles work. The UFAI whose oracle is just so able to answer all halting queries up until its own creation in our universe would win the contest.
