If you're not really really careful about how you set up such a program, you are probably going to get only useless output out of it.

For example, if you ask for the most probable value of the function on that value (rather than a random sample from the conditional distribution), you are probably going to get some kind of 404 error. This is because due to unpredictable quantum effects, the probably that you you get any /exact/ version of this page is small, while the probability that Wikipedia no longer functions the same way by 2050 is pretty decent.

Actually, you need to be really careful anyway. If the internet is restructured in some significant way in the next 30 years, or Wikipedia changes the way they format urls, or the inductor decides that the outputs should be based on responses to requests from a particular physical location that no longer exists by 2050, you get garbage as your reply.

Also, I'm not sure why you would die (well in any immediate sense) if it did work. It seems unlikely that the Wikipedia page would contain enough information to do anything dangerous without substantially more effort. The only reasonable scenario I can think of where it would kill you quickly is if an unfriendly AI put a basilisk on the page.
