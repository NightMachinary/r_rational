If I had to posit a hypothesis, I would say that Solomonoff is designed around favoring elegance in models, and overfitting decreases elegance. Specifically, Solomonoff contains Occam's Razor, and overfitting violates Occam's Razor by accruing complexity from noise and not favoring simplicity to a sufficient degree. (I lack any relevant expertise in mathematical fields, however I believe this to be accurate.)
