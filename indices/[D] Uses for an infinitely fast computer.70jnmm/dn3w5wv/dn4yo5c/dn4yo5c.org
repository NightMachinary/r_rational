This won't necessarily home in on whatever AGI was already going to govern our future. There is the Solomonoff hypothesis that simulates our universe and extracts Wikipedia, but you are only testing a small set of data. Another Solomonoff hypothesis class is AGIs with utility functions over the mathematical multiverse. They might simulate many universes, filter for those that contain minds that might attempt Solomonoff induction in this manner, and overlap the Wikipedias of the pasts of those minds in a Tetris-like manner in order to elevate their Solomonoff probability above the first hypothesis.

This /might/ be fixed by also requiring all other past (title, date) pairs to map to null.
