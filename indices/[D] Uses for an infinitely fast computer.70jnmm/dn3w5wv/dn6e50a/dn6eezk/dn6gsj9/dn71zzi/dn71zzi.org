AIXI is not supposed to be a model of efficient intelligence, dear. And all the computations that actually return an answer are finite, just not small. And if you object to infinities in the outer system there's always AIXI-tl. And if you don't understand what this respectable academic theory is used for, read the manual instead of yelling at it.
