Come again? You're just repeating the same thing said above, but now it makes even less sense.

#+begin_quote
  function
#+end_quote

Formula. This distinction is important, and may lie at the root of your misunderstanding.

#+begin_quote
  unexpected input
#+end_quote

Input is always well defined by previous cells. Well, mostly. You can always create degenerate spreadsheets, but that's not what we're discussing. Or maybe you were considering a divide by zero error?

#+begin_quote
  buffer overflow
#+end_quote

In Excel? There is no dynamic memory allocation. (I'm not discussing VBA.)
