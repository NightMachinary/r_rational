If you don't want to debate honestly, just say so. I said formulas, not functions. And I explicitly said we're not using degenerate spreadsheets.

We don't have to be stupid. We can run simulations in Excel using only simple formulas. No matrix manipulations, no circular equation solvers, no string functions. Just numbers. In packed arrays, with well-defined dependencies.

Is there necessarily a security flaw? (And hold off for the moment, would you, on the absurdity of using a very large spreadsheet to simulate a superintelligence.)
