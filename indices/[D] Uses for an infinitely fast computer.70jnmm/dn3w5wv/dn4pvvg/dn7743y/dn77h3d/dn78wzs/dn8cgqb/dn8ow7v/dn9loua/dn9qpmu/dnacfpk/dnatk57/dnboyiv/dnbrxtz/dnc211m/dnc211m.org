  In Excel? There is no dynamic memory allocation.

Say what?

First, an absolutely trivial example. Simply putting any value in any cell can and often will result in some dynamic memory allocation.

Second, a more obvious trivial example. A1 contains ==REPT("foo",B1)=. Put a big number in B1. See that long string of "foofoofoo" in A1? Where do you think that's being stored in memory, if not in a dynamically allocated buffer?

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Consider a TRANSPOSE that uses other cells to define its extents. That would allow moving arbitrarily large amounts of an existing sheet into new maybe-previously-empty space. And Excel is, of course, optimized; it doesn't waste memory to represent large sections of empty space. All those cells you just produced data in have to be stored somewhere, and that somewhere is dynamically allocated.
