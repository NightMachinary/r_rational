Well, a world in which unlimited computation has been executed is different from one in which unlimited computation is possible but a limited amount of computation has taken place. The latter can be (somewhat) predicted by a physical theory that merely presumes a limited but very large amount of computation. Any such theory can be disproved by just running a longer computation, but any actual universe can only have performed a finite amount of computation at any time, because the computer errors when you feed it an infinite loop. (This is indistinguishable, below the limit, from a computer that simply errors when the limit is reached.)

Hence, any universe that permits unlimited computation can be approximated up to time t by a physical theory that merely permits "sum of all computation actually done before t".
