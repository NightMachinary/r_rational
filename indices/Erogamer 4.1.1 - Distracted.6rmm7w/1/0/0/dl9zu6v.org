It indicates that I'm referring to Eliezer as a kind of object or role in the larger world rather than as my agent-that-is-this-agent. In this case, the perhaps-problem is that something that sounds like it was meant for typical wandering readers of [[/r/rational]] is being solved by someone with a special role relative to [[/r/rational]]. Like, okay the founder knows stats and already knows how to interpret a logistic function, but perhaps that is not what was to be tested.
