I always appreciate the criticism - and that specifically was something I was thinking about while writing. Some of it will be addressed in future chapters, but if it's currently seems implausible/idiotic then it's something that I can work on fixing. So here are some ideas - I'd appreciate you letting me know what you think would work best.

- Floyd was given explicit orders to keep Martha safe, but simply failed in some way - either by miscalculating how hard to hit her to knock her out, choking her on accident with the gag, or getting into an actual altercation with her in the course of trying to get her away from the farm wherein he uses too much force.
- While Lex Luthor wants to keep Superman anchored, making the trade of Martha Kent for the spaceship is one that he'd make with eyes wide open if he had to do it again - since Martha Kent is going to die at some point anyway, and the spaceship might offer some permanent solution to the Superman Problem
- Include more dialogue with Martha and Floyd as he makes more of an attempt to keep her away from the farm, or retrospective internal dialog where he realizes that he's made a mistake.
- Include more of an introduction to Floyd that justifies his employment - his skills that extend beyond murder, his (seeming) consummate professionalism, etc.

Of course, Floyd was never meant to be there in the first place, and he didn't actually intend to kill Martha Kent, just knock her out. It's a fuck up to be sure, but mostly what I'm worried about it making it a fuck up that's consistent with current characterization/motivations.
