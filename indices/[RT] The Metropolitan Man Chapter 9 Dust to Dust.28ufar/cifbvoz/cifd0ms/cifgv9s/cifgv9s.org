It's clear that one of the focuses (the focus?) of the story is the justified paranoia of what an unleashed Superman could do. So especially given that Lex doesn't know what's in the storm cellar, he couldn't know whether what's inside is worth the trade of killing Martha (when dealing with Superman, it better be a guaranteed "I win button" in there to even risk /his mother's life/ just a little bit).

I think the most straightforward fix is to use your existing characterization of Floyd as an exasperated loose cannon, and have him betray Lex's explicit command in a way that Lex should not have thought possible. Deathstroke was a cool choice, but his expertise is the reason Lex would pick him, so the accident is a little jarring. I thought that it might be a deliberate lamp shading on the knockout trope (it is actually very easy to accidentally kill someone by striking them in the head). If it wasn't intended to be a poke at the trope, than someone like Deathstroke would know to subdue her more safely (old lady=asleep within 3 seconds of a sleeper hold, with drastically less risk).

The more mundane fix would have Floyd explicitly choose the sleeper hold over a blow to the head for safety, and have Martha suffer a stress induced heart attack or somesuch. That still acknowledges his expertise, but does diminish it slightly (even if it's out of his control).
