I love all of your stuff, so I feel bad that the first time I comment on it is criticism, so apologies. That said, I think this is a pretty serious case of Lex holding the Idiot Ball. Given what he knows, and his deliberate attempt to increase the strength of Superman's anchors, your Lex would probably have immediately seen to the active protection of Martha. Instead, he sent in a ruthless killer with such vague instructions as to leave him confused about how important it was to keep her alive?

I get that this was/will be a crucial turning point, but avoiding moments like these is pretty central to rationalist writing. I'm trying to come up with an alternative that's more in keeping with the setting/characterization (as all of us rationalist fanficcers are wont to do) and it seems like this could have been written to put Floyd more at fault. Even though we need Superman to blame Lex, you already have indications that Floyd was being affected by the job. Lex could reasonably expect Floyd to do the job while keeping Martha safe (given his perfect record), but Floyd being fed up with idealistic/boring Martha leads disregarding the order to keep her alive. He then simply lies about his orders to Superman which adds some nuance to the later confrontation.

I'm still really enjoying your take, and am excited to see the real underlying psychology of your Clark. Superman is my one true fandom because I love what he stands for, but it still takes a lot of effort to create a head canon that maintains enough realism to keep him inspirational. My gratitude goes out to anything clever rationalists can add to that.
