I didn't have a problem with it. As you sensibly established, Luthor's options are limited and Deadshot is a professional. All considered, 9 times out of 10 what he did probably would've worked.

As for your bullet points, I had already assumed 1, and 2 makes sense. 3 could've happen, but again it didn't because of an understandable mistake. Even if Luthor is supercompetent, he can't guarantee anything more than the regular sort of competence from his underlings. And I already got point 4 as well.
