Are there any similarities between you two? Similar temperament, pace of life, habits? Maybe equivalent life philosophies?

Even if your upbringing and cultural backgrounds are different, similar enough personalities could compensate for all of this.

On the other hand- do you remember someone from a very familiar circle (think a fellow club member, a classmate you share interest with, etc.), that you didn't find a connection with?
