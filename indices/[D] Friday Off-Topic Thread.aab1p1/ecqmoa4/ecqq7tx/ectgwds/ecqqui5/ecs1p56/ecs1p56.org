yeah, social interraction on the whole makes very little sense.

the fact that society is schizo in telling people to do things/not do things with so many contraditictions and so littel basis in actual reality makes something of a mess of it. hollywood (most media these days) presents a couple basic types of romance, usually dysfunctional at best, abusive at worst, usually played for laughs.
