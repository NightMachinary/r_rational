Hunting for specific sci-fi or fantasy short stories is best done with the aid of ISFDB. [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1687565][For example]], we can find that this story got included in "The Best Science Fiction & Fantasy of the Year: Volume Eight" edited by Strahan, and then hunt down a copy of this by your preferred means (such as local library, Amazon, or ... alternative methods).
