I've thought of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_game][hand game]], and I want [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s take on it. Also, suggestions on names.

My intention is to make a game for 3 or more people, is simple to understand, and can both accommodate straightforward play and high level strategy. Let me know what you think.

--------------

Rules

- Three or more people.
- The objective is to be the only person to place the highest number with one hand.
- If multiple people tied for the highest number, the next highest untied number wins.
- If there are only ties, the people who played the highest tied number are eliminated, and the game is repeated.

--------------

Strategy

Playing 5 is a high risk play, as someone else is likely to do so as well, and that will get you both out. On the other hand, people will know that, so no one might play it, which makes it viable. But people know that, as well. Hmm . . .

So your strategy is to predict your opponents' thoughts. Is she the kind of person to go for broke and play a high number, or to try to slip in unnoticed, play a low number and count on people fouling each other up? Also, what is she thinking i'm thinking she's thinking? What did he do last game, and will he repeat?

And so on.
