They played a similar game with donuts on Taskmaster (a UK 'panel' show I highly recommend). Contestants have five donuts, and put some number of them on the peg, with ties canceling each other out. Of course, given that it's a game played by comedians, there are some more or less clever tactics, like eating a donut in full view of everyone else as a form of pre-commitment.
