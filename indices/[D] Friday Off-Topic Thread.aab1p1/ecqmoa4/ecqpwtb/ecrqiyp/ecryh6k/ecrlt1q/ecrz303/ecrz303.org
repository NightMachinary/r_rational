Why does uniqueness follow? As far as I can tell there are several weak mixed Nash equilibria, e.g. for three players A-C: A plays 5, B plays 4, C plays 50% 5 and 50% 4.

There also is the symmetric solution you described, for three players it should be according to the ratio 1:1:2:4:8 from number 1 to 5.

I don't think there is something stable under cooperation and threats by groups of players, but not sure. Perhaps I'm not well-versed enough in game theory for that.
