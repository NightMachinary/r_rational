People are a lot alike under the shell, but they rarely expose their soft underbellies to each other. Have you been talking about things that are parts of fundamental human experience, feelings, longings, formative family/friend experiences, what makes you really feel alive, et cetera? The lesson I've learned is that this is what makes up a lot of "connection," but that when people will share it with each other really is unpredictable.
