What really brings people together is basically if they have the same problems - if they are in the same stage of life. Like what they ultimately want from the relationship. People tend to relate to mutual life problems and form a connection. Everything else tend to be superficial, just more various different quirks and qualities about that person that you just roll with. Sounds like you guys have great chemistry.
