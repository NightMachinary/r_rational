Are they attractive? That helps.

But seriously, getting along with people is weird. So long as you don't actively disagree with each other, humans tend to form pretty strong empathetic bonds. This is more noticeable with platonic same-sex relationships - I distinctly remember my college orientation, where two girls in the orientation group were thicker than thieves after maybe five minutes of conversation. All it takes is actually talking and engaging with the other person. The exoticism may make them /different/, but notably, it does not make them an enemy. In that sense, you have a shared lack of understanding, rather than shared antipathy, so you can both commiserate about how strange it is that you get along without even liking the same things.

A more pessimistic person would call this an illusion, or a shallow friendship. That's dumb. Any friendship is going to be pressure sensitive, the only thing that makes an "instant friendship" more unstable than one made through common interests is that there's more unknown personality-space in each person that could potentially offend. You address that failure state the same way you would any other, with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem][pre-mortem]]:

The relationship has ended? What led to this?

1. (I/They) said something that (I/they) disagreed with, and was aggressive about it in a way that didn't suggest future peace.
2. (I/They) revealed a facet of personality through physical actions that (I/they) didn't initially model, which upset (me/them).
3. (I/They) took advantage of the trust that is implicit in most friendships.
4. Et cetera. If you want a good picture of what "ruining an implicit relationship" looks like, watch children's television. Most of the characters on, say, My Little Pony, are very diverse, and only really friends because of authorial intervention. This makes them structurally very similar to your situation - people with different backgrounds and philosophies being fast friends for no reason.

The solutions to these issues are simple. For the aggressive perspective, just /don't/ do things that would upset someone - don't abuse their trust, reveal a poorly aligned preference before they really know you, or be an ass about a disagreement. From the defensive perspective, practice conversations in your head. Try and imagine what it would be like if they did something to offend you and then try to go through the mental effort it would take to tolerate and forgive that offense. Once you've done that once, it won't take you nearly as long, or nearly as much effort, to do it again, should the situation arise.

As for building relationships like these: your first priority is to build a common ground for you to stand on. Find a new Youtube series you both like. Go on a date in a new place for both of you. And /aggressively/ try out things that they enjoy until you find one that you enjoy as well.

That's all that I can write that seems obvious to me. I hope it helps, and isn't as obvious to you. (or rather, I hope it is obvious to you and you didn't need the help, but that I largely matched your thoughts anyway)
