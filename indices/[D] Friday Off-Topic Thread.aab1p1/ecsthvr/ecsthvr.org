Last year I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7lhyo4/d_friday_offtopic_thread/drncnnt/?context=3][a list of resolutions]] for 2018. I was in somewhat of a "shoot for the moon" mindset, and so I included way more things than I expected to achieve. Since it's pointless to make these lists if you don't hold yourself to them, I figure I should revisit that list and tally up how many commitments I kept to:

- Learn about system administration and networking: I've got a job that touches on that field, but I have a bunch of subjects I thought I'd look into, and I haven't so far. No.

- Learn about machine learning: Nope, not really.

- Learn about package managers: I learned how to use pacman, which has done wonders do reduce my frustration whenever I need to re-install something or figure out what I've installed. Yes.

- Learn about sandboxing and alternate PM systems: Not really. I have a bunch of open tabs on my laptop about flatpack and other systems that have been taunting me since march. I figure I'll have time to look into them in january-february.

- Learn about computer graphics and modern UI: Ehhh, not really. I have leads, and I've discovered a lot of neat tools, but I haven't had the weeks of free time needed to really learn how to use these things.

- Learn about advanced programming language theory: Same thing, no time so far.

- Get a backup network up and running: In my head, I visualized it as "install a network on a bunch of computers and servers that I own". Only problem, I don't really own a bunch of computers and servers, and don't really want to. Oh well, pre-packaged solution it is.

- Release a playable, sellable version of The Tesseract Engine: Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah no.

- Participate in at least one Open-Source project: Yes! I made a large-ish PR for one of Atom's module that was merged, and featured as the main highlight of one of their releases. I'm ridiculously proud.

- Learn about and learn to use as many useful applications as I can: Eeeeeh, not really. I haven't really found the need, and everything I need is mostly already on my phone/computer.

- Work with a friend on one productive project per month: Ahahah, ahah, ah. :( :( :( Yeah, no. We ended up working on a frustrating three-months-long project that we burned out on. I need to stop starting video game projects with this guy.

- Keep exercising on a regular basis: Check, mostly, with some bumps in the road. I'm going to change my exercise regimen anyway.

- Practice parkour out of a gymnasium on a regular basis: Nope, I've only done it once this year. I'm not really at the level where I'm comfortable practicing outdoors.

My intention was to stick to about half of these commitments. A fairly optimistic tally gives me 5 successes and 8 failures, so I'm closer to a 40% success rate, which is in my dreaded "not bad but you could really do better if you tried" zone.

--------------

So, my new year resolutions for 2019 are:

- Learn about system administration and networking. Ask someone at my job how systemd and DNS servers and all these other names I keep hearing about work.

- Learn more about machine learning. At least set up a few neural networks and min-max systems.

- Learn about containerization and orchestration. That one's a bit of a cheat since I both have a student project and a professional project riding on it, but it'd still be nice to learn.

- Learn about computer graphics, and build at least one tool using glTF and Vulkan.

- Learn about Reactive UIs find a reactive UI framework compatible OpenGL / Vulkan apps.

- Learn about WebAsm and make at least a test program using a WebAsm plugin.

- Learn about advanced programming language theory. Write a new memory model for the D language. For ultimate extra credits, fork the D compiler and implement it.

- Finish and release the turn-based stealth game I'm currently working on.

- Participate in at least one Open-Source project. Candidates include: Atom again, Molecule, Dlang, Battle for Wesnoth,

- Work with a (different) friend on any productive project at all, at least one day per week. To be able to sustain this rythm, better manage my schedule, stick to low-stress jobs with flexible hours, and don't bite off more than I can chew.

- Write an edited version of TDWoD.

- Get politically implicated and either join a political party or a public debate commission. (might be /way/ too time-consuming, though)

- Stick to my new exercise regimen, which is push-ups and sit-ups twice a day every day, plus intense sport sessions twice a week (I already do parkour, I'm thinking 2 hours of climbing on saturdays).

- Stick to a morning diet of bread and jelly, as opposed to mild and industrial cereals.

Again, I'll be happy to stick to half of these commitments. I've stopped trying to get an unbroken streak of projects that would motivate me to keep pushing forward. I think that kind of commitment method doesn't really work for me. Instead I think in terms of getting the most done out of every week, which I thinks works a lot better for me.

I've tried setting myself up with a friend in peer-coding sessions, where I describe to him what I'm doing in real time, at least one day every week. It's really helped me stay motivated and productive, but it's also hard to arrange when outside circumstances make my schedule way too loaded to find time to work with him. I think that, in general, having periods of intense works is just terrible for my productivity, and I need to get into a rythm where I don't let work accumulate to the point where I fall back to bad habits. Having a job that accepts remote work and flexible hours is a big part of that.

Also, most of these things I will either get done during my months of entirely free time, or not at all. It's really hard to get motivated for in-depth research while working at a day job at the same time.
