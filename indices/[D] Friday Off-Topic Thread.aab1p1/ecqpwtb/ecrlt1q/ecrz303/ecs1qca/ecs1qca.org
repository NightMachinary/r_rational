Yeah, I should definitely not have used the word "unique", though in my defense I didn't really consider asymmetric equilibria as being "realistic" I guess, particularly the one you described. Formally in game theory it is an equilibrium, but if you are presented with this game and put against people you don't know there's no reason to expect one to play only 5 and the other to play 50-50, so always playing 4 is probably not the best strategy. In real life, you can't actually expect your opponents to be perfectly rational, but symmetric, stable nash equilibria are still often decent choices regardless.
