Ted Chiang's been posted here a few times and people had done an amazing job of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4tjcld/q_im_trying_to_list_all_of_ted_chiangs_freely_and/][compiling his short stories]] online. Except, it looks like most of these links are now broken and the "Subterranean Press" magazine much of his things were posted in have stopped hosting his works? In particular "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling," as I haven't been able to find that in print. I've done some web searches and checked libgen, etc... Any suggestions on finding his works online?

On the plus side, it looks like next May he's [[https://www.amazon.com/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07GD46PQZ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1546012016&sr=8-3&keywords=ted+chiang][currently scheduled to release]] a collection of some of his works, including a couple new short stories. So that's exciting. I thought the online takedowns might be related to this, but for example "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling" isn't in the new compilation...

Edit: Collection
