I'm working on a rational Bleach fic! I have a full plot and all chapter outlines completed. Chapter 1 is done, and I'm about 60% along with chapter 2, which happens to be longer than usual.

I haven't posted it here yet, mainly because the title isn't finalised. I will most likely be posting chapters 1-5 together, once I get to that stage.

Judging by your username I'm guessing that out of the anime you listed, you're most interested in the Bleach one! You can expect it to be out in a couple weeks to a month. I'm cautiously optimistic that my fic will not disappoint you.
