  Anime

  Harry Potter

I don't think this counts as 'anime', but as always, there's /HPMOR/ and its many, many, many spinoffs. /Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ and /HP & the Natural Twenty/ aren't explicitly rationalist, but fall somewhere within the same sphere.

/HP & the Prince of Slytherin/ and /Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches/ both fall into a /ton/ of bad HP fanfic tropes (Occlumency wank, Slytherin wank, Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived plotlines, etc), but they do a sufficiently good job of rationalizing canon and fanon alike that I'd call them 'rational' or quasi-rational. I'd say roughly the same for /Harry Potter and the Game/, once it hits its stride.

  Bleach

There isn't much. We've had brainstorming on the subreddit before, and someone here is trying to write rat!Bleach, but, well, writing is hard and ideas are easy. Outside of explicitly rationalist fanfic, I suppose there's Rihaku's /Bleach Quest/, which rationalizes Bleach canon (especially Aizen) from Uryuu's point of view.

Just off of the top of my head, we have: /The Waves Arisen/, /Lighting Up The Dark/, /Marked for Death/, /Team Anko/, /Shikamaru vs the Logical Fallacies/, /Chiaroscuro/ (sort of), /In Fire Forged/, /The Need to Become Stronger/, and... probably something that I'm forgetting.
