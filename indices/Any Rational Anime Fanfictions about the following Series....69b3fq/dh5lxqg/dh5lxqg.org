Naruto:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][/Time Braid/]] --- one of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][resetting time travel]] stories I've found so far (inb4: underage sex criticism);
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds][/Black Cloaks, Red Clouds/]] --- well written but in a gritty setting;
- [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][/The Waves Arisen/]] --- a well-written rat. \ munchkining story;
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][/Marked for Death/]] --- I've only read the starting chapters so far but it looked like a promising story back then;
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-naruto-si.380860/][/Shinobi, The RPG/]] --- IIRC, starts good but eventually turns into a crackfic;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro][/Chiaroscuro/]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715/1/In-The-Blood][/In the blood/]] --- these have been positively mentioned here before (haven't read them myself yet).

Harry Potter:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/Natural 20/]] --- well-written HP Ã— D&D, the author has [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork][shown their work]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/Well Groomed Mind/]] --- HP joins VD /without/ the story deteriorating into slashy teenage romance drama;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]] --- interesting and well-written story, even though the protagonist is not perfectly rational (he makes do with what he has, even when it'll be harmful to his long-term mental well-being);
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][/On the Way to Greatness/]] ;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][/Forging the Sword/]];
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][/For Love of Magic/]] --- Harry's into experimentation, research of magic, etc. Has smut and wishful thinking though;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][/Applied Cultural Anthropology/]] --- the first 9 chapters that I've read were good.
