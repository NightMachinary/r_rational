I am [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mortality.36749/][currently working on]] a Worm/Death Note crossover. It's not rationalist, but the characters are largely behaving rationally and in their own self-interest, thinking through things before committing to action.

If you decide to read it, I will warn you that, while the main functionality of the Death Note is the same (write a name of someone whose face you know and a circumstance, they die in that circumstance if plausible and of a heart attack if not), other rules of the note have changed to fit the story I want to write. The Death Note is a great plot device, but it wasn't perfect for what I wanted to do.

I have written down the rules I'm using, I will not show them because trying to figure them out is part of what the exercise is about.
