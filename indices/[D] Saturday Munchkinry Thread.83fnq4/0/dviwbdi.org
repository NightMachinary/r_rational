You realize that somehow you were mindcloned around 11 years ago and the mindclone was placed in a baby, who is now somewhere in your country and 11 years old attending a private school. The child underwent infantile amnesia at the usual age, so he or she doesn't have any of your episodic memory but does have your basic habitual thought habits down and is basically you mentally, if you had been raised by their family. You can detect their emotions and identify the emotions accurately but not read their mind beyond that. What do you do to exploit this?

Idea not original to me...
