  If the character on your sheet isn't trying to do an industrial/electrical/computer revolution, you're not really trying.

First you have to explain to your GM how your character has any idea that an industrial revolution is even possible, let alone knows how to bring it about, given the knowledge and experience they are starting with.

We pretty much stumbled into the Industrial Revolution in our world, and then blindly iterated from there. Unless your player-character is a time traveller or a clairvoyant, there is no reason for them to start with a clear concept of "modern technology" to work towards. That would be so far outside their understanding as to be literally inconcievable.
