One information-efficient use of /sending/ is to arrange a meeting via /clairvoyance/ (also a 3rd-level cleric spell): as long as you can get to within 1 mile of the other party, in a location that's familiar to them (e.g. hired rooms in an inn) then you can use 1 /sending/ on your part and 1 /clairvoyance/ on their part to transfer 10 minute's worth of information.

Otherwise, a simple method of compression would be to assign pre-arranged concepts to different words, picking randomly out of a dictionary - e.g. APPLE might be arranged to mean "Your group is discovered."

Keeping your code-book for translating such signals secret isn't of as paramount importance as it usually would be, since there aren't any (standary) ways to intercept a /sending/; however, the reproduction costs might be prohibitive depending on how expensive your DM thinks books should be.
