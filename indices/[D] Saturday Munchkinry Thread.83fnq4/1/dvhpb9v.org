You can form a standing portal between any two doorframes on Earth that are of roughly equivalent size. Doing so requires you to first mark one, then mark the other, which will connect them after roughly two minutes. Attempting to answer some of the inevitable questions:

- Breaking the doorframes, moving the doors too far relative to the Earth, attempting to drill into the portal from the side of the doorframe, etc. will break the connection, irregularly cutting anything that was between the doors.
- The portal goes both ways, and from both sides of each doorframe, with orientation decided when the second portal is chosen.
- Momentum is conserved, but nothing can travel through the doorframe at speed greater than 100kph. Anything moving faster that attempts the transition will be instantly slowed down (though only at the boundary, meaning that a car moving at 200kph and hitting the portal would essentially crash into itself, I think).
- There is no limit to the number of portals you can create. There is also no limit to the number of marks you can make on doorframes awaiting a link (you can dismiss these marks at will, and cannot link two marked doors without first unmarking one).
- You cannot link the doorframes if something is in the way (e.g. a door).
