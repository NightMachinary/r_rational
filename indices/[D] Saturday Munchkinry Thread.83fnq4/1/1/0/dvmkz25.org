This made me realize - these portals are very, very cold. Room temperature air particles move around at an average of ~1000 mph. Forcing air through a portal should be usable as an extremely effective heatsink.

KE = 1/2 * m * V^{2} = 3/2 * k * T

1/3 * m * V^{2} = k * T

(1/3 * m * V^{2} ) / k = T

so for Nitrogen, 100kph mean particle speed is...

Ok, so these are pretty useless for transporting things that shouldn't be flash frozen.

There should also be some weird pressure things going on, but I don't know enough about fluid dynamics to comment on the specifics.
