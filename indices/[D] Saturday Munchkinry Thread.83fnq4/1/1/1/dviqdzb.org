Eh, it is a portal. We can completely destroy energy even without the 100kph speed restriction: just connect a door on top of the building with a door on the ground floor, and send stuff through it. That stuff loses gravitational potential energy, and we can repeatedly carry it up to the top of the building (investing kinetic energy) and send it through again.
