- Create a fairly small 'door', about the size of my head. Leave one end at home, bring the other end with me, everywhere. Now if I forget my keys (or anything else) I can just get someone to pass it to me.

- In fact, if the 'home' end is close to a plug, I can have my phone in my pocket while it's charging.

- If I am feeling larcenous, I can surreptitiously mark a bangle or a ring (preferably a bangle) at a high-end jewellery shop - picking one that's out of sight of any cameras, of course. I can then, at my leisure, remove a substantial fraction of their inventory.

- Small teleport-doors will also help me take people by surprise with gas-based attacks.

- By making a 'door' in the neck of a small pouch (which connects to a large pouch of similar neck-size) I effectively have a bag of holding.

If I enter a door in America and step out of a door in Australia, how badly does the difference in the speed at which the land is moving make me stumble?

Given the 100kph speed limit, what happens to a laser beam fired through a portal?
