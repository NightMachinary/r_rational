The amount of energy added to the earth by the sun is (by definition) equivalent to the power output of a type I Kardashev civilization. According to wikipedia we are currently five-ish orders of magnitude away from that, so even if we add enough portal power plants to replace our current power plants a hundred times over we'd only increase the amount of energy on the planet by 0.1%.

Once we're at a point where this becomes an issue we can probably just move our power generation off-planet.
