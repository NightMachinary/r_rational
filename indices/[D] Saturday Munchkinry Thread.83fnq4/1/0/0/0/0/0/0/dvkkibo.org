  All power generation eventually turns energy into waste heat; it just delays it a little bit and redistributes the heating. Instead of the wind energy dissipating into heat due to turbulence, it would heat the generator, the power lines, and whatever devices are plugged into the power grid.

True, but when using solar/wind power, you don't convert any /extra/ energy to heat. So in terms of the amount of heat that is added to the planet you either have:

#+begin_example
  energy released by power plants + amount of sunlight hitting the earth
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
  energy released by solar plants + amount of sunlight hitting the earth - energy absorbed by solar plants
