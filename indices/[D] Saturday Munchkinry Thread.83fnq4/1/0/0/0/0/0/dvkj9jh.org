+All power generation eventually turns energy into waste heat; it just delays it a little bit and redistributes the heating. Instead of the wind energy dissipating into heat due to turbulence, it would heat the generator, the power lines, and whatever devices are plugged into the power grid.+ edit: We agree on this, I misunderstood the argument.

You could say that solar actually increases the energy captured by the planet, since otherwise a larger portion of the light would bounce back into space.
