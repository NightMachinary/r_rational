Technically, if you replace tidal/wind/solar power plants with this you would marginally increase the amount of energy added to the planet (because the tidal energy/wind/sunlight that isn't absorbed by your tidal plant/windmills/solar cells is now heating up whatever it is hitting instead).

You're absolute correct for fossil fuel and fission/fusion plants though.
