Does a full vial weigh 100kg?

Can you refill it by, say, dunking it underwater?

How about if you dunk it upside down?

Does it continue pouring out after you prop it upside down and let go?

If the answers are no, yes, yes, and yes in that order, you can get perpetual motion from it in 100kg bursts.

1. drain barrel into upside-down vial (placed intentionally upside down by a person)
2. lift barrel+vial (via counterweight)
3. drain vial into barrel
4. use weight + height of barrel to do work, including lifting the counterweight.

With enough altitude, this can produce significant energy, though yeah it's probably less useful than more conventional generators.

Come to think of it, you could also use a similar mechanism to fill a water tower and "smooth out" the power generation.
