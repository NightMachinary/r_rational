Unfortunately, it's no (weighs ~100g), no (you can put the ~100ml the vial holds into the vial, but it doesn't enter hammerspace, which i guess is a one-way valve), N/A, and no. :(

But I like your style!

I deliberately tried to create three magic items that while clearly magic and cool/interesting aren't "let's stop the plot of this story and exploit these items", so with the vial I was going for the great "create water" spell, but in practise it's not much more useful for power generation than a solar panel.

The emerald apple tree is interesting but ultimately useless except as a source of money (and relatively slowly: it's a small plant), and the magic mirror is just a videophone (... that could also be used as a solar panel, as per another reply, which is pretty neat!)
