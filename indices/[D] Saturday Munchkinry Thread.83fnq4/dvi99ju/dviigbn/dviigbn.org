All of that's pretty useless, except for, marginally the emerald tree. It'll inevitably fall apart at some point, and you'll get to a point where all of the buds are too damaged to make new apples. Try grafting another apple to it? Try fucking with hormones and chemicals to trick leaf and bud nodes to form branches, since those are the only parts of it that can actually be considered really alive. The rest of the tree is basically a wooden statue. After looking for gem prices, assuming that the gems are the best emeralds anyone's ever seen, you can get probably 10-50 thousand for each gem, 10 per Apple, so it's not worth it to sell it. Become a millionaire and then sell the tree to science.
