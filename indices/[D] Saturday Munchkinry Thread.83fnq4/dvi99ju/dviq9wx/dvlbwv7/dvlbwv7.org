  But then, the mirror probably isn't that big, so I doubt you would get much power out of it.

But since sunlight's energy density decreases with the square of distance what with it being proportional to the surface area of a sphere, you rapidly get very huge amounts of energy. Rather than work it out myself it looks like [[http://www.egr.unlv.edu/%7Eeebag/Sunlight%20and%20its%20Properties.pdf][at the surface]] energy density is 5.961E7 W/m^{2} , which for 20cm x 20cm mirror would give 4E6ish W, which apparently is about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(power][mechanical power output of a diesel locomotive]]). So I guess not a huge amount lol but I bet you could still use it to crawl out from under the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation (assuming the magic mirror is unbreakable/unmeltable/has perfect "reflectance").

Of course as you mention the sun's far from the [[https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/1-billion-suns-world-s-brightest-laser-sparks-new-behavior-in-light/][brightest object accessible to us]] and positioning the mirror in some stable orbit would be tricky, so really what you have here is a wireless energy transmitter with far more throughput than a locomotive.

  If it doesn't pour, it isn't a person! This item is awesome! Or it would be, if we lived in a world with shapeshifting hostile non-persons.

You could use it to test nonhuman animals for personhood under a "thresholded" personhood framework, assuming person != human (which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person][often it does not]]).

  This would be somewhat useful for astronauts, since it takes exponentially less fuel to launch a small vial into space than several liters of water.

It could also be used for fusion or as a reaction mass (assuming it's not easier just to scoop of interstellar hydrogen or something).
