  Assuming you somehow protected the vial for the trillions of years it would take before that becomes a relevant problem.

Thank you for including this caveat. People on these threads always bring up avoiding the Heat Death of the Universe as if it were some sort of priority, or even possible, which it's not in the case of a prompt where you as a person have the power to create matter, but are not immortal and so will die in a few decades and make little to no impact on long-term entropy. With the vial it could actually work, but deserves to be last on the list in terms of priorities
