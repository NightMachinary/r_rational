How is that possible, assuming both parties are aware of the properties of the tree? The sell price would then be determined by the expected profit that can be extracted from the tree. If the tree were expected to produce $X worth of income each year, then a reasonable price would be around $X*10, to provide a 10% return on investment each year.

[[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]]'s suggestion was to exploit asymmetric knowledge about the tree. Suppose you know that it can produce X income each year, and that 10/X is a reasonable price. If you can convince somebody that it will produce Y income each year, they would believe that 10/Y is a reasonable price. So long as Y>X, you have effectively scammed them.

The problem with applying this in the real world is that nobody will believe that the emeralds came from the tree. Their expected profit Y is then much lower than your expected profit X, and so you will have a net loss by selling the tree.
