  A mirror that is a video phone: you can communicate with the person who uses the other mirror in the set (not FTL)
#+end_quote

Exactly how you would munchkin an actual video phone?

Well okay, it is different in that it doesn't use power, but video phones don't really use all that much power either. Instead, let's talk video quality. Normal video phones have like, a few million pixels in terms of resolution, and a limited amount of brightness. Magic mirrors in the literature don't, as far as I know. So one possible way to use this magic mirror would be to place one end as near the sun (or some other blindingly bright light source) as possible, and the other directly over a solar panel. It would be a reliable (clean?) power source as long as the mirror isn't destroyed.

But then, the mirror probably isn't that big, so I doubt you would get much power out of it.

  An apple tree that produces apples with emeralds where its seeds should be (the limbs and branches don't grow, it just flowers and produces apples; if you try to graft it, the limb you removed is dead and doesn't grow back)

What [[/u/CreationBlues]] said. Scam someone by selling the tree to them without telling them that it can't be reproduced.

  A small vial (test tube sized) that seems to pour water forever without getting empty: but that's only because nobody has tried, there's about 100L of "invisible/hammerspace" water in that vial that regenerates at a rate of 1L a day. It will only pour water if a person is pouring it out, so it can't "spill" (and you can't hook it up to a robot that's programmed to tip out 1L every day to fill your royal moat or anything).

Personhood detector. Get someone to try pouring the vial. If it doesn't pour, it isn't a person! This item is awesome! Or it would be, if we lived in a world with shapeshifting hostile non-persons.

Motion detector. Define "person is pouring it out". What if the person wears gloves? What if the person is using a tool (like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_extender][reach extender]]) to grab the vial when pouring it? If sufficient amounts of indirection are allowed, you may be able to use the vial as a motion detector.

Bomb. What if you stopper the vial but keep "pouring"? What if you put the vial in an airtight container and poured it? Would it just keep on pouring out water, compressing the air in the container further and further, until the entire set-up explodes?

Bag of Holding. Can you put things back in the vial's hammerspace?

Light-weight water container. I'm assuming it is light, because someone would notice if the vial weighed as much as 100 liters of water (~100kgs). This would be somewhat useful for astronauts, since it takes exponentially less fuel to launch a small vial into space than several liters of water.

Avoiding the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe][Heat Death of the Universe]]. Assuming you somehow protected the vial for the trillions of years it would take before that becomes a relevant problem, it would then become the savior of the world, since it creates mass from nothing.
