How would you munchkin any of the following magic items:

- A mirror that is a video phone: you can communicate with the person who uses the other mirror in the set (not FTL)

- An apple tree that produces apples with emeralds where its seeds should be (the limbs and branches don't grow, it just flowers and produces apples; if you try to graft it, the limb you removed is dead and doesn't grow back)

- A small vial (test tube sized) that seems to pour water forever without getting empty: but that's only because nobody has tried, there's about 100L of "invisible/hammerspace" water in that vial that regenerates at a rate of 1L a day. It will only pour water if a person is pouring it out, so it can't "spill" (and you can't hook it up to a robot that's programmed to tip out 1L every day to fill your royal moat or anything).

The only thing is, you can't use them to prove magic is real and win the randi prize or impress and befriend a world leader or anything like that.

I think the water could give you perpetual motion, but with 1kg/day you are not looking at much energy compared with say, solar panels.
