Aw...

You can electrolyse the 1L of water into 620L of O2 (at STP). That's enough for one person to breathe for a day, with a little left over. I assume that it's easier to filter piss than it is to generate O2 in space, so that might be more useful than using it as a water supply. This will take an average of 150W of DC power generation to keep up. Not /too/ bad, but you still have to scrub CO2. Presumably you would just vent the hydrogen into space.
