Great, I've been reading /The Maretian/ (a The Martian/My Little Pony crossover that is as fun as it sounds) and now all I can think about is how useful that water would have been in /The Martian/ (in The Maretian, one of the few gimmes is they have unlimited water due to a magic supply from the pony world).
