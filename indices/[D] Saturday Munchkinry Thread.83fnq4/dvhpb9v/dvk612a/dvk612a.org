What happens when force is applied to the interior edge of an active portal?

Also, can you have a free-standing, dollhouse-sized door frame and lift it from the other side of the portal by reaching through the portal?

Anyway, I'd fabricate collapsible door frames that fold up into briefcases that I can link back to home base at will. If I need money and the whole free energy thing doesn't pan out, I can sell long distance travel on the cheap, by setting up a hub + spoke network. I can also sell briefcases to rich people, who can use cellphones / sending scrolls / etc. to have me open up a portal to the hub on demand.
