The obvious one is generation of negentropy. Link two doorframes, one of which is above the other like this:

(Portal)

(Air Gap)

(Portal)

Put a water wheel in the middle. Then place a liquid of your choice inside - free power.

One thing I'm curious about - is light slowed down? That probably has a few uses, but I think that means that you'll probably die if you go through (electrical signals in the brain).

You could use the portals as shields, making an armour out of tiny doorframes. Any projectile that goes in a portal just comes out the other side. It scales up as well.

Possibly as a defence against certain natural disasters. Example: One portal above an active volcano, another where you don't mind there being ash and lava. Depends on how liberal doorframes are when it comes to shape. On the side of buildings to defend against debris from high winds, along the shores of high flood risk areas - you just need a spot where you don't mind a hazardous dump.

Disposal of hazardous materials can be done by lowering portals on top of them, and waiting for the centre of gravity to pass through the other side.

That's all I have for now, but I'm sure there are other uses.
