In a 5e campaign I am playing in we are about to hit level 5, we are a group of five which is fighting against a totalitarian dictatorship which holds power thanks to a liberal use of a [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Geas#h-Geas][Geas]]-like spell.

I am about to get access to 3rd level spells as a cleric, most importantly [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sending#content][Sending]].

How would you suggest to exploit it to the fullest capabilities, assume such limitations :

- Unreliable consistency, 3rd level spell slots are a limited resource and may be expended for other purposes.
- RAI interpretation of "words", so no chaining or over-hyphenating or creating a code which has extremely long words to circumnavigate the 25 words limitation.

How would you structure an information network in such a context, with these limitations?
