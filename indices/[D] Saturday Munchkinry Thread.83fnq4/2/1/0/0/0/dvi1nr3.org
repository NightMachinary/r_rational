  Invent the wire draw. With a medieval tech base, fine copper wire is pretty expensive, but it can be made very cheap instead. And, bonus, then you can do all the fun things copper wire implies (motors, generators, distribution networks, telegraphs, etc)

Okay, not only does that not fit the parameters of the question, it's meta-gamey as hell. Neither I nor any other sane GM would ever let you get away with that. I might allow your character to invent the wire draw if they had some knowledge of metalworking, such as from working as a jeweller or such. But to jump from "cheaper copper wire" to ELECTRICAL REVOLUTION without the character having any prior knowledge of electricity, conductivity, magnetism, etc. is ridiculous.

Play the character on your sheet, or don't play at all.
