  How about German?

In a meta way I think that the spell doesn't really care about how many words but how complex of a concept it is, it sends up to a particular complexity.

  Wouldn't the real limitation for making a network be on number of familiars?

That's simply a requirement for being able to use the spell, you must know the person you're sending it too, but even a small interaction is passable.\\
It's not a familiar in the sense of an animal/magical companion.
