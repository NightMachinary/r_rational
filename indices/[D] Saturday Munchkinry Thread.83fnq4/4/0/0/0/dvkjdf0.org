Cool, so I can just turn the entire world into more of me with exponential growth and telefragging all opposition...

Or I can make infinite copies of rare materials by holding some in my mouth.

Or I can end world hunger in spectacularly morbid fashion. Tastes just like pork, just don't eat the nervous system and careful with the liver...

Or I can replace energetic natural disasters with ecological disasters by mass-teleporting into tornados, volcanos, hurricanes (probably a bad idea), or tidal waves (probably a bad idea), replacing the high velocity / high temperature material with static, low temperature flesh.
