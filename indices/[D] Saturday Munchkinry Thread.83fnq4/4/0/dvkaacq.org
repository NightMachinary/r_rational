Define body. Does it teleport small objects hidden in my mouth? How about dental fillings? The contents of my stomach / guts?

Is my mind cloned? Are the copies mentally linked in any way? Do both copies retain the teleportation ability? Is there any obvious effect on the originating body?

What happens to material at the destination site? Is what happens different for air/water/solid stone/other people? Does the originating copy know whether the process completed sucessfully?

Is the process instantaneous? Does it work for "moving" targets? How fast can I end up going? What's the maximum range? Space is only ~60 miles away, can I teleport into orbit? What's the cooldown, if there is one?

There are a great many things which may be exploitable but WAY more detail is required.
