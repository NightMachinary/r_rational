- The teleportation copies anything inside your body, including anything inside your mouth, digestive system and lungs
- The copying done to a quantum level - from your perspective there is a version that teleported and one that didn't. Both have the ability
- You can teleport anywhere in the 10km sphere from sea level. Velocity is conserved relative to the earth's surface. Anything in the target area is destroyed (e.g. if you teleport into a mountain you will be encased in stone)
