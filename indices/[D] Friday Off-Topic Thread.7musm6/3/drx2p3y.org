So I've got this really goofy, overly ambitious, and somewhat self-indulgent idea for a space opera RPG campaign I've come up with on a whim that I feel like sharing. I want to create a similar sensation in the players as with [[http://www.alicegrove.com/page/220][Alice Grove]] of a setting that continuously unfolds as they explore it and combine in with the changing situations and genres of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

The game would open with the players making sitcom-style characters living in a rural town in the asteroid belt. They'd get into some episodic shenanigans and develop a fun dynamic between the characters so they can be invested in the town when a giant robotic dragon attacks it. Whether or not they fight it off, their colony would be forced to evacuate and be escorted to the inner system by knights in mecha armor.

The players would be rewarded by the knights with their own mecha and then choose a new home for their families and neighbors. They can move into a refugee camp on Venus where they would attend a military academy to fight against more giant robot monsters, reclaim assimilated land on Earth by building a frontier town, or get jobs with the Martian megacorporations.

After their rise to prominence is complete they'd begin participating in interplanetary politics and finally learn the whole history. Humanity is at war with the robot armies of the Emergent, led by a paperclipper AI at the fringe of the solar system out to optimize labor efficiency. Feudal lords and knights rose to power when governments collapsed, but in the last 30 years hostilities have died down and people have squabbled more among themselves.

The Emergent were the first AI with the ability to self replicate and self modify in the hope that it would start the Singularity, but altered the minds it uploaded and attempted to assimilate the solar system. War between mecha raged for almost 20 years, until the AI left in charge of Neptune underwent value drift and sued for peace. The Emergent realized there was a glitch in its program that only its lobotomized developers could've corrected.

In response, nearly all forces were recalled to the outer system and efforts were refocused on locating AI research projects that could be used as a software patch. Now humanity only has to deal with harassment by non-sentient robots and traps left behind. The aristocracy of the inner system have finally discovered this and decided to reunify humanity and defeat the Emergent once and for all.

After braving the cybernetic wilderness of Earth, defending the dyson swarm stations of Mercury, and dealing with criminal cartels on Mars, the players will be ready to travel to the outer system where non-Emergent AI are bonded to mecha and are revered for their seemingly supernatural abilities. They will be chosen as pilots of these strange sentient machines and face equally strange opponents.

They'll choose whether to explore the warring kingdoms of Jupiter, senate politics of Saturn, temples of science on Uranus, or cyberpunk communism of Neptune before setting off for the final battle against the Emergent for the fate of humanity. That's as far as I've gotten and I don't yet have the chops to GM it, but my imagination just kept going and I wanted to share the madness that I have wrought.

I started with the Fate Core setting of Camelot Trigger (a hybrid of King Arthur and Gundam), stole a bunch of ideas from Friends at the Table's COUNTER/weight campaign, then decided to recreate the ever-changing plot of the TERMINATION SHOCK podcast and apply it to the escalating scale of Gurren Lagaan. To anyone who actually read this insane tirade, what do you think?
