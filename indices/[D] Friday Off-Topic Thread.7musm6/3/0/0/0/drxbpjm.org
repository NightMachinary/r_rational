Also i dont think the jojo styles crazy encounters and twists fit with the constant escalation of everything. What made jojo what it is today are shifting narratives and settings that are sometimes big but sometimes small. You can see the mangaka especially learning this lesson in part 4 which was only about a serial killer in some town.
