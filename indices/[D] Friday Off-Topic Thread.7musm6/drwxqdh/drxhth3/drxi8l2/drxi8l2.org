  Well yeah, but that's cheating. Anyone can go to large subreddits and shitpost their way to 100k, and that's only easier if you rely on other people's content to do the work for you.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_film][/Preservation/ of content is just as important as /creation/ of content is.]] How many times has a hilarious 4chan comment been forgotten in the dank depths of a third-party archive, never to be seen and enjoyed by more than the few dozen or few hundred people who saw it when it was originally made?

Also, you may have misinterpreted the objective of my comment. I was trying to boost 4chan, not myself. I haven't even bothered to apply to [[/r/centuryclub][r/centuryclub]].
