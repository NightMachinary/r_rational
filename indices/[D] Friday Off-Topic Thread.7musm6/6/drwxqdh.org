Reminder: Browsing 4chan is useful, not only for finding discussion (both [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/77hti4][entertaining]] and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7b8um1][serious]]) and pornography (both text and images), but also for [[https://i.imgur.com/VkTTO9n.png][accumulating karma]]. It can be a hit-or-miss endeavor, but finding a thread that's worth a few hundred karma on [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] [[http://np.reddit.com/user/ToaKraka/submitted][really isn't difficult at all]].
