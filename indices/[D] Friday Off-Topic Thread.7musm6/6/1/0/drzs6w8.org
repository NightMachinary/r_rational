  Does accumulating karma have any practical utility at all?
#+end_quote

No (except in the vanishingly-unlikely circumstance that someone wants to buy your well-endowed Reddit account for [[/r/hailcorporate][r/hailcorporate]] purposes). Still:\\
- If you're altruistic (I'm not), you can flaunt your karma score as a measure of how much you've enriched the lives of other Redditors.\\
- If you're selfish (I am), you can flaunt your karma score as a measure of how helpful you've been in keeping the site alive by providing useful content for it.

I consider karma to be a minor side benefit of an activity that I would be prosecuting anyway, achievable with a minimal expenditure of effort (/i. e./, messing around with Chrome's Developer Tools, GIMP, and Imgur whenever I see a particularly-funny post in the regular course of browsing).

  [I]f you use lower-effort methods to get the karma, it becomes even more meaningless and less rewarding, right?

Submitting screenshots of 4chan threads (which you would have read anyway in the ordinary course of entertaining yourself as a bored denizen of the Internet) to [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] is no less "low-effort" than submitting The Hill news articles (which you would have read anyway in the ordinary course of educating yourself as a responsible citizen of a republic) to [[/r/politics][r/politics]] is.
