Well yeah, but that's cheating. Anyone can go to large subreddits and shitpost their way to 100k, and that's only easier if you rely on other people's content to do the work for you.

The real skill is sticking to small and medium sized subreddits and making the bulk of your karma from comments and textposts. (Which may also be shitposts, but are at least /involved/ shitposts.)

[[https://i.imgur.com/5WfXXpI.png][Check it.]] Only ~1/3rd of my comment karma comes from the big subreddits, and less than a tenth of my post karma.

(I am, indeed, something of an elitist about karma farming.)
