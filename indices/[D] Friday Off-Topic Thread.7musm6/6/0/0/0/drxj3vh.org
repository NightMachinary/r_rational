  Preservation of content is just as important as creation of content is. How many times has a hilarious 4chan comment been forgotten in the dank depths of a third-party archive, never to be seen and enjoyed by more than the few dozen or few hundred people who saw it when it was originally made?

Preservation of content is indeed important, and I /do/ enjoy [[/r/4chan]], but I find the beauty of 4chan to be the fact that comments are not /expected/ to be archived or perused, in keeping with the anonymity. If an author wants their comment to be saved forever, they can keep it on pastebin instead. Instead, it is the very throw-away nature of these comments that makes them so interesting to see them in the wild-- to know that nobody will every care about them but you and perhaps a few others, and that's OK.

  Also, you may have misinterpreted the objective of my comment. I was trying to boost 4chan, not myself. I haven't even bothered to apply to [[/r/centuryclub][r/centuryclub]].

That's true, but you also seem to have missed the point of my comment-- unadulterated self-aggrandizement.
