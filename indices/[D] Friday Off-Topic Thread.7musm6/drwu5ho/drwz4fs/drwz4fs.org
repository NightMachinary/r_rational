My favorite moments in the movie were the worldbuilding, especially when it came to ideas that really hadn't been explored before. The new Force powers, the new spaceships, the casino, the new species, Snoke's extreme mastery of the force, etc.

Otherwise, have the plot twists were brilliant and half were stupid.
