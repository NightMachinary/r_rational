I got a date \o/

EDIT: Seriously, remember these posts I made a few weeks ago where I was a little bitter because it was hard for me to find a girl who I connected with intellectually (a la "find someone I can respect as an equal in things that matter to me")?

Well, I've been browsing on OkCupid and I just found someone who seems to fitting the pattern I'm looking for. I don't want to be too optimistic too soon, but... man, I'm excited!!!!! :D

She put on her profile that she didn't meet anyone IRL until weeks had passed, and she just invited me over for a drink. The feeling is very clearly mutual.
