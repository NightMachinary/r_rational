Work with me here... but I think Jane the Virgin is an excellent romance show. It's on netflix and it's amazing. It is very over the top but within its world everyone acts rationally and all the relationships/etc are very realistic.

And both my straight, male partners love it so it's not a show just for women, FWIW. Even though I want Raph to marry me....
