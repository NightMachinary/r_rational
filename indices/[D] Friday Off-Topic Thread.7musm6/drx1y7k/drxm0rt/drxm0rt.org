I'm writing a rational supernatural romance story! It's human vampire, both men, spanning 1944 to present day / possibly "near future".

It's going to be three volumes, the first of which is almost finished - I'm hoping it'll be finished by the end of January or February, but I have a coauthor who will need to edit it and she's very, very slow, so I can't guarantee a release date for volume 1 let alone the other two volumes which I haven't started writing yet. Volume 3 is basically fully sketched out but volume 2 needs to be filled in.

I'm not sure how well it meets criteria: the main plot is their relationship and how it changes and how they change as people as to me that's what romance does to people, it makes them change and become better.

The vampire goes from not thinking humans are not moral subjects to, well, being super progressive by vampire standards and wanting to forge a vampire-human alliance (this is also partially because this attitude both costs him nothing and nets him a very powerful human ally). He also has to deal with the changes in their romantic dynamic when his partner becomes a vampire, which are quite major.

The human goes from being a coward to being a semi-human monster who sees and does terrible things to turning his back on that, regaining his humanity, and accepting his mortality. Then he's actually faced with mortality and realises that he doesn't actually want to die and has to adjust to life as a vampire, which is /hard/, and his partner is not being a great "vampire-mentor" and he makes a bunch of vampire mistakes but ultimately it works out.

So yeah, that's more or less it. If you're interested and would be able to provide feedback, I'm happy to PM you a link to the 80-90% complete first 50,000 word volume. It's completely readable as-is (no major missing sections). I just need to write up about half a dozen interludes, redo the first part of the first chapter, and then go through the entire story with a fine tooth comb to ensure everything flows - actually now I think about it there's a couple more scenes I need to retool.
