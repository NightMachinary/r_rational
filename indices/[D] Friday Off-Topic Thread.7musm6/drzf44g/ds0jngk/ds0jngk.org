  Push the planet Venus into an orbit in the habitable zone and siphon away its excess atmosphere?
#+end_quote

The campiest incarnations of Superman might have been able to push planets around, but usually this is a very tricky engineering problem. Arbitrary amounts of flight and super-strength /in a human-size body/ will let you pierce through a planet, not move it.

Similarly,

  Build a space elevator?
#+end_quote

We don't yet have the fancy nanomaterial needed to form the "rope" of a space elevator without breaking under its own weight. This is a job more suited to the billionaire and/or genius aspects than to super-strength.

I'm sure there are lots of interesting space projects that nobody's talking about because they're not economically viable under the tyranny of the rocket equation though. They'd come out of the woodwork once it became known that SuperLex was willing to act as a free space elevator from time to time. I wish I could give concrete examples here but I haven't explored the subject myself.
