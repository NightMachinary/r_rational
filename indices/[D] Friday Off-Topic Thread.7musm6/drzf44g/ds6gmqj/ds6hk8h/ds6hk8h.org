If you mean a literal tech-based lightsaber-like device, you'd have to change a lot more than that! Each change needs both plausible prerequisites and sensible consequences, and may require additional changes in turn in a domino effect.

For example, if you... Give Frodo a lightsaber: How does he charge it? Lightsaber charging is never shown in Star Wars movies, but there's also a reasonable expectation that everyone is familiar with electricity. And that's actually pretty insignificant compared to all the other changes necessary. So would you elevate all of Middle Earth to a tech level closer to Sakaar as seen in Thor Ragnarok, or whatever the name of the ground town is in Alita: Battle Angel?

The hallmark of Rational Fiction is a self-consistent universe. That's why there isn't more of it: it's a lot of work to even plan, let alone write!
