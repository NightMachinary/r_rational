I'd like to be an (unpaid) shill for a story I found on spacebattles: [[https://altimatewriting.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/choosing-the-blade-part-i/][Choosing the Blade]]

It's a litRPG isekai work, which I know will immediatelly turn off a lot of you, but what distinguishes it from all the crud on royalroadl are the following:

- Wankery is kept to a minimum
- The main character gets no super special advantages. By the same token, however, they don't get hammered with any despair-porn inducing disadvantages either, excepting the ones logically brought on by being a short, skinny guy from modern earth trying to hack it in adventureland.
- Fluff > crunch. This story does include references to levels and xp and abilities and so on, but the mechanics are deliberately obscured from both the character and the reader in the interest of making a better story. It's not a story about making numbers go up.
- Fits tenets #2-3 of rational fiction quite well, and mostly fits tenet #1. I can't really judge how well it fits tenet #4 because I haven't been reading it as rational fiction and therefore haven't been paying exacting attention to setting details. From another work by the author ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/znt-an-american-geek-in-halkeginia.224847/][An American Geek in Halkagenia]]) I do know that the author tends to be fairly consistent, however.
