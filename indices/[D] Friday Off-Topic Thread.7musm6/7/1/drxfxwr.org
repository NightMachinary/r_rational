[[https://altimatewriting.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/choosing-the-blade-part-i/][Choosing the blade]] <- I found this one relatively recently, it's been a very interesting, non-wish-fulfillment saturated take on litRPG, without simultaneously being a despair porn subversion that a played-perfectly-straight take could be.\\
[[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/10293/bitter][Bitter]] <- The best of mooderino's fics, in my opinion. I eventually dropped How to avoid Death on a Daily Basis becuase I got tired of it, and The Good Student because the subject matter bored me, but I've kept up with bitter since it was initially linked on this subreddit months ago, and am still interested.

Also, if anime is your thing, check out Log Horizon. The light novels aren't worth reading translated because Japanese-English translations are rarely good, but the anime is downright incredible. the fanfic linked in my flair is a (complete) Log Horizon fanfic, to get you some idea of how much I liked LH.
