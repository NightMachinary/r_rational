*[Request for community input][META][WIP][HSF] What should be on the ToDo list of a rationalist who has mysteriously developed entropy-violating superpowers?*

 

/Note: Any answers provided may or may not find their way into a story I'm writing. I cannot guarantee attribution for any great ideas. If you're uncomfortable with this, do not reply./

 

In the rational story [[http://rationalfiction.io/story/the-metropolitan-man][Metropolitan Man]], Lex Luthor [[#s][minor high-level plot spoiler]], and prioritizes [[#s][minor high-level plot spoiler]]. But what if /Lex Luthor (billionaire rationalist businessman genius)/ had woken up one day and discovered that /he/ suddenly had Superman's power set? Assuming Superman never existed in such a reality, how should Lex use his newfound powers to optimally increase the probability of the best possible future for humanity?

Some ideas:

1. Push the planet Venus into an orbit in the habitable zone and siphon away its excess atmosphere?
2. Terraform Mars outright?
3. Build a space elevator?
4. Take over the world?
5. Develop high-quality educational materials for children?
6. Push forward the boundaries of science with perfect memory, superfast reading/comprehension, and superhuman writing/typing speed?
7. Leave Earth forever?
8. [[https://www.universetoday.com/130989/can-save-sun/][Save the sun?]]
9. [[#s][Minor high-level plot meta spoiler for Metropolitan Man:]]

I'm using the above situation as a proxy for a story idea I recently had. Inspired by a writing prompt, I have written the beginning of a short story about a person who mysteriously develops superpowers.

I've been heavily influenced by the rational/rationalist fiction genre since I discovered [[http://www.hpmor.com/][HPMOR]] by accident through a comment on a [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/157888][StackExchange answer]] earlier this year. Because of this, I don't think I can bring myself to write a main character who isn't rational.

I'm currently in the process of trying to plan out how the rest of the overall story will unfold, but I've realized the story I /want to write/ might not be the same as the story I /should write/. I suspect the story I /should write/ might be a little bit beyond my skill as a rationalist and my overall knowledge of the world.

Therefore, I'm seeking community input on what should be on the ToDo list of someone with superpowers?

Information about main character's power set (intentionally vague):\\
Assume a power set similar to (but not the same as) Superman's: not truly invincible, but unstoppable (maybe even un-opposeable) for all practical purposes due to a highly versatile power set of the entropy-violating variety; flight, impermeable force fields, superhuman sensing capabilities, maybe bending light for invisibility, and possibly other powers TBD. Less powerful than Doctor Manhattan, but able to kill instantly and silently at a distance with precision (in a "Why does Darth Vader bother with choking when he could just sever the brain stem, or shred the cardiac muscle, or mulch the brain itself?" kind of way once his powers have been mastered. Looks like a normal human. Beginning of story is set in America in either 2015, 2016, 2017, or 2018.
