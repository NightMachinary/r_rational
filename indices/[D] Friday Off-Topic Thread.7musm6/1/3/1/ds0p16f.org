  Is the Guard force trained?
#+end_quote

I assumed they were the jedi apprentices Kylo took with him when he rebelled.

Which, incidentally, is really interesting and I wish they got more character development instead of being masked mooks to cut down.

How did Luke pick the first new generation of padawan? What made them give it up so dramatically in a moment of crisis? How did they feel about training with, then working under, someone rather unlikeable but forever more powerful than them by mere accident of genetics? Do they spend their day bored to death standing guard in the throne room, or do their abilities make them useful in special ops?

If someone wants to rationalfic these folks, I'll eat it up.

(Friend of mine told me that no, they're something else and have an explanation in some layer of canon or another, but I admit I don't remember any of it.)
