  the musical score was beautiful, the visuals were gorgeous, most of the dialogue was good and most of the punchlines landed

The score was forgettable at best, the visuals /were/ gorgeous, and the punchlines detracted from the film.

  'the Force doesn't belong to the Jedi, it belongs to everyone'

This is part of the film's repudiation of the heroic myth. I'm fine with this particular revelation, except that it's less a revelation and more a statement of the obvious. I was hoping Luke would explain some deeper secrets of the Force.

In the end, I felt the writer was going out of his way to subvert audience expectations at every turn. The lesson I take away is that subverting audience expectations is fine, but a writer needs to give the audience something better in return. This film didn't do that. I felt short-changed every time.
