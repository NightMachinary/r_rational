I watched /Star Wars: The Last Jedi/ yesterday, having successfully avoided spoilers. Overall I enjoyed the film: the musical score was beautiful, the visuals were gorgeous, most of the dialogue was good and most of the punchlines landed. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Andy Serkis' performances made the film. Alas, I'm sure that if you've seen the movie, you know where this comment is going...

Since all of us collectively are unlikely to have missed any details, I'm looking for anything that might potentially explain some of the plot errors and inexplicable decisions characters make. This is deliberately ruling out things akin to [[#s][The Last Jedi spoiler]]
