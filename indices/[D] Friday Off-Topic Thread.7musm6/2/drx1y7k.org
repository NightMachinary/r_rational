Inspired by a post made by [[/u/Workaholico]] and also a few of my own errant plot bunnies, I pose a question:

If you had to write a rational love story, not a love subplot in your star wars fanfiction or murder mystery novel but a story written for the express purpose of being about two (or more) people falling in romantic love, how would you go about it?

I suppose I'm basically asking for pitches for rational romantic love stories. I'm never going to utilize them for anything (I don't think) so please don't spend more than 5 minutes thinking about it but I'm curious to see what you guys have to say!
