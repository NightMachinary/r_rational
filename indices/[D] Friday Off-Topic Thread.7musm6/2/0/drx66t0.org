If you mean rational as the sidebar describes it, then I would say that there are a lot out there, since all you have to do is remove some of the dumber tropes, like people saying "wait, I can explain!" and then not explaining while the other person storms off, or problems that could be (but aren't) solved by a phone call, or plots that rely almost entirely on coincidence.

But if you mean rational as in "thinky fiction", then you have more work to do. Stories require conflict, and for the kind of story that lasts longer than a simple short, you need a bigger, complex conflict that thought can be applied to over a longer period of time.

I think star-crossed lovers works well for that, but you need more than just "we are in love and things are keeping us apart"; the conflict has to come from within the pairing itself, and part of the plot needs to be about either finding compromise or growing as people in order to accommodate that relationship (or possibly in response to the circumstances of that relationship).

I guess I /do/ have a Draco/Hermione work sitting on my shelf that's largely about redemption, racism, and confronting cognitive dissonance, which might qualify as rational by some metrics, but it's far from done, and not one of the things that I've been working on.
