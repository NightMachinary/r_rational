There was someone who posted their.. I think it was a Downton Abbey fic? on here once or twice - I liked the first few chapters but lost interest (and never saw the source material).

Anyhow, for a rationalist love story, I want the main love plot itself (the thing that begins when we meet the lovers, and its resolutions and tensions are resolutions and tensions in their love) to be rational. This doesn't mean people can't make mistakes - I want to read a love story about people like me, and I often make mistakes (though different mistakes than a typical romance-novel character). But it means that they should see problems and take actions to resolve them that might actually work in the real world.

In other words, no contrived problems, sensible characters who make mistakes similar to the audience's mistakes and have to use real-world-plausible solutions, because there's no deus ex machina or psychologically unrealistic power of love to help them.

So for example, Alicorn's Twilight fic Luminosity has a love plot in it between smarter Bella and smarter Edward. But it's the most simple plot possible - they meet, one of them likes the other, then they like each other, then they get happily married. The story contains love, but the course of that love isn't interesting.

In a sense, then, I'm outlining desiderata for rational stories /about/ a romance.

A key trick is making it interesting. There's a reason most romance novels are the way they are! I think the solution to this is keeping the exposition light, and have something else going on. Like the vampires, or like all the high society and sister drama in Pride and Prejudice.

Anyhow, idea: everyman hero/ine meets love interest who has a brilliant, labyrinthine, implausible, possibly-only-ironic system for the perfect romance (remember that NYT article on 36 questions to ask each other to fall in love? Multiply that by a philosophical movement). It sort of works, they do smart people things in their spare time, it sort of stops working, we see beneath their masks to who they are inside, they solve some problems in a plausible way, there's a narrative climax that's allowed to be a little improbable, the end.
