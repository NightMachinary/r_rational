thank you for the mention my friend, and I have some ideas, but I lack the skill on the language to do so.

As a base I will do my favorite trope, "MMO gamer life".

- First idea: "I am tired of RL love, I want MMO Love":: 2 adults dive head first in a MMO from past marriage problems, both become social retracts, so they fake a perfect [marriage] in game, a role play of sorts, as a way to deal with all sadness and problems of empty houses, bit by bit they stop faking and build a family (aka. guild)[plot: long distance relationship difficulties, psychological problems of both, some "family" members are not as cooperative, and social pressures] they never ever in this story meet each other (different continents) yet, love, and caring happens.

- Second: "Pragmatism makes love":: a boy in game marries for buffs a over sympathetic girl (he doesn't like), so he could have access to her guild's power,and steal the [Dragon's den] instance from the biggest guild in the server [Barbarians], he discovers that she is not as dumb as she seems, as she actually wanted his power for the same objective, see how these who over pragmatic people use all possible way to achieve their goal. (PS: in truth, both love each other, the stealing thing is not as important. but they do not want to admit. all guild knows)

are these enough?
