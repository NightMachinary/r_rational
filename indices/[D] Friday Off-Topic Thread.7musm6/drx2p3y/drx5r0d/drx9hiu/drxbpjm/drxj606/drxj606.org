I plan on the journey to the outer system being a similar shift as the introduction of Stands, hence the reference to AI mecha having strange powers. That'll be the point where the players will stop increasing in power and the story will be more about what they do with it in a world filled with other strange abilities.

I actually plan for the final battle to be roughly equivalent to Part 3 of JoJo, and then the story can just keep going as they return home from war and go on to explore space. I haven't planned out that far ahead, I only did this much because I didn't want the different story arcs to be as sudden a change as in JoJo.

JoJo did get much more interesting after the introduction of Stands, but I think starting the plot without something that weird with the plan to introduce it later helps to get the players more invested at the beginning. The point of starting the campaign as a sitcom is so the players can more easily relate to the story and ground future events.

However, I am a bit split on what system to run this in. Fate is the obvious choice for its pulpy style, but the mechanics aren't as well suited to the more slice of life/drama elements I want to emphasize. Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine has the latter down to a tee, but I'm worried it won't handle the action scenes as well.
