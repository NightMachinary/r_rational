i assumed

1) that they must be near you for you to control them

2) Once they are programmed, they stay that way until death

3) How long it takes is a function of how complex it is. The magic works with your psychic intuition to control what they want, but you have to actually observe them in action and tweak what you've done to their preferences to make sure they actually behave as desired. They're still squirrels - If you desire them to want to go to the moon, they'll just start jumping ineffectively and climbing trees when they see the moon. You'd actually have to make them create the individual parts of the ship and do the whole thing in steps small enough for a squirrel mind to understand. (Obviously, intellectual or creative work like making space ships is not the sort of thing this power is good at - but repetitive farming might be.). So the transfer is fairly instant, but getting them to work on tasks unsupervised takes takes time to optimize. It's like having a really powerful computer program housed in capable hardware that can be intuitively made to do a wide range of "complex" tasks like "recognize object, fetch" etc, but can't actually do your high level thinking for you and you have to test it out to make sure it does what you think it's going to do.

4) You can do identical magic to an indefinite number of squirrels at a time, but you're still limited by your own working memory.

So you could pack 10000 squirrels in a small space and tell them all "you now feel the urge to jump every 5 seconds", and then pack 10000 different squirrels and then tell theim "you now want to gather all objects that look like THIS and put them inside objects that look like THAT"... but you couldn't do that simultaneously, for the same reason you can't program two computers simultaneously, it's just too hard.
