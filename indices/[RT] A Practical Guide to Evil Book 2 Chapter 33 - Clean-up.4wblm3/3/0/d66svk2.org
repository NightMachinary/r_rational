My guess: munitions alone wouldn't kill Heiress, and would be too open of an attack. She DOES still have the demon in the banner, after all. While killing Heiress would be good overall, I can absolutely see her releasing the demon if cornered. And open attacks would lead to reprisal from the Empress, because Heiress is nobility.
