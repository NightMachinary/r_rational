Sorry for being vague: I meant that he/she isn't the owner of the Naruto copyright.

+I don't believe fanfiction authors are entitled to DMCA actions.+

Apparently "derivative works" fall under the Copyright Act, but it's still unclear without some lawyering whether derivative work authors are entitled to DMCA action.

  The copyright on a derivative work covers only new material, appearing for the first time in the derivative work; it does not cover any preexisting material from the original. So the character of Superman is not covered by the copyright on the film Superman, since the copyright on that character pre-dated the movie; but any elements new to the film received their copyright from the date of Superman II's creation. What this means are two things: (1) if you license a work from its author so you can make a derivative work based on the original, you do not obtain the copyright on the original---you gain only the right to make the derivative work agreed upon; the owner retains all rights to the original and all its elements, and (2) the copyright on the original is not extended by the creation of the derivative work. This used to mean more than it does today, since copyrights exist for the life of an author plus 70 years, and if an author makes a derivative of his own work, then his copyright won't change regardless. But what it does mean is that if a second author makes a derivative work of the first author's original, the copyright on the elements of the original is measured by the life of the original's author---not the derivative work's.

  With “new versions” of work becoming more commonplace, the lines between a new creation, a derivative work and copied work can be blurred. With all these gray areas, it's important to do your homework before you set out to create and publicize something you believe is completely black and white. The take-away: get a license or get a lawyer.
