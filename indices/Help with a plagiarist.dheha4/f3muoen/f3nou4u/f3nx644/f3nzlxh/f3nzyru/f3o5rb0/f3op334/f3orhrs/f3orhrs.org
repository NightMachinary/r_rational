...I think you may have misunderstood my intentions.

I'm not trying to say that the law isn't on OP's side. And if they do indeed intend to work with the copyright holders and charge for it, then this all makes sense.

But it seems based off of what they've said so far, that this isn't the case. As such I'm trying to convince them, by appealing to their morals, that letting the story be mirrored would be the logical and most beneficial thing to do.

Also, I kind of doubt your third point. In what way did the reuploader imply that they have permission? By giving credit? Personally, I would never have considered that to be a way of stating permission, and I don't really see why you do.
