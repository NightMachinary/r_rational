Having your work appreciated seems to me to be a pretty fundamental drive for humans. I don't have a good justification for it from a philosophical perspective at the moment, but practically at least it seems to me that people would be far less willing to engage in intellectual labor if there were no assurance at all that it would be known that the work was theirs, to the point where I suspect the natural human desire to contribute would be insufficient.
