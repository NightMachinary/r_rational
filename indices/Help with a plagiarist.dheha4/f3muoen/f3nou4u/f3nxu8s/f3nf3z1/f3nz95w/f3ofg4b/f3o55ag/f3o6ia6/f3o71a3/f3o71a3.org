I do understand. My main disagreement is just with the idea that you have any right to control over your work (and thus that there IS any obligation to ask you) once you've put it out there, aside from requiring that you be credited. In truth, the only reason I'm not against ALL intellectual property is because we unfortunately still live under capitalism where you need to make a profit to live and be happy; if that weren't a factor, I don't honestly believe that you'd have any right to control over your intellectual labor so long as you were credited for it. And we've established that that's not relevant here.

I do get your frustration that maybe the credit isn't effective enough, but I'm not sure that a few people missing the disclaimer is a huge enough issue to outweigh the advantages of people being free to rehost works of fiction. In the long run, it's beneficial to the survival of your work as well. FF.net won't last forever. But if people are free to rehost, it can keep being spread around indefinitely.
