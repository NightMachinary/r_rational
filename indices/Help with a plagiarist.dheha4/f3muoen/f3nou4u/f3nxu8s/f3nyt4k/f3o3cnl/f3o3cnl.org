There actually are TOS for fanfiction.net which the reposter is in clear violation of:

General Use of the Service

FanFiction.Net hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service, including but not limited to User Submissions (defined below), without FanFiction.Net's prior written authorization.

Edit: Plus a license is a grant of permissions/restrictions. Lack of license effectively means "no permissions"* (I'm highly simplifying here, there are of course fair use exceptions, right of first sale, etc.)
