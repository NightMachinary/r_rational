Since you're not the owner of the copyrighted work, stick with reporting the story. Also if you're still posting chapters, get your readers to report it on Wattpad as well.

  *How to report Published content if you are not the owner:*

  Clicking the report button on the story description page OR when on web clicking the "..." on any story part and clicking "Report Story"

  After you click report story, you will select that you are reporting copyright. After doing so, you will be brought to a separate reporting form and will be required to provide all links since the DMCA form does not track the story link you reported from.

  Tip: For the "original source," please include a link to a listing if you are reporting a novel. A link to the Amazon or Goodreads page for the novel is ideal so we can view a free preview and easily investigate.
