You own the non infringing parts of the derivative work, which is going to be quite difficult convincing a judge that any part of it is original unless you made substantial changes.

For example, EY's Harry Potter would be partially owned by EY and JKR. JKR owns the parts that match the character she created (history, appearance, name) while EY owns the parts he created (Modifications to history, behavior). Now if another author decides to make an R!Harry, but just copies EY's Harry to make it happen without doing the work to create a unique character, EY would own this other Harry outright, and since Harry is a defining feature of the work, may even own this other story entirely if the unnamed writer fails to make a case for fair use.

Here is an example of a case where the author of the original ended up owning the derivative even though the derivative was a whole new story (thanks to ChronoDAS for linking it originally). [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Stallone]]
