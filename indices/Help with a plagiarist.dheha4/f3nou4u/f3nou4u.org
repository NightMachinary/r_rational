The disclaimer seems visible enough, it's the first thing people see when they click. You may have the legal right to stop them, but as far as I'm concerned they did nothing wrong, since they credited you clearly. They CERTAINLY didn't "plagiarize" you considering they were very clearly not intending to pass it off as their own work and stated that their intention was to share a story they enjoyed in a way others would find more convenient.

Like I said though, you are unfortunately legally in the right, since the law does not agree with me that the creator should have no right to limit how people use their work so long as it is properly credited as theirs (things become slightly more complicated morally when money is involved, since we're unfortunately in a capitalist economy where it's necessary to make a profit to survive, but in this case there isn't any money involved anyway). But I certainly don't see how you can pretend to hold the moral high ground when your own work builds off of others copyright, and I doubt you sought permission from the original authors any more than this so-called plagiarizer did.
