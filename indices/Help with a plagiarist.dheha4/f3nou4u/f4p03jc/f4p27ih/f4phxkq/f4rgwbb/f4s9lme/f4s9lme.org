I did say I was exaggerating. Just sayin' don't be an asshole m8

It's equally ridiculous to compare remixes (which add value, like a response in a conversation) to simply reposting and copying wholesale others' art without permission (which adds no value and is kind of a dick move)

basically my issue is that you're opposing the idea that we should let artists engage with their audience themselves,and instead advocating that we should view it all as mere content consumption and let content aggregators accumulate all the engagement

I hope that the irony that arises when you pair this with an opposition to capitalism isn't lost on you; the reposter here is playing the role of a corporation, an exploitative barrier between the artist and the effects of their work, without consent
