Alright, admittedly, I was overly harsh. I apologize for my tone.

With that said, my point wasn't that you were stupid for caring about "worthless internet points", I totally get that! Recognition for your work always feels good, and is probably the main reason that most people create art in the first place.

My point, rather, was that a mirror of your story isn't going to reduce that! Like, I just don't get how someone putting your story up somewhere else would /lower/ the traffic to the original.

EDIT: Additionally, as an explanation for the aggressiveness of my tone, I suppose it was probably because I felt defensive of the mirrorer. You're accusing them of wrongdoing, when I can't see how they actually did anything bad. I was, in my own eyes, responding to aggression with aggression. In retrospect that was silly of me. Sorry again.
