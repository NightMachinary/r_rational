1. It doesn't matter that op is posting it for free. They may decide to take down the free bits and charge for it in the future. As author it's their right to do so (assuming they work out the details with other copyright owners who might have a stake) the thief who mirrored the story is illegally taking the author's ability to do so away.

2. Assigning credit to the owner of a copyright doesn't make it ok to then copy wholesale. In fact the only place it's appropriate is academic papers where one person builds on another's discoveries (or if the academic field is literature, the one person adds original commentary). Why you're defending such an act with melodramatic BS is unclear.

3. Besides the points in part 1, if the owner of the characters used decides to make op take the work down, op is unable to do it and the thief is implying that they have permission by giving credit and then posting the work as if they have permission. This can cause all sorts of trouble for op.
