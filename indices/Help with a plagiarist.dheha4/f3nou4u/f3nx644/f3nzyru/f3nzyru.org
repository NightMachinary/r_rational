  The analogy isn't me writing a fanfic, but me copy and pasting the words of Harry Potter exactly and then saying "credits to JK Rowling!"

JK Rowling sells her books, you've posted your online for free. As far as I can tell, the only thing that someone mirroring your story can do, in this case, is good. Heck, I don't think that you even could hypothetically make money off of it, considering that it's a fanfiction, and it might therefore be illegal to do so, though I'm not /totally/ sure about that.

  But this person just copy pasted directly. Which I think I have a right to be annoyed about. Even if they put the disclaimer, lots of people skip over that. If you look at the conversations on their author profile, it's clear that readers have mistaken this for an original work.

Oh shit, somebody else is getting credit for something they didn't do! The HORROR! Even though they explicitly said they didn't make it, and realistically speaking it probably is drawing more attention to your original upload, there's a chance that people might not understand!

My. What a vile crime indeed.

  I didn't pour hours of my life into this thing just so someone else could post it under their name.

Why not? How does this negatively impact you in any way?
