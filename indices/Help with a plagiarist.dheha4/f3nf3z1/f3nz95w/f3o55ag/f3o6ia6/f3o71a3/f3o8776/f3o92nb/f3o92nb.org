  I don't know if you've ever worked on a 300k-word thing for 4 years.

Well, that's a pretty specific requirement. I've made art of various kinds (mostly music), which I do allow others to reuse, rehost, etc. as long as I'm credited. But I'm not really a writer, so no "300k-word thing"s, and I've admittedly not worked on one project consistently for 4 years.

I'm not trying to be rude. You do seem to be much more reasonable about it than most people (some people somehow don't get that it's unreasonable to say people can't make fanworks of their own fanworks, etc.). But here's another angle to look at: It is not AT ALL unheard of for fanfic authors to mysteriously one day decide to take down their fanfic, even in-progress like yours. If that happens, the survival of the art relies on others having rehosted it. You may think that you personally would never do that, and you may even be right, but none of the rest of us know that. Rehosting is vital for the preservation of all forms of art.
