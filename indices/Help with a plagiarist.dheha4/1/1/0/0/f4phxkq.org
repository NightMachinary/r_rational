I take it you haven't experienced people claiming your work as their own, or had shitty profiteering meme-sites appropriate it as advertisement for themselves (not that this is exactly the same, but since it was without permission, it is related). It doesn't feel nice.

Artists don't have any obligation to the world; they should be able to share their work on their own terms -- especially if you think of art as a social action. Try replacing "art", "story", and "work" with "sex" in your original post for a slightly exaggerated take on how I feel about this.
