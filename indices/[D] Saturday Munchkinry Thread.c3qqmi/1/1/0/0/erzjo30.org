That's fine, they just need to cook up some Greek Fire that never goes out to go along with it.

That gives me an idea for a related setting. Magic is a source of basically limitless energy that can be directed mostly by rituals (think chalk circles and runes) that can direct the energy in programmatic, unique, and exotic ways. This clearly leads to a post-scarcity society, but if you want to take a chemistry/physics angle, you set the story right as people are trying to get to that post-scarcity utopia. Free energy is probably trivial, free food, immortality, and magical computers probably aren't.
