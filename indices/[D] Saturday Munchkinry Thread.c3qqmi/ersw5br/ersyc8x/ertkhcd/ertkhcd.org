I don't think this would be useful compared to the siege weapons of the time (catapults, ballistas, and trebuchets), since you're limited by human ability to catch and throw the projectile, so you can't use too heavy of a projectile or get too high of a velocity.

(Edited to remove momentum addition error.)
