Hm, I wonder what counts as a catch and a throw?

If you're forced to "catch" a projectile head on that certainly limits the maximum amount of kinetic energy in the projectile. But what if you catch it from behind?

Suppose the projectile is really really heavy, so that each "throw" (really a push) only adds a tiny amount of velocity. Then you could easily run up to the projectile from behind and give it yet another push forward.

If you have a lot of people in your army learn this technique, could they create a large and super heavy metal shield (shaped sort of like a battering ram), and collectively throw it forward while charging though the enemy?
