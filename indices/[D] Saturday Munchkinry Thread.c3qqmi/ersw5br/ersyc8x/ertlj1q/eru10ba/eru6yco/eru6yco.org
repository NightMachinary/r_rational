Knights with a shield and armor weren't superhumans and they were functionally immune to piercing(besides gaps and crossbows). 3 heros can definitely slip between pikes just like normal soldiers do and there's only 4 people they have to keep an eye out for in the entire enemy army. Or just give your heros even longer polearms to outrange the chaff.

Heros and aces have at least enough stamina to kill an army of elite mooks? Historical sieged cities managed to stealthily sally forth with armies, sneak attack and raid, then return to the castle. Having 3 heroes do this should be a breeze especially since the 3 of them can theoretically kill the entire invading army.

On the flip side the attacking hero should be sneaking in to raid or open up the castle. He can probably even survive jumping off the walls if he needs a quick escape, since the impact would be blunt force.

The only use for ki sharing I can think of then would be for extremely heavy draw weight bows, but then you're probably just a worse version of a ballista crew.
