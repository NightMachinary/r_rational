What if I make a 10000 person square of trained elite mooks? I think that would make them overpower any heroes or aces, but without the mobility of them. Could be coupled with battering rams for a quick breach.

As for raids how would you prevent the 5 heroes from launching an all-out attack to capture you(Kublai Khan)?
