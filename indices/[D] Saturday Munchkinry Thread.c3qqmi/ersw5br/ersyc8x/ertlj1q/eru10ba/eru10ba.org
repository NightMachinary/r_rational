Kind of, but note that ki gives no piercing durability so heroes and aces can't just trivially charge into a wall of pikes or cross a hail of arrows. Also they will eventually run out of stamina.

Ki sharing needs skin contact to be maintained so they will have to move in a formation to achieve that, and then it is only at one point of the formation.
