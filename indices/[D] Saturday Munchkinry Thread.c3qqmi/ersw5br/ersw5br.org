I'd like to munchkin the Mongolian army from /Return of the Condor Heroes/ by Jin Yong. You are Kublai Khan and you are tasked to conquer the city of Xiangyang from Song Dynasty within a little more than a month.

There are two noteworthy techniques available to you:

The first one is a throwing technique where a projectile is thrown then caught up to and thrown in another direction where its kinetic energy increases by simple addition instead of obeying conservation of momentum. Energy is conserved in any application of such techniques. Eg character A throws a 2 kg rock north at 3 m/s then catches up to it and throws it west at 4 m/s. The rock flies west instead of northwest(ish) at 5 m/s. Only one person in your army knows this technique at first and it takes a week to teach your army.

The other is the ability to share ki by skin contact. Ki(just call it that for the sake of simplicity) enhances the strength, blunt force durability, speed and stamina of the body. A different person knows this technique and it takes another week to teach your army this. Your army has no ki at first and it takes a month to have enough ki to become them all into elite mooks.

Your side has one 'hero' unit who knows the second technique and three 'ace' units, one of whom knows the first technique. You also have an army numbering several hundred thousand. The Song Dynasty side has 5 'hero' units and 1 'ace' units, and around 500 elite mooks, in addition to less than 100k garrison. 'Hero' units are 3 times as powerful as 'ace' units. Elite mooks are 10 times as powerful as normal armies. Elite mooks are negligible compared to 'ace' and 'hero' units.

How would you take the city?
