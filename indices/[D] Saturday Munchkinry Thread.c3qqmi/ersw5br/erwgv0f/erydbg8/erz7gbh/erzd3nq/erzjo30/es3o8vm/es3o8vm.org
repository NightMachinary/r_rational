Ice-9 would probably be easier to contain in this scenario as it wouldn't be able to exist outside the influence of the spell that's changing the phase behavior of water, so if the spell only covers a limited region it can't "escape" and if it does spread out of control as long as it hasn't killed all the wizards yet (or the magic space bats intervene) the spell enabling it's existence can be canceled/dispelled. So the main problem it posed in the original concept which was that once it got into the oceans there was no possibility of melting it faster than it spread would probably never hapen.

It would still be incredibly dangerous however as the otehr thing it did was crystalize water in the human body. But again magic might help as if people have an aura/magic resistance of some sort the spell might not hold inside a person, or a protective spell could probably be devised once the danger is known.
