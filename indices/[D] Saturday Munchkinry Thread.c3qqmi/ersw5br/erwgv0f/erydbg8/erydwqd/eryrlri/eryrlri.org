Well the non-barionic gel implies that it is not beyond normal practitioners as mucking about with fundamental forces enouhg to make that hapen has lots of bad end possibilities if you make similar adjustment but more carelessly. Like for one thing why isn't the gell turning all the air in contact with it non-baryonic and how many tries did it take to get that right?

Anyway, I think the idea needs to be started again from a more productive angle. The main problem here IMO is it's too open there isn't any indication what magic can't do so answers like "make Aristotelian motion a real thing in an area to stop arrows from moving through it" are sort of valid, but that has all sorts of consequences for the air and thermodynamics of that region that are impossible to calculate because that's not how physics works IRL and tehre aren't any equations you can use to determine what happens in that region, let alone at the edge between the two regions.

I'd suggest picking one fairly simple thing you want magic to be able to do and focus on that. You mentioned exotic states of matter and messing with chemistry as points of interest so perhaps magic can alter the phase diagrams of matter with a cost in magic proportionate to the degree of change?
