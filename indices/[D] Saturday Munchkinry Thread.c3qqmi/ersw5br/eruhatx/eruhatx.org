It depends on how heroes/aces manage elite mooks, and where they're located. One on one, they demolish elites, yes, but what if there's ten? A hundred? A thousand? If a hero can take on any number of non-ace, non-hero units, then you've lost. The heroes will bulldoze through your armies and kill you.

If they can be taken out by armies of elites, it depends on the number. Needing 1 million elites has the same result as above, as does any number above half your forces.

At half or less, you can win by teaching your army ki-sharing and building them up to Elite. Then, you send 50k at the garrison (5x effective power of the garrison), and engage the heroes.
