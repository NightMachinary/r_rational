- Bait one of heroes out of city in some way. Try to ensure that he comes alone.

- If more than one leaves together, then split them up

- Lead him into an ambush of 50k mooks, to tire him out.

- Once he's tired out, my Hero and three Aces turn up and obliterate him.

Now I'm down about 50k mooks, and the enemy is down one Hero. I "leak" the info the the enemy that their missing hero is alive and in a certain location.

Naturally, the other four heroes go to rescue their compatriot, leaving their Ace in charge of the city defenses.

While they're out, I have my much bigger army take the city.

--------------

The heroes find a large bag of money, along with a thank-you note addressed to my spy which implies that said spy should have killed the other three Heroes by now. Alone with the disembodied head of their former companion.

I estimate that fewer than four Heroes will return from that confrontation, and the remaining Heroes are unlikely to be united. I should be able to pick them off, one by one.
