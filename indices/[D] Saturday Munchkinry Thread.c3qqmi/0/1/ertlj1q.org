10 mooks = 1 Elite mook = 0 aces so only aces and above truly matter?

1 Hero = 3 aces

Assuming ki is the difference between tiers: you teach your army ki and ki sharing then use these to convert as many as possible to aces or heros if ki cost 3 aces > ki cost 1 hero.

Although the 5 hero garrison should be periodically sending out 3 heroes to raid/obliterate your forces as they approach. There are also huge strategic implications when the strongest forces are also the fastest.
