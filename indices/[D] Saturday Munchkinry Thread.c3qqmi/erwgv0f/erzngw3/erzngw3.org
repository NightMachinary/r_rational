What happens when you use reversibly transfigured or conjured materials in a chemical reaction? For example, if I burn a conjured twig under a bell jar, what happens to the smoke when the conjuration wears off/is dispelled? If I transmute a volume of stone into a volume of water, dissolve salt into the water and then turn the water back into stone, what happens to the salt?
