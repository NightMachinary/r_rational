I don't think your first sentence is correct, even considering what you said in the spoiler.

There is much debate about how much influence your second statement has over the characters as a whole. And I tend to think that for the vast majority of characters who aren't Thinkers of some sort, the influence is very small and subtle as far as their actual intelligence goes.

They gain increased ability to do things, but not the intelligence to do them in particularly novel or efficient ways. Which is why you see the main character sometimes comment on how some people are wasting their power's potential.

But overall I'd say Worm isn't really a story about geniuses competing with wit. But more about people of average to above average intelligence using extraordinary powers to the best of their ability.

Most characters aren't incredibly clever, but they use everything they have at their disposal to solve their problems. The ones who are incredibly clever aren't simply smart because of the reason you stated, but rather because they spend time considering the best way to use their tools and have a natural mind for improvisation.
