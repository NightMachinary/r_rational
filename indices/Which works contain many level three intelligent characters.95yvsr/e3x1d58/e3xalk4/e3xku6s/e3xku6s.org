I very much agree with your post and for anyone who sincerely believes the original post spoiler I would urge them to actually compare the actions that characters make throughout the story with their respective personalities and motivations. I can easily imagine each of the characters to act in the ways that they do without any underlying mental influence to rob them of their agency. Hell the latest chapter of Ward even addresses this misconception directly by stating that there is little evidence to show direct mental manipulation in parahumans

Worm is more about realism than anything else which I suspect is why it sometimes gets criticized in this subreddit for not being rationalist. The story never focuses on or flaunts the intellects of the characters, but simply expresses them in a believable way corresponding to the characters.
