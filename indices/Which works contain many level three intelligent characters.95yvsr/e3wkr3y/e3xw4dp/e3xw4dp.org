I have tried it, and liked it a lot. The only issue is I stopped a few dozen chapters in, and it's now very hard to find my place because of the looping.

Planning to wait until it's finished.

I also enjoyed The Good Student, for similar reasons to Mother Of Learning, but am waiting for that to be completed too.

I agree with your thoughts on House, most of his "insites" were based on weird coincidences. And now I think about it, most of his commentary is Straw manning.
