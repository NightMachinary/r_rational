Dr. House and Sherlock Holmes are both the "writer faking character intelligence by giving the character random insights" type of intelligent, neither one of them is level 3 intelligent.

Have you tried Mother of Learning? I've only read the first two chapters and it was quite a while ago (I'm waiting for the whole thing to be finished so I can read it all in one go), but I remember thinking that the main character had somewhat of an HJPEVish sort of vibe to him.
