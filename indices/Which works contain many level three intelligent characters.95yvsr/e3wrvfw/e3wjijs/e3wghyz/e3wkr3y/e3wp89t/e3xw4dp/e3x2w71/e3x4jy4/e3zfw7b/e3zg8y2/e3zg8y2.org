I figured it'd be something like that. That's pretty similar to how the writers tried to convey "genius" in House, too, minus the /usually/ total bullshit part (though it /was/ sometimes, especially in later seasons when the patients and illnesses started getting more extreme to keep the medical part of the show interesting).
