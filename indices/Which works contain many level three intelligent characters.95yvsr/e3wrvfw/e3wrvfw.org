  Sherlock Holmes and Artemis Fowl are other obvious examples (if they can be called level three intelligent).

Funny you should mention Holmes, because in [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][the essay where Yudkowsky defines level 3 intelligent characters]], he specifically points to Sherlock Holmes as a /negative/ example:

  But when you look at what Sherlock Holmes does - you can't go out and do it at home. Sherlock Holmes is not really operating by any sort of reproducible method. He is operating by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction. Maybe it's just me, but it seems to me that reading Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise. Holmes is a mutant superhero.

The Ender's Shadow series/"Bean Quartet" is pretty good about having a large cast of intelligent characters that have to deal with real challenges using limited resources. One thing that comes up several times throughout the series are scenarios where two parties have no way to communicate/coordinate, but they manage to arrive at a sort of Schelling point by thinking, "Okay, the person I'm trying to coordinate with is a smart person, so all I have to do right now is think 'what would a smart person do in their situation' and I'll have a pretty good idea of what their plan is and what they need me to do in order for it to succeed."

In Shadow of the Hegemon, this happens when one person in captivity is trying to communicate messages to the outside world without their captors knowing. The prisoner has to use a messaging method subtle and hidden enough that the captors won't detect it, and the rescuer has to both locate and decipher that message without ever having been told where to look for it. Shadow of the Hegemon has three main viewpoint characters, and all of them are intelligent. There's a similar case in Shadow of the Giant, where one character (who is ostensibly an honored guest, but is actually little more than a glorified prisoner) has to "communicate" his escape plan to the rescuer in plain view of the captors -- of course, because he's being watched, the only "communication" that really takes place here is "you're here at my behest, now figure out what I want you to do," and the rescuer has to deduce the fact that the prisoner is actually being held against his will, that he has a plan for escape, and the plan's nature soon becomes evident when answering the question "what plan would I devise if I were a captive smart person trying to coordinate with another smart person?"

One of the other things that the Bean Quartet is also good about doing is showing how intelligent characters can still have epistemic blind spots (usually places where they rely too heavily on heuristics), and then showing how they go about recognizing and overcoming those blind spots, and also diagnosing how they developed those blind spots to avoid repeating similar patterns of thinking in the future. So in that sense, there's actually a sense of "learning to be smarter," rather than simply being a story of "smart people doing smart things," even though the characters are all really intelligent to begin with. Another theme of the books is that being a rational person does not make you immune to irrational impulses, even when you recognize that those impulses are irrational. For example, knowing "it would be irrational for me to gloat right now" does not magically remove your desire to gloat, and knowing the methods of psychological warfare that your captors are using against you does not magically make you immune to the psychological torment. The characters are smart, and a big part of being smart is trying to figure out how to deal with the limitations of being human.
