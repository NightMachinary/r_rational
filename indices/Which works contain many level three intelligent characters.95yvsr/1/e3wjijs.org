I don't think any of the characters you cited are level 3 intelligent, by EZ's definition. At best they're level 2. (and EZ's description of level 3 intelligent was kind of vague, actually).

/Animorphs The Reckoning/ and /Glimwarden/ are often cited as having multiple protagonists with different perspective, who are all just as important, smart and interesting. Unfortunately, both of them are in hiatus right now.
