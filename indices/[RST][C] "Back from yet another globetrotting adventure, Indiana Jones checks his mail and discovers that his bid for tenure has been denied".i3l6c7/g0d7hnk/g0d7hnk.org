This is unrealistic. Dr. Jones clearly /already/ has tenure. Who would risk their professorship by going gallivanting, unless you had tenure already?

Now, given that he's violating professional standards of archaeology left and right, there could be a very plausible hearing on /stripping/ his tenure from him, but he obviously already has it.
