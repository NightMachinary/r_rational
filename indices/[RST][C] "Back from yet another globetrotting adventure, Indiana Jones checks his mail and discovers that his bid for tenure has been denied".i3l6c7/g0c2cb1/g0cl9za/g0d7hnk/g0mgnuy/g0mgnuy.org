I got tired of reading this after a couple paragraphs. It's not rational so much as a circlejerk of one.

Most of the really self-congratulatory burns are things that should be assumed to take place off-screen. Paperwork is one example they keep harping on. You have not one shred of evidence he owns the artifact on display, besides of course the word of the person in charge of the building where they're on display? Gasp. Have you tried checking with the records office? No, I guess he should have sharpied his name on the stuff instead. Of course the worst part of this letter is the nonprofessional tone. Anyone who's set foot in an academic lab knows you don't leave evidence of behaving less than stuffy and formal, because someone who wields a black pen for a living might think to check on you otherwise and find out what really goes on back there.
