I always felt that at a certain point, given his exploits, Indiana Jones would be used as a celebrity professor used purely as advertisement for their history/linguistics department.

Instead of being a teacher of a course requirement, it would be a 1 credit class pass/fail class (really just lectures whenever he feels like it) where students sign up for the possibility of bring taught by The Indiana Jones.
