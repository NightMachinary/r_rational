Seeing the danger that the magnetite posed, humans must spend some effort in either capturing or killing the really powerful Pokemon around their cities and regions. IRL humans are known to kill off lots of large predator populations that pose even a small risk to people in cities or other settlements; when those animals are dramatically more dangerous, the incentive to do the same would only be greater. Imagine if an onix got an equivalent of rabies. It could level a city block before anyone could even be mobilized to fight it. Maybe the rangers do periodic sweeps to capture/kill any of the dangerous evolved Pokemon in an area? This could also help to reduce the danger of Stormbringer rampages, if the average danger of each Pokemon in the stampede is lower.

I don't think the effort would necessarily be worth it for the numerous Pokemon that never get that powerful, like Beedrill or rattatta. But sweeping caves out for larvitar or pupitar before they can become tyranitar could be practical.

There's also a market-like negative feedback loop where trainers are incentivized to go and capture powerful Pokemon where they're most numerous, decreasing the danger and increasing the power a trainer can bring to bear. Years of this system could produce the world we currently see in Origin of Species, where the extremely powerful Pokemon haven't killed off and outcompeted all the weaker one: those really powerful Pokemon get taken out of the gene pool pretty quickly whenever humans set up shop nearby.
