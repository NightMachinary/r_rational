From what we've seen of wildlife left to its own devices in this world it seems as though most pokemon tend to work in symbiotic systems (like the pineco's just hanging out with a vespiqueen's nest) so that pokemon culling pokemon tends to stray more towards the rare side. As for humans, I could see some effort being put in to eliminating especially dangerous or erratic pokemon to protect the wildlife and civilizations that would be effected. Although, depending on how much of a burden these pokemon naturally put on their ecosystems, it might be possible that there just aren't enough of them out there to naturally throw things out of balance without some crazy catalyst.
