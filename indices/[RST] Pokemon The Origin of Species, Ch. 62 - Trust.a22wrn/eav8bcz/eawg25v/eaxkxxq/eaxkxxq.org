  Doesn't seem that way. Seems like its the weakest pokemon that would get captured the most, because they're the easiest to do so with. Look at how hard it was for the team to get Absol.

I'm not sure this is necessarily true. We follow the perspective of people who have been trainers for less than a year. Trainers who already have a good selection of Pokemon may decide not to go for weaker Pokemon at all, because even though they're easier to catch, it would either take too much effort or not even be possible to train them up to a usable state. Except for people who have a reason to own weak Pokemon like gym leaders, I would expect most trainers with a few years under their belt to skip the easy to catch rattatta for something more powerful or exotic. Time spent training a rattatta or Pidgey up to a usable state is time not spent training something like a Alakazam or Gyrados.

We're also seeing the world after my hypothetical historical changes. Young trainers would have an easier time catching the powerful Pokemon when they were more common, and they would want to catch them because they are stronger.

Then again my original post is just speculation and may be either based on wrong/incomplete data or flawed in some way. There isn't a good way to tell until the author confirms or denies it in or out of story.
