  Trainers who already have a good selection of Pokemon may decide not to go for weaker Pokemon at all

But even experienced trainers and rangers were getting messed up by the Absol. I'm not saying that trainers with 5 pages are still going to be catching pidgey, but I do think it would pretty hard for them to catch an Alakazam or a Gyarados. And even then, they are going to end up catching the weaker Alakazam and Gyarados. Because the stronger ones probably won't get caught.

  Then again my original post is just speculation and may be either based on wrong/incomplete data or flawed in some way. There isn't a good way to tell until the author confirms or denies it in or out of story.

Well the nice thing about reading a rationalist fiction is that we can use ration to speculate pretty effectively. The author clearly intends to design a world that makes sense, so we just extrapolate what would make sense based on the information given.
