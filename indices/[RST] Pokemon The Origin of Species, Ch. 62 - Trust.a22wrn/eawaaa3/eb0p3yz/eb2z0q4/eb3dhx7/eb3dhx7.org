I have to agree with you on most of those points. I didn't take into account flight as a factor and the personal dimensions the Sinnoh Legends live in.

However, what we should keep in mind is the power gap which exists between the lesser legendaries (birds, beasts, regis) and the greater legendaries (Ho-Oh, Lugia, Rayquaza). We haven't seen or heard of any of them yet in the story, but I could imagine the gap between the two being massive, just like the one between legendaries and regular mons in this fic. Something to keep in mind is that Pokemon like Snorlax and Arcanine have a closer Base-Stat Total to the birds than the birds do to Lugia.

This isn't even taking into account Pseudo-Legends, for which Hoenn certainly gets the short end of the stick.
