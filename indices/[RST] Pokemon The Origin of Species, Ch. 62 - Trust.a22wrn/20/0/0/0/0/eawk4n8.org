Ok :)

First, a matter of levelling the field: you referred to "externally verifiable" evidence twice. However, if that really is what's required - What evidence could Leaf present in a courtroom to prove that Red is trustworthy? Could she bring enough to convince any fair minded but moderately skeptical individual that they are obligated to trust him implicitly, as she does?

There's his actions in providing Abra to help the community at below market rates. But as she's already seen from the online discussions, it's not hard for someone to suspect ulterior motives there, like gathering money with one hand and popularity with the other. Moreover, since she did the same, any effort to paint that as evidence of good character has a conflict of interest.

She's seen him hesitate to condemn Yuuta to death as a renegade, but was that because he's compassionate, or just because he was put on the spot? Or was he actually involved somehow? Not strong evidence to an impartial third party.

He's always been nice to her. But as she now knows, he has a crush on her, so that may not have been entirely unselfish, nor reflect his usual character.

And that crush leads into another point: she found out about it because he used his psychic powers to transmit that emotion to her. She has spent months in the company of a psychic who specializes in mimicking and projecting emotional states - and coincidentally enough, she feels inclined to completely trust him! That would go down great in cross-examination, I'm sure.

And both Leaf and Red have shown a willingness to flatly lie to authority figures when it suits their purposes, as on the SS Anne.

As far as I can see, she would have very little evidence that might convince a neutral external party to trust Red.

Is her own trust, then, irrational and naive? Or does she, rather, have sufficient valid evidence for herself, which nonetheless is not externally verifiable?
