I've never found an answer as to why faith (in the sense you are using it as distinguished from trust) is a useful epistemology when it so clearly gives different results to different people. If we make the basic assumption that other people in the world are living in the same world that we are, and that they aren't projections from an alternate universe or something, and the basic assumption that the universe is internally consistent, I don't know why using the process of faith gives wildly different answers as to the nature of the universe dependent upon the person's culture and personal beliefs. Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Pagans of all flavors, etc. all have mutually contradictory theories on the basic structure of the universe, or at least in the governing intelligence of the universe, but all claim to use the same methodology to arrive at different conclusions, and usually without room for much doubt.

I remember a conversation I had with this nice couple that were going around my University trying to convert people to their branch of Christianity. Part of the conversation revolved around how their evidence for their flavor of Christianity is their deep personal conviction in the truth of their interpretation of the Bible, how good they feel when they contemplate their faith, various statements of that nature. From someone who isn't currently feeling those things, why should I take their personal feelings as evidence for their religion any more seriously than the all but identical feelings that people of wildly different beliefs have for their religion? I think concluding that all but one group of people is lying about their feelings would be a good way to start a holy war. So other than the fact that I live in an area where my neighbors happen to be Christian instead of Muslim or Hindu or anything else, why should I convert to this one sect over another when they all give the exact same evidence for their version of reality? I can't reach into their head and verify these feelings, and I rather heavily suspect that they aren't lying about them even if I could.

My conclusion, that I've held for a long time but haven't always been able to verbalize, is that faith is not a good method of epistemology. Even aside from any religious mutual contradictions, I think it's telling that by and large people and institutions need hard evidence before reaching a conclusion. Courts do not or at least should not convict or release people based on the personal feelings of witnesses. Policy generally is not and should not be decided on someone's personal conviction in the absence of externally verifiable events/records. If my toilet or sink isn't working, I do not meditate on the problem, then fix the problem immediately after correctly convincing myself of the problem's true source through personal conviction. I troubleshoot, or in other words I look at things, although experience can tell me which source problems are more or less likely ahead of time. Applying faith in these curcumstances, although logically consistent with the religious faith that most people claim to possess, seems absurd.
