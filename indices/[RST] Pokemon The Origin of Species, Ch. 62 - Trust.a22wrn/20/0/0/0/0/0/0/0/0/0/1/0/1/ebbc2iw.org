  I'm curious to know what makes you think /you/ or your denomination of religion got it right and they're all the ones who got the question of religion wrong, when they're probably using the exact same criteria as you?

Well, there are several possible answers to this :). But I should first clarify: my church is neither "all roads lead to heaven" nor "agree with me or burn." The first option makes no sense when different beliefs contradict each other, and the second doesn't make sense when millions of people live and die without even having /heard/ of 99.9% of religions - it would hardly be fair, let alone merciful, and most of those exclusive religions insist that God is both.

Rather, our view is that our time on Earth, while very important, is not by any means the end of our period of testing and probation. There will continue to be preaching and decisions made in the spirit world after death, and before anyone is resurrected and judged, s/he will have heard the gospel and had full opportunity to accept or reject it.

So, while we do believe that God has revealed important things to us that most churches reject, there's nothing that won't be revealed to everyone eventually. Wanting to share those things is just about doing our part.

That said, the "why do I believe?" mostly hinges on the Book of Mormon. Externally, it's a remarkable volume that could not plausibly have been written by a barely educated young adult in 19th century rural New York. Personally, I've found its contents to be both a very insightful life guide, and also a great source of clarification of Biblical passages that divide and confuse many Christians. Internally, I have prayed to ask God whether it's true, and distinctly felt an answer - although I recognize that this proves nothing to you, and that you are likely to think me mistaken.
