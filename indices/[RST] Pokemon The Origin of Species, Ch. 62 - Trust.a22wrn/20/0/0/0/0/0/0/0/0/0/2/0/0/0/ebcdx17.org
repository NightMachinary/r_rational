I think you're still missing what constitutes "good evidence." You're including unverifiable personal experiences, and my assertion is that a rational epistemology for understanding what's true about reality puts such things very, very low on the totem pole, because it's trivially easy to find examples of how people have been convinced of false things by genuine feelings they have had.
