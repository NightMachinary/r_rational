I specifically prefer to use the word "trust" opposed to "faith" to keep them distinct, personally. Leaf knows Red and has been through a lot with him. Her trust is based on first hand experiences.

If someone tried to apply the above criteria to someone they've never met before, or someone who they've only learned about through some piece of media (particularly media biased toward that person), we wouldn't commend their trust, we'd consider them misguided or naive. The whole idea of faith only really makes sense when it's specifically about unjustified trust/confidence in someone.

Needless to say, I dislike faith and think it's net-harmful for most people and for society. I don't think that means people shouldn't trust each other, though: only that they should base that trust on something rational and meaningful.
