Cool chapter, although I think something is not leting me enjoy it as much as it deserves. It could be the voice in my head screaming "I WANT TO SEE ZAPDOS ALREADY".

Still, I love the apocalyptic feel these legendary pokemon bring. Just their literal presence is enought to bring chaos. You are amazing at showing the mon part of pokemon. This situation is terrifying. And to think many of us wished as children for pokemon to exist.

At least Red and Leaf are been able to manage, even if it is with so much pain and deaths. And probably permanent mental trauma (not even accounting for pressure added damage). But hey, at least their relationship is growing. We shippers are content. Just don't kill them before the confession.

I also like how pressure, like dementors in hpmor, is the biggest fear of any rationalist protag: a power able to deprive them of their reason. Does it count as a trope?
