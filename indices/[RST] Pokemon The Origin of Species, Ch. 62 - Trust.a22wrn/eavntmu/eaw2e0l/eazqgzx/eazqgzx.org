That is and interesting distinction. I can agree with the idea that baseless faith is naive and harmful, but I think it is possible to have faith based on reason and knowlenge enought to fit your definition of trust. Although obviously I will always be heavily biased and think "but my faith is the based enough one". Still, I feel like a talk with you about religion and faith would be quite interesting
