Ok, looking at dictionary.reference.com, the #1 definition for "faith" is "confidence or trust in a person or thing." That's how I use it, and in my view it's also how the Bible, for example, uses it.

Now, the #2 definition sounds more like how you've defined it, "belief that is not based on proof." Interestingly enough, the example given actually refers to having faith that a hypothesis will pan out - which works just fine, in my opinion, because presumably your next step is to test it and get a definitive answer.

Moreover, the definitions of "trust" don't say anything about evidence either. They talk about reliance and confident expectation, but there is no sign that evidence is a necessary part of the definition. If your confidence is groundless and foolishly misplaced, it apparently still counts as "trust".

So I think that the distinction you've drawn between the two does not correctly reflect their usage.

If you've had to deal with people who deal with ignorance by clinging to belief, then I can understand wanting to distinguish their attitude from the scientific approach of dealing with ignorance through investigation and discovery. But I don't think that trying to separate the synonyms "faith" and "trust" is the best approach. Perhaps it would be better to ask such people why they haven't asked God for more insight, as Matthew 7:7 and James 1:5 recommend.
