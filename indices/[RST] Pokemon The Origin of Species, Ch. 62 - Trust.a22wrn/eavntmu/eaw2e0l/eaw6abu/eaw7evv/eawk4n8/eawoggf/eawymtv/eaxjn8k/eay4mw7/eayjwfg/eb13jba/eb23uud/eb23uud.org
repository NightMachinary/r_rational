It's convenient that God wants us to "think for ourselves" now that there's not a smidgen of externally verifiable evidence for him, as opposed to in biblical times when he apparently thought the extraordinary evidence was a good idea. I wonder what changed his mind? Also, since education and intelligence are correlating more and more with agnosticism and atheism as times goes on, God apparently wants us to think ourselves into disbelief, which seems like the kind of God I could respect, if I ever had any reason to believe he existed in the first place :P

And call me crazy, but I'd rather people end up in heaven than be left to follow their reason and end up in hell or divorced from God's love or whatever. I'm guessing you don't believe that happens, which is surely a nicer world to imagine we live in, but I have no idea what makes you think your beliefs are /right/ or /true./ Maybe you were raised to believe that there's no penalty for getting the question of God wrong. Maybe you just found the idea of people going to Hell distasteful and decided not to believe in it. I really have no idea, and that's a problem with this conversation: your epistemology seems to be missing the answers to some obvious questions.

For example, since something like 70%+ of the world's religious population seems pretty clearly on the side of "If you don't believe in God, or even if you don't believe in OUR version of God, you lose your chance at eternal salvation/bliss," I'm curious to know what makes you think /you/ or your denomination of religion got it right and they're all the ones who got the question of religion wrong, when they're probably using the exact same criteria as you?

What do you think you know, and why do you think you know it?
