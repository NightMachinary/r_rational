Further to my "miracles" comment below: I would like to make a case that "empirically verifiable" evidence, while very useful for investigating impersonal forces, is missing an important part of the picture when it comes to personal relationships - which most Christians will attest is the nature of our relationship with God. Specifically, there can be evidence that is sufficient to convince an individual, but cannot be demonstrated to others.

Consider two scenarios:

1) Alice is having a rough day. Her friend Bob calls to check how she's doing, and after talking things out, she feels better. Her friendship with Bob is strengthened, and her trust in him increases.

2) Bob is having a rough day. He opens the Bible, and after reading passages like "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world," he feels comforted and at peace. He feels that God has spoken to him through these passages, and his trust in God increases.

Now, these two scenarios are really very similar. Both relationships are being built up via essentially the same process. But if we require evidence to be verifiable, especially externally verifiable, then we must entirely dismiss the second scenario - even though it operates on largely the same principles as the first - because we, as external observers, cannot tell what Bob actually experienced, whether it was a real communication or imagined.

Thus, I assert that it is at least theoretically possible for someone to have good evidence, for themselves, that cannot be proved to anyone else.
