  Oh, miracles haven't ceased.
#+end_quote

Do you have any good evidence of this? If not, what do you think you know and why do you think you know it?

#+begin_quote
  So, today, what extraordinary things are being asked of us, that would require extraordinary evidence?
#+end_quote

The occurrence of past miracles are still extraordinary claims. The assurance of life after death is a /massive/ extraordinary claim. The existence of an all-powerful deity is similarly so. I don't understand why you think that a claim made in the past would be extraordinary and thus require extraordinary evidence, but claims made in the present about the past should not.

  Being invited to pray, to read the Bible, to try attending church, does not impose much cost on us
#+end_quote

On the contrary, they impose massive costs on us. You're talking about hours of time spent every week on activities that /may/ carry intrinsic value for some, but definitely do not for everyone.
