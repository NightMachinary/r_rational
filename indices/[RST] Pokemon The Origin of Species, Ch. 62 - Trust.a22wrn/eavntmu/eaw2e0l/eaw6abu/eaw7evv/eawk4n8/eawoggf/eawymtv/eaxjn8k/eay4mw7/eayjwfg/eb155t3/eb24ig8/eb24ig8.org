Sorry, but your understanding of what constitutes good evidence seems really strange to me. You're arguing that people's experiences influence their beliefs. Sure, of course. But the question isn't "what makes someone feel confident in their belief," it's "what makes someone distinguish beliefs they're confident in from ones that are /true?/"

If all someone cares about when trying to find out what's true is what /feels/ true or good, they don't actually care about what's /actually/ true, and have no method of actually learning and confirming it when faced with people who disagree by the same internal experiences.

Consider the following scenarios:

1) Bob is having a rough day. He opens the Bible, and after reading passages like "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world," he feels comforted and at peace. He feels that God has spoken to him through these passages, and his trust in God increases.

2) Alice is having a rough day. She throws some salt over her shoulder, leaves milk out her front door, and hangs a dream catcher over her bed before she goes to sleep. The next day she feels better. Alice feels that the positive spirits/fae folk/her ancestors have come to help her, and her trust in them increases.

What's the difference between these two situations, on the level of "knowing what's true about the world?"

Furthermore, imagine Bob's brother gets comfort from the passages in the bible about how sinners will have death and eternal punishment (Romans 6:23 and Matthew 25:46), which Bob doesn't take literally and believes aren't true. Is that the same God that's speaking to Bob's brother? How does he know? Because both may feel equally like they've been spoken to by God through these passages, and now you're at exactly the problem with relying on personal relationships to determine what's true about the world: people's feelings contradict each other while still feeling genuine and true, and the experiences that lead to those feelings can be direct opposites.

It gets even worse when you look at the history of religious warfare. If God is the actual source of that feeling of comfort, if that's the sign of a "personal relationship," why is God also giving it to people who believe in things like, say, murdering those who claim to receive it from other holy books or even other passages?
