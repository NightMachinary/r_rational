Yep, and this is where many progressive religious folk will say something like "there are many paths to God" or "everyone's spiritual journey is different" and ignore the parts of their Holy Books that pretty much all explicitly say that no, actually, this is really the one way to worship the True God, and you /have/ to have faith in /their version/ of that God.

Don't get me wrong, I much prefer the "no one's right or wrong" religious folk to the "you're going to burn in hell" ones. But it's pretty frustrating how logically inconsistent their internal maps for reality are when it comes to religion vs everything else.
