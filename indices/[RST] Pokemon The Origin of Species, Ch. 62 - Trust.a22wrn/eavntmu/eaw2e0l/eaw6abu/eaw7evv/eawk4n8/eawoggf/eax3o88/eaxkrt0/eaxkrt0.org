This is a semantic problem in society, yes. The dictionary reflects that by using synonyms in its initial definition without attempting to disambiguate /actually different concepts./

Words are just labels we stick to ideas or clusters of ideas. It doesn't matter if everyone on earth used Trust/Faith/Confidence interchangeably, there would still be concepts that need to be differentiated.

Concept 1 is "Has seen sufficient impersonal empirical evidence in something to act as though that thing is true."

Concept 2 is "Has felt sufficient personal experiences with something to act as thought that thing is true."

There are many other concepts between and around these, but if we don't have words to differentiate them, both reason and communication suffer.

  Perhaps it would be better to ask such people why they haven't asked God for more insight, as Matthew 7:7 and James 1:5 recommend.

I think you're under the impression that only those religious people who are ignorant of science or reason make this mistake. I see it /all the time/ when talking with smart and educated religious people who use faith interchangeably with what I mean when I say trust/confidence, until we get to the nitty-gritty of their epistemology and they ultimately admit that their faith is about belief /without evidence or logic/ or even /in spite of evidence or logic./
