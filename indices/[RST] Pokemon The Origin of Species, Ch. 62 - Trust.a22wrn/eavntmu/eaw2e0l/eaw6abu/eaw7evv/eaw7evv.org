  Ok, but I think we're defining faith differently, then, because my understanding of it is practically synonymous with trust.

I think a lot of people use the two interchangeably, and it's something that bothers me on a clear-communication level. If people talk about trust/confidence in a way that indicates "there are good externally verifiable reasons to predict how this thing/person will act," then they're not talking about what most religious people mean when they say faith, which is usually something more like "I know this is the thing I'm supposed to do/believe regardless of what the evidence says (and maybe it feels good to do so) so I will."

  Most Christians I know (and I'm guessing most Muslims too) would assert that they do indeed have a personal relationship with God, based on experiences, despite the lack of face time.

Then they're still using the words "personal relationship" different from the way they would if describing someone in their life who they would decide to give their trust to or have blind faith in. It really is a matter of clearing up the language to show the difference: no matter what internal experiences makes someone feel justified in their faith in God, the lack of externally verifiable interactions still marks it as separate from "trust/confidence" in non-supernatural things.

  If you do want to discuss whether that implicit trust, "I believe you have a good reason even if it doesn't make sense to me," is based on sufficient evidence in a religious context, then ok, we could do that, but it may be a bit off topic here.

I'm fine with having that discussion, here or elsewhere :) Just wanted to clarify that I think there's good reason to distinguish them, though I do appreciate your original intent in describing the similarity to the religious goal state.
