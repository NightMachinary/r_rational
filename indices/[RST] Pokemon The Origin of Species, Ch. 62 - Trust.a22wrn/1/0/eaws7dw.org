tbh I can't remember where half of these pokemon got caught. It's only really a handful that really feel like a part of the team to me. It's making me feel bad about all those pokemon I caught that I never really gave a second chance to. :(

If it wasn't for the fact that it would be incredibly boring, I could see Leaf resolving to give up being a trainer after this to become a nurse. With how guilty she seems to feel about not being able to help she may do away with training altogether to pursue a more direct line to her goals. As for Red, I agree that he'll definitely reconsider the value of being able to fight against pokemon, although I don't know if that will lead to him wanting to become a battler any more or less since his methods of fighting tend to rely more on clever thinking and use of the environment than his skillfulness as a trainer. Can't wait to see him mind merge with his future charizard into battle like boss though.
