Recently binged the entire thing over the course of a few days. I love it! Rediscovering this world you've recast to be more realistic is making me feel the same way I did the first time I played the games.

I especially love the way you've handled legendaries. It makes me wonder, if Kanto's Trio are constantly surrounded by storms and they don't even have the weather abilities in the game, what would the storm following a pokemon like Kyogre look like, or even worse, its primal reversion? Anyway, these antagonists you've created as pure, untouchable forces of nature are just epic to watch. I hope Red and Blue end up doing something cool about it. (also, calling it now, this world's "master ball" is mounted on some kind of surface-to-air missile)
