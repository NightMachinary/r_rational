Excellent chapter as always. Quick question though. We know that in Kanto, the citizens have to deal with the Legendary Bird trio constantly causing casualties. In your story, do other regions have similar issues with their legendary Pok√©mon? Do Sinnoh natives have to watch out for waves of attacks from Heatran or Darkrai nightmare epidemics? Do the people of Alola have to be constantly wary of their Island deities going on a rampage, or an extra-terrestrial attack from UBs? Just curious how unique Kanto's situation is compared to other regions in your stories' world.
