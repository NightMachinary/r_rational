I'm digging the introduction of magneton, and glad leaf has one now.

My favorite pokemon are always the ones that are just bizarre or not based on any animal i.e. magneton, chandelure, klinklang, cofagrigus, zurkitree.

Also made that magneton feel like a salient threat; I like how different it gets when dealing with something seriously powerful. It's also interesting that it's leaf that has it now, since it's something that's mostly good at blasting away with raw power, which is something she's generally reluctant to do. I predict she'll either trade it, or maybe this experience will nudge her in the direction of knowing that sometimes, even though it's unpleasant, you have to act in an extreme and decisive way, and her coming to train her magneton would be an interesting expression of that.
