Spectacular as always, especially for Leaf's character. I'm so relieved that she's acknowledging the mistakes she made in ch. 58, and learning things about herself in the process. Her realization that she /needed/ to sac something during the fight, and that something needed to be a less "important" pokemon...ouch. That's already a tough decision to make, and I can't imagine how disgusted Leaf is going to be with herself later. I hope Red can help her through it.

Speaking of which, poor Red, as always. I hope he can get into the hospital with all limbs intact so he can maybe try and not get horribly traumatized by how far he's pushing his powers + the fact that I'm pretty sure he /felt/ someone die? Same thing with Leaf, jesus christ. I do not envy her for walking into an apartment and finding a dead mother and child. I hope Joy's eye injury can get fixed, but it's chilling that she's out for the rest of the fight, considering how useful Sing is.
