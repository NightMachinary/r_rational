Alright cool. So to start with:

#+begin_quote
  Have you actually met many people who claimed to believe for no reason at all? Because I find the idea quite strange.
#+end_quote

No of course not, they all insist they have reasons to believe their faith is justified, they're just really bad at recognizing why it's not until they're boxed into a logical corner. /That's/ when the idea of faith as just "something you believe even if it doesn't make logical sense" comes out. And if you think you don't do this, then you may be the first religious person I've ever met to not, and I'm happy to find out, but keep in mind what I said earlier: there are about 11 different paths I've found will consistently get a Christian in specific to admit that their beliefs ultimately require blind faith, without even resorting to solipsism.

  Jesus was definitely in the "build trust through experience" camp.
#+end_quote

That's certainly one narrative. Here's the other:

John 20:29 /Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."/

2 Corinthians 5:7 /For we walk by faith, not by sight./

Also, just kind of being a dick to non-believers, Matthew 13:10-13 /Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand./

It's always a dangerous game turning to scripture to prove one's preferred interpretation of religion. I can assure you that those Christians who disagree with your beliefs about the nature of faith can find many such reasons to justify it and insist that faith without evidence, even in spite of evidence, is quite clearly the correct path.

#+begin_quote
  The pattern all through his life was that when someone took a leap of faith, putting their trust in him, they were rewarded with miracles.
#+end_quote

And yet, to give an example of what I said above, I've met smart, educated Catholics who say that of course their beliefs are based on evidence, and when I asked why all the evidence they listed is impossible to verify, why not just go back to miracles (since those were pretty effective at convincing people in the biblical times), they then said that miracles are not necessary for faith because otherwise it wouldn't be /faith,/ or that focusing on miracles is missing the point which is to "just believe," or even that the miracles are metaphorical. There was some disagreement about this from the Catholics in this particular group. This is not uncommon, in my experience. There is no denomination or subsect of a religion I have ever met that did not have disagreements about what's actually true about their religious beliefs.

In any case, whether the miracles were meant to be empirically verifiable evidence, as you seem to imply they were, to reward trusting in the Jesus hypothesis, or just metaphors for the rewards those with faith will receive, either way, there's no big and obvious miracles around these days, so we're left with what seems to be a God who agrees with the idea that some blind faith is necessary BEFORE any evidence is given, and then doesn't reward people in any clear and obvious way, thus requiring MORE blind faith to be maintained.

This:

#+begin_quote
  Faith might begin that way, as unfounded trust, but it's supposed to develop, through being acted upon, into trust based on experience... if you have even a tiny spark of hope and desire to build a new friendship, and if you have the courage to step outside your comfort zone and act on it, then you get a result that will either confirm your hope, or deflate it.
#+end_quote

Is a rather silly thing to say, considering how many ex-religious people there are who used to have faith in God and loved God with all their hearts and wanted to continue to, but lost their faith when it became more and more clear that no such evidence was forthcoming. I'm not sure what the "deflate it" outcome you're envisioning is, but it seems like you're saying it's a crapshoot which will occur, even if you do everything right.
