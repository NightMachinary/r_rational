I wouldn't say that miracles are missing the point, necessarily. Jesus made some extraordinary claims, which require extraordinary evidence. However, I do think that God wants us to think for ourselves, to make choices without it being obvious that He's looking over our shoulders. If we were surrounded by flashy and obvious and undeniable evidence of God's existence, then we would have an even bigger problem of people blindly obeying. Arguably it would even be the logical thing to do; if there's a being of brilliant light and cosmic power standing in front of you, and s/he tells you to jump, it makes sense to ask "How high?" Possibly while already in the air.

By remaining largely unseen and subtle, we are instead left to have discussions like this one, to talk things out and use our own powers of reasoning and observation. We learn more from this than we would from walking behind a visible deity.

A quick reversal test: if I were in the presence of a visible, obvious, undeniable God, would I choose to instead enter a state of isolation in order to learn by my own experience? My church's doctrine says yes, that's exactly what happened, we were with God before we were born, and upon learning of this opportunity we were excited at the chance for personal growth.
