Not really, Johto wouldn't be too bad: the beasts don't fly and Lugia seems to be aquatic. Not really sure what Celebi would do though.\\
Hoen might actually have it the easiest: Deoxys is the only native legendary with pressure (and I'm not sure if Deoxys is actually native), though Kyogre and Groudon made as powerful as legendaries in this fic would be utterly terrifying on their own if they're not asleep (Rayquaza and the Regis would obviously be dangerous, but at least they don't play havoc with the climate).\\
Sinnoh could be anywhere from hell on earth to fairly average: on the one hand you could have Palkia, Dialga, Giratine, Arceus, Darkrai, Cresselia, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Shaymin, Regigigas and Heatran all in one region, on the other most of those may well be absent: Regigigas hiding somehwere undergroud asleep, Dialga and Palkia don't really seem to be part of the normal world most of the time, Giratina lives in the distortion world, Uxie, Azelf and Mesprit are sleeping lakes, Arceus is never around and I think Shaymin are limited in what enviroments can sustain them, That just leaves you with Darkrai's nightmares, Heatran's volcano stuff and whatever Cresselia does.
