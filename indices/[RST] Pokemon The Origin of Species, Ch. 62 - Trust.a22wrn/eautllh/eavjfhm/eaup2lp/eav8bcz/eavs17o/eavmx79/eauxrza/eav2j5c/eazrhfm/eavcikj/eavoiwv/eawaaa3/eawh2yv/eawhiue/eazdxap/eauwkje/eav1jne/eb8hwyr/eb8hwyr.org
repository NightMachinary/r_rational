You know, I hope we don't even see the battle with Zapdos, just tangentially learn about it through Blue's eyes. Legendary pokemon feel more and more like Eldritch beings powerful in ways incomprehensible. Affecting the mind with Pressure miles away.

As for Red and Leaf, I'm worried this will end up making them codependent. Honestly I thought Red would be safer from pressure with his partition shields but constantly using abilities seems to be wearing him down faster than anyone else.

I'm also very very worried about Leaf making assumptions about her mind being altered by Red. Causing even more distrust, and pulling them emotionally apart. Then all it would take is Red reading her while she feels distrust toward him and he'll be devastated.

Ohh! Speaking of reading, Mewtwo! Where is our best boi? I really really want him to meet Red, what would he make of that Partition? Perhaps be surprised at independent discoveries of similar techniques for hiding the mind?

More than Legendary battles, while I look forward to immensely, I was to see Mewtwo explore the world.
