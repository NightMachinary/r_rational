Well first off, the standard of a courtroom isn't necessary. As far as I'm aware no one acts or expects others to act on such a high standard of verification for their personal relationships. A courtroom is designed as an adversarial system: it's right and proper for people to nitpick, question motives, question intent, etc. But when people make friends and decide to trust each other, it's not about convincing other people that the person they're friends with or trust are "genuinely selfless" or any such impossible metric. It's just about being able to point to actions taken and efforts made that built their trust in them.

Like if a friend helped you move, you could be suspicious that they only did it so you could help them move at some point in the future, or to win your trust so they can come rob you, or something. There are plenty of people who do think that way. But I think most people would accept it as /weak evidence/ that they may be a good friend who cares about your well being.

Then maybe that friend drives out to give your car a start when your battery dies. And another time they bring you some food when you're sick. And another time they apologize first for an argument the two of you get into.

There is no way to externally verify that they actually care about your well-being and values. But you would probably start to trust them regardless, and if someone asked you why and you mentioned things like that, they would have to be pretty cynical to say "Well that doesn't /prove/ anything, they could just be playing the long con!"

They'd also be missing the point. Because it's not about "proof." It's about sufficient externally verifiable events, and what those mean /to you./ No one can /know/ what's in someone else's heart, or else the whole concept of trust would be meaningless.

For Leaf, the things you're listing that Red did are a start, but she has also seen him work hard to update his beliefs, seen him promise to try restricting his pokemon diet to align with her values, seen him put his fear aside to help strangers. None of this is proof that he's a good person, and you could dismiss a lot of the things he does toward her in specific by "well he has a crush on her." But why does that matter? She still has to make a decision to trust or not trust him. What other criteria should she use?

Sure, it's /possible/ that he's not actually a good person or doesn't actually care about her. But by any metric through which such a decision can be made, externally verifiable actions that continually benefit her and others makes it /probable enough/ that he's a good person for her to feel justified in placing trust in him.

Everyone has a different threshold for that, of course, but the criteria in a rational framework is the same.

By contrast, if Alice declares their deep trust in Bob and justifies it by saying things like "It's just this feeling I have when we're together" or "It's just the experience of being with him" or "When I talk to him I just feel so [positive emotion]," what all these have in common is they're about internal feelings, not specific, externally verifiable actions that may result from Bob's character or feelings.

A third party observer may /understand/ such a decision, because feelings aren't in our control and often influence our perspectives and actions, but rationally speaking it's easy to see why, on their own and without specific tangible actions, trust based on just those feelings might lead to bad outcomes, and has many times for many people.

(I'm ignoring the psychic thing for now because it's irrelevant to the difference of what makes up faith-based feelings of "trust" and non-faith based ones, meaning even if someone is using psychic powers on you, if you can't know it you'd still either be able to point to external events or not be able to, and one would still be more justified than the other)

Does that make sense?
