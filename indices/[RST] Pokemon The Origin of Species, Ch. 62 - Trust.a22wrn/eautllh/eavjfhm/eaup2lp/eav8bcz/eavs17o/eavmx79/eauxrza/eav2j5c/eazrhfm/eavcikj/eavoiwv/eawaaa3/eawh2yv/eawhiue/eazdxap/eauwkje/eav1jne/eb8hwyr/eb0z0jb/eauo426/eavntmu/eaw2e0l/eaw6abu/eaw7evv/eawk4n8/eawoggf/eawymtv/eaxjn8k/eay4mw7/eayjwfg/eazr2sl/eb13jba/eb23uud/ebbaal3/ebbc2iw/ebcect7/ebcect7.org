  There will continue to be preaching and decisions made in the spirit world after death, and before anyone is resurrected and judged, s/he will have heard the gospel and had full opportunity to accept or reject it.

This is a convenient method for a religion to avoid the question, but still does not address the problem of millions of people from different religions who insist that they /also/ have heard the true gospel and that God communicated to them through it.

  Externally, it's a remarkable volume that could not plausibly have been written by a barely educated young adult in 19th century rural New York.

You should talk to some ex-mormons: claims like this are very easy to find within mormon echo chambers, but there are plenty of people who can point out why it's entirely plausible far better than I can. Go ahead and check out [[/r/exmormon]] and assert this in a post asking for them to change your view if they can, and I'm sure you will be met with many polite and respectful explanations of why it's not nearly as meaningful a statement to make as you've been taught. That which can be destroyed by the truth should be, right?

Also, Occam's Razor is in full effect here. The idea that it's implausible for him to have made up the Book of Mormon as opposed to actual divine intervention shows a pretty poor understanding of how probability works. There's nothing in the books that couldn't possibly have been known (like, say, confirming the Big Bang theory or explaining an atomic theory of matter) and quite a lot of factual archaeological claims it gets demonstrably wrong.

  Personally, I've found its contents to be both a very insightful life guide, and also a great source of clarification of Biblical passages that divide and confuse many Christians. Internally, I have prayed to ask God whether it's true, and distinctly felt an answer - although I recognize that this proves nothing to you, and that you are likely to think me mistaken.

It's great that you have had a good source of insightful life advice, but again, your internal experiences become largeley meaningless for those who care about truth in a world where others have the same experiences about different deities and religions.

Again: your pursuit of truth appears to stop at /what you experience./ You have shown nothing in your epistemology that shows how you check your experiences /against reality,/ which by definition is independent of your subjective experiences, and where indeed we can find many people with just as good a reason to believe you're wrong as you do to believe you're right.
