Im starting to get the impression that trainers are a lot less common then I expected. It seems nearly every normal citizen has no pokemon, and even most trainers have very limited options. This is a pretty stark contrast to the previous chapters where we saw just random rangers have pretty strong pokemon, and quite a few high tier trainers around the gyms. Im sure there's some places with more trainers than others, but maybe being a trainer just isn't worth it for a lot of people. Is being a trainer just too much of a time investment for someone who wants to be, say, a banker or an engineer? Maybe its a huge cost investment? The only thing i think contradicts this is the age of the kids. If the kids are only 12, then it's clear that people can have a training period when they're young where they try out being trainers, and then if they want to do something else they can put down the belt and pick up the books. Maybe this is one of those societies where you have to choose your path ridiculously early, or maybe the cost investment thing really is the big difference.
