These examples strengthen my point, I think: that if there is, in fact, any telepathic/empathic communication occurring between God and individuals, then we cannot externally verify it. We cannot tell whether someone is a prophet, charlatan, or just suffering from hallucinations. It is at least theoretically possible that an individual could receive a communication that they can distinctly tell was not from their own imagination, but they cannot demonstrate that. Yet it would still be reasonable for them to rely on that for themselves.
