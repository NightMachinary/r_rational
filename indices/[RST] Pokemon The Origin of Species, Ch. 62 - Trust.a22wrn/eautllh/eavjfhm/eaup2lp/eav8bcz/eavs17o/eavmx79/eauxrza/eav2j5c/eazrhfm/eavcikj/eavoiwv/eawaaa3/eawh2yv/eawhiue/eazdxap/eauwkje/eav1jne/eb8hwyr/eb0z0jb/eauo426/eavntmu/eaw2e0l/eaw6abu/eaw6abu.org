  I specifically prefer to use the word "trust" opposed to "faith" to keep them distinct, personally.

Hmm. Ok, but I think we're defining faith differently, then, because my understanding of it is practically synonymous with trust.

  Leaf knows Red and has been through a lot with him. Her trust is based on first hand experiences.

  If someone tried to apply the above criteria to someone they've never met before, or someone who they've only learned about through some piece of media (particularly media biased toward that person), we wouldn't commend their trust, we'd consider them misguided or naive.

Ah, that's a whole separate discussion, about whether trust in God is /justified/. Most Christians I know (and I'm guessing most Muslims too) would assert that they do indeed have a personal relationship with God, based on experiences, despite the lack of face time. But I wasn't trying to argue that; I was just acknowledging that you accurately described the goal state of that relationship, the level of trust that is held up as an ideal.

If you do want to discuss whether that implicit trust, "I believe you have a good reason even if it doesn't make sense to me," is based on sufficient evidence in a religious context, then ok, we could do that, but it may be a bit off topic here.
