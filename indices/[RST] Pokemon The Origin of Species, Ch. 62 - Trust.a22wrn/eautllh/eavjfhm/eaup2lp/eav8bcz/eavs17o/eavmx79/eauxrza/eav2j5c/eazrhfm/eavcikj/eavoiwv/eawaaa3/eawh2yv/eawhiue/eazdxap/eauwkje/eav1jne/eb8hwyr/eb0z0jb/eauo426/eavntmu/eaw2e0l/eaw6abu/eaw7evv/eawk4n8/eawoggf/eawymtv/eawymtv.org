It does make sense, yes.

However, I'm very much of the opinion that a religious journey is supposed to parallel the gradual, experience-based friendship that you describe, and not the mysterious case of Alice and Bob. Have you actually met many people who claimed to believe for no reason at all? Because I find the idea quite strange.

Jesus was definitely in the "build trust through experience" camp. The pattern all through his life was that when someone took a leap of faith, putting their trust in him, they were rewarded with miracles. When the crowds came to be healed, they may have started out with just wishes, but because they took a chance and acted, they came away with evidence.

Consider John 7:17, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." Or Matthew 7:15-16, "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"

So, if a Christian, at least, claims that they have no need for any evidence because they just have faith, I'd say that they don't understand their own scriptures. Faith might begin that way, as unfounded trust, but it's supposed to develop, through being acted upon, into trust based on experience. Very much comparable to starting a conversation with a stranger; you start off knowing almost nothing about them, but if you have even a tiny spark of hope and desire to build a new friendship, and if you have the courage to step outside your comfort zone and act on it, then you get a result that will either confirm your hope, or deflate it. To devote your life to a religion without ever expecting evidence would be like continually talking to someone who never responds, with no idea whether they actually want to hear from you. That's certainly not my idea of religion. And while it might, at a stretch, be considered a kind of faith, I don't think it's a kind that God ever asked for in any scriptures I know of.
