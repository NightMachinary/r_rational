The people who have trained Pokemon would be better able to congregate in the shelters, as they would feel safer leaving their homes when there are wild Pokemon outside. So the people we see in this chapter, the people who aren't in the shelters, are much more likely not to have any Pokemon. You'll notice also that there's only like a dozen or so people left in an apartment complex? It's perfectly plausible that the majority of people have at least one Pokemon they can rely on to some extent, and we're only seeing the outliers.
