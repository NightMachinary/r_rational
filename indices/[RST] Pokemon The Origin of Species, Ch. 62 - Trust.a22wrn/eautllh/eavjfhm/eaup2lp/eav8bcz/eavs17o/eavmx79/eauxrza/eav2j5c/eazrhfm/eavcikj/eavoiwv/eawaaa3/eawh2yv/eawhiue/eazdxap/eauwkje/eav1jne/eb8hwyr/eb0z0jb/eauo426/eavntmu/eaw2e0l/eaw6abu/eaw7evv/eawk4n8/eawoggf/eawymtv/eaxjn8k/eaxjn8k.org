Ok, so we're about to get into some nitty-gritty religious stuff here, and I'd like to get your permission and acknowledgement that you're going into this conversation with the understanding that you might lose your faith as a result.

Please take this seriously: I've deconverted 24 strangers on the internet in the past five years, just from casual conversations like this, and those are just the ones who have reached back out to me weeks or months afterward to let me know.

I have no intention of deconverting you if you're happy in your faith and especially if you're under 18 or dependent on family that's religious. But there's a chance you really do value logic and rationality over religious faith, and I don't want to shut the conversation down if that's the case.

Note that I'm not going to be /trying/ to deconvert you, it's just going to be a potential danger of engaging seriously on this topic. And sorry if you're not religious, I'm just getting that vibe and I've seen how these go too many times, and wanted to make sure you're fully aware of what you may be walking into.
