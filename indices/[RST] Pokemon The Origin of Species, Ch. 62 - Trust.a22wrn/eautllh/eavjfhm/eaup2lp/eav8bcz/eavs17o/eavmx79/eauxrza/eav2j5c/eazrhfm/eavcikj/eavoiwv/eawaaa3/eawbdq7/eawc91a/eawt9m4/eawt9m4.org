Must be great to live in Hoenn since their trio is locked away, and I can't imagine the lati's doing much other than a few sonic booms here and there. And they have Jirachi! Imagine actually getting a few wishes granted every thousand years or so. :D Gotta be careful with those meteor showers though, might get a side of aliens every now and then.
