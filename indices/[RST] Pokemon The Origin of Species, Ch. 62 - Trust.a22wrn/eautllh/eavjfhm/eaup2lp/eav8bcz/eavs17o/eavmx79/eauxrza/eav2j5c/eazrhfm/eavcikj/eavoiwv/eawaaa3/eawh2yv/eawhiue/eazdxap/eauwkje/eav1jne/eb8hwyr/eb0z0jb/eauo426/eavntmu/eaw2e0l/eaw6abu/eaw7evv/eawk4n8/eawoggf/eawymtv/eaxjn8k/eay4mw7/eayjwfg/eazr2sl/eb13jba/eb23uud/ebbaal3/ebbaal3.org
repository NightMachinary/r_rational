Oh, miracles haven't ceased. However, they were never an everyday thing. Moses made extraordinary claims; he told hundreds of thousands of people that they needed to antagonise a powerful nation and walk out into the desert. And he provided extraordinary evidence, smiting the nation with plagues and opening the path to the desert by dividing the sea. Elijah opposed idol worship that had basically become the state religion, enforced by the king. And he was able to call down fire from heaven. Jesus claimed that their entire religious tradition was all in anticipation of His coming, and his whole ministry was full of miracles being used to assist and heal others.

Though it's notable that even in Jesus' ministry, miracles were withheld from those who refused to believe.

So, today, what extraordinary things are being asked of us, that would require extraordinary evidence? Being invited to pray, to read the Bible, to try attending church, does not impose much cost on us, so it's reasonable that there's no fire from heaven or walking on water to convince us. We can instead focus on the actions themselves and what inherent value they might have.
