  Years of this system could produce the world we currently see in Origin of Species, where the extremely powerful Pokemon haven't killed off and outcompeted all the weaker one: those really powerful Pokemon get taken out of the gene pool pretty quickly whenever humans set up shop nearby.

Doesn't seem that way. Seems like its the weakest pokemon that would get captured the most, because they're the easiest to do so with. Look at how hard it was for the team to get Absol.

Rangers also seem to be somewhat about wild life preservation, so I don't know how they would feel about doing raids to wipe out certain pokemon. I agree it would be smart, i can imagine groups of trainers going into forests hunting Shiftree sort of like fox hunting
