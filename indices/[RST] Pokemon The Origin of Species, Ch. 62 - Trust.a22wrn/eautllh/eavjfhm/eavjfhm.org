Damn this is such an effectively oppressive atmosphere. What I love most about it is the sense of unceasing attrition, a wound here a death there, like these are Pokemon they spent many chapters acquiring and one by one they are getting cut down, but never all at once. It has a brutal realism to it.

​

Also I was someone who commented on the Red/Leaf cruise chapter that they thought Leaf was coming off like quite a jerk, and I wondered if that was intentional. This seems like some good confirmation that it was, and Leaf is dealing with the need to respect that good people can disagree on things.

​

A prediction I have is that this is going to serve as a fiercely radicalizing chapter for the two of them vis a vis being a trainer. Red in particular had sortof put being a fighter on the backburner, but after this I think they will consider that particular skillset to have a much higher value.
