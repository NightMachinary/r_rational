From what I remember reading, it seems like becoming a trainer in your early years is encouraged as a rite of passage kinda thing, but it does require somebody to put down some cash to buy the license/gear as well as pass an examination (I think?). On top of that is the danger factor, we've already seen a lot of rando's just straight up murdered on their journey. But yeah, it feels like the strong trainers are few and far between even among a select few. On the other hand, a couple of kids with mostly scrubby pokemon have been getting by pretty alright so far... seems to be more about how you use them than how strong they are.
