But there is not a single area in which 20 year olds do not out perform 12 year olds. If it's about how you use them, then the kids would get destroyed every time. Even in situations where physicality isn't important, like chess, a 12 year old will consistently lose against a 20 year old. There's a reason chess championships are age gated. This should hold even more true in a world where your pokemon get stronger over time. The kids are not only behind because they are children and have less physical and mental development, but they're also behind because the opponent's pokemon would have been trained for years longer. It's not really realistic unless they're significantly better off than normal kids in terms of training and supplies, which is possible. There are examples of child chess prodigies ranking pretty high at young ages. But those are like, one in a billion. They're not only natural savants, but are generally from very well off families and have a loooot of resources behind them (even for a relatively resource light endeavor). I just don't see how the average 12 year old would even be able to compete with other trainers, assuming trainers stay trainers past like 16.
