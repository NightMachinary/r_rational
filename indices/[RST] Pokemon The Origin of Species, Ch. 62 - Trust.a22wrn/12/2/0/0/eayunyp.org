Yeah, I agree, most if not all of the older trainers we've seen so far tend to be better equiped and better trained than pretty much anybody younger than them, which makes sense. Like you said, more time to trainer and gain experience and gather useful items and such. Although, it also seems like many adults didn't become trainers at any point in there lives, or at least for a very small time in there lives, so they're going to be less capable at the thing than somebody that continues to put effort in, which also makes sense (a junior competitive chess player will beat out somebody with only passing knowledge of the game pretty much every time). It also seems like our protags are also prodigies in their own right if we take their older acquaintances Amy and her brother as the standard for somewhat older trainers, so our view of the world is skewed in that respect as well. Could be that most 12 yr olds are basically scrubs with pidgeys and rattatas.

tldr: if adults seem to be less capable trainers in this setting it seems to be more a factor of they just didn't stay trainers long enough to really know what to do more than that they would be bad at it.
