  The people who have trained Pokemon would be better able to congregate in the shelters, as they would feel safer leaving their homes when there are wild Pokemon outside.

Really? I thought it would have been the other way around. I suppose its easier for people with pokemon to move during the storm, but it seems they would be more eager to move before the storm whereas trainers might think they can stick it out in their homes.
