Interfering with ecosystems can have wide ranging consequences. There are lots of reasons why you might avoid taking unnecesary action against pokemon species. Taking out the king or queen in a local population could cause the entire local nido population leading to an overabundance of prey species that if riled up could be harder to deal with than the king or queen if riled up while also threatening any species of flora or fauna that they prey on due to overpopulation. Or any species that prey on the nido population are forced to roam further afield or migrate to find food. Or it might be that after taking out the king or queen a 'rina or 'rino quickly evolves to take it's place which would make it too risky to keep putting them down.
