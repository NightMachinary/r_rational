Absol is a rather unique pokemon in this setting. The challenge wasn't that experienced trainers couldn't handle something that strong, it's that it has pressure which seems truly crippling, it hinders decision making ability (easily the most important part of the trainers' job) and makes wild pokemon crazy/aggressive.\\
You wouldn't face those issues fighting a Nidoqueen, so as long as you have a sufficiently powerful team you could probably handle it.\\
Also consider the fact that most of these powerful pokemon evolve from things that are much more easily caught, so there should be veteran trainers who've raised them from the first stage, so not only would they be able to fight them, but other trainers would have to be good enough to beat those trained Nidoqueen to stand a chance in tournaments.
