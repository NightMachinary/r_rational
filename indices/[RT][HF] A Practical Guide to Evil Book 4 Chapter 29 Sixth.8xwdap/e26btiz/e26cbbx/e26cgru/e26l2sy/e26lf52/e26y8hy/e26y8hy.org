Vivienne has a ton of other reasons why she'd be a great successor:

- She's callowan by blood and was from a semi-important family. This will win over the heroes and nobility

- She hates corruption and cares for Callow above all else. She's also unwilling to compromise on this stance.

- She was a (former) hero meaning she could win over the side of good by claiming to have always been in the side of good.

- She basically runs Callow's underground.

- The other members of Catherine's group are on decent terms with her.

- Catherine trusts her enough to allow her to have control over herself. That's a pretty big thing

All in all, Vivienne would make a good successor.

My theory is (Unless EE blindsides us which I'm expecting) that at the of the story if Catherine becomes Dread Empress, she'll place Thief as Queen of Callow only for Thief to “betray” her (Not really) and “push out” Praes. This isn't really what happens of course. Thief never betrayed Catherine and they'll still remain close friends. However, to the sight of the gods above, Callow is now ruled by a Hero who stole the crown from an evil Queen, thereby keeping Good from burning Callow to the ground.

However, if the Woe do succeed in breaking the story in half, I can totally see Catherine just allowing Callow to become its own kingdom with Thief at the head. Praes and Callow maintain a good trading relationship, and everything is fine
