My running theory, as in its so foul you should run away very fast too, is Akua is going to be redeemed, probably by Grey Pilgrim who is a narrative redemption bomb aimed at Cat. I think Cat is setting it up to have a Hero she controls, via soulbinding, or Masego carving them into Akua's soul, enforcing the accords.

If you look at the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/][Kaladescope VI]]

  If Akua had always known heroism was this entertaining, she would have begun dabbling years ago.

  Akua Sahelian was no stranger to otherworldly influences, and so she embraced Winter eagerly.

And in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/08/chapter-18-cradle/][Chapter 18 Cradle]] Cat discusses the accords with Archer

  “And what's our shore?” Indrani asked.

  “I call them,” I softly said, “the Liesse Accords.”

  “They worth the swim?” Archer said, eyebrow quirking.

  “They're why I still have a crown on,” I replied. “Because for them to work, someone needs to enforce them from this side.”

The unstated other side is someone has to enforce rules against, say angels mindraping cities, on the heroes side and the Gey pilgrim is obviously mortal . . .

Cat's deal with Vivian kind of throws a spanner in my guess, but I could see Cat paying the price of being foresworn, or being fey enough to say that they (her and Akua) aren't done until the Liese accords are a groove in creaton, but that's the points I'm extrapolating into a Hero Akua line.
