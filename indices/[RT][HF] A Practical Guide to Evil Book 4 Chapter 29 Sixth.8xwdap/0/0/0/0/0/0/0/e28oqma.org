It has a degree of symmetry to it. But Akua (being a villain) being redeemed ensures her death as was mentioned by Cat during the aftermath of the negotiations with Malanza. How can Akua enforce the Liesse Accords from the heroic side if she's dead?

Furthermore, what political backing does Akua even have? She can't become anything of import in Callow because of the same gripes Thief has. If Cat introduces her to the other party's signing the Accords as a Hero redeemed, half the people in Callow will rise up in open rebellion, love for Cat or no. It's been repeatedly stated that Callowans are legendary in holding grudges and a 100k+ of their own countrymen mutilated and sacrificed is a pretty big hatchet to bury.

I'm sorry but I'm not seeing how this hypothesis can succeed.
