Anyone else getting serious "it's a trap" vibes from this whole endeavour?

We know the tower and dead king were in contact. We know that the woe are cut off from creation, where anything could be happening. And all of a sudden, they stumble across first pure masego bait and now pure cat bait, making them take days/weeks longer away from callow.

Unrelated: cat taking a trapped soul to see the dead king, who we know can resurrect named, seems highly risky.
