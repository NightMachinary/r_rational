Cat has a clear dislike of being a ruler and has mentioned on multiple occasions that if she could step down from the throne without throwing Callow to the wolves, she would. obviously the council idea didn't work, so who would be the ruler/highest-ranking after she steps down? it'd have to be someone she trusts.

this sentence seems like a clever way of instilling foreshadowing clues, as it can be a double meaning:

- Thief is straight (not homosexual)

- Thief is morally straight (cat's definition of it, anyways), so much so that she could be a Ruler
