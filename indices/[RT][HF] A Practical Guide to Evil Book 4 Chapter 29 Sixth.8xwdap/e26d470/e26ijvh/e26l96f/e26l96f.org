It occured to me as well. Given Akua's utility, Cat should have been hesitant in commiting to that kind of agreement since this will limit her future options. But there was time pressure present, which did not afford her the time to consider the implications of this agreement. Her hesitance would have likely rubbed Thief the wrong way, since she has an almost manic desire to see Akua suffering. She said it herself that it was a line.

But given that Cat is known for self mutilation for the greater good, her going back on this agreement because the situation demanded it and suffering the appropriate backlash is now all but certain to happen. She wouldn't be Catherine Foundling otherwise.
