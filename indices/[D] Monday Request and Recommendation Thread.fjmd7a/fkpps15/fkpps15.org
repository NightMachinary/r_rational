Reviews of things I've read recently:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning/chapter/301778/1-good-morning-brother][Mother Of Learning]]: Time loop story with a month-long loop, main character is studying magic in a very well-realized version of a D&D-esque world. Does a satisfying job of having a main character grow in power over time, but also grow into a more well-adjusted and kinder person. Feels pretty low-stakes all the time, so it's a good break from other well-written serials; usually anything this good will consistently drag their characters through hell. The magics the main character develops are specific, and unpopular for main characters, so they feel fresh. Story is greatly improved by the introduction of giant telepathic spiders. Would recommend; there's a reason it had threads here for five years.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/threadmarks][I Just Love Killing]]: Worm / Rick & Morty crossover. You'd need to have read Worm to enjoy this, but for Rick & Morty you could get away with just the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDr9axb7X7E][two]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFA1UQ2UOVQ][scenes]] that Krombopulous Michael appears in (also interplanetary portals exist). Taylor gets her power replaced with a cheerful alien assassin stuck in her head, who gives her advice about killing. It's not incredibly rational, but it's light, easy to read, and pretty well-written. It also focuses on planning and practice paying off, which is an itch that's popular around here. Not completed, incredibly sporadic update schedule. I don't think being complete is particularly important to this one though.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]] (not quite done reading yet): Dumb adolescent power fantasy, but like the best possible version of that. The writing does a great job of stringing together new ideas, new problems, new possibilities, new bits of world building, and dumb jokes so there's always something to anticipate, and it goes by fast. Main character lucks into a completely busted pile of abilities in their LitRPG-esque world and rapidly gains power (and a harem).
