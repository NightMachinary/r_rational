/Hero School Adventure/ is definitely great. It and Sage's /Transdimensional/ both do Hachiman really well.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11808918/chapters/26640231][Conversations with a Cryptid]]*. This fic takes place after the Overhaul arc, and contains spoilers past that. All For One is captured, and after months of getting absolutely nothing out of him from interrogation, Izuku is allowed weekly visits to see if he can get anything out of him. The result is a carefully paced plot that slowly peels back the layers of a very old and crafty criminal mastermind, as Izuku learns more than he expected about how his world became what it is today. I was pretty captivated the whole way through, and it easily gets my rec. Keep in mind a couple of things. This fic has a sequel, in addition to a planned third installment, buuuuuut that one kinda jumps off the rails very quickly and never gets back on. I don't like it nearly as much. And in addition to having several spoilers for MHA, this fic also has a few major plot points (including the finale of /Conversations/) that actually aren't true in canon, and afterwards I had to ask a few questions to someone who was caught up with the manga to figure out which were which.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11088315/chapters/24735288][Erased Potential]]*. This one is near and dear to my heart. One of my big problems with canon's opening is that it feels like it is setting up a premise where Midoriya is perpetually told he's worthless and that his dreams are impossible without a quirk, and he would go on to prove them wrong through grit and intelligence. Instead, he trips over the strongest quirk in the setting, challenging exactly none of these ideas. This fic, however, is exactly what I wanted from MHA's opening. In this AU, a young Midoriya takes a more proactive and thoughtful approach towards his goal of becoming a hero, realizes that the Hero Eraserhead basically fights people quirkless after neutralizing their special advantages, reasons that he could train his talent for quirk analysis into something that could function similarly, tracks Eraserhead down to his apartment, and begs him to teach him how to become a hero. This is an Aizawa apprentice fic, and it is what I wish canon would've been.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11847156/chapters/26745675][an education in interruption]]*. This is a very interesting one, as it is technically a reader-insert romance story with All Might's secret identity, but that is not the focus. The reader-insert character is a kind of Special Needs teacher for children with dangerous or unstable quirks, and the look into that world is easily the most interesting part of the fic. They are on the receiving end of a very deep cultural stigma that thinks they're one step away from turning into horrible Villains, and they have to struggle against that prejudice. On top of their actual quirks, some of which are /horrifying/; disabilities at best, "kill everyone nearby" buttons at worst. They are the ultimate Problem Children, but they have each other and teachers who would die for them.
