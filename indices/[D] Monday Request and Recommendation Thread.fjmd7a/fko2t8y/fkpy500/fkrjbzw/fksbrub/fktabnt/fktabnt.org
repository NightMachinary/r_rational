I'm just curious what more you expect an author to change. The sports fest happens and a student can't really change that. The author changed the obstacle race to better reflect the different quirks introduced through oreigaru characters (particularly the flying characters who would have invalidated the original obstacles), gave a strong motive for the protagonist to succeed in the festival when normally he wouldn't care, changed how the students approached the events, had a character antagonize the league of villains + stain on national tv and gave new character moments to mha characters that will change the results of the festival (because ultimately it is a character development and introduction arc).

Also not sure how you can view the protagonist as passive when he is constantly working to improve his quirk. Directly addresses the league of villans and stain. And has a strong motive to succeed that he is following through with.
