Hi, posted this last week, but it was Friday, so it missed peek viewership.

I've really been enjoying "My Hero School Adventure Is Wrong, As Expected" and I think [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would like it a lot too!

([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/]])

It is an Oregairu, My Hero Academia fusion fanfic. Both stories are combined very well with lots of interesting quirks (powers). The main character uses his complex quirk 108 skills very intelligently. It gives him the power to copy 108 other quirks at 1/108th of the power (and only use 1 at a time). There is good character development and it feels like there have been entertaining divergences from a the canon plot line (though much of the plot is out of the students control).

Also, Does anyone have any other My Hero Academia fanfiction that they like? I've been having trouble finding other good MHA fanfic.
