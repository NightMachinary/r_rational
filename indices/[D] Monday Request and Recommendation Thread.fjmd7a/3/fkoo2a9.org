Tentative recommendation for the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/34561/Re_Creators][Re:Creators]]. It's a reverse Isekai where characters from games and stories start showing up in the real world. At it's best it reminds me of PGtE with it's focus on tropes and stories as strategic plot elements. It also does a good job of showing a range of reactions to characters finding out they're stories and meeting their authors. It's also interesting watching characters evolve from their archetype origins to become 3D characters.

Full disclosure, I am only half way into the season, so it's possible my opinion will change by the end. I also wouldn't call it rational, since plenty of characters make objectively stupid decisions, but no one behaves particularly out of character.

This likely won't be new to many people, but the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)][Expanse novels]] are pretty good. I found the first two decent, but flat at times. The third one took the series in an unexpected and really interesting direction and now I'm eager to read the rest of them. If you haven't heard of it, it's fairly hard sci-fi in the near future, and it goes to great lengths to justify as much of the world as it can with realistic science.
