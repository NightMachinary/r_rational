The main problem with Magane is that, as far as I can tell, there was nothing stopping her from approaching a random person on the street, saying "I'm omnipotent", goading them into calling her out on the lie, and thereby becoming omnipotent. I /had been/ willing to grant that her power has some upper limit --- that is, until it was used as a Deux Ex Machina in the endgame, to change a variable that was presumably impossible to manipulate via any other demonstrated power.
