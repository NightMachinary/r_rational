[[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], Urban Fantasy: Basically all magic is dependent on your ability to convince Spirits that yes, you /can/ actually do that. Playing into established patterns is a big part of that. This means that being aware of /what/ you are in the "audience's" eyes is very important. Theatralic declarations of war lessen the karmic impact of killing someone. The result of a third battle is more impactful. Making clear, decisive statements gives you a little boost, but if you fail to follow through, you take a huge hit.
