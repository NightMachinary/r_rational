Or, now that I'm thinking about it, if it only worked if a person from a certain highly-restricted set of people called her out --- say, that of all non-Earth characters. They were all relatively well-informed and competent, compared to an average civilian, which would've made her ascension at least minimally challenging.

It could've also served as a source of interesting tension. She isn't affiliated with any other faction and is Chaotic Evil, but if she managed to ally with /anyone at all/, they'd instantly win... if any of them could trust her, that is, if she could only stop being chaotic long enough to earn anyone's trust.
