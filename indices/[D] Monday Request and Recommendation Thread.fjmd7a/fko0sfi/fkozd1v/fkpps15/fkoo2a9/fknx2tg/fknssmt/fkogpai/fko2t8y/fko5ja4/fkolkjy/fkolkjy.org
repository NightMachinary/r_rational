Thanks for the book recommendations! Nice to see them here.

I can't second Gideon the Ninth, though. My main problem is that it is a pretty difficult book to read. That would be okay, if the world-building, characters etc. justify the complexity (think Dune) but in this case this isn't the case, in my opinion. I think the complexity obfuscates large plot holes, inconsistent world-building and character issues. If this is the case it'll become more obvious with sequels.

My rec instead would be “The Traitor Baru Cormorant”. It has some of the same themes, but the complexity of the themes + plot justify the complexity of the presentation. See e.g. [[https://www.sethdickinson.com/2015/10/01/the-traitor-baru-cormorant-read-along-chapter-1/][here]] about what kind of thought process the author went through for each sentence.
