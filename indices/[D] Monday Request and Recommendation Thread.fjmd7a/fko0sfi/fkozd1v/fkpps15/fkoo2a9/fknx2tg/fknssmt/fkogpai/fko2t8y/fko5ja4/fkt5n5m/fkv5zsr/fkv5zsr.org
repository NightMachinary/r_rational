This one is very popular so you may have read it, but in case not: World War Z is by far the best zombie story I have ever read, to the point that I still re-read it on occasion.

Its written as a collection of stories being recorded by a historian tracking the experiences people had during the zombie outbreak.

Also, if you like audio-books, I can't recommend the audio-book version enough. I usually hate audio-books, the narration grates on me and just never works, but World War Z was done incredibly well. They got actual voice actors to do different characters and it works so well. I wouldn't say it's /better/ than reading the book on your own (but again, I'm biased against listening to books mostly), but if you feel like listening to something instead of reading, this is a case where I can heartily endorse the audio version.

Also, it has essentially no connection to the movie.
