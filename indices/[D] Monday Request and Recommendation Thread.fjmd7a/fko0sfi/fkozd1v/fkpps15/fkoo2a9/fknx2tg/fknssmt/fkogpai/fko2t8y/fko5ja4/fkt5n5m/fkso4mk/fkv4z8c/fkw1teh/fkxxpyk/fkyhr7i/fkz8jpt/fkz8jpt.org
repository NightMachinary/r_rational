Based on your scene description, you seem to have been watching “A Certain Magical Index,” a different series set in the same world. It's... not terrible, if we ignore season 3, but both Railgun and Accelerator are significantly better protagonists for their respective series (A certain scientific Railgun/Accelerator) than Touma is for Index.
