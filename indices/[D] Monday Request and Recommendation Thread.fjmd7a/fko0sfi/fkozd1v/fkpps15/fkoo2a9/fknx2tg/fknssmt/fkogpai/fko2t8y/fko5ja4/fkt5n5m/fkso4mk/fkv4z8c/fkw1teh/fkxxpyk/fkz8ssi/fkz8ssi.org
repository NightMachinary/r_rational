Raildex is (imo) the epitome of an author who isn't smart trying to write smart. The science you see in it is a superficial coating to a story based on characters acting like idiots, the world running on nonsense rules, and author handwaves being the order of the day.

If you want a passable supernatural shounen anime, you could do worse. But if you want something rational? You'd be better off watching Nichijou.
