It depends. The ToAru franchise (Index/Railgun/Accelerator) are 3 interconnected stories. Events that happen in one, also happen at the same time in another.

The watch order varies on how you want to watch. Also, since I have only seen up to S2 of Railgun and Index so far, I can only give you a good watch order for those 4 seasons. If you want to watch Railgun, you can just watch the first 2 seasons of Railgun. The third season apparently has some things in it that would be better understood if you watch Index. If you want to watch the entire franchise, there are a few ways, but I'll just show you two. My suggested way of watching is Index S1 Episodes 1-9, Railgun S1 and S2, then the rest of Index, then however you wanna watch the other seasons. I suggest this way because watching a bit of Index is helpful in understanding what is going on a bit better, and up to ep 9, because the next arc after is much more better in Railgun. If you want to watch in seasons, you should watch Railgun S1 and S2, then Index S1 and S2, then the rest.
