  Full disclosure, I am only half way into the season, so it's possible my opinion will change by the end.

It falls off in the second half, but I still enjoyed it at the time. Some people in this community would like certain aspects of it for sure. /a/ was obsessed with Magane and her 'uso-no-uso' power that season, it was pretty funny at the time, half the threads turned into Magane generals. Her power has such specific trigger conditions anyone being rational about it would simply not talk to her but people kept falling for it again and again.
