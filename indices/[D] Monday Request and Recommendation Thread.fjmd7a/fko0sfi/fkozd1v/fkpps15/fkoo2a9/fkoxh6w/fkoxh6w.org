  Full disclosure, I am only half way into the season, so it's possible my opinion will change by the end. I also wouldn't call it rational, since plenty of characters make objectively stupid decisions, but no one behaves particularly out of character.

Yeah it seems the second half jumps the shark several times. Still a fun premise, which imo would benefit from a rational mind to turn into a fic pretty much like The Metropolitan Man.
