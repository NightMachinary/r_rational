I enjoy reading fanfics which focus on a villain and portray him as more intelligent, competent and charismatic than cannon. For example, I've read the vast majority of the sane!Voldemort fics out there, as well as the protagonist!Lex Luthor fics.

Are there any other fandoms (besides Superman and Harry Potter) with villains that lend themselves to that sort of portrayal? I'd love to see any fanfic recommendations for rational!villain protagonists outside those fandoms.
