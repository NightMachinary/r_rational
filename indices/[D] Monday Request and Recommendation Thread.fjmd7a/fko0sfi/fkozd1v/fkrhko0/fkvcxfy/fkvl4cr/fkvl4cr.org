The Lex Luthor fics:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17356310/][The Metropolitan Man]] - Probably the most well known rational!Lex Luthor fic.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8700173/1/Lex-Luthor-Triumphant][Lex Luthor Triumphant]] - rational!Lex Luthor, but more selfish and vindictive than in "Metropolitan Man".
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]] - This rational!Lex Luthor fic tends to get recommended on this sub, but it's not to my taste.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7370077/][It Doesn't Do Well To Dream]] - A decently written rational-adjacent fic focused on Lex and an OC set in the Smallville canon.

I have over a hundred sane!Voldemort fics in my favorites list, but here are the ones I think are most likely to appeal to this sub:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - rational!Voldemort successfully steals the Philosopher's Stone and kidnaps Harry.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][Lord Voldemort and the Intricate Plots]] - rational!Voldemort is more cautious about the prophecy and kidnaps baby Harry rather than kill him.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/][Birds of a Feather]] - (occasionally recommended on this sub) Hermione is born in Tom Riddle's generation. They become friends before they get their Hogwarts letters.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] - After his death, Voldemort awakens in the body of his teenage self. With his sanity restored, he resolves not to repeat his past mistakes.
