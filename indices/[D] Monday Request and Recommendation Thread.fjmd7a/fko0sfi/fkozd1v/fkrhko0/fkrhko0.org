Worm's Skidmark is basically a racist stereotype. In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]], it's portrayed as a deliberate act he puts on, while actually being rather cunning and smart.

  Now, I have no delusions that I'm important. I'm a minor character at best in the grand scheme of things. I at least hoped to be the stern no nonsense mentor character (or at least let Armsmaster be that, if it means I can avoid death by teaching), but since last year, I've come to terms with the fact that the PRT and Protectorate ENE were not the A Team. We're almost definitely antagonists.

  Well, at least an obstacle to overcome. How am I so sure? It's simple really: Triumph and Gallant. Triumph is the mayor's son, and Gallant is a billionaire. It reeks of privilege so hard we're clearly the asshole rival baseball team the underdogs will have to beat for the state championship.
