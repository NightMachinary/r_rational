Eh it's not quite rational - it's more munchkiny / intellect bootstrappy.

The basic plot is that the main character is an Orc Wizard in a world that works very much like older versions of D&D, where your spells per day is based on your Intelligence. As a fairly dumb Orc Wizard, he can cast about one spell per day. He quickly discovers an Intelligence boosting spell, which allows him to cast something like /three/ spells per day - a net gain of one spell.

I have no idea what the target age is, but it didn't feel like a YA book at least.
