I enjoyed [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/magna-graecia-a-city-state-quest.17910/][Magna Graecia]], a quest set in Ancient Greece, with a lot of detail spent on making the historical setting both accurate and vibrant; it might scratch some of the "worldbuilding" itch?

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]] is a xianxia quest which I'd say has good writing and medium worldbuilding.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer (definitely NSFW)]] is what I'd consider the gold standard for lewd quests.
