I'd honestly say the opposite about Forge of Destiny. It's writing and main story is ok, but I live for the worldbuilding segments. I love the whole entire civilizations built around island turtles, and everything about Duchess Cai even though she's a bit of a rip-off of Ragyo from Kill-La-Kill, she's simply the same idea executed so much better.
