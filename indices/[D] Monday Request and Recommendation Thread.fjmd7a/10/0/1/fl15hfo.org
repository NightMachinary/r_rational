  In terms of rational anime it's hard to beat out Puella Magi Madoka Magica. If you're unfamiliar, I advise you enter completely blind, as it's better that way and very much a different story than it appears. I can't reccomend this enough, probably my favorite show period.

In addition you can then read To The Stars which is some of the best fiction I've ever read.
