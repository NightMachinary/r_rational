I agree with most of your recommendations, but I just couldn't get into A Certain Scientific Railgun. I couldn't get past the start of the /first episode./ It's been a while, but IIRC the first few scenes really lacked verisimilitude in a way that I would expect to get on [[/r/rational]]'s nerves so I'm surprised you recommend it. Is the start not representative?
