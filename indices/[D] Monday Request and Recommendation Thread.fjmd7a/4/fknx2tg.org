Anyone can recommend any rational [[https://youtu.be/j-hGeKvhYi4][Tangled]] fic? I just finished the series and was disappointed with season 3 after all the worldbuilding and plot it had on the first 2 seasons.

Any good fics that deal with heavy politics and intrigue? I'd like something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9913706/1/Ice-on-the-Rhine][Ice on the Rhine]] but more rational.
