  One of my big problems with canon's opening is that it feels like it is setting up a premise where Midoriya is perpetually told he's worthless and that his dreams are impossible without a quirk, and he would go on to prove them wrong through grit and intelligence. Instead, he trips over the strongest quirk in the setting, challenging exactly none of these ideas.

If you're interested in a story that actually runs with these ideas, I'd recommend Brandon Sanderson's Steelheart - in fact, when I started watching MHA, my first thought was "wow this is like someone decided to make an anime out of Steelheart after reading the first half of the book".
