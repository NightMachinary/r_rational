  I'm just curious what more you expect an author to change.

One suggestion could be to scrab or drastically reduce the screen time of the sports festival. The media of writing lends itself much less to pointless fighting than manga/anime/other visual media. This fic was started in Nov 2018 and the sports festival started in Aug 2019 which means that about half the story at this point have been filled with stuff I've basically seen before and stuff that has little to no impact on the rest of the story. Maybe this wouldn't be as big of a problem if this was my first MHA fanfic but almost every single MHA fanfic retells the sports festival with only minor changes.

  Also not sure how you can view the protagonist as passive when he is constantly working to improve his quirk. Directly addresses the league of villans and stain. And has a strong motive to succeed that he is following through with.

None of the actions you described is moving the story. The story happens to the MC rather than being driven by him. One easy way of having this MC be active is to research powerful quirkusers and actively seek to acquire those. That would introduce new conflicts by having to convince(or cheat) heroes, hunting villains down, trying to gain access to villain prisons for juicy stuff, making deals with neutrals etc. Imagine him learning about Gran Torino and realizing that extra speed can often be useful, seeking him out, and having to convince him to share his quirk which the grumpy old man is reluctant to do.
