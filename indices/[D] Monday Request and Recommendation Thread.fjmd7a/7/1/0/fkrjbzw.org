I think the opportunities to change canon have been taken. Events have different effects on characters and different characters have had success in the sports festival. I think that early mha doesn't give a lot of opportunities to change drastically with either the villains or teachers being the driving force of the plot (attacking with no forewarning, scheduled school events like the sports fest or provision exam).
