I've read two novels last week that might be interesting to folks here:

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0851HYMXV/][/Grog/]]: unlike most characters in rational fiction, Grog is pretty dumb. However, he understands that he's not smart, and so spends half his time thinking and asking questions about why things are the way they are. The other half of his time is spent disassembling the enemies of the adventuring party that has (reluctantly) bought this massive half-orc from the gladiator pits.

(as a side note: you might also like [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074W7P6MB][Another Stupid Spell]], which is about an Orc who bootstraps himself into wizardry using intelligence spells)

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J6HWLPR][/Gideon the Ninth/]]: Harrow would be a classic rationalist protagonist (super smart, hard working, great at magic), but what makes this book interesting is that you get to see it from the other side - Gideon, her companion, is the main character. They hate each other, but have to at least pretend to work together to get through what amounts to a death game.

The only problem with this book is that it's /so expensive/. It's good but I don't know if I can really recommend spending $12 on an ebook copy.
