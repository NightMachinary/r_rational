[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria][Fallout: Equestria]] (and its much better recursive fanfic, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/208056/fallout-equestria-project-horizons][Fallout: Equestria --- Project Horizons]]) are nice if you can stand ponies. They're obviously post-apocalyptic, given the titles, but I'm not sure I would call them survival stories as much as action/adventure/fantasy stories (with a tinge of mystery/intrigue in the case of Project Horizons) that happen to be set in a post-apocalyptic setting. The low level survival stuff is not a focus, and is mostly elided in favor of more violent, political, or magical threats.

Haven't read them in several years, tho.
