In terms of rational anime it's hard to beat out Puella Magi Madoka Magica. If you're unfamiliar, I advise you enter completely blind, as it's better that way and very much a different story than it appears. I can't reccomend this enough, probably my favorite show period.

Fullmetal Alchemist (especially brotherhood, but somewhat 2003 version) is great and rational adjacent; it does so while still being Shonen, too, which is rare.

In terms of anime I expect people on r/r to like, A Young Girl's Military Record / Saga of Tanya the evil, Tenga Toppa Gurren Lagann, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, A certain Scientific Railgun (season one is solid, arc 1 of season 2 is /amazing/, arc 2 of s1 is meh), Unlimited Blade Works are all good.

My general recommendations would be Code Geass (IK it's popular here but I can't reccomend the end of S1/anything beyond), KonoSuba, Kara no Kyoukai, OreGairu, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and My hero Academia.
