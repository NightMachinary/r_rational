I came at it through the manga first, so it's possible that influenced my opinion; I know anime!Kuroko would have made me judge the series more harshly if that has been my first introduction to the character, for instance. Nevertheless, yeah, the first part is not that representative; ToAru is at its worst when it tries to do slice of life.

Some of the parts I think would appeal to r/r are things like the powers getting their physics due; rather than electricity control just being shooting lightning, it's also manipulating ferromagnetic materials, up to a fucking Railgun, decomposing water, EWar, controlling plasma, manual muscle contraction for movement, etc. This extends beyond just Mikoto as well, such as when one of the sisters effects accelerator through his whitelist reflection power by turning the oxygen to ozone Another is the aesthetic; while espeed powers may not always be fully /understood/ by everyone, the setting always tries to show them as fundamentally /understandable/ and receptive to scientific inquiry. Then there's the fact that improving your esper abilities requiring you to get better at the mental math involved.
