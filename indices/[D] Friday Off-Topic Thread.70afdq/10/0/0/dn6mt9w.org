Spacechem is the only one I haven't played, now. I figured I'd check it out at some point (maybe after finishing the other three), but it didn't immediately interest me as much.

I get what you mean about Infinifactory---by building it out of such simple, easy to understand concepts it makes it easier, so you don't have to look anything up in a manual; but adding the third dimension makes up for that. I'm actually having more success with Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100 than I am with it, though, and that's despite the fact that I have very limited coding experience. Maybe it's just that it's easier to try lots of different things in those games, and because there's nothing like Input Rate to work around.

Although, sitting here away from my computer thinking about solutions to puzzles I got stuck on in Infinifactory has just given me a couple ideas... Now I'm excited to get home.
