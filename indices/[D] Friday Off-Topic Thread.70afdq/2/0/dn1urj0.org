Trade bariers are mentioned in author notes.

  Although HPMOR doesn't go into this in much depth, the lack of trade between magical Britain and Muggle Britain implies some further background reason why the Weasleys can't just go off and make millions of pounds selling simple healing Charms to rich Muggles. Presumably people like Lucius Malfoy have arranged for trade with Muggles to be heavily regulated - for the protection of the poor innocent Muggles, perhaps - so that only people like Lucius Malfoy are allowed to make their family fortunes at it, and nobody else is allowed to try. (This is also a likely place where Harry's idea about trading Galleons and Sickles for Muggle gold and silver would run into a barrier - there are a lot of dogs not barking, a lot of Ricardian comparative advantage trades that aren't happening, not only that one.)

I wish Harry tried his arbitrage scheme and failed miserably. /Harry Potter and the Exclusive Institusions./
