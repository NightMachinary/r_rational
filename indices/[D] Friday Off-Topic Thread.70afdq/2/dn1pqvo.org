If you weren't aware, [[http://archive.is/bEKbD][much continues to be made]] of [[http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/04/what-was-aragorns-tax-policy.html][George Martin's dig at John Tolkien's failure to provide the details of Aragorn's tax policy]]. I wonder whether jokes in a similar vein could be made toward /Harry Potter/ and/or /Methods of Rationality/. A search for =tax= in my /HPMoR/ file turns up no details on the Ministry of Magic's revenue stream . . .
