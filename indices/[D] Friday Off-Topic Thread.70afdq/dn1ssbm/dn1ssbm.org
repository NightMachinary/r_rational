I have a strange and recurring problem. Through various means, I make the accquaintence of women who are fundamentally shattered by the events of their lives. They've survived rape, started and quit drugs, had other mental issues exacerbated by their experiences, and never developed into what one might consider a normal adult for a variety of reasons.

People like this often don't have many in the way of friends, and I am one of the only people who will talk to them. This is a problem, however, because this causes them to become attracted to me because /omg this super nice, empathetic guy notices me!/ I am not attracted to them. I have my own mental issues to deal with, and being in a relationship with someone whose issues are worse would destroy me because I would want to reach in and fix their problems. Which I can't. I also feel somewhat obligated to keep talking with them as a harm-reduction method, but I know I really shouldn't because I personally cannot handle interpersonal interaction at all hours of the day, and I know that doing so will just lead them on.

This has happened twice now. What do?
