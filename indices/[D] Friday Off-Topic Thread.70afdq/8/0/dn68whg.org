People should have the ability to choose what information to listen to, and it's up to them not to abuse this privilege. I mean, think about it the other way. A flat-earther comes up to you and says "Hey man, I have PROOF that the earth is flat. You're wrong. All you need to do is listen to this ninety-minute video."

You're well within your rights to say "No, I don't want to." at which point the flat-earther accuses you of refusing to be educated. Should you be allowed to refuse to take in this information, even if it's arguments for the position that you've never heard before?

As for specifically factual information with verifiable evidence, I could make a similar argument. Someone asks you to read over a boring, obscure three-hundred page technical manual. Every word in it is factual and verifiable. Should you be allowed to refuse?
