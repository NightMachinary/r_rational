That's a very fair way to look at it. My instinctual reply to that was "But then what do we do if someone's obstinate and refuses to accept the opportunity to challenge their worldviews?'

+Try and take over the world without their consent+ Accept that some people are obstinate and pray the damage they inflict is minimal.
