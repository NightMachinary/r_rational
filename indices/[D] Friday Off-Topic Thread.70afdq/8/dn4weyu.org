Another question about consent. But this time, information consent!

Basically, I had a discussion with my friend and she told me that she believes consent is important in all respects, even information. As in, information should not be forced on someone who does not want/ask for it.

This was interesting to me because I personally feel that people need to be educated on certain things regardless of their beliefs/consent as I feel that there are certain beliefs that are honestly negative, such as racism or the belief in the earth being flat being used to justify a fundamentalist's view. So I don't personally think I would respect a flat earther's desire to not be educated.

How do you guys feel about consent, specifically towards information we take in? Specifically factual information with verifiable (or as good as) evidence.
