Man, I've tried the system approach a few times.

It may be that I'm not organized enough but it ends up being a cluster-system of systematic proportions.

Every system ends up dipping in every other system and before I know I've designed myself into a corner.

From your own description the world, action and combat systems have such a vague description of their purpose and will need to interact so heavily that they may as well be a single "Logic" system while the rest are just data containers.

If you cant' explain to a five year old why system A and B are not the same thing your assignment of responsibilities is too vaguely defined and you'll end up with cross dependencies and duplication on who needs to do what and who needs what data.
