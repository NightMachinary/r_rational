  I have a strange and recurring problem.

I'd hardly call this /strange/. Commonplace is probably a more accurate term.

Do not engage. There is no victory to be had in these battles. Do not spend significant amounts of one-on-one time with these women. The best thing that can be done is to introduce them to a support network. If you have a church, invite them to attend and engage with the social network there. Other social organizations may be able to fulfill a similar role. Get them to volunteer with a charity organization if possible.
