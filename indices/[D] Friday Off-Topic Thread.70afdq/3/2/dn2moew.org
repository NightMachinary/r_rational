My advice would be to be upfront from the beginning of the interaction. A large part of empathy is that it seems like the person being empathetic has their shit relatively more put together when that might not really be the case.

I was in a very similar situation a couple years ago. I started dating a girl, like you described, who had more than her fair share of issues while simultaneously dealing with a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. We started dating primarily because I was the empathetic one in the relationship and was serving as a social crutch for her and she asked me out as a result. An important thing to recognize is that this is not healthy for either party involved. Like you, I found it draining because I'm an introvert who was struggling to live up to being a mental crutch for someone in a not great place. For her, the relationship made it seem like not as much else needed to be done.

Obviously your situation is not entirely the same, but I think there's a lot of parallels there. It's okay to tell someone that you're not capable of interacting with them sometimes, or that you're not ready to be in a relationship with them because of personal issues. In my experience, that's what I wish I had done because I think it would have turned out better for both of us.
