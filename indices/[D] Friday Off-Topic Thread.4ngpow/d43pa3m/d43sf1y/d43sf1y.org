  Somewhat surprisingly, three turn-based soccer games are currently on sale through Steam

Uh, this might just be my soccer heavy European bias talking, but considering that the Euro 2016 starts today, it's not that surprising?

I've read some of the Hugo awards stories across the last few years(and specially after the Puppies bawl), but not the Imperial Radch trilogy, and honestly I've found that across the years there have always been some books and stories which I've kept more at mind the concepts and themes than the characters and story itself, so I don't think it's so much an unusual thing to lack precise memories when one read them first in a simple consumer fashion.
