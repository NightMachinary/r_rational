The controversy honestly is pretty nonexistent. Some group of conservative writers believed a specific book awards group to be leaning too liberal in their choices, and Ancillary Justice was one of the books they targeted as not deserving its nomination. It's so far from a substantial concern or real issue that I hesitated to even explain it in the first place, lest I give it even more relevancy beyond what it deserves, but I didn't want you to think the writer had done something wrong.
