I think that in changing a concept from its original form (fanfiction of a subject that everyone who reads it will, by its nature, understand) to something else will necessarily lose a lot of its ease of access. For an HP fanfic, you don't have to explain a lot of the setting elements; just what makes the ones in your setting different from the canon/fanon. It's hard to say for me, as someone with no experience in the realm, whether this will gain or lose you readership.

As for whether it would be plagiarism, I think not. I believe [[/u/eaglejarl]] did something similar with 2YE for a time. You might speak with him about its legality.
