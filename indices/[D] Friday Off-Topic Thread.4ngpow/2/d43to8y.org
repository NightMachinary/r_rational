This might be better for Monday, but I forgot about it back then so I'll ask now. What do you folks think of gene drives. Basically science has discovered how to make sure regardless of the copy of a chromosome or even what parent the chromosome comes from any decedents of an individual will have a particular gene.

This allows us to theoretically make changes to an entire species. So for example by releasing 1% the population of mosquitoes genetically inoculated against Malaria in with a gene driver to drive said gene basically entire population could be inoculated within 10 generation which could be as short as 126 days for some species. The equation according to Wikipedia assuming no mutations is. 1 − (1 − f)^{2^{n}} = t. Where f is the initial fraction of the population and t is the target percent. N is the number of generations.

There's a lot of controversy over this tech because it has such widespread potential affects. My question is if this does get bogged down in politics which I think it will (look how scared people are about genetic engineering) and we go years with the tech basically perfected, but not used, what should be done assuming someone has the resources to produce inoculated mosquitoes?
