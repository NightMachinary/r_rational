Ok, so I want to try and turn a rational irrational hatred of mine into something which has constructive results, who wants to give me suggestions on how to do it? Which hatred is it that has such a weird connotation?

Soccer.

So, being from a European country with a strong soccer tradition, I've grown with this sport in the background of society for all my years of life, and the bias and behaviours of society around it are well marked in my mind.

- The nightly news which take ~1 hours always reserve at least 20 minutes for soccer news which is a disproportionate amount.
- And that's in the days where there isn't an important game, where the news have been just about that instead of serious matters.
- The stadiums built for the european championships have certainly not paid for themselves and are falling apart in certain regions, but there is serious talk about a candidacy for hosting the world cup.
- The team that wins the national championship are invited and go dine with members of the parliament. This does not happen for any other sport.
- Everybody says that they prefer if the money spent on soccer was spent on hospitals, everybody still goes and buys season passes for the games.
- The presidents and managers of team have a high correlation with financial crimes, but people still form cheer squads around them.

And basically all of this? Every time there is any conversation about soccer I have this present in my mind, that's why I called it irrationally rational, because despite the reasons being valid the way I feel about this and experience it, is far stronger than other issues(either smaller or bigger). But I can live with that, it takes a while to explain to curious acquaintances exactly how deep my hate of soccer goes, but eventually they get there.

I just wish there was a way to get some proper output from this, some way to turn this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EddX9hnhDS4][hate]] into something constructive instead of just something I have as an occasional background to events.

Any ideas?
