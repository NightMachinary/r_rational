I'm sorry, but that's quite a bit of armchair sociology.

It justifies the current status quo, but more likely than not hardly corresponds to reality. Different countries have different levels of engagement with sports and their economies, and current socio-economic european status make it unlikely for countries to suddenly go to war due to the lack of sports. And this is ignoring the fact that most of the spending comes from competitions between various national teams.

But most of all, it ignores my question. I said that I'm acknowledging my hate and I live with it, I'm asking for ideas for constructive outlets for it.
