I've actually put most of the plot together in my head already, and written the first five chapters. Her powers are as follows:

- Thinker: Is immune to psychological disorders, and can see them in other people she sees in person.

- Striker/Master: Cures all psych disorders on touch. Can only be turned off if she legitimately believes that having it on will cause more problems than having it off. This power is otherwise involuntary.

Her powers generally classify anything in the DSM as a disorder, adding a few things like Master influence to the list. Her shard is named Conflict Resolution. Conflict Resolution got damaged when Eden collided with the other entity on the way to Earth.

This powerset is super broken in the Wormverse. I never intended it not to be.
