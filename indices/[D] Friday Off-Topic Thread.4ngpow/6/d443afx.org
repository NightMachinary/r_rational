[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinji-quest-bleach-fate-stay-night-crossover.389478/][Shinji Quest]] is coming to a close in the next few days. After writing three arcs and about 50,000 words, I've decided to wrap it up. It's not great writing, but it's a lot more than I have ever done, so I'm proud of it. It ended up being a lot longer, and also a lot easier, than I expected. At my best speed, I was writing 1,000-1,500 words per day--much more than I would have thought possible.
