The concepts of existential risk, value alignment, and decision theory are dealt with a lot in the traditional stories. As a primer, you should probably take a look at "Braiding Sweetgrass" by Robin Wall Kimmerer, which is essentially an introduction (in English) to rationality through Anishinabe and Ongwehonwe stories and teachings. The book has a strong emphasis on decision theory and existential risk, both fields these societies have studied for a very long time (and the English-speaking world is just not catching up on). After reading that book, you might want to read the Haudenoshone Great aw of Peace, which is essentially an attempt to create a value-aligned superorganism.

Unfortunately, I'm much more familiar with Ojibwe stories than Mohawk ones, but once you get into them, there's actually quite a lot of math and science involved. I an quite interested in the Seven Fires "prophecies" (essentially partial instructions for sow to stop the planet from getting paperclipped) and it turns out the "prophecies" are all predictions fo population ecology and game theory, which I and others have had quite a but of success at filling in some of the missing pieces with. If you like I can PM you some of my research in this area (which has been quite well received by many of the Ojibwe carriers of these teachings).
