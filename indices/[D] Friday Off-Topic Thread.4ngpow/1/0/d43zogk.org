Soccer is nationalism. Think of the world cup as a relatively harmless outlet for the sort of pride that once launched European wars (hot and cold, local and colonial). Soccer players are war heroes, their managers are generals, and each are treated as such.

Most people have a fundamental need for causes with allies and enemies... and both war and sport can provide that. For all the money wasted on stadiums, the time wasted on games, and the emotional energy wasted following a ball around a field, better that than reports of wasted lives from the advancing front.
