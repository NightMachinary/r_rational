I don't think it's always true. Take malaria nets, for example. If you donate now, more malaria nets go out, which prevent malaria, which have a bunch of positive effects into the future. Without malaria, people are in theory more productive, get better education, etc., which accelerates development. Your dollar donation pays dividends over time, but they're dividends in terms of good done rather than additional dollars earned. The investment of a dollar into some charity could in theory exceed the investment of a dollar into some low risk fund. You'd have to run the numbers to find out though.
