Nnnooo.... I mean your utility equation can be personally tuned of course, in fact, strictly speaking it could be literally anything, but the classical equation was Jeremy Bentham's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus][Felicific Calculus]].

You'll note the presence of Propinquity there. If your own personal equation puts any nonzero multiplier on that element of the equation, then it becomes possible to solve for an optimal donation time.
