  For most morally good acts, doing an equivalent act now and doing it later are equally good.

I would disagree with this premise on both an intuitive and an economic/mathematical level. You have pretty much inadvertently pointed out the economic reason why this is untrue, so I will try to explain the intuition/common sense reasoning behind this. In general, if you think of a donation as an investment in another person's well being, the logic becomes clear.

- Extreme exaggerated example: starving homeless person on the street. Your investment into charity is time sensitive, that person may be dead if he doesn't get the help sooner. Giving money in the future might make a difference to another person, but that person would be dead, and all the ripples their actions and existence might have made would be gone.

- Moderate example: donating to a scholarship fund. If the fund is able to pay out more and sooner, it could mean the difference of another economically disadvantaged student getting an education. This student will then go on to likely make an impact through the world. Again, the altruistic investment is time sensitive in that the sooner it is made, the sooner another student is able to get an education, and the sooner impacts from another educated student spreads.

In general, actions further into the past can have larger ripples in terms of future benefits and altruistic action is just as much subject to this as money is.

  Why don't charities themselves do it, or do they?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment][They already do]]. If you give to a foundation that works through an endowment, your money will be going to an investment that will pay out over time in a manner designed (at least ideally) to do maximum long term good.

  How do you resolve the weird incentives that always reward delaying your donation?

Can you use your money to invest in yourself more effectively than an altruistic organization can use it to invest in other people that need it? If you are a poor college student working hard to get through college, the answer might be a no, for all but smaller donations to the most efficient charities. If you have a decent salary and its likely to be stable for a while, and there is not anything you can invest your money to improve it (for example more education), the answer is probably yes. For edge cases, your own generosity can be the deciding factor. Of course, I am a grad student living in an area with high rent, so I might be biased because this reasoning gives me an excuse to hold off on any major donations until I have a better source of income.
