There are cumulative effects of charity, but are they exponentially cumulative? Even if they are, is the rate faster than the rate of growth of a reasonably well managed account? If not then the problem stands. Isn't it better to save two hundred starving people in ten years than to save one hundred now? If so then isn't it better to save four hundred starving people in twenty years than two hundred in ten years? Exponents are powerful things.
