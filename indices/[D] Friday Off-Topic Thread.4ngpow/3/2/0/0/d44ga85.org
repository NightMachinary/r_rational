I don't have the exact information or expertise to answer this. My intuition is that if the altruism is done in an effective manner such that you invest in people and encourage "pay it forward" type mentalities, that you should be able to beat interest rates. But I don't have any good justification for this. I think a proper analysis would require careful quantification of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital][human capital]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward][the pay it forward mentality]], and how various forms of charities and altruism interact with these things.
