I have an effective altruism question. For most morally good acts, doing an equivalent act now and doing it later are equally good. You could give a certain amount to charity now, or you could invest it in low risk stocks and bonds and etc and donate an exponentially larger amount later. Is this always a more effective strategy? Why is it not more common? Why don't charities themselves do it, or do they? How do you resolve the weird incentives that always reward delaying your donation? I'm confused.
