In the case of Malaria, it's definitely exponential. Malaria is the second greatest cause of death in human history (after Smallpox. Humanity fuck yeah!). It's so bad that we evolved Sickle-Cell Disease as a /counter/ to it. A gene which causes 25% of children of protected parents to just die in horrible agony is, according to evolution, better than Malaria. Wiping that disease out will have a massive impact on humanity moving forwards.
