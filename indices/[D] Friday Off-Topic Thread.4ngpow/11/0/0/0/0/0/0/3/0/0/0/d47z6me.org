The "chose to disbelieve" was a bit hyperbolic now that I think about it. I was trying to say that I still believe but feel social pressure not to, which is not a good reason to change my belief system but I've been giving into it anyway. I cannot be happy as an atheist because that would mean declaring every experience I've had related to my spiritual beliefs never occurred and will not occur again. I do not believe my conversations with spirits are just fantasy, but as a rationalist I don't seem to be permitted to believe in something that is not verifiable.
