Good answer, but you misunderstand me. I do not want to stop following my spiritual beliefs. In fact, I'm unhappy with how far I've drifted from them already. It sounds irrational, I know, but I am not capable of being both happy and a materialist atheist so I'm seeking a way continue following my spiritual beliefs and receive the happiness benefits from them once again.

The problem is I now think it is good (or at least rational) to be materialist atheist, so I have cut myself off from my spirituality without really wanting to. From my perspective, all my paranormal experiences are still true but I feel I am forbidden from believing they have occurred. You chose to disbelieve, I did not.
