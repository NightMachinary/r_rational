  You can tell me my beliefs are irrational all you like, but my map of the territory is constructed from my knowledge and experiences. I can be skeptical of extraordinary claims and surrender to the scientific consensus, but you're trying to convince me to stop believing in and practicing what has essentially been my religion for the past decade. It would be easier if I could see any detriment to my current belief system

I mean if you want to believe claims even if they seem irrational then no one can force you not to. But it will be a problem if you want to use them as argument when having some debate where its expected to provide evidence.
