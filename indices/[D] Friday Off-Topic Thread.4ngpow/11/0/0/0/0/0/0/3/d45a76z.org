  but it's like telling a religious person that prayer doesn't do anything when they've been doing it all their life and have a hundred memories of it working. How do you convince them to stop believing prayer has power?

Quite simply, you teach them statistics. This might seem like a rude or glib answer, but I promise I'm being sincere. I grew up in a family whose wiccan magic "worked", and while I never bought into it 100% there were still a lot of things that made me wonder. That is, until I learned how to reason about chance events. "It couldn't be a coincidence" just isn't a convincing argument when you understand some probability. I know it's not easy and that a lot of people will refuse to make the connection even if they do learn statistics, but it can work on people who are willing to go back and evaluate their experiences honestly.

A more practical method is probably [[http://www.streetepistemology.com/][street epistemology]]. Ask them about their particular experiences, and then figure out if those experiences really required a divine hand to happen. Talk to them about how they come to the truth normally, and get them to critically examine what their experiences imply. Some times it's as easy as reminding someone that "unexplained" really means unexplained, not supernatural.
