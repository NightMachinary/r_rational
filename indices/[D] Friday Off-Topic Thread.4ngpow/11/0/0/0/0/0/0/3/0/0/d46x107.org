Alright, considering that you're leaning in that direction anyways, how sure are you that you can't be happy as a materialist atheist? As someone who had clinical depression and didn't think I could be happy with anything, you'd be very surprised what a change in perspective can do for you.

I'm not a mental health professional by any stretch of the imagination, but if you feel like telling me why you can't be happy with materialism maybe I can help you examine your reasoning.

  You chose to disbelieve, I did not.

I sincerely try to never pick and choose my beliefs. If you think that I don't believe in the supernatural as a matter of preference, then I'd like to fill you in my epistemology because it's certainly not that.
