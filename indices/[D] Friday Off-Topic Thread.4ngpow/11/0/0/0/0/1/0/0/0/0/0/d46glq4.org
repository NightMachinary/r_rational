Unless a rapist was deranged enough to actually believe their victim wanted that, then no I would not let them off. Unless they are mentally ill they should be prosecuted to fullest extent of the law. If they were mentally ill I would want them to get help, even if their illness had led to them committing a crime as horrible as rape.
