There are two things I've seen skeptics criticize Sylvia Browne for. First, she was a celebrity psychic who they feel did harm to people by offering answers to their questions when her predictions had been proven false. Second, she never participated in James Randi's Million Dollar challenge despite repeatedly claiming she would, which they believe is proof she's a fraud. I'm ambivalent towards her since her books introduced my Mom and me to many of our current spiritual beliefs and practices, which I believe to have independently verified. Well, as much as you can verify spiritual beliefs.

If she was a fraud, then I'm confused why some of the stuff she said appears to be accurate. If she wasn't a fraud, then I'm disappointed that I lack any means to prove it and am not sure what to make of the more...esoteric things she said about the physical world. Sylvia Browne's meditation techniques and claims about the spiritual purpose of life are harmless enough, but she was an avid promoter of physical paranormal phenomena like psychic mediums, indigo children, UFOs, Atlantis, and vitalism. I never got the impression she distrusted modern medicine, but she certainly supported reiki healing.
