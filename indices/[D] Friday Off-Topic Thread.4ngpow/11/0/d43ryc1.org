I'm speaking here as someone who has no context of Sylvia Brown and most of the sceptic organizations except tangentially, but I would point out that even the responses to that comment seem to imply that it's pretty much a typical "reddit comment very emphatically putting opinions as facts".

Some people mention and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_%28author%29#Wire_fraud_case][wikipedia corroborates]] something about a wire fraud case, but that doesn't seem related to his veracity in condemning pseudoscience.

Unfortunately sceptics like everybody else can still perform non-legal and non-ethical decisions, so if you can separate his initial arguments from his persona you should still be able to evaluate it calmly. If on the other hand you felt that part of the arguments were based on a measure of trust from his part which is now broken by knowing his illegal actions, there certainly must be some other people who approach the same issue from different angles.
