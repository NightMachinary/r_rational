Maybe the lack of showmanship is how she convinced so many she was genuine. In what I've seen, which isn't a lot, she presents an image of humility and commonality. She didn't claim to be anyone special and insisted everyone had the same potential as her, she was just someone who had managed to access it and wanted to share her gift.

Something that bothers me about how disgusted people are with her is that even if she was a fraud, it remains entirely possible that she believed what she was spouting. Her grandmother claimed to be psychic as well and Browne was very close to her as a child. She admitted that's how she got started on her own path, so doesn't that imply she wasn't a con artist?
