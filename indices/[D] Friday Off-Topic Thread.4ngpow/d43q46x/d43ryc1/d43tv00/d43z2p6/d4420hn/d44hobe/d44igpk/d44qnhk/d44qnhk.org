Well do you think a person should be considered a murderer and suffer the sanctions applied to murderer even if they don't know that they're actually killing people? Should a person be considered a rapist and suffer the sanctions applied to rapist even if they don't know they're actually raping people?

Besides, mens rea is usually difficult to prove without obtaining a warrant for evidence like private communiques, so I don't think we can come to any conclusions about that. And in the absence of more evidence, I'm going to say yes, sanctions should still be applied to the ignorant.
