So to summarise, you are happy with your belief system because it brings happiness benefits, but at the same time don't want to be taken for a ride by charismatic charlatans who practice some of the things endorsed in your belief system. Well, it's certainly a novel problem, but I'm really not sure I can give a solution aside from to find people who have similar beliefs to you while still forming accurate judgements about the world, and asking them how they go about it.
