Want it to be even more novel? I [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/][believe in belief]] in science and rationality. I believe it is right and good to hold your belief system to such standards, so I act as if I were an atheist and tell myself not to feel the way I do about my spiritual beliefs. Because science says things like reiki doesn't heal better than a placebo and psychics don't predict anything better than random chance, I tell myself it's wrong to believe in them even if I remember experiencing those things myself. I can't even talk to the spirits I normally do when I'm in this state because the only reason I have to believe they're real are my subjective experiences.

However, since my spiritual beliefs were never based on objective evidence in the first place I eventually wind up believing in them again and feeling happy. That is, until I run up against rationality again, then the cycle repeats and I end up feeling depressed all over again. This has happened at least three times in the past year. I'm stuck in a paradox as I cannot completely submit myself to science and rationality, not can I completely reject them in favor of my own beliefs. The best compromise I have is dualism, but even that is irrational.
