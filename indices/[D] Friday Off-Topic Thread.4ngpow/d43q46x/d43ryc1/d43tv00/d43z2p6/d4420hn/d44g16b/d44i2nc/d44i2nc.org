I am aware of the evidence against reiki's effectiveness, though I did not know it had been proven to warm up your hands. The problem is that I already believe reiki is capable of healing because I practice it, though I NEVER suggest it as an alternative to science-based medicine. It's not that I'm biased towards the evidence against it, I trust science and its debunked things I believed before, but it's like telling a religious person that prayer doesn't do anything when they've been doing it all their life and have a hundred memories of it working. How do you convince them to stop believing prayer has power?

You can tell me my beliefs are irrational all you like, but my map of the territory is constructed from my knowledge and experiences. I can be skeptical of extraordinary claims and surrender to the scientific consensus, but you're trying to convince me to stop believing in and practicing what has essentially been my religion for the past decade. It would be easier if I could see any detriment to my current belief system, but I've already abandoned the pseudoscience associated with New Age spiritualism. Questioning the purely spiritual beliefs has brought me nothing but depression and existential crises with no solutions.

In /The Righteous Mind/ by Jonathan Haidt (my favorite sociology book ever), the author theorizes that religious belief has a genetic component. I'm inclined to believe the same since, in my experience, atheists lack a fundamental understanding of religion and why people follow it. Perhaps they have no psychological need of it, and good on them for living their own way, but I cannot live that way because I do need religion. Unless I am diagnosed with a mental illness that causes delusions, I cannot cease to believe my religious experiences have happened because they are important to my identity and worldview.
