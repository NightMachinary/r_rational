Sylvia is particularly gross (to me) because she doesn't care. Most of these sorts of frauds have some showmanship to them. They at least care enough about the art of cold reading to put in some effort. Sylvia doesn't appear to give any fucks about what she's saying, or the people she's saying it to. She'll just say whatever, flatly, and to hell with the audience or the mark. I mean, just look at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKyzBe0CA2Q][these pathetic displays]].

Some of the stuff she said appears accurate because she spews a prodigious amount of stuff that's general enough to get some occasional hits. Law of averages.
