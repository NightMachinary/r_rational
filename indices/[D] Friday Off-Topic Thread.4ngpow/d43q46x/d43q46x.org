I found [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/4neenp/an_honest_liar_awardwinning_documentary_about/d43glp9][this post]] today and I want to confirm if there's any truth to it. If you'd like some background about my belief system, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4mda32/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d3umkmc][see last week's thread.]]

  The most fascinating thing about the Sylvia Brown saga is that the high-profile "skeptics" who spoke out against her, such as Karen Stollznow, Rebecca Watson and Brian Dunning, all ended up being frauds and grifters themselves, running their own money-making scams of one kind or another.

I listen to Skeptoid quite a lot. Brian Dunning politely explained to me why the pseudoscience I believed was false, or at least unscientific, and I thanked him for giving me an existential crisis. I actually stopped believing what I'd learned from Sylvia Brown because of him. Now I'm confused what to believe once again.
