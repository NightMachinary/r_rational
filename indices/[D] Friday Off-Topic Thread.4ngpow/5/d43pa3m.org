/Do you make any changes to stories that you download? Or do you stick to whatever your downloading service provides to you?/

Typically, after downloading and trimming a story's .html files, I just standardize chapter headings--=<h1>Story</h1>= and =<h2>01. Chapter</h2>=, or =<h1>1. Story</h1>=, =<h2>01. Part</h2>=, =<h3>001. Chapter</h3>=, =<h4>01. Section</h4>=, etc., depending on how the story is laid out. My .epub reading and editing programs ([[https://sourceforge.net/projects/crengine][CoolReader]] and [[https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil][Sigil]]) lag rather badly with files larger than about a megabyte, so I also break stories into pieces if necessary. For example, my copy of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/ is divided into three files: chapters 1-73 (through the story's first climax--673 KB), 74-132 (through the story's second climax(es?)--592 KB), and 133-173 (epilogues and author's notes--375 KB). On the other hand, I may consolidate several closely-related stories into one file, if they're short. For example, my copies of the books composing the /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185][Harry the Hufflepuff]]/ trilogy are in a single 181-KB file.

Occasionally, I'll make a more significant change if it's easy to accomplish with =Ctrl=+=F= or =Ctrl=+=H=. For example, after searching for =<p>'= and " '" (note: leading and trailing spaces don't show up in this site's =code= formatting) in /[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893][Mother of Learning]]/, I manually changed every instance of 'inner monologue' to /inner monologue/ in the copy of its first two arcs that I made a few days ago. I haven't yet gotten around to making a thorough, fully-personalized edit of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/, though I definitely plan to do so at some point (he said as he looked at his two-year-old, ten-percent-complete "Time Braid Editing" folder).

[[http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/08/24/sad-puppies-3-looking-at-the-results][A fair amount of ink]] has been spilled on the debasement (or "progress") of the big science-fiction awards, and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333324][Ancillary Justice]]/, among other works, has been held up as an example of an undeserving winner of those awards. I read the book many months before I became aware of any hullabaloo surrounding it--IIRC, I first learned of it through the biography blurb at the end of a general-science-fiction article written by its author--and actually liked it a fair amount. Nowadays, though, I can't remember anything about it, beyond the many-bodied natures of its protagonist and its villain. I'd even forgotten about its use of =she= as the neuter-gender English pronoun until I saw it mentioned a few months ago.

I probably should re-read it, to see whether it really is as mediocre as it's made out to be. I read only for shallow entertainment, though, rather than for any deep appreciation, so maybe it's an issue to be decided by the /real/ science-fiction fans...

Some writers on [[/r/NarutoFanfiction][r/NarutoFanfiction]] made nice demonstrations of good English as presented by Team Seven: [[http://np.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/4n5rhl][1]] [[http://np.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/4n70ec][2]]
