I also read /Ancillary Justice/ before the whole Puppies thing percolated into my consciousness, and I enjoyed it quite a bit, personally. The neuter-gender pronouns was an interesting exercise in exploring personal biases (a couple friends had read the book as well, and we compared notes on which characters were male or female in our minds and why we saw them that way), but I found the world building and unique protagonist perspective to be really what made it a worthwhile read.

It didn't blow my mind or anything, but it definitely stood out in positive ways compared to some of the other science fiction I've read in the past few years. Enough to read the sequel and have the third in my possession, once my reading list thins out enough to get to it.
