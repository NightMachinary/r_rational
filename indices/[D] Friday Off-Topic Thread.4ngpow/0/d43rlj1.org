God /damn/, writing this first chapter is tough for me.

Or, I suppose I should say:

God /damn/, I have high standards for this first chapter.

I've been working on chapter one of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4h1z3x/q_gven_the_many_stories_that_have_come_through/][my thermonuclear magical girl story]], but due to a bunch things I'm about to vent and whine about I haven't finished it yet, despite being like a month behind where I want to be.

- A member of my family came to visit, which was rare for this particular member, and because of activities before, during, and after the visit I didn't make any progress.

- I had a serious case of the flu, which didn't help at all.

- Learning about nuclear physics took longer than expected (but was worth it).

- Learning about the development of nuclear weapons, reactors and policies took longer than expected (but was worth it).

- Fifty-percent chance I have /too many/ beta readers, who will make too many great suggestions and incorporating them will delay the chapter even more.

- I was 5k words into the chapter when I diagnosed the biggest problem and had to delete the last 3k words and start over (essentially, bad character introductions led to tone problems across scenes).

- On top of all that, this is the first time I'm going to publish something and I know I won't do it justice for one reason or another, but I've resolved to grit my teeth and bear it.

- Also, the nagging that an actual nuclear physicist or student will appear in the comments and reveal some extreme plot hole I missed. You can never tell with this sub.

I'd hate to say I've bitten off more than I can chew, but trying to fuse elements of magical girl fiction, nuclear physics, and Greek tragedy is slow going.
