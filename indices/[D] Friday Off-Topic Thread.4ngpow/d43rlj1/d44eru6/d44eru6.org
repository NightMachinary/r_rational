We've all been there. If it wasn't for my self-imposed one-chapter-per-month schedule, I can't imagine how many chapters I'd be behind due to life events and constant rewriting.

Remember that HPMOR's first chapter contained nowhere near all the amazing depth and storytelling of the rest of it, and that many people read it anyway. Furthermore, published authors go through extensive rewrites both of their own volition and the editors before publishing. By publishing our stories one chapter at a time online, we can't expect them to be as perfect as we'd want them to be, and at some point have to just accept that and move on.

Good luck!
