Eventually you just have to get it out there. I have a tendency to work and rework things, but eventually I just get to a point where I'm losing interest without having actually produced all that much, or I'm reworking without actually improving. I have no idea whether you're at that point or not, but just be aware that polish has diminishing returns.
