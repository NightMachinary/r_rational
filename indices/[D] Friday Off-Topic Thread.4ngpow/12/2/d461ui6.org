I'll try to respond to all of this, but bear with me as the answer will get long. The tl;dr is that no, you are not plagiarizing. You might or might not be committing copyright violation, depending on how much you change, but no one will care.

*Fanfiction, original work, and readership*

As [[/u/Cariyaga]] pointed out, I've taken fanfiction that I wrote, turned it into publishable original work, and made money from it. IANAL, but I have some knowledge of copyright and how it works.

Also as [[/u/Cariyaga]] pointed out, the readership of a fanfiction starts with the entirety of that fandom on that publication medium (FFN, [[/r/rational]], Amazon, etc) and is then reduced by your marketing (title, blurb, long description, where you advertise it, etc). Original fiction, on the other hand, starts with a readership of zero and is increased by your marketing. That's an oversimplification, but it draws the analogy. Point is, it's a lot harder to get people to read original fiction.

As specific examples from my experience: getting people to read 2YE and discuss it was pretty straightforward. It was a D&D fanfic, so people knew what to expect. Getting people to read and discuss my first original series (The Change Storms) was really hard.

  Keeping the same character relationships, and basically only changing the names and Hogwarts a bit, do you think it would be plagiarism

Again, IANAL. No, it is not plagiarism. Plagiarism is when you use substantial sections of someone else's works with no or very minor changes. Depending on how much you change this would either be original or, at most, a derivative work. According to the [[http://bit.do/b669H][US Copyright Office]] (shortened because character limit):

#+begin_quote
  A derivative work is a work based on or derived from one or more already existing works. Common derivative works include translations, musical arrangements, motion picture versions of literary material or plays, art reproductions, abridgments, and condensations of preexisting works.

If you start from, e.g. HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the following blurbs would be a derivative and original work respectively:

  Bob, who happens to be a tennis master, gets a job as a guard at Azkaban. The story focuses on his reactions to prisoners suffering from dementor effects. One day, a prisoner named Sirius Black escapes by turning himself into a dog. Not wanting to lose his job, Bob pursues. He watches Sirius grab a kid and drag him into a shack. Bob rushes in, stuns Sirius, and calls the police. Before the police can arrive, the kid explains that Sirius is actually the good guy, Scabbers (his rat) is actually the villain Peter Pettigrew, and that Peter is the one who committed the crime Sirius went to jail for. Peter has just fled the scene, but Bob chases him down, captures him, and drags him back to the shack, hands him over to the cops, and clears Sirius's name.

  Bob, who happens to be a tennis master, gets a job as a guard at Rikers Island. The story focuses on his reactions to prisoners suffering from the psychological effects of long-term incarceration. One day, a prisoner named Thomas Dobson escapes by swimming across the river to the Bronx. Not wanting to lose his job, Bob chases after him. He watches Thomas break into a warehouse. Bob rushes in, knocks Thomas out, and calls the police. Before the police can arrive, the kid explains that Thomas is his father and Bill Johnson (the man Thomas was holding at gunpoint) is the villain who committed the crime Thomas was sent to jail for. Bill has fled the scene, but Bob chases him down, captures him, and drags him back to the shack to hand him over to the cops and clear Thomas's name.

The original story has the same story beats as the original but it uses none of the names or places and is therefore an original work instead of a derivative. You have not plagiarized or committed copyright violation, and you can feel free to publish and/or make money from it.

*What will people think if you publish this thing*

If you're publishing for free, no one will care that it's a derivative work. If you're publishing for money, things get hairier. I'll speak from my own experience:

2YE started off as a parody of D&D. It used the D&D rules system and spell / magic item names, but the setting and all the characters were original. I probably could have published it (for money) as-is because it was parody, but I chose to change the names and rules details just to be safe.

The reaction was mixed. Some people supported me on it, but some were violently opposed to me wanting to make money off writing that had originally been free. The opposers were far more outspoken than the supporters because that's how people are. Many of the attacks were (or at least felt) ad hominem and hit pretty hard. I did not agree with them and left the book for sale.

I was eventually reminded that, when I originally published 2YE on FFN, I had promised to keep it free permanently; I value my word so I took it out of the Kindle Unlimited program and made it freely available again. (It's still for sale as well as being free, but that's fine with Amazon as long as it's not in KU.)

The lesson you should take from this: if you might want to make money off of it, make that clear up front with a disclaimer like "I might publish this at some point." If you don't have plans to do so, never promise it will always be free. If you do publish for money, expect that you'll get some hate. When you do, breathe through it and do what you think is appropriate.

What you've got sounds like an interesting plot, and I look forward to reading it.
