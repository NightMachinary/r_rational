Fanfiction gets you a lot of audience that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get. There are lots of people who a perfectly willing to check out a Harry Potter fanfic, but there are a lot fewer people willing to check out a story in a completely foreign setting. Some of this is a matter of investment (fanfic readers are already invested in the setting and character), but there are other contributing factors as well. Basically, fanfic is the path of least resistance. /With that said/, there are lots of benefits to writing something that's not fanfic. Selling it on the open market is definitely one of them, but there are others, like the ability to grow your own community and (possibly) get an expanded non-fanfic readership. The trade-off in terms of audience is basically that making fanfic gets you more readers, but limits the total potential pool of readers.

As an author, I think fanfic readers can be a little bit annoying sometimes, specifically because they have more investment in the setting and characters than in your particular story. One of the reasons I find myself writing a lot less fanfic these days is that I'm stuck between either satisfying that need for rigor and adherence to the group, or getting stuff in my inbox about how much I've failed to adhere to canon/fanon.

As for plagiarism and/or copyright infringement ... you can do a reskin, but a reskin isn't necessarily enough. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Grotter][Tanya Grotter]], for example. You can /to some extent/ hide behind the parody part of fair use, but that's going to be hard if you're not actually writing a parody.

My advice would be to take what you like about the idea, break it down, and then build it back up. This will also be helpful for when you want to write the story, so it might be helpful to do that even if you're going to write fanfic.
