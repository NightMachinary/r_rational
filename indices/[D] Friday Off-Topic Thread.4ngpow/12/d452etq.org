I independently conceived of a story that's basically [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yiegk/rtbst_rational_harry_potter_with_schoolage/][this]]. I hesitate to start it, though, because it's fanfiction; I'd be limiting my audience before I even wrote the first paragraph. Keeping the same character relationships, and basically only changing the names and Hogwarts a bit, do you think it would be plagiarism for me to turn the idea into an original story? Do you agree that doing so makes strategic sense for the terminal goal of having a widely shareable story?
