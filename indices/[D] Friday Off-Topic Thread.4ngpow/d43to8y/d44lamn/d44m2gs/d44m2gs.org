Sort of. You can release a new genetically engineered organism engineered in such a way to drive a gene that reverses the previous engineering. It has a number of problems though. Primarily that any effects the engineered organism has had on the environment will stick around. For example my biggest fear with something like this is that if you release a small enough fraction of the population it may be tens of years before the trait covers the entire population and in that time Malaria might evolve resistance somehow.
