  Hard to go on the run or make a breakout when you're a 5 year old.

Why pick 5? It's even harder to escape when you're minus four weeks old, and dependent on an umbilical cord for survival.

  In times of famine I de-age members of the community
#+end_quote

Is there any particular reason to wait for a famine to start? Why not apply some of the ideas you've mentioned for livestock, and determine at what age humans put on the most weight per year, and generally have people stay at their age of fastest growth?

  What happens to a pregnant animal when it is aged?
#+end_quote

Complications. The nanotech doesn't induce births (or youthen a pregnant animal beyond what can carry its young). As long as the 1% error odds don't pop up, then a fetus is only aged to roughly minus one day, plus or minus some, depending on how long a fetus can safely remain unborn. There will have been a few cases where immediate caesarian sections were necessary to protect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postterm_pregnancy][the health]] of both the mother and post-third-trimester offspring, but so far, no cases of mothers pregnant with toddlers-or-older.

  A foetus?
#+end_quote

While it's younger than the equivalent of an eight-months human pregnancy, the nanotech seems perfectly willing to age or youthen it, to the point of returning to single-egg stage (and possibly even putting it back in the ovaries). If a fetus is ever aged past that point, the nanotech won't youthen it beyond that point again.
