  I'm not really.. sure how foetus incarceration would work, but wouldn't it be really awkward for the mother?

Say that after the occasional oddball 1% accident, and some further experimentation, it's learned that the nanotech is able to manage cross-species gestation, as long as the sizes are reasonable. So if you wanted to put your prisoners inside goats, that could probably be made to work.

  Plus teenaged humans are rebellious at least partly because of hormones.

Mua ha ha. :)

  So you could inseminate a cow for example, age both to term, then do the birth, then age the calf and de-age the mother for extremely rapid husbandry?
#+end_quote

Almost, yes; the nanotech doesn't really add new information into an aged-up brain, so the rapidly-aged calf might barely know how to breathe, let alone stand, let alone breed. But if you're going for rapid species modification, that's probably a tolerable state for the intervening generations, as long as you aren't too worried about the lack of any selection pressure on the species' mental abilities.

  rampaging abominations (I'm assuming you have those)

There are monsters aplenty, yes.

  Run hornets through a few thousand generations until they instinctually defend humans and attack anything else in a particular area around the hive, and give them massive stingers.

The rapid breeding is simple enough; how do you figure breeding for that sort of trait could be done?
