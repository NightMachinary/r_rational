  The rapid breeding is simple enough; how do you figure breeding for that sort of trait could be done?
#+end_quote

It would take a while, and probably be quite painful. You'd need to have different species in an area they could access, then only breed from that ones that prioritise attacking other species than humans. Then you'd need to iterate until they no longer attack humans at all. It would take bloody ages and involve a lot of people getting stung.

Other potential methods involve covering humans in don't-attack pheremones, then slowly reducing the level of pheremones and breeding from the ones that continue not attacking humans until the levels are so miniscule that you can spray someone once and have it work for weeks.

I'll be honest, the whole hornets thing is slightly dubious. It may or may not actually be possible. Someone with more knowledge of bugs would have to step in.

  Say that after the occasional oddball 1% accident, and some further experimentation, it's learned that the nanotech is able to manage cross-species gestation, as long as the sizes are reasonable. So if you wanted to put your prisoners inside goats, that could probably be made to work.

Doesn't that have a rather large risk of miscarriage killing your prisoners? Also, for a 10 year sentence they'd need to run that 1% chance 120 times, which is rather poor odds. To say nothing of sensory deprivation sending the inmates mad. There's a reason solitary is used as punishment. Solitary with no lights or possibly even a sense of touch would be hell.

If food is /that/ much of a concern you may as well just call it a death sentence, and de-age em for the meat.
