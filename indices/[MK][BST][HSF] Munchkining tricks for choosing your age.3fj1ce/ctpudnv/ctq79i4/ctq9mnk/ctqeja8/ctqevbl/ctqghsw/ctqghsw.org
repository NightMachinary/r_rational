  the whole hornets thing is slightly dubious. It may or may not actually be possible

At least narratively, it's the sort of project that somebody might submit an application to use some time with the nanotech for, even if they don't end up with anything useful.

  a rather large risk of miscarriage

(Technical pedantry: As we're dealing with fetuses in the late-30's-weeks instead of pre-20, the preferred term seems to be 'stillbirth' rather than 'miscarriage'.)

Fair enough - those are all good reasons not to set your prisoner's ages to the minuses. Do you have any thoughts on sending them through the nanotech to end up somewhere between 0 and 1 year of age, with or without an option to age them back up after a certain length of time?
