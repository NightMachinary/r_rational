  "Pound of flesh" or "biomass"?

The only way that's been found to replenish the nanotech's reserves is to send someone (or some critter) through and make them young enough to be smaller. The nanotech doesn't seem to bother doing anything to plants. Wasps could work, according to what's known; cut leaves wouldn't.

  can you clarify the "1% error rate"?
#+end_quote

A lot can happen to a person when they grow older - different amounts of exercise, or injuries, or food intake, can lead to radically different bodies. For about 2/3rds of that 1%, the 'error' is the nanotech's reconstruction assuming you were a couch potato, or something similarly benign and easily reversible. Many of the remaining errors are, apparently, the nanotech picking an age at random, again with reasonably benign results. Almost all of the remainder involve setting the target prenatal, which is rather awkward for mammals even if a female with a large enough uterus is within the nanotech's range. There are a few individual outliers - eg, a chimerical lifeform having one part of their body rebuilt with the genes from another part, or someone set to old age with a dementia that remained even when their age was brought back to young adulthood.
