  Conservation of mass still exists; for every pound that's added to a creature, a pound of flesh has to have been removed from some other creature. How do you see this issue being solved?

"Pound of flesh" or "biomass"?

If the former: different meats are of different quality. A hive of wasps is now several steaks, etc...

If the latter, then a small-medium tree is worth a cow. Hell, you don't even need to cut down the trees. Collect several tens of tons of leaves in the autumn, feed you and your family on high quality meat and have lots left over for sale. Start paying people 1kg of beef/chicken/pork/mutton per 50kg of leaves/grass they bring you. Hire people to operate your slaughterhouse.

Edit: can you clarify the "1% error rate"? What happens in an error; do you get a randomly assigned age within a valid range, or what?
