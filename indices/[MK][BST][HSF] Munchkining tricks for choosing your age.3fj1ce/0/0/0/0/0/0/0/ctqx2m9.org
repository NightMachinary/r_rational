  Fair enough - those are all good reasons not to set your prisoner's ages to the minuses. Do you have any thoughts on sending them through the nanotech to end up somewhere between 0 and 1 year of age, with or without an option to age them back up after a certain length of time?

You'd need to wetnurse them and change their nappies, and babies require feeding every few hours. Plus they're really fragile and freeze to death or overheat comparatively easily if you're not careful. And they have special dietary requirements. Can't feed em on just grain or meat. You know how new parents look about 6 months in? All haggard and like they haven't slept since the dawn of time? All the jail guards/nurses would be like that. Plus, the screaming of babies is basically programmed to be really annoying and un-ignorable. Your guards/nurses would not be happy bunnies, and you'd need a lot more of them to keep all the inmates fed/changed/healthy/warm. Plus the inmates would suffer mental deterioration from being unable to turn pages to read or use their voices to talk. It would not be an effective way to rehabilitate people.

On the flipside you'd save on space. Maybe food as well depending on if more guards/nurses eat more than the difference between how much babies and 5 year olds eat. I wouldn't use it for people you want to still be useful members of society afterwards though. Maybe as some kind of particularly horrible punishment for people who society has decided deserve a fate worse than death. Basically solitary confinement except also with a complete loss of dignity. Personally, I think fates worse than death are immoral and inefficient but who knows that a post-apocalyptic society would decide.

If I were to be an inmate in such a system, being turned into a baby would make me resentful in a way that just being a kid wouldn't.

TL:DR I don't think the benefits outweigh the downsides.
