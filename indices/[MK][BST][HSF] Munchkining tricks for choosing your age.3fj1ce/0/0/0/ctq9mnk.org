Glad to be of help.

1. Five mainly so they could feed themselves and take care of themselves without requiring excessive manpower. Three would probably work just as well. I'm not really.. sure how foetus incarceration would work, but wouldn't it be really awkward for the mother? Especially if she starts feeling protective.

2. Humans are inefficient at adding biomass compared to animals. If you've got spare food, better to feed it to animals if biomass is the goal. Plus teenaged humans are rebellious at least partly because of hormones.

So you could inseminate a cow for example, age both to term, then do the birth, then age the calf and de-age the mother for extremely rapid husbandry? Allowing you to change species extremely quickly?

Well that's even better. Run hornets through a few thousand generations until they instinctually defend humans and attack anything else in a particular area around the hive, and give them massive stingers. Then use them as a defensive/warning measure against rampaging abominations (I'm assuming you have those). If the particulars of Hornet farming make that impractical, do it with type of bug. Like a wasp, or a scorpion.
