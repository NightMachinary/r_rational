As interesting a thought as that might be, I'm trying to describe a line being drawn at the 8/9ths of a pregnancy mark, a line which can be crossed by making younger fetuses older, but can't be crossed the other way. So you don't have to worry about trying to fit an adult's mind into a blastocyst-or-smaller.
