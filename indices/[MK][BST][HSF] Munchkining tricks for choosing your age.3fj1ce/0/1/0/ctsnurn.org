When an animal is de-aged and made smaller, the pounds it loses don't vanish into thin air - they're stored by the nanotech, as a resource to use when it takes some person or critter and makes them older and heavier. If the nanotech runs out of that reserve, it loses some of its functionality - it can't make anything bigger without the biomass to make it bigger /with/. The point of keeping the livestock at the age where they put on the mass the fastest, is to put as much biomass in the nanotech's reserve as fast as possible, to maximize the uses to which the nanotech can be put. (Such as the rapid breeding proposals mentioned elsewhere in the thread.)
