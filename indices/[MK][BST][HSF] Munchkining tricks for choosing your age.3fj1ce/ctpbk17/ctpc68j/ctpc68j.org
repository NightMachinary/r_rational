In theory, there's some potential there, but in practice... <scratches head> Is there actually any known way to build, say, a half-adder circuit out of organic parts that are part of a living animal, let alone anything as complicated as a Commodore 64's CPU? Or are there any oddball organisms, such as some sort of starfish, whose nervous systems can be tricked into doing computations?
