Ah, yes, HeLa. I knew it was a cell line, I'd forgotten it was cancerous.

After checking a few quick references, it appears that the effort required to keep an immortal cell line like that alive in a controlled medium, let alone reproducing to the point of adding a full pound of such cells, is moderately significant; at least, in comparison to the amount of resources required to get a goat to add a pound of bodyweight.

If someone's goal is to add the greatest amount of organic stuff to the nanotech's reserves for the least amount of effort invested, then as best as I can tell, livestock handily beats out cultivated cancer. (Post-apocalypse, agar is a bit hard to come by; and even if it weren't, putting together a proper growth medium would seem to require a few more human work-hours than letting some goats graze in a field.) But it was certainly worth checking that - and I look forward to any other off-the-wall ideas you, or anyone reading this thread, can propose.
