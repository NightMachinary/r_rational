Now we're starting to cook. :)

#+begin_quote
  rapidly age animals to get their meat to market faster?

Conservation of mass still exists; for every pound that's added to a creature, a pound of flesh has to have been removed from some other creature. How do you see this issue being solved?

#+begin_quote
  Lure your enemies close and de-age them into infants or senile seniors?
#+end_quote

Depending on how much intel said enemies have gathered on where the nanotech is, certainly a possibility.

#+begin_quote
  You could probably pull off some tricks involving aging children to optimal 'soldiering' age if you need an army fast?
#+end_quote

The nanotech can age their bodies up - their minds will still be, as far as can be told, what they originally were. Adult-bodied child-soldiers may be a bit tricky to integrate into an overall defense plan.

#+begin_quote
  There's probably others I'm not thinking of.
#+end_quote

Almost certainly, which is why I started the thread. :)
