Alright;

When an error occurs that results in a younger age, the only known examples involve the subject ending up at an age other than the desired one. Eg, if someone wanted to drop 20 years, they might just drop 2; or if someone wanted to be de-aged a week, to just before they broke their arm, they might end up back in diapers, or pre-natal. Assuming that the subject isn't inside a womb, then being run through the nanotech again, whether to de-age or re-age, seems to incur the same chance of error as usual.

With those examples to build your mental model of, what error rates would you find acceptable for what sorts of usage patterns?
