Saying that there's a 1% chance that it will do something other than what was requested is very badly-defined. Why is there a 1% chance it arbitrarily chooses to do something else in the first place? In the OP you say that it's not the age you asked for. And elsewhere in the replies you seem to imply that that 1% of the time there's a uniform distribution over possible ages, at least that it is /just/ a distribution over all possible ages. But now here you're saying that it would make arbitrary changes in your brain? You're being inconsistent.
