I'm trying to be consistent - I just often explain myself badly, and occasionally need to describe my ideas in several ways to get them across.

When a 1%-chance error hits, and the nanotech decides to age the subject critter-or-person without following the usual standards, it has a number of options open to it. The nanotech might age up the subject as if they were a complete couch potato; or as if they'd spent the intervening years training for marathons; or as if they'd gone everywhere by hopping on the left foot. Each such scenario leads to a somewhat different bodyplan. The extent of the mental changes I suggested were the ones that most closely follow a similar pattern; and, mostly, are ones which are tied to physical development, such as the brain's sensory and motor homunculi.
