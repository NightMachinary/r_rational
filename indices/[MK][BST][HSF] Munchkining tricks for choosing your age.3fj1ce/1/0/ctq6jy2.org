  How does the neural hardware work
#+end_quote

The nanotech pulls some tricks so that a full set of skills, experiential memories, associations, and all the other parts of an adult mind fit into a smaller skull, and will still be in place once the youthened individual grows back up. Maintaining the person's full mental identity comes at the cost of the advantages that usually come with a younger brain.

That said, there are still a /few/ tricks that can be played with brains. If I'm not mistaken, if a person spends years studying a particular skill, then associated parts of their brain may grow larger than they otherwise would, which is something that can be played with by anyone willing to experiment with letting the nanotech do more to their mind than keep it intact. (And remembering that there's roughly a 1% chance that the nanotech will do something other than what was requested.)
