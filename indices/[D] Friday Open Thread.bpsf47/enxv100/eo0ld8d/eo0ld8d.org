Hm, hard to say. Probably depends on a) your race, and b) the country you're in. If you look Arab or so you'll probably have it worse in some places, while in others you'll literally just blend in with the locals if you're on the lighter skin end of the spectrum. I don't think there's much against Asian people, especially Chinese/Japanese/Korean, but that depends on the country possibly. Black people... depends, again, but my guess is in that case origin would matter more than looks. In Italy at least you may be looked down upon if you're African, but whip out an American accent and I expect that to change. Though dunno how things changed in these last years, it's not gotten pretty.
