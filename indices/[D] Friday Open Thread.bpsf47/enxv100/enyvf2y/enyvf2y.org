A showerthought: let's say I wanted to create the ground rules of a science-fictional universe which has lots of culturally distinct civilizations.

Right away there is a problem to overcome: the very first intelligent life form that arises is probably going to come millions or billions of years before all the others (because the creation of life is such a rare event). That head start gives it an enormous technological advantage. The civilization built by that life form might want to make sure no other civilization ever rises to threaten its existence (which might happen between two civilizations through mutual distrust and prisoner's dilemma type arguments).

That civilization might feel threatened because the technological advantage from being first won't last forever: at some point everyone will likely reach the point where you figure out all the laws of the universe, and also figure out more or less everything that can be usefully done with them. The first civilization could ensure its survival either by direct conquest, occupation, or more indirect methods of influence (for example, covertly shaping the cultural evolution of other life forms as they arise).

Well, how about this: I'll make sure that, starting from any planet, you can only ever reach a small part of the universe. How can that be done? I suppose I could put in uncrossable barriers (maybe it looks like empty space, but if you try to move past you just stay in the same place) but that is difficult to incorporate into physics, and besides it might lead to the civilizations in question to devoting much of their efforts to theological speculations about the origin of these barriers.

How about this: create a limit on how fast anything can travel, and then also make sure all the planets are moving away from each other at high speed, with more distant planets moving away progressively faster. That way if two planets are far enough apart, they'll be moving away too fast for one to ever be reachable from the other.

Oh wait a second...
