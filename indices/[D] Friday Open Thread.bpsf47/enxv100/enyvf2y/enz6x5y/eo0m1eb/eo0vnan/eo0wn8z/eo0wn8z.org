I've read it! Egan's work on that is amazing, but still, it's relatively simple compared to what I had in mind, which was removing entirely relativity from mechanics. All he does is change a single /sign/, and even that fucks up almost all of physics into something unrecognisable (and it must be said that Egan found a very clever way around the problem of solving differential equations in a ++++ spacetime. There is a paper by Max Tegmark that explored this among other possible dimensionalities and metrics, and it seems to suggest that really, our -+++ is the only one in which life can evolve).
