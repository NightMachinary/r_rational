You might be interested in Greg Egan's /Orthogonal/; it's set in a universe where the Minkowski metric has signature (+,+,+,+) instead of (-,+,+,+) like in ours.

The author has written some essays on the physical consequences of this, which he's [[https://www.gregegan.net/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html][published for free online]]. One of the immediate consequences is that there is no universal speed limit.
