Not easy at all. You're just thinking cosmology. Try rewriting quantum field theory, relativistic quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism with an infinite speed of light... my best guess is you could have a finite speed for EM waves, but it /not/ be the fundamental speed limit of everything. However, in QFT as we know it, that'd be a weird thing, because it would mean either photons have mass (and then behave in some weird way that resembles more what other particles do than actual photons) or everything goes tits up and we're in no man's land. Of course QFT itself was born out of the necessity of making QM fully Lorentz-invariant, and with no light speed, that's not a requirement any more, so what would we have in its place? I can think of a /classical/ quantum field theory, I don't think it's impossible, but working out what that would be like, well. It isn't easy.
