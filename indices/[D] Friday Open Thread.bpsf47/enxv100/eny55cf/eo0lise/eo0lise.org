Well, there's also less charged history with race though. From the outside, it seems to me the US has more seething issues under the skin, but also has developed more ways to deal with them or at least bury them under a pretence of nicety at the surface level.

In Europe you're certainly more likely to get people assuming you're a foreigner for looking different, but I wouldn't consider that "racism" per se, though it can be annoying. Will you meet xenophobia? Yes, and that's on the rise, but heavily dependent on your country of origin. Will you meet actual, bona fide white supremacists who believe in genetic inferiority of black people? Possibly, but I suspect those are actually less than in the US.
