I don't know what part of Europe you are in, but when I was in France, there was far more racism there than in the US.

Our group was mostly Indian subcontinent, and quite a few people complained in French about the "dirty foreigners" on the assumption that none of us could possibly understand them. We frequently got poor service in restaurants and in general met a lot of surly people.

This wasn't just our group being jerks; in the same month I went with a group that could pass as European (mostly Americans actually) and things were far more pleasant.

So it's not just you.
