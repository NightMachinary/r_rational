Quick question: I just took an in-depth look at my first serious pay sheet, and apparently as a junior developer it costs my company roughly 4'000€ to pay me 2'000€, once we're done with the various kinds of taxes.

So, I already knew France had pretty high corporate taxes, but I miss a frame of reference for how big a cut that is. What tax rate do you pay in your country?
