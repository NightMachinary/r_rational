I'm actually struggling to think whether I can conceive a completely consistent set of rules for a universe /without/ a finite speed limit (for world building purposes) and I can't find one. Granted, fundamental physics are already mind-bogglingly complicated as they are, so having to rewrite them from the grounds up ain't exactly easy, especially since simply having c go to infinity is likely to break most of it...
