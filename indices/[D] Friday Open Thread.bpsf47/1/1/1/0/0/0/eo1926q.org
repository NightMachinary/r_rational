The thing is, having c > 300,000 km/s but /finite/ only brings about quantitative change. Taking it to infinity is a whole another matter entirely.

Out of the top of my head, merely increasing it would certainly change a lot - for example the energy released in nuclear reactions, probably the rates at which certain processes happen, not to mention the relative strength of electric and magnetic fields. But make it infinite and off the top of my head I think you'll get:

- decoupled electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations (rot B ~ 1/c^{2} dE/dt)
- infinite rest energy for matter (E = mc^{2)}
- no gravity (there's a 1/c^{4} term in front of the stress-energy tensor in Einstein's field equations)

That doesn't look like our universe - indeed, it doesn't look like /any/ universe, the whole of physics basically breaks down. So you need to go deeper than just our equations, assume some more fundamental principles, assume that Newtonian + quantum mechanics is all there is, and then rederive everything from there.
