That's a nice showerthought! It sounds like an elaboration of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle][anthropic principle]], or a combination of it with the fermi paradox.

If the universe were such that 1) an alien civilization develops billions of years ago, and persists, 2) for whaetver reason, they are pre-disposed to eliminate all future civs, and most importantly 3) it is physically possible to go on a universe-wide preventative genocide. If all these were true, then you wouldn't be around to remark how curious it is that the universe isn't that way, like you're doing now.
