Well, Australia is closer to China. I guess the immigration fluxes may be different. Me, being from Italy, I can tell you most definitely right now it'd be Africans and people from the Middle East who would have it worse. The Chinese might be looked at with some suspicion, partly because they tend to form really secluded communities, send children to study back in China and such, but I think most people just consider them as minding their own business and not as potentially 'dangerous' the way they tend to fear Africans, or anyone who they perceive as being probably a Muslim. Next on the list are probably some of the Eastern European peoples, and Roms especially. The Japanese and Koreans aren't much common but they certainly aren't seen as anything particular. They do not emigrate usually, after all; they only visit as tourists, and even that hit peak in the 90s (the economic crisis made Japan a bit poorer after that). And it's Italy, we've got a lot of tourists, in fact some regions outright live off them, so you get used to it.
