  I don't think there's much against Asian people, especially Chinese/Japanese/Korean, but that depends on the country possibly.

Australia isn't Europe but racists here definitely target the Chinese because they're perceived to be "buying up" a lot of our land/businesses/etc and the Japanese are perceived to be "generic annoying tourists", so I would be very surprised if places with more tourism and/or worse economies weren't similarly annoyed by them. Whereas here I think racists don't so much mind dark-skinned people of African descent but do mind Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander peoples and people from the Indian subcontinent. But who knows, I'm in a white progressive bubble.
