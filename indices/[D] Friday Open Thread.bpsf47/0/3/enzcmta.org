My understanding is that in Europe they care more about nation rather than "race" per se. You're British, or French, or German, or whatever, based on what country you are from. Nobody cares about the color of your skin, or where your ancestors originate from but they do care about where you yourself are from, and are willing to openly discriminate based on that.

The U.S. is one of the most tolerant countries on the planet, the fact that we have so many people complaining about racists proves how much we care in the first place.
