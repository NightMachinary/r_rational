I enjoyed the heavily [REDACTED] portion. It would feel like a copout if it weren't for the fact that /knowing/ this meme pulls you /inside it,/ and the unredacted bits do a good job of getting across the kind of Lovecraftian apocalypse that we already suspected à°µ would unleash. One perfect idea, resonating in every mind and tlaol obr every visible surface.

With the only ember of hope being the few remaining SCPs who haven't quite succumbed. They're gonna need a lot of amnestics.
