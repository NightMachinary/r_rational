I enjoyed Beyonders. I disagree that the actions the villain took were rational, they were more pseudo-rational where they worked because the author wanted them to work, not because they were actually good ideas.

1 and 2 would just inspire more rebellion. Creating a luxurious hotel would make more people want to rebel to get a shot at it, and letting the previous hero live also would just create more dissidence.

1. was actually a pretty good idea though.
