depending on where precisely on the cliff you are a waterfall actually is rather difficult to get power from, check out the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Falls][angel falls]] the falls turn to a heavy drizzle at the bottom. also similar stuff will render most liquid waste to drizzles if there is enough distance between the out pour and the unfortunate folk below.

Interesting potentiality is the city might have been built somewhere sensible then remained through an uplift/landslide. so look for city ruins above and below the cliffs or subducting below it.
