In a D&D campaign that I'm running I have a three mile high cliff with a city running down the side of it to the ocean (or technically a crevasse that splits the cliff a bit). In my head, this is super cool, but I think I only have the knowledge base to take a very shaky stab at it. Figure a population of 2.5 million, roughly the size of modern day Paris.

The biggest issues for a three-mile high cliff city would be ... transportation, waste removal, water, and stuff falling. Since it's D&D, many of those problems can be solved via magic if necessary, but I'm not entirely sure how serious those problems are, or whether you could solve them given purely 16th century technology.

Transportation can be done with elevators, but that requires some form of motive power, which I suppose you could get with water, but that then requires large amounts of water capture at the top of the city and some kind of long-distance piping. But that then bring meteorological considerations up, because you /probably/ need weather systems producing constant rain at high altitude in order to be caught by your catchments in order for your elevators to keep running. (Which I guess leads to the sort of worldbuilding thing that I like.)

(Yes, in the real world cities are built for a purpose, but one of the conceits of this setting is that there are magical cities whose existence is a constant, even over geological time. h/t to [[/u/nighzmarquls]] who posted that idea to the Discord, which I took for this campaign because I thought it was Neat.)
