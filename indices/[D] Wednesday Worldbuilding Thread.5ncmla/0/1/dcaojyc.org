A simple way to give the city a source of fresh water is to have a waterfall from a large river flowing off the cliff. The locals could build some kind of vertical aqueduct system that would fill counterweights for elevators, which just dump their ballast into the ocean. Assuming Roman-era technology, a simple sewer system could work the same way or even use the same aqueducts (sanitation didn't exist back then). If things falling is a big danger, they could just build large nets beneath the buildings.
