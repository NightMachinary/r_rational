In order:

Until it realizes you know it is there, it will only walk, neither run nor fly. If it realizes you know it is there, it will turn into a flying murder machine and kill you.

It can apply steel bar pretzels levels of force, but will take care to stay unnoticed, so won't apply much force at all unless the gig is up.

Human shaped, human sized. A little smaller than average for a fit woman.

Its power source is magic. You can't reasonably disrupt it other than by 'killing' it because you don't have magic, nor do any of your allies or any other faction you could reach out to.

It is not bothered by water.

Acid, strong enough and in enough quantity, could damage its body like it could any other metal. It is made up of (to you) unknown metal. Judging by its weight and size it is probably mostly made of something heavier than gold, but probably not gold because that's not terribly practical. After the initial shock of the attack, however, say a second or two, it will switch on the magic and just stop taking damage.

Fire... Well, its temperature can be raised, and you could melt it, but again, you have about two second before it goes magical terminator. A nuclear bomb could take it out, but that would involve rather a lot of collateral damage.

You do not have retaliatory magic. There is a magical vortex of doom in a fixed location, and that could destroy the thing, but it knows it is there and will be very cautious if it has to go anywhere near it. Sudden battering ram or explosion could possibly throw it into the vortex, but it will never be more careful than when it is near the thing. It can sense the vortex from a distance through any barrier you could put up.

Its long term intentions are to watch you and your group and make sure you steer society in a direction that serves its ends. You don't know what these are, but they seem to involve a lot of death. Its plan seems to be to stay hidden and discretely murder anyone who looks like they are pulling in the wrong direction.

You do not know how much blunt trauma would be required. It is not made of adamantine, but it is likely sturdier than steel.
