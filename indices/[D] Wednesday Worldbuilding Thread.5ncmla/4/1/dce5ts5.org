Data insufficient. How fast can it run? Ditto fly? How much force can it exert? Is it human-shaped, or just sized? What is its power source? If the source is internal, how long will it last, and how exposed is it? If external, can it be blocked? Is it resistant to water? Acid? Fire? What kind of retaliatory magic do we have? What are its long-term intentions? How much blunt trauma is "sufficient"; are we looking at an inch of steel, or solid adamantine?
