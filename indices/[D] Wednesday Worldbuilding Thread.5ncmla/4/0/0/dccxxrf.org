It can fly if it has to, but doing so (it would have to use magic) would break its invisibility, and it is currently spying on you and others and is assuming that as long as it does not use magic, none of you can sense it at all. So you can count on it being unable to fly for a few seconds, but the second it realizes you are attacking it it will turn into a flying murder machine.
