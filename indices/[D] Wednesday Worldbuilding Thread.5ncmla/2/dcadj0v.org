Idea:

You're a secret agency/task force tasked with dealing trans-dimensional travelers.

Earth has become a destination in the multiverse, and strange denizens are starting to make their way to Earth.

Already, you watch over four teenage girls who are monster hunters in training, and an elf enchanter/artifacters who thinks all the round-ears are actually the elves.

How long can the masquerade last? What will you do if some other nation, hostile to you, play host to a trans-dimensional traveler? How do you detect and locate the whereabout of trans-d travelers?

There's also the mundane matter of ensuring your superpowered teenagers going to school and not making a fuss......
