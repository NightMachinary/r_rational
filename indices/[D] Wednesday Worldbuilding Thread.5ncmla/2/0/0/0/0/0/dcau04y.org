I thought part of the premise was that it needed to be kept secret. You ask how long it could be kept under wraps. I agree that it would be hard to find a good motivation for it to need to stay secret. They do exist but there aren't a lot of them. If they want to keep it secret it isn't being evil for the sake of being evil. If the need to keep it secret is morally important enough it may even be evil not to lock them up.
