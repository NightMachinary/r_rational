Why are you being nice? Sure it's a good policy in many cases but we don't just let teens come into the country without paper. Give them the option to be kept under lock and key or leave. Why I ask again are you being nice. Governmental agencies aren't nice. Some times we do things because it's the right thing to do, but you've said the right thing to do is to keep this secret and honestly making two teens leave is far less morally questionable than a lot of what the government does.
