Hum, lots of variables here. First I must mention teenage monster hunters seems a bit strange and worth farther investigation. It's a common trope but makes next to no actual sense. We don't see teen police officers or bounty hunters very often, especially if earth is for some reason newly accessible you'd expect to see mostly experienced people. Possible solutions include them not actually being teens (magic healthcare for the win) or some incentive for the young to go into this kind of work. Magic is stronger when people are young. Monsters have some form of instinct not to attack the children. Even unicorns with the classic myths.

On to your actual question though. You'd be hard pressed to keep it secret long and the real question and problem is why would you? Are you gaining financially because of this? Are you worried about a destabilizing effect. Here also is where other variables come in. Is the transdimensional travel restricted in some manor? Does it have just one exit point or can you predict where a traveler will appear? Do travels have a reason to keep their presence a secret? Let's assume the following. Travelers can only arrive at the full moon and you can predict their exit point down to about a squire mile up to a week in advance. Travelers themselves don't really care one way or another about exposing themselves with maybe a slight bias for secrecy.

Here I think you could maintain things but the last thing you would want to do is send people off to school. If at all possible if you really have a strong motive for keeping it hidden you'd try to turn back the tide. Either imprison anyone coming through or send them back. Maybe if there was enough reason even kill them. Maybe though you need to let them through. Monster will invade Earth or some other disaster occurred otherwise. In this case you let them in but minimize contact between them and other people.

This is of course everything I think you'd actually want to do in this situation. In reality it would make terrible fiction so either come up with really strange starting cases (the teens are rebellious and misbehaving and they are going to public school one way or another with or without your help). Here again you try to minimize contact. Choose a small school somewhere out of the way. Greenland would be ideal. Maybe contrive to cause an internet outage to the area. Through out the key to keeping it secret will be to limit the number of people who know anything. It will be useful to have a team ready with stories meant to discredit anyone coming out with the claim. Without good evidence it shouldn't be hard at first.
