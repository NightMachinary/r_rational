Three miles is enough for noticeable differences in atmospheric pressure and temperature, so I'd imagine different trades or classes of people preferring different levels which could lead to cool zoning by level - fishermen at the base, wind farmers at the top etc. You'd need to decide which level the rulers prefer to live, which I'm guessing depends on defendability as well as comfort.

You could have a lot of birds on a cliff like that, and if you have some mythically large flying beasts they could be used as transport - especially if they're the sort that roost at the top and use the sun's rays to get going in the morning before swooping down and climbing back up in the evening - then you could have a whole day night cycle of human activity based on that.
