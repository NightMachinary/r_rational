Waste disposal is going to be a big issue for this city, especially if it's been there for a /geological timescale/. My first thought was primitive people can just throw shit in the river, but with a city that size, or even with a smaller one, over geologic time that's just going to fuck the whole river up.

A landfill would need to be used, and having one on the side of a cliff is a /massive/ engineering project. I have some very minor expertise in landfills and they collapse regularly, and they're effectively giant landslides of garbage, and that's when they're reasonably properly planned by civil engineers and not /placed on the side of a three mile cliff/. Especially with 2.5 million people. It's going to be a huge issue even if we assume it's medieval technology so they're doing things like composting food scraps and there's no plastic packaging to contend with.

Since it's D&D you probably want a guild of wizard garbagemen who make the rubbish go poof, or teleport it elsewhere. Maybe the town has an artefact that's a dimensional portal that puts the rubbish into some desert somewhere and it gets stolen or blocked up so they need to find some other way to dispose of their rubbish (or the portal puts their rubbish into some powerful being's Private Dimension, and now it's full enough that they want revenge?).
