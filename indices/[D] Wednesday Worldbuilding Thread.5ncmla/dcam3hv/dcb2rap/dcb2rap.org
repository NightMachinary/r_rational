If magical desalination is practical on an industrial scale (and it should be due to enchanted heating stones and the like), your elevators could use seawater as ballast, with animals/slaves/bound skeletons as their motive power at the top. The seawater is brought to the top of the city while people are moved around with it, and at the top that water is desalinated and sent through pipes to the rest of the city. This allows for gravity - powered indoor plumbing, with the highest water pressure at the bottom of the city. The salt from the water becomes the city's primary export and reason for existence due to D&D's wacky economics and fixed pricing. The families who own the city are fabulously wealthy and employ most of the denizens in this industry.
