Can it fly? I'd just set up a trap of some sort off the edge of the cliff. Maybe weaken a portion of a bridge - or perhaps lots of modern bridges wouldn't be able to handle a 15t point load. I actually have access to the load ratings data of all the bridges in my state, so I'd probably make use of that.

That said, the load rating data isn't necessarily accurate - a report for example said that a bridge can't handle the traffic that has been travelling on it every day for 15 years - but I'll just keep taking the creature to progressively weaker and weaker bridges since it will probably just think I'm playing chase with it?
