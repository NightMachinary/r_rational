There is a human sized magical automaton made largely of strong, heavy metal. You cannot see its exact location because magic, but you can tell if it's within line of sight. Using only pre-1950 technology, including heavy machinery if necessary, how could you destroy it? It is not trying to harm you, but if it realizes you know it is there that will change very quickly. Luring it somewhere specific is fine, but you better get it on the first attempt. Although animated by magic, sufficient blunt trauma will destroy it, as will melting a large part of it, cutting its head off, etc. It has 360Â° vision, but no other special senses or protections. It weighs about 15 metric tons. You can sort of determine where it is by narrowing your field of vision, but if it thinks you are looking at it it will assume it is about to be attacked.

My current plan is for it to be rammed into a magical vortex of doom with a great big battering ram, but I'd like to consider alternatives that don't rely on the vortex.
