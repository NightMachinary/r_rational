Given the two-second limit, I think we can rule out acid. The level of force sounds like enough to rule out trapping or pinning it, at least without it getting warning. You haven't specified how fast it flies, so theoretically a sacrificial artillery unit might be able to give it grief as it charges them, but that's probably too unreliable. A plane full of bombs could go kamikaze and ram the thing, although that would take more than two seconds to approach, so it might become hard to hit.
