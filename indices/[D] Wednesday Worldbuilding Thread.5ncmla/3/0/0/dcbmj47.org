Oh, of course. A dog is actually a perfect analogy. You have everything from mangy stray dogs, to family dogs that are neglected, to beloved family dogs, to well-trained police / guide dog. In my story, Red at this point is probably on the "neglected family dog" level of respect in vampire society, whereas Elodia's human (Lucia) is on guide dog level of respect.

William killing Lucia in retaliation for Elodia threatening to kill Red is a bit irrational though. Especially because Elodia could still kill Red. Maybe William will kill one of Elodia's expendable servants, and keep Lucia "prisoner". I like that. It will be a fun dynamic. Lucia would be all stoic, "you know how it is, Red. Vampires get into their little spats. Either your master will keep me forever, or I'll go back to my master." - she's probably been held captive before.

Incidentally, this whole "William killing Elodia's human" problem is going to culminate in a "gift war", where they each have to provide more and more extravagant gifts. I figured it's probably a sensible way for vampires to solve conflicts. William will ultimately lose the gift war when he is given a living statue that is essentially a slave to its owner. This will hit Red's last nerve and open up the obligatory "omg they almost break up" part of the plot.

EDIT: Though Lucia is a "thrall"; a human who drinks vampire blood and in return gets a deep, unmovable devotion to the vampire they drink from along with, you know, magic powers. Being kept prisoner results in one of these things:

a) Due to lack of blood, Lucia detoxes, becomes "free" until Elodia takes her again

b) William feeds her his blood. I don't want this to overwrite Lucia's devotion to Elodia, so it just maintains her previous state

c) As part of the generally accepted etiquette of keeping other vampire's thralls as hostages, she provides him a vial of blood that he can feed to Lucia as needed (she only requires a few drops a night to maintain).

I think the last one is probably the most sensible...
