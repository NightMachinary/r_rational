So, what do you think about my vampire society??? Any thoughts for obvious consequences of the below, or ways to extend it, or things I might not have considered.

Vampires are super intelligent, good senses, etc. Drink blood, almost always has to be from a human. We can go into details as you want but they're pretty normal as far as vampires go really.

The major thing their social framework runs on is sending letters and gifts. The gifts all have symbolism - think [[http://www.allflorists.co.uk/advice_flowerMeanings.asp][Victorian Flower Language]] but taken up to 11. You change the arrangement of laces in your shoes to communicate subtle things, the exact shade of your clothing matters, etc. Same with gifts; you send someone a silver bull statuette, the angle the horn comes out at could make it either an apology or a grave insult. Vampires live a long time and have astonishing memories, so they're quite able to keep track of all this. The letters are similarly full of subtleties, and run for dozens of pages at a minimum.

They also have very strictly ritualised ceremonies. The only one that's really been presented is a blood drinking ritual, where there is heated blood and chilled blood served in separate cups. The cups have to be drunk from in a certain order, the handles angled differently, and so on. If you do it wrong, it's considered a grave mark of disrespect.

(All the specifics of the meanings of different things are not addressed in the story, thank /god/, because that would be hideously boring and hard to keep track of)

I also want there to be a "red in tooth and claw" aspect, with ritualised combat - I am considering that maybe it's like martial arts in that you don't actually kill your opponent, but they tap out and are considered to have lost. But I do want vampires to be pretty blase about killing humans, because the difference between a vampire mind and a human mind is like a human and a chimp, or a cat, as the vampire gets older and older and thus smarter and smarter.

My story is about the love that dare not speak its name between a vampire (William) and his human consort (Red). As a plot point, I want Red to mess up during one of the aforementioned ceremonies with a high-status vampire (Elodia). Elodia is then considered socially right to kill him, and she goes to do so. William can't have this, because True Love, so he either kills Elodia (bad: unrational: she's powerful, not as powerful as him but still, it would make him look bad; good: power of true love), or Elodia's human servant (good: plot drama, sensible since William thinks of humans as subhuman, and so on).

But.... does it make sense that killing the humans would be on the table at all? I guess humans are considered chattel by vampires, you can eat them to death if you choose and nobody will care, but humans like Red and Elodia's servant have time and energy invested into them, so it would be analogous to destroying an artwork that someone was halfway through completing.

But I feel like vampires aren't /really/ vampires if they aren't violent.

Thoughts?
