/Magic is Radiation/

Thaumons are the particle of magic. Produced by mages/magical artifacts, mages have the ability to partially direct and detect thaumons, allowing them to perform magic. However, high thaumon concentrations quickly become uncontrollable, and result in an extremely destructive magical blast. Magic must be carefully regulated to avoid loss of control.

Mages intrinsically emit thaumons, which are absorbed and re-emitted by other (non-mage) animals. However, mages release more thaumons than they absorb, making it especially dangerous for mages to live in dense population centres, and even more dangerous to have large gathering of mages. Two low-powered mages working together can amplify their powers significantly, but two high-powered mages can barely stand in the same room without resulting in a magic blast. This makes it difficult to teach new students, and when a mage does receive formal training, it is done mainly through master-apprentice relationships.

New mages are often found as a result of a magical blast in a densely-populated area. Mages are feared and discriminated against due to their power and the danger they pose to society.

Recently there has been the discovery of element Null, which absorbs thaumons without re-emitting them, making them indispensable to magical shielding. A single magical Academy has been established, where all mages must wear Null robes to prevent a magical blast. Magical artifacts can also be stored in Null, but Null is still extremely scarce and valuable, resulting in a monopoly by the Queen for usage at the Academy.

Magical artifacts are infused with a large amount of thaumons, and their efficacy slowly decays over time as they emit thaumons. They have the same problem as mages; it is unwise to store powerful magical artifacts together.

And of course there's the Philosopher's Stone, made from powerful mages, a physical manifestation of pure thaumons. Mere exposure to the Philosopher's Stone can turn a non-mage into a mage, but is extremely volatile, as exposure to even the most middling mage can result in a magical blast.
