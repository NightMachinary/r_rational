22 hours later completely read it, kind of went downhill I have to say, I have to assume all the cliches were on purpose but I don't get their points. What was the point of the narnia references, I mean I know it's meant to be deconstruction but I'm not really sure that just making it really cliched is enough.

Also, I thought it was at least going to be consistent, it's mentioned he has perfect memory but then he forgets things (like cyborg's name), and I thought from the opening lines he would be omniscience or something but then he says he doesn't know how things have changed since he's been inside well, how the fuck does he know the number count of heroes?

I don't know, on a whole it just felt so /disappointing/
