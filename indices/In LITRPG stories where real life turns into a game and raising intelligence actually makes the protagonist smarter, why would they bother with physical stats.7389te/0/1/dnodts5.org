I realize it widely depends on the system, but don't forget that the theme in all of these stories is life turning into a classic rpg game, not something completely random, and the protagonist can usually gather easily whether or not INT makes them smart/improve magical power- by the game overlay and a little bit of testing.

It's like supply and demand- a very crude economic model that wouldn't perfectly apply to every real life situation but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken into consideration.

Obviously someone new to the situation wouldn't have all the data, but the moment they realize that:

1.INT raises your "firepower"( fighting capability) 2. INT actually makes you smarter.

They should invest everything into INT until further information is revealed.
