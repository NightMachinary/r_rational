If the system comes with a manual (which it usually does in these fics) they don't have to wait for more info.

If the system is game balanced, it won't have a single killer stat. If there's an obvious "raise INT" strategy then it's not balanced, and the author of the fic has set up a straw system to put their mary-sue in.

2-5 are common ways to balance the game, and any balanced game will likely have one or more of them.
