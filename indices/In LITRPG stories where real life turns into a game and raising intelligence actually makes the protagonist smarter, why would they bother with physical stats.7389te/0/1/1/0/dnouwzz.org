  If there's an obvious "raise INT" strategy then it's not balanced, and the author of the fic has set up a straw system to put their mary-sue in.

My experience with these fics is that they're almost always depicting games which have been balanced to assume that INT is a stat of the /character avatar/, as operated by a merely-human-level player. Then, separately, there's something else going on /outside/ of the game, as part of the narrative conceit, that unifies the player with the character, thus making the INT stat /also/ translate to increased intellect. My impression is that the games-as-designed don't usually take this unification into account in their balance.

One piece of evidence I have for this, is that although many characters in litRPG worlds have magic powers commensurate with boosted INT, I've never read a litRPG where any character /other than the protagonist/ has the sort of intellectual capacity you'd get by boosting INT in a game where INT controls that. It's only ever the protagonist that gets this effect, if it happens, because it's only the protagonist that isn't "from" the game.

Which is too bad; I'd love to read a litRPG where the protagonist is a permanent "merely human", brought to a fantastical world but not governed by stat-progression rules, who instead notices that everyone /else/ is governed by stat-progression rules, and so sets out to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingSim][raise]] an NPC party member into a God. The protagonist would be Watson, building their own Sherlock Holmes.
