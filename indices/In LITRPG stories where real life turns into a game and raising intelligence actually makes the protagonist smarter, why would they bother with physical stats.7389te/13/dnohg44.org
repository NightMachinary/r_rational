The game is meant to mimic real life. In real life, although specializing in one particular area makes sense, even graduate students should probably hit the gym at least a little, and there is definitely a niche for people who primarily focus on strength. Increasing "int" is really more like studying. The mechanic is simulating your character improving their technical proficiency behind the scenes, not simulating a direct increase in magic (although that's the practical result).
