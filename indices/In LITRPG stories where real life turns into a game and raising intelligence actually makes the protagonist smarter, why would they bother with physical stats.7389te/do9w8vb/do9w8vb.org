By the same reasoning, why not boost CHA? You don't need to punch or lightning-ball someone if you can talk them out of fighting you (and possibly into joining your side). And a lot of modern civilization is rigged more towards handing wealth and power to maxed-out CHA than INT characters. The latter might make you a super-scientist; the former would make you a rock star, hypercelebrity, or world leader.
