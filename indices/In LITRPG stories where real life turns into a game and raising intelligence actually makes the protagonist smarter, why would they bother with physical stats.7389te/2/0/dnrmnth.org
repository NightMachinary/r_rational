  Is high INT even safe in this game? High INT may not prepare you emotionally for whatever insights you gain. If you see all mages are insane, then it's a clear warning sign.

A set of homebrewed D&D spells I found a while back came at this from an unusal angle. It was a set of offensive divinations that would, for example, tell a terrible secret to the target. They'd have to make a check against it, where they were penalised for /higher/ int, to try to avoid understanding it, and if they succeeded (in understanding it) they'd instantly die.
