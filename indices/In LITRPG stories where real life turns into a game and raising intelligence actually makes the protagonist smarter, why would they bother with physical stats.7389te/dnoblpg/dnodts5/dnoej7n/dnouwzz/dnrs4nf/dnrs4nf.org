  Which is too bad; I'd love to read a litRPG where the protagonist is a permanent "merely human", brought to a fantastical world but not governed by stat-progression rules, who instead notices that everyone else is governed by stat-progression rules, and so sets out to raise an NPC party member into a God. The protagonist would be Watson, building their own Sherlock Holmes.

That... would actually be a very interesting story.
