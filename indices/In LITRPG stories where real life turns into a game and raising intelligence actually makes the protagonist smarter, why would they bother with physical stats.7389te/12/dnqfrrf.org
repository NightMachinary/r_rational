It depends entirely on the specifics of the system...there could be some limit on how many spells you could cast (as in almost every RPG) or there could be a soft cap, where diminishing returns make putting further points into a stat useless. This seems to be the case in most litrpgs...if only because we rarely see increasing INT actually leading to better decision making (I know, that's to do with the writing). Of course, there isn't any reason for reality to be balanced, but in a world that follows RPG logic it's likely that there's something odd going on to make it that way.

 

And if increasing INT actually made you smarter, the world would either be ruled by immortal superintelligences or there would be thousands of shadowy conspiracies of said intelligences pulling in thousands of directions. Which would be an incredible setting, if hard to write.
