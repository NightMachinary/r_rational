You don't need that munch to make a computer , being better in math in general does, include s being better at things like lambda calculus, whith enough int you should be able to run a computer in your mind. Also having a calculator in the middle ages is useful for a lot of things and, jobs , just not combat related things, everyone wants you as theisa accountant, you are better in engeniering and in a ton of calculations people used to painstakingly do by hand and they would pay you a lot for doing .
