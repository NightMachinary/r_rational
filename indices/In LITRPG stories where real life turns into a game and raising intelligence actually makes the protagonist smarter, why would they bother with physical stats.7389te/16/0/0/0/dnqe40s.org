I think I misunderstood you - did you mean that the increasing Int stat would come with autism? Or that the wizard would become very good at solving a, or a few particular equations? Like, hypercalculia or something? That's not how cognitively normal humans are good at math. Because all else equal, increasing general mathematical competency is a huge aid in problem solving. Sure, autistic savants didn't conquer the middle ages, but that's a strawman argument here. We aren't talking about an autistic wizard, we're talking (I'm assuming) about a cognitively normal person who is a unequaled genius in mathematics, and can also shoot fire out of his/her eyeballs. And, if we get back to the initial conceit, gets better at math by shooting said fire. I like this idea a lot, but I just don't see how it could balance the Int/Str thing.
