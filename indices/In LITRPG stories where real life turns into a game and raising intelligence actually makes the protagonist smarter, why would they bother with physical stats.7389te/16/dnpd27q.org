You can get around this problem by making spell-casting heavily dependent on math, and making int boost your math skills only. So small int = bad at math, normal int = average math, high int = autistic savant.

For example, you could make spells depend on magic circles (possibly mental visualization), whose lines/angles have to be adjusted to determine all kinds of attributes. Like a fireball would have size, temperature, mana cost, direction, speed, etc. And the mage has to compute the mana cost correctly as a function of the other attributes: too low = spell fails to activate, too high = spell backfires. So the more int you have, the better you are at spellcasting.
