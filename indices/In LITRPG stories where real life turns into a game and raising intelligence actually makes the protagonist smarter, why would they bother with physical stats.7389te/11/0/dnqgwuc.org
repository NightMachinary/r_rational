I guess you could write it from the outside, and just have the high-INT characters look at each other for a few minutes analyzing what they know already and comparing it to what they can deduce from the other person by looking at them, then modeling how combat would go, then come up with the best game theory solution. From the outside it would just look like two people staring at each other until one surrenders. Would be funny, but not very engaging.
