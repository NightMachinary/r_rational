Raising mental stats like INT and WIS are explicitly editing your mind - depending on the perspective of the character, they may consider this to be a form of personality death, with a new, smarter version of themselves essentially taking over their lives.

Bonus existential crisis points if the character only realises this after they've raised their mental stats high enough for the possibility to occur to them.
