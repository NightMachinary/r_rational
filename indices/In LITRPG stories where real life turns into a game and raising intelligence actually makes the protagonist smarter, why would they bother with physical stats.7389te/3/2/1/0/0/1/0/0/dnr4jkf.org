To further clarify my point of my intelligence, it's like this. I can speak German and English. Therefore my mind is capable of understanding and using both English and German. However if I were to forget all my German, or all my English, I would have lost an ability, but not something integral to 'me' as conscious individual.

And while consciousness may be a side effect of everything else in your mind (I don't want to turn this into a debate on consciousness because those tend to just start going in circles), you have to admit that it does not 'feel' like that on a day to day basis. I feel like there is a 'me' thinking this sentence. When I am successful at meditation, I feel that there is a 'me' how has managed to stop thinking. From my point of me, my emotions happen to a central 'me'. While emotion and memory and thought are all key components of the mind, and consciousness as we know it couldn't exist without it, subjectively all those things can, or always do feel like things that a conscious mind does, rather than what a conscious mind is.

Basically here is the main thrust of my point of view, in a much simpler form that I probably should have used in the first place. Intelligence, in my point of view, is similar to the muscles of the body. Increasing intelligence, in a world where such a thing is possible in a clear quantitative way such as INT stat, would be more akin to building more muscle, and less akin to ripping out the muscles already present and replacing them with newer, shinier ones.

Thanks for the fiction recommendations :) I find that in debates about hypothetical things, peoples opinions are quite influenced by the fiction they've consumed on the topic (because, naturally fiction is the one of the main places where ideas such as this are expansively and thoughtfully explored). For example one of my siblings rebelled quite stubbornly against the notion of anything but a brain made from meat ever being considered conscious, until she watched Black Mirrors Season 2 Christmas Special and suddenly had a change of heart.
