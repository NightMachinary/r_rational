  I think what is happening here is that you are defining intelligence as one of the integral aspects of the mind, while everyone else is defining it as one of the minds abilities.

I'm not able to conceive of how these are distinct statements.

  Personally I believe that the only truly integral part of my mind is my self-awareness or 'consciousness' I guess.

Your consciousness is a side effect of everything else in your mind.

One of the best fictional depictions of the result of suddenly getting superintelligence (significantly > 18 INT) is in /Protector/ by Larry Niven. It's also a pretty good book with some excellent physics hacking and rational characters (albeit with a bit of a '50s mindset since Niven was born in 1938).

I'd also suggest reading a bunch of Greg Egan, especially the short story /Mister Volition/.
