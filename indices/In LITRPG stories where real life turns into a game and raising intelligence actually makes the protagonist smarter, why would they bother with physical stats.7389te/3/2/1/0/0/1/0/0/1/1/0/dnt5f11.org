Well, you would be /adding/ something to you. It's tricky because it's not just these random words of language you're learning. The process and result of learning it engage you in other ways - you may identify more strongly with German speakers, learning a different language may cause you to reconsider how you communicate

This fixation on "killing" bothers me. In a biological or philosophical sense, every moment your old self is "dying" and a new iteration of you is being "born." But you are built to see yourself in a continuum. In this thread, we're just speculating whether we would be aware of an artificial and instant intelligence increase as a change to our fundamental being.

Hegel would say that your lack of German knowledge does define you. You are X and not-X. Not knowing German is part of your identity.
