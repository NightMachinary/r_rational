I don't understand how people can put /too much/ emphasis on a single part of a gestalt when the gestalt is defined as it is - if you change a part, the gestalt changes. You are not entirely losing your German: it's losing its salience in your day to day life, but part of you will always identify as German. But if you were going through some total mindwiping, the new you would not be the same (e.g. you would lose any of the influences your German heritage had during your upbringing, informing your current attitudes and behaviors).

Chemical interference in the brain is bringing in another level of complexity. But yes that drunk version of you (who did not have a full memory, since memory loss occurs due to memories never being stored in long-term-memory) is dead if you assume you will remember nothing (and no one will remind you) and none of your actions will ever inform a future you.

You're confusing/overlapping the muscle analogy with uniformity-of-consciousness (though yes, such a muscle upgrade may change the way you perceive yourself, especially in relation to other humans). I'm not sure how you can say you're not killing your old biological version of yourself when you are a distinctly new creature.

Education is essentially the same, except it's gradual and people are slower to recognize a "change" when it occurs over a continuum of time. You're appealing to emotions here with the word "kill." Education in its many forms does "kill" the students' old selves but it's rarely labeled as such except when it violates social mores. Many mourn the brainwashed youth of ISIL.

In fiction, it's because it's a, well, polite fiction. Our tendency to perceive sameness is Gestalt pr√§gnanz in action. Even if the onset of a superpower marks a change in thinking/behavior, we prefer seeing it as a continuity. By the way, there are stories that explore these issues of identity (off the top of my head, Worm, fanfics like Tabloid).

You have a strong faith in uniformity-of-self and I don't want to argue about the metaphysics of identity on an emotional basis. There are many studies on the relationship between intelligence (usually measured by IQ) and personality/behavior.
