Not really. That's what the phrase means. Dogs and humans have profoundly different brains, you'd need to do a lot more to a dog than make it better at dogging to be as smart as a human. If you think there are fundamental differences between the changes that occur in the human brain and those that would go along with increases in INT other than immediacy, you should be more specific. You might be right, I just don't know what they are.
