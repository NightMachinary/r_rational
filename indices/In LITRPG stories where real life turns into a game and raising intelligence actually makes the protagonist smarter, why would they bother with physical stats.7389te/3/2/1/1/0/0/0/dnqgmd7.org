Um...huh? This reminds me of the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/og/wrong_questions/][wrong question]] sequence on LW. What is the mind? Well, (and this is only a basic level of understanding, I'm not a neurologist) your neurons interact with each other by releasing neurotransmitters. Memories and skills form by proteins building up on/in the synapse which gives more weight to a neuron/neurons. Those neurons fire more readily in the future, especially when other neurons that fired at the same time do. In that way, patterns form in the brain and you learn. The "mind" is the map of those patterns. If you change brain structure you change the map. There is no "mind" entity floating around, being fed by the brain. It's a map generated by the brain. You can run the map on different hardware and it will still act the same (brain uploading) but if you change the map by changing the hardware you have changed the mind, which can be considered death. We accept a certain amount of variance as a matter of course, since a lot of things affect the brain. How the amount of variance that means death is defined is up to you.
