Well that is why the Ship of Theseus is such a popular trope in the community - but we're not talking about equivalent replacement.

It's wholly valid to argue that enhancing a person's brain structures will result in fundamentally different and new person. To illustrate, think of it in terms of the heap paradox (how many grains does it take to make a heap?): at what point does enhancing an irrational actor's faculties create a rational person? Of course, rationality doesn't quite exist as a gestalt and operates more at a microdecision level. Still, controlling for all other variables, just enhancing brain structures associated with intelligence (essentially increasing IQ) /will/ lead to a person having a different perspective and making different choices = explicitly editing the mind.
