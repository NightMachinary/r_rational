Sorry, what? It says "having a different perspective *and* making /different/ choices." The whole point of the thought experiment is that you will be making different decisions and decisions are a product of the mind. So yes it is no more evident than, say, regretting a past action and knowing you would act differently now.

To your other comment: (Truism as in it's true?) The boundaries are slightly different in that power can be defined as "acting as you see fit" and on the sliding scale of power, you're still acting as "you." However, it's a paradox because limitations are inbuilt into existence and the very word "corrupts" presupposes that humans weren't born with absolute power. It corrupts or changes insofar as it provides a different map of actions that were previously unavailable, and if we throw the truism "actions define you" in, well yes you're essentially different/"corrupted".
