I don't know if you think this is cute or an effective rhetorical technique or you simply don't understand, changing the maximum number of pull-ups you can do before the body gives out isn't going to change who you are. Changing the amount of dense information you can parse before you begin to struggle isn't going to change who you are, it would be as if you were dealing with easier subject matter or a lower volume of it. And so on, with other faculties.

All of this changing can create emotional reactions and have personal impact, but it is not necessarily going to change the character of who it is who is doing the perceiving.

Unless your concept of self requires 'anxiety' or the liberal use of the word sufficient.

No? Are you even certain of that, that you can say it with such attitude? The mind, if it is not itself the perceiver can damn well HOLD or contain the perceiver. As a consciousness. As consciousness.
