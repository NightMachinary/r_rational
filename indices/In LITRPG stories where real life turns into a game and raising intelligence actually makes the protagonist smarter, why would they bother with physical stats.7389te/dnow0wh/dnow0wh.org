Seeing as I wrote a fiction in which the main character is integrated into a digital world and is trying to become a 'Digital' (essentially an AI), I had to handle this.

The basic way I handled the issue is that the protagonist has lots of traits he is trying to raise, focused around his mind, but 'int' isn't one of them. he has 'short term memory' and things like that. It all combines together to make who he is. The /physical stats/ aren't even shown for him. For this exact reason. They just don't really matter to him, his focus is on his mental stats and more importantly how he views and interacts with the world, his long term perception and planning around the world.
