It explains why the visions of the entities aren't remembered. That's the last of the shard's own memories before they were overlaid by the victim's. The people who remember? They're not more human than other capes... they're less.

But mostly it explains how characters like Night and Fog and Shadow Stalker and extreme case 53s like Weld can function without (at least temporarily, in the case of the changers) an actual brain. Which is super handwaved in canon.
