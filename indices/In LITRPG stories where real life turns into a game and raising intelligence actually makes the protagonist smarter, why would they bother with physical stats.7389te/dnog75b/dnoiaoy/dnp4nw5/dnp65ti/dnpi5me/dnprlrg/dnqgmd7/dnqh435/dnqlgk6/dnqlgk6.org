I'm not sure I agree with you or EthanCC, but I feel like debating exactly what the 'mind' is, is essentially kinda pointless. Both of you can essentially agree that the mind is something the brain does. And I assume that both of you can also agree that damaging the brain would therefore also damage the mind. From that point of view, both of your respective philosophy's make exactly the same predictions about reality and are, at least from what I understand to be the rational point of view (which I admit might be wrong, I haven't been here in a while) essentially the same thing.

Arguing whether the mind is something generated or supported by the brain, or whether the mind is the content of the brain, feels like a needlessly convoluted debate with no real pay off. I don't see how a reality where the mind was generated and supported by the brain, would differ from a reality where the mind was the brain, given that we are living in a society where our best philosophers cannot decide.
