Yes, it's unsubstantiated, because we are not talking about something with a clear case of right or wrong like, say, the behavior of a charged particle in a magnetic field. We're talking about some category in our minds, as to what we define "mind" as. Categories in the human brain don't necessarily match with reality. I'm saying that thinking of "brain" and "mind" as distinct entities doesn't map to how the world actually is. Everything after the "unsubstantiated" part is the working definition of "mind" that I use, specifically the weighted neural map of a human brain- the information system that acts identically to a human brain at sufficient resolution. And besides, your /theory/ is unsubstantiated and far more complex than my /definition/ (which is not a theory, I'm not postulating anything we don't already know- just using a definition that makes talking about it easier).

 

[[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.159.5.695]["the separation of the two categories is arbitrary, often influenced by beliefs rather than proven scientific observations. And the fact that the brain and mind are one makes the separation artificial anyway"]] (Martin 2002) quoting the Dean of Harvard Medical School if you want to be pedantic.
