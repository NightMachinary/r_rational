There is a logical gap between

#+begin_quote
  will lead to a person having a different perspective
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  explicitly editing the mind
#+end_quote

Because the statement is NOT will lead to a decision that they otherwise would NOT have made.

This is no more evident that you in the past IS another individual and not just you.
