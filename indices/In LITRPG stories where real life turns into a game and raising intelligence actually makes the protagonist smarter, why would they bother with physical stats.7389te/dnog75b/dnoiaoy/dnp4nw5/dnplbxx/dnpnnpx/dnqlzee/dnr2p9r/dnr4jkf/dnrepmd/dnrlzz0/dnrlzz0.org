Ah but I feel like people put too much emphasis on how much a single part of a gestalt contributes to the continuity of the whole. Already, day by day, I'm losing my German. Living where I am right now, in a year or two the german-speaking version of me would have died, but I will still be here.

And if I go out drinking, and drink badly, then in the morning I won't remember what happened the night before. But would the version of me from that night, which went to sleep with a full memory, be said to have died? I hope not.

And to continue the muscle analogy; no I would no longer really by considered a homo sapien if my muscles were powerful enough to life trucks, but I would still be 'me'. Whether or not I could still be counted among the human population, I would still be, essentially, the same person I was before. Sure I would have much stronger muscles, and perhaps the point of view these much stronger muscles afforded me would make it so that I quickly formed different opinions and beliefs than I would have had before, but I simply cannot see how the actual act of altering my muscles in the first place would in any way 'kill' a version of me and replace it with a newer, stronger version.

Education also changes how people think, but we don't say that school 'kills' kids and turns them into students. When a reformed racists makes their new, better beliefs public, we don't mourn their old selves.

And to use a far more fictional example, when we're reading stories about people living in classic 'mutant gene' worlds, and the main character, inevitably, develops some kind of superpower, we as readers don't act as if the character we loved had died and been replaced by a superpowered version of themselves. Even if they suddenly develop precognition, or greatly accelerated thought speeds, we still think of them as themselves, but with a superpower.

And in the same way, if my INT score right now is 20, and I found out I was in a LITRPG story and found some way to change it to 40, I would do it. Because I don't think that would kill me and replace me with a smarter version of myself, but rather just make the central, integral 'me' smarter. In the same way that alcohol certainly lowers my inhibitions and, arguably, my intelligence, but it doesn't kill me either. And in the same way that drinking too much and forgetting a night I used to remember doesn't 'kill' me either.
