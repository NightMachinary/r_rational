If you lose your German, you are losing something integral to "you" as a distinct consciousness formed from your experiences. You are not losing your sapience, i.e. ability to "be conscious." So you're confusing /your consciousness/ with being a /conscious mind/.

Yes, and intelligence is one part of that gestalt. Increasing or decreasing it within known boundaries won't change the fact that you /are/ thinking, it will just affect /how/ you think.

To continue your muscle analogy, increasing intelligence by a factor or two would be akin to changing your muscles to the degree that you can now perform totally different actions. Would you even be considered the same species if you were closer to Superman than man?
