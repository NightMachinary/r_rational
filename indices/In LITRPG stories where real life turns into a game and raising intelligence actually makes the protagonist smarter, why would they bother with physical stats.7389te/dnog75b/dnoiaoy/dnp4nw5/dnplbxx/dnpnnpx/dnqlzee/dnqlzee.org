I think what is happening here is that you are defining intelligence as one of the integral aspects of the mind, while everyone else is defining it as one of the minds abilities. It's similar to difference between how cleverness and memory are treated in the English language. We say 'I am clever' and 'I have a good memory'; in this case people refer to their intelligence as something they are, and their memory as something they have.

In this debate I think what is happening is you are saying, for example, "I am a level 18 intelligence, changing me to a level 6 or a level 24 would be changing something integrally tied to my being", and other people are saying "I have a level 18 INT stat, changing that would only alter one of my capabilities, and would basically be no different than if I altered my STR stat."

Personally I believe that the only truly integral part of my mind is my self-awareness or 'consciousness' I guess (though that word is too fuzzy for most debates). My beliefs may change over the course of my life, but I wouldn't consider an earlier instance of me a different person, despite us having radically different minds. And while waking up after a bad night of drinking not remembering what happened is scary, I wouldn't think that the version of me from the night before (which had access to all of my memory plus the memories of what they were doing at the time) had died and been replaced by a different mind with one night of memories missing.

Essentially, I don't believe intelligence is integral enough to my own definition of consciousness, to believe the modulating intelligence is the same as brain death.
