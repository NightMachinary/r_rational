Thinking that improving your intelligence would result in personality death strikes me as a basically impossible position to hold.\\
After all it would imply that you are dying /all the freaking time/ without any "special" means of altering your mind. Whether from maturation, intelligence increases (if the protagonist is a teenager with some neural development ahead of them), or just from their mind being temporarily altered by tiredness, drugs, or any number of other things. There would also be no way even in principle to assess whether a given change would be enough to count as death.

Of course I generally have my own issues with identity change being too conflated with proper "oblivion" death since from an internal perspective they wouldn't resemble each other. Having your personality forcibly altered can be terrifying all on its own without trying to insist it's the same as having your brains blown out.
