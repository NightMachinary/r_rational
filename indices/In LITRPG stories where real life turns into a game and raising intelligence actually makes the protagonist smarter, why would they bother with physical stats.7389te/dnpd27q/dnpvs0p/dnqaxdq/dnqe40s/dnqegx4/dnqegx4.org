  I think I misunderstood you - did you mean that the increasing Int stat would come with autism?

No.

  Or that the wizard would become very good at solving a, or a few particular equations?

Yes.

Essentially, I'm imagining high int wizards as just having a simple calculator in their brains, not a whole computer. Is that so exploitable? If you went back to the middle ages and gave someone a calculator and the ability to throw fireballs, can they conquer the world any better than if you just gave them the ability to throw fireballs without the calculator?
