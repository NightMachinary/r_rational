To clarify, high int only makes your mental calculator better. As in, it can multiply bigger numbers, and outputs the answer faster.

Having a calculator does not automatically make you familiar with the concept of calculus, or automatically allow you to discover the Newtonian laws of physics if you are still using Aristotelean physics and never think to question it.

That's the whole point here, high int should make you a better mage.

Yes. Mages will be good at accounting. Just like Warriors will be good farmers since they can till the fields with their high strength. Mages will be good architects since they can do the math, Warriors will be good builders since they can do the heavy lifting. Seems balanced to me.
