... Author practicality. Being a successful author requires you to have a fair chunk of int. Otherwise, keeping plot straight and writing believable characters just does not work. But a gamer character who min-maxes for smarts will - given that gamer setups are nigh-universally wish-fulfillment setups, in short order be not only "Very clever", but "Terrence Tao". Very few plots are going to survive that, and writing it believably is absurdly hard.
