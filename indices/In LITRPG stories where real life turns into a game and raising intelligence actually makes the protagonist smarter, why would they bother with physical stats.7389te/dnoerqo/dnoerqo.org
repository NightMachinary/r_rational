By principle? Yes, INT is more valuable. But there are quite a few problems with your perspective:

- What's the balance of the game? Are mages actually any good, or are they pathetic glass cannons shattered by indestructible tanks?
- Do you have magics that you can munchkin? Complex systems to optimize? Trusting or rational people to easily manipulate/convince? Imagine landing in a low-fantasy prehistoric setting. Not much to do there but fight.
- You stand in front of a werewolf, magic ran out and he doesn't listen to reason. Do you still put your points in INT at that moment? Safety is not something you'll have to be given.
- Do other stats come with their own special benefits? STR allowing /muscle wizardry/? END making you immune to magics?
- Is high INT even safe in this game? High INT may not prepare you emotionally for whatever insights you gain. If you see all mages are insane, then it's a clear warning sign.
