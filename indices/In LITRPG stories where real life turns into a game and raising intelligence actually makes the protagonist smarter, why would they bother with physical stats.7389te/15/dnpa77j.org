INT makes you know the solution to a problem. eg angle and power to toss the bomb exactly where you need it.

WIS tells you the consequences, both intentional and unintended. eg what else would the bomb hit and how to minimize collateral damage.

DEX and STR helps you with the execution. eg Telling your arm to throw at an exact angle and power is not an easy feat.
