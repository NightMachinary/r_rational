You're making a lot of assumptions about the game system. The game could, for example, compensate for the difference between intelligence and strength. In a lot of game systems, intelligence starts out really really weak, and exceeds strength only later on, and that's the primary difference.

If you start out assuming that the difference is only aesthetic and that they are of equal power all the time, you're letting your assumptions dictate the entire course of the argument.
