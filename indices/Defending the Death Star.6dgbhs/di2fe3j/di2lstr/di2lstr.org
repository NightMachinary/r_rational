The Death Star was built by a dysfunctional organization which had to resort to conscripting a lead architect in the first place. Most of the management probably rose to their level of incompetence, or past their level of competence by being political creatures who are good at taking credit for the work of others and shifting blame. Most of the people lower down are probably content to do the minimum amount of work necessary to avoid reprimand and continue to collect a paycheck. This all gets worse if you have an imperial culture which actively discourages the questioning of superiors.

And if someone /does/ come forward to point out the flaw, then a clever enough architect is ready to defend his design decision by saying that this is a result of engineering constraints and proscribed trade-offs.
