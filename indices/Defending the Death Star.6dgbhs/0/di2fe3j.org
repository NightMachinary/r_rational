I don't understand how it's possible to have such a huge engineering project be sabotaged by a single (not even trusted) architect, surely the plans have passed through the hands of thousands of scientists and engineers and architects who would all have seen his design flaw for what it was and have rectified it or brought it to the attention of their leadership.

Prior to Rogue One I preferred thinking of the exhaust port hole as a design limitation and the force being an out-of-context solution to something that would have ordinarily been impossible to target, the missiles bent in their flight path because the force guided them. I liked the idea that the death star exploded because it had a particularly unstable and untested power source because nothing prior needed such huge amounts of power.
