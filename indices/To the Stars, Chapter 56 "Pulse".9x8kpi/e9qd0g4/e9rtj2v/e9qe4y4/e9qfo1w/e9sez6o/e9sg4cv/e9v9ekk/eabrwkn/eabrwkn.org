Arguably, even the original show itself is pure subversion. (Including the fact that this can't be inferred from its title or any other superficial properties.) It's a magical girl anime to the same degree that /Bakemonogatari/ is a harem or /Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei/ a school story. It twists and mocks and deconstructs just about every stereotype there is in the genre. So (unlike /e.g./ for Naruto fics) definitely watch the original for this one.

I'm struggling /very/ hard now not to spoil anything. You can do it yourself while getting a better idea of the content using, say, TVTropes, but better just watch the thing. (This may be less important given that you've read the fic; I haven't, so I don't know yet.)
