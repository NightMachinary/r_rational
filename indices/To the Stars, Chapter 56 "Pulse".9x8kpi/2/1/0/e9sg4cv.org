Just a heads up that you may wanna give the original a watch. I say this as someone who started with TtS and then watched the original. It's gonna subvert those puerile tropes. Stick with it thru episode 3 before you decide.

It's not as good as TtS, but still really good and worth watching. If you like TtS, knowing the original character arcs is going be interesting.
