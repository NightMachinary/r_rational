Thanks for the recommendations. I'll try to keep an open mind (I have, in fact, seen the 1995 Ghost in the Shell and thought it was quite good; forgot to mention that).

But, wow, I get the impression that I may have [[https://xkcd.com/386/][pissed some people off]]. My intention wasn't to vilipend the magical girl genre or even anime in general, rather to express my unequivocal recommendation of this fiction and emphasize that viewing the anime is not a prerequisite for its enjoyment.
