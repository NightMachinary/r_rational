The only anime I've ever watched is a few episodes of Death Note, and my general (though uninformed) impression of the "magical girl" genre is that it seems rather puerile.

That said, To The Stars is not only one of the best fanfictions I've ever read, but one of the best sci-fi stories in its own right. It's reminiscent of Iain Banks' Culture and Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. It has one of (if not the most) plausible and best-realized conceptions of a post-scarcity AI-governed society I've ever seen. Its depiction of asymmetric combat with ultra-high-tech weapons -- both on the ground and in the air -- is incredibly well thought out. And its plot is /extremely/ interesting; I'm not quite sure where it's going but I'm sure I want to be there when it reaches it.
