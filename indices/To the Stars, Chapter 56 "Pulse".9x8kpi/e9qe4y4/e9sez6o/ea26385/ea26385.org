Second the recommendation to watch the original Puella Magi Madoka Magica show (though not necessarily the followup movies, which are non-canon to TtS).

It's worth considering that the writer of PMMM, Gen Urobuchi, is an incredible science-fiction worldbuilder, and for someone who loves AI worldbuilding, one of his other works, the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass][Psycho-Pass]], is an absolutely incredible dive into an AI-governed society - a utopia for some in how that AI system has put an end to crime, and a disturbing dystopia for those exposed to the other side of that equation.

Anime is a fantastic medium for depicting the juxtaposition of an innocent mindset with a complex and disturbing world, and Urobuchi is a modern master of this juxtaposition. Don't spoil any more of PMMM for yourself, and watch it knowing that his works are anything but puerile. It will massively increase your appreciation for the TtS lore.

And for what it's worth, Death Note is IMO a suboptimal introduction to the world of anime for those looking for deep sci-fi worldbuilding alongside philosophical themes in their stories. (And it's anything but rational as it progresses.) Perhaps even before seeing Psycho-Pass, I'd start with the sci-fi classics:
