I'm also a sixth year in grad school, but I would always say that teaching, and public speaking in general, is a useful skill for anyone. I consider public speaking one of my force multipliers, alongside writing and programming. They come up in any role, really, and allow you to put things out in the world and stand out in ways that other skills do not.

Glad you're back teaching, and good luck! I just got back from a week teaching APIs to humanists for use in their projects.
