Thanks! And yah one of my first modifications to the first course I taught a few years ago was to assign students a 10 minute presentation each (much easier when there are 12 of them vs 60). Classes in one of my ugrad majors almost always had 2-3 presentations per semester, and I feel all that practice really helped my otherwise mediocre and underdeveloped public speaking skills.
