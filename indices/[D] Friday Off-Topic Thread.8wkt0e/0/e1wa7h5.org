I received teaching assignments (as a going-into-my-sixth-year grad student) yesterday -- looks like next year I'll be instructing an upper div class on primate evolutionary biology, despite not really knowing anything about primates that aren't humans. My TA for the class will luckily have taken and TA'd the class before, though. In years past the class has focused on morphology/behavior but I'm thinking of revamping it a bit to play more to my strengths (e.g. popgen, theory, statistical phylogenetics, etc.) This'll be my first time teaching during the school year, too (I'll have taught a few times but always during the summers, where class sizes almost never exceed 20, vs. the 50-100 that we might get during the actual school year, though I have guest lectured a good few times during the year, given plenty of large-group outreach talks, and given podium presentations to crowds in the ~hundreds). Been a while since I last served as instructor but luckily I'm teaching a class again later this summer so that'll be a nice refresher (funding historically has almost entirely been through various fellowships, and last year I was out of state). Excited to teach at a time when the weather's cold, too, that I might experiment with e.g. Carl Sagan cosplay.

I'm hopefully graduating in a year and not entirely set on continuing on in academia, and from what I hear most R1 faculty positions dgaf about teaching experience, but sometimes SLACs do. Would it benefit me in any other areas, e.g. industry data science (my #1 plan B)? I can see myself spinning teaching duties into relevant desiderata (coordinating lotsa students and lesson plans, explaining and visualizing nuanced statistical results, etc.), but can also see any in-depth description cluttering my CV. A plan D is going to some private high school to teach, but idk if teaching experience can substitute for an education MA lol.
