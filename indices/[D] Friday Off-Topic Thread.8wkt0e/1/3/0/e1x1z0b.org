If you address a private message to the subreddit, the mods will get it as modmail. You can use the link "message the mods" which should be on the right-hand sidebar at the bottom. It will get handled by whichever of us has the time/effort to deal with it, and all mods will be able to see the communication. This is generally preferred if you have some moderation-specific thing that you need to communicate, because it lets whoever has the slack pick it up, while also letting everyone know who's done the picking up. Doesn't work for general comments though.
