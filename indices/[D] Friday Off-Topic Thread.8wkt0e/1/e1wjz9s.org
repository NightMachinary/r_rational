Hey! A while ago, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8q6g8c/bst_preparationspoilers_ranimorphs_crowdsourcing][I mentioned]] I was planning a brainstorming thread for Animorphs: The Reckoning, in the vein of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56uzvp/bst_q_request_itt_post_reactions_to_latest/][previous]] crowdsourced [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6rnjtx/ama_im_a_soldier_for_the_yeerk_empire_and_im/][chapters]] the fic had had.

Well, I've had a flash of inspiration, and what was going to be an unstructured discussion with a few themes has become a full roleplaying scenario, one of my favourite things to do, complete with several pages of events and worldbuilding.

Anyway, the ARG will start next monday and last for a week, so... tune in if you're interested!

Also, I'm still interested in having yeerk players. For now the list is [[/u/Rouninscholar][u/Rouninscholar]], [[/u/CopperZirconium][u/CopperZirconium]], and /maybe/ [[/u/NatsuDragnee1][u/NatsuDragnee1]] if available.

Also [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]], [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]], [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]], would any of you like to assist me? The big thing would be to sticky one different comment at the top of the thread every day for a week. Thanks in advance.
