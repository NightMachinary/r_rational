I'm assuming this is an alternate universe version of Cincinnati that has this restaurant, because I've never seen it in the city, and it honestly sounds a bit adventurous for Cincinnati cuisine, but I don't necessarily have a better suggestion that isn't just a major metro city like New York or Chicago.
