The library wouldn't be redundant because of P = NP (it's easier to check something than to create that thing), but it still requires an essentially infinite amount of time to find the books you're actually looking for.

In much the same way you could make a machine for solving mathematical proofs that tries out every possible proof and then checks them, but it's not feasible.
