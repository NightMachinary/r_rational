At least one person has attempted to generate the Library, which is theoretically possible given modern technology. Link:[[https://libraryofbabel.info/book.cgi?08-w3-s3-v08:1]]

In any case, consider that for every text that coherently communicates an idea in the Library, a text will be generated that completely contradicts it. Even if a text expresses something that seems true, it might nonetheless be wrong in a few minor, yet crucial details. The only way to confirm or deny the truth of any book would be to test the idea communicated within, which makes the library either redundant (because you'd have to put effort into acquiring the truth for yourself, so why use the library?) or useless (in the case of untestable ideas).

Let's be charitable, and assume we are given a work that somehow communicates the location of 410 pages worth of truth-texts by encoding for each of their locations with each letter, and a companion work that provides the key to working out the location of each truth-text in the guide. You'll probably still never find those truth-texts, for there are more books in the library than there are atoms in the universe. ([[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2006/03/how-big-is-the-library-of-babel/]]). It might take you a ridiculous amount of time to travel to these books, if you start from a random location in the library.

This doesn't go into how we would test whether such a guide to reference tomes in the library, assuming we possessed one. Let's say we find the first three works in the guide, and confirm that they are indeed truth-tomes. This doesn't assure us about whether any of the subsequent tomes are worth searching for, or merely gibberish or maliciously wrong in some subtle area.

The information in the library itself is useless. On the other hand, the nature of the library's universe would imply all kinds of strange things about the reality in which it exists - perhaps those oddities could instead be exploited.
