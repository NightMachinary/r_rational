Problem: the actual energy density and extraction cost of books from the Library make this impractical beyond a fairly small scale - maybe you could power a city for a few months or a town for a few years, but no more.

Alternative problem: depending on how the structure etc. works, offgassing, decomposition, or (god forbid) combustion byproducts - gasses or heat - could quickly ruin any planet the Library connected to, given it's near-infinite extent.
