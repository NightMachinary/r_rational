  given there are all possible books,

For clarification, there's a book with aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa throughout it, a book with aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab, a book with aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaac, and so on until every possible combination of letters (and punctuation) is exhausted?

If so, the fact that it contains /every/ possible string means that it doesn't contain any useful information. It is exactly as likely that you would find "one plus one equals two" compared to "one plus one equals ten", as they are both 23 character long strings, and the library contains /every/ possible book.

For a different tack, let's say that there are 40 characters available, and 2440 characters per page (~500 words), making each book 1 million characters long. That's 40^{1000000} possible books, or 10^{1602060} books. You now have access to countless universes worth of building material and fuel for fires.
