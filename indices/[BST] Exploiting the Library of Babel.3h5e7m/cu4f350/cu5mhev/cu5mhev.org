I just thought of this, but is an index even possible in theory? Normal indexes work by using a small amount of information (such as the fact that a book was the 7983th one published in 2015 in the United States) to point to a large amount of information (the content of the book).

With the Library of Babel, there /is/ no small amount of information that can point to a specific volume.
