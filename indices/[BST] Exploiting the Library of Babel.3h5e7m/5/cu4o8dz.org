I disagree philosophically with that. The library does not contain every book. Quite the opposite. It doesn't contain /any/ books. It contains bound sets of paper with ink stains on them, but that does not make a book. A book is made of information. And the library of babel contains nothing but entropy. Sure there's a "book" that flawlessly details the past and future, but there's no real information there. No letter in it tells you anything about any other.

Someone can find a "book", and if they do it becomes a book. It has information because they made it so. They did not find the book. They wrote it. I'd write it the regular way. That's easier.
