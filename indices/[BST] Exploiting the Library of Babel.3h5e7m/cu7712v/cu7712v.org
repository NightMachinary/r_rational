It's an excellent source of truly random information. For instance, you could use any given book (or sequence of books) in the library as a perfectly secure one-time pad.

I think "as a source of randomness" is the best you can do by looking at the contents of the books. Even if you find a particular book that contains text you like, searching for that book probably took more time than writing it yourself would.

On the other hand, living in a practically infinite climate-controlled setting with a practically unlimited supply of organic material has its advantages.
