Author of [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145056/the-library-of-discord][The Library of Discord]] here. If you do want to read it and you're a fan of audiobooks I'd recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji8pInOuGzQ][downloading the audio version]].

I'd also recommend reading "[[http://www.amazon.com/Short-Stay-Hell-Steven-Peck/dp/098374842X/][A Short Stay in Hell]]," it's not rationalist but it is a good exploration of the library and the concept of the duration of infinity.

Now, onto your question. The first thing to do with a library of Babel would be to clean the data: remove the books that are not necessary. At the very least every book needs to be spell checked. The way the libraries are arranged for my book(s?) is as follows:

*Library of Babel:* Sheer combination of every letter of every book.

*Library of Discord:* A Library of Babel that has been spell checked.

*Library of Understanding:* A Library of Discord that has been filtered so that all the grammar of all the books makes sense. These are books that pass a Microsoft word "spell and grammar" check, and have stories that make some amount of sense.

(This is the Library I had in mind for when I wrote the Library of Discord, however [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145056/the-library-of-discord#comment/3529752][I didn't know the math for how to know the size of that library, but I do now.]])

*Library of Accord:* A Library of Understanding (or Discord) that has been sorted and curated by a sentient being (be it an AI or some other creature) that is capable of living for durations of time that can only be truly explained with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation][up arrow notation]]. It's a library that has taken nigh infinite time to find and experiment to know that those are the books that are actually correct.

To truly harness the power of the library of Babel you would need a single person/AI/creature that has read all the books in the library and can give you the one that works for your situation.
