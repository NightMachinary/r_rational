The initial library itself is a N=NP problem. You have an infinite amount of data, but no way to quickly verify the veracity of that data. The teleportation book might look good but until you build the machine it describes, you won't know if it works or not, so its almost impossible to use the library to learn anything new. You can easily check books against your regular pool of knowledge, but you can't use the books to /gain/ knowledge without a way to discard the stuff thats 'wrong'

The digits of PI might have the entirety of shakespeare encoded in binary, but good luck finding it.
