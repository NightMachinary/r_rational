Since it is both significantly larger than, and contains much more usable fuel than, the visible universe; I'd suggest me move in and form nomadic tribes of book-burners. I bet with enough work, you could get essentially-empty books to serve most of your needs; pulped as fertilizer, cut up and remade into clothing, used as building material ... heck, you could even write in them and use them as books.

And that's without even getting into the question of the shelves, the building materials of the Library itself; or whatever space-warping magic is required to maintain it; or what powers it.

We don't need to send many in; until Singularity, their descendants will long outlive the humans of this universe.

EDIT: there's also the question on the lighting, come to think; and the air-conditioning. Both are presumably infinite, or at least vast, sources of energy if you can figure them out.
