The library is useless for book-reading purposes, because searching for a book in this library is equivalent to writing the book yourself.

Even having a correct index doesn't help you. We like to think of indexes as containing short descriptions like "shelf 23 aisle 6" but this won't work--the only index listing that could distinguish a 100,000 character book from all the other combinations of 100,000 characters would itself be 100,000 characters long on the average. Each entry in the index would basically be the book.
