I was going to say /no/, given several of these things have broken at fairly low stresses, but I have a few spare so I thought I might as well test the theory. It held my weight for probably 10-20 seconds before breaking, with mild wriggling (I estimate in the range of 1.2-1.5g). So probably yes, actually.
