Originally, no. Then I used some HK character art as reference images for the cover artist, and they became kind of fixed in my head when thinking about future vessels. Delmutt's current vessel is a direct nod to that influence, but we won't see much more of HK- too obscure to just obliquely reference. Which is a shame, because it's an amazing game.
