Making a successful band of five consisting of both heroes and villains has massive implications. Catherine's whole idea for the Liesse Accords is that she can get both sides to unite for a common, greater cause, and here we see it proved to work even beyond the Truce and Terms.

The Relentless Magistrate has skyrocketed through the hero rankings to maybe my third favorite hero. This guy literally arrested an undead abomination for a minor felony. Not for a crime against the gods, not for slaughtering innocent people, but impersonation. Hanno betting with the Woe has made his top two spot secure, though it's hard to choose between him and the Kingfisher for first place.
