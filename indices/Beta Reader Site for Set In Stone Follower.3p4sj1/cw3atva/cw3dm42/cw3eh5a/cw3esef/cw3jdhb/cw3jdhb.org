I'm not talking about the war. I'm talking about the setup that allows a war between Earth and Mars to wipe out the solar system. Even if they were both North-Korea-like totalitarian states, they would have backups in the outer system and huge secret farm habitats set up as boltholes for the elite. And North-Korea-like totalitarian states wouldn't have the surplus resources to have run the colony project in the first place, so there's no way they'd be monolithic and centrally controlled enough to pull off that "no farms in space" nonsense.

After two hundred years, with technology that can drill a hole through the moon and build viable generation ships? They'd have permanent self-sufficient colonies with hundreds of millions of people on every ball outside Earth's orbit, and probably Venus upper atmosphere as well.

The story as a whole is incredible. It's tight and realistic. The backstory is fifties pulp.
