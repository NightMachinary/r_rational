Thinking about it, you might be correct about it being silly for humans to only be able to survive on Earth and Mars in the Sol system. Earth and Mars were trying to establish four self-sufficient independent colonies. Why would they do this, if they were interested in strictly controlling all off-planet human activity?

It's far more likely that we're looking at a Fallout-like scenario. Post apocalyptic. Perhaps Albert has received crude, weak radio signals from Earth or even Mars, or found humanity struggling on Earth as well, and is trying to help them.

I'll try to give it some deeper thought.
