  EDIT: Also how will this blog stop Amazon from screaming at you for releasing the book for free somewhere on the web?

Amazon doesn't care if the book is available elsewhere unless you put it in Kindle Unlimited. If you're in KU they expect exclusivity, but they don't care if it /used/ to be available online. As long as he un-shared the Google Doc, it's not an issue.
