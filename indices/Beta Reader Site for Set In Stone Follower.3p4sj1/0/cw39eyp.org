That doesn't make sense.

You shouldn't need

#+begin_quote
  to create a secure password protected document
#+end_quote

in Google Docs. When you first create a document, it gives you the option to share it with whoever you want through their e-mail addresses and share it with only these people. Alternately, it should allow you to create a 'shareable link' where you can PM it to only the people you want to see it. In essence, unless you are worried about needing to block someone from the document in the future, it should be fine to use Google Docs or is there some factor I'm not aware of when using Google Docs?

EDIT: Also how will this blog stop Amazon from screaming at you for releasing the book for free somewhere on the web?
