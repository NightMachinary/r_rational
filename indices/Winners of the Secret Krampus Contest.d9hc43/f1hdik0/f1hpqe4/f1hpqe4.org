Thank you for hosting the contest and for your kind words (and the prize)! I think it was a great idea, and I had a lot of fun reading all the entries. I especially loved The /Grakian/ Choice, which I'll be recommending to my friends in the hope that I can add "grak" to my vocabulary and be understood.

I think it would be great for the contest to be run again, although I thought a month was actually a good amount of time before the submission deadline. I was definitely still fiddling with my entry right up until the last couple of days. But it would be interesting to see if changing the contest time affects how many people follow through on submitting a story. Like, would a shorter time give a greater sense of urgency and reduce the chance of people forgetting to work on their entry? Or would it cause more people to flake because they don't have something they're satisfied with in time? I could see it going either way!
