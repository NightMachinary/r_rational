For anyone who wants to know why I'm posting this so much later than the stated voting deadline of Sept 14th, it's because I had a lot of overtime at my job and kept falling asleep when I got home. I haven't been online the last two weeks or so. I made a lot of money because of it which is great, but kinda forgot about this contest until this morning.

If anyone is wondering, I can confirm that vi-fi and CeruleanTresses were the winners when the contest ended, I was just late with the prizes (a month of Reddit Prenium).
