Came across the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755550/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-cryptographic-key][author's FanFiction split of HPMOR]] from a comment in that subreddit. I enjoyed it enough to follow his plug for his own WIP novel, Artie. Bit of a "Ready Player One" feel to it, and 12 chapters in I am hooked. Looking forward to the weekly updates.
