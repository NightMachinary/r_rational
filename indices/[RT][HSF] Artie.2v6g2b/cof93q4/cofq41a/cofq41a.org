n robots are required to replicate a robot. Sloppy code or garblked transmissions cause a set of n robots to create a second set of n robots and transcribe their instructions. This command is not rescinded or transmission error causes the new set of robots with instructions to replicate to have garbage IDs or no receivers. Viola you have grey goo lifeforms of cooperative sets of n nanobots making new sets of n nanobots.
