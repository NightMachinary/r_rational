Ok not bad so far. Some sentences are a bit complex and hard to follow, but it seems this trend drop as the story goes on.

I wouldn't call this Hard Science Fiction yet, some of the technology is bit off, especially considering the whole domain and magic nonsense. I am on chapter 4 now, so that could all change. Cassandra and Cicero = maximum smugness. EDIT: and humor is pretty good too.
