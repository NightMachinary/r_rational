A few things - given that yes, it /is/ a bit of a weird world because I still need to operate within the constraints of what Toriyama defined, and the Red Ribbon always was a pretty weird organisation to even exist.

First, yes, it's not a very populated world. Canonically the setting is mostly modelled on China, really, which makes sense since the original inspiration was "Journey to the West". So, you have some big cities with a lot of population and then vast, vast, /vast/ rural areas of low population density and with comparatively little centralised state control.

Second, it's not a very militarised one. The Piccolo wars put the end to one era, breaking up the world into smaller fiefdoms, and the kingdom that was born after that, the Corgi's, slowly reunited the world under its control throughout the following centuries, a process that's almost complete at this point. As you pointed out, even compared to the population, the numbers are tiny; but that's because there never was a big push for a major military. The RDF is more of a militarised police force than a true army; it never had to fight anything /remotely/ as big as another kingdom of the same size of the one that supports it. On the other hand, the Red Ribbon is somewhat of a mix of a mercenary army and a paramilitary organisation, like the kind that the most powerful crime syndicates could field. It grew in the (vast) spaces of lawlessness in between the areas more tightly controlled by the government.

I think your description is more or less what I imagined. Add to that that the entirety of the world's habitable land is basically only one single continent in the Northern Hemisphere, a bit like if Eurasia was all there was to ours.

The Desert Fox Den would be approximately at the centre of this map, south of the Capitol and east of West City.

The cession of power wasn't always entirely peaceful (the next chapter will mention one example...), but in general it was mostly due to economic pressures - it's hard to go it alone while surrounded by a foreign kingdom when the size difference is so massive. If you're offered the chance to join, and the other government isn't especially oppressive or anything, it makes sense you might accept.

That's more or less the best I could come up with to reconcile both what we know of the Dragon World's history and what we know of its present politics (namely: there is only one King, there is an army, which in fact we see fighting the Saiyans, Cell and Majin Boo later, and yet there also is the Red Ribbon running amok). Of course it's not perfect, but with those constraints, I'm not sure how it could have been made more believable.
