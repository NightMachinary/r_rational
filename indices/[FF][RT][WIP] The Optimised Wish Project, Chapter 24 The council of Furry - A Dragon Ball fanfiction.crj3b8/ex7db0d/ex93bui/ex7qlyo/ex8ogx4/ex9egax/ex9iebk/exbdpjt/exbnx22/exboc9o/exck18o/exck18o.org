It's actually quite a reasonable way of explaining the situation, and I like it.

You are right in saying that it was a lot like old-school China. In this case, there also used to be many fiefdoms of warlords who might oppose the central authority, but so long as they weren't too close or weren't too extreme or expansionist about it, there'd be little reason for the small central army to do anything about them. And if they got out of hand fast enough, it might not even be possible.

Enter the Red Ribbon army, which as a mercenary organization could be hired to fight against the warlords by the common people or by other warlords. It's effectively profiting enough to do a 'world police' job, but as long as it doesn't threaten to attack, eclipse, or conquer the 'normal' army, it's permitted as it allows the central government to spend more time governing rather that fighting wars. All the while the warlords become /less/ powerful proportionally due to losses and the RR's growth over time.

The existence of it would keep the warlords more-or-less in check... At least until a super-powerful alien comes and conquers all the warlords and unites them into a single force. Then the balance of power is broken horribly. Red Ribbon becomes more unified, as does the central army, but it doesn't matter too much when you have Dragonball power-level bad guys who honestly don't care.

But once the alien warlord has conquered the others himself gets vanished, well, the warlords are functionally done, leaving only the Red Ribbon (now partially without purpose) and the central authority. It's no surprise the Red Ribbon would begin to factionalize, as they'd have to find new purpose for the organization (the Instruments) or would have to slowly guide it in its decline until its members could acclimate to new lives and jobs (Black's plan). It would still do individual mercenary work, but its income would be kneecapped unless it turned to crime. And if it did that as an entire organization, it would be an enemy to the world government.
