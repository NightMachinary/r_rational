It got a head start, the world already was unified /before/ Piccolo's war, Piccolo just caused it to break up a few pieces, but the Corgi's original kingdom was still probably something like 70% of all land or so. The culture was already unified to begin with, so there weren't strong identitarian resistances. And I didn't say explicitly Furry's whole /dynasty/ was always 100% peaceful, though it generally strongly preferred diplomatic means over war. Furry himself never waged wars of annexation, but by the time he took the throne, the world was already massively unbalanced.
