Just random themed names I picked. For Zeeman I was thinking of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect][Zeeman effect]]. For Pitt, it was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham][Pitt the Elder]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger][the Younger]], famous British Prime Ministers. For Liu, I don't think it was anyone specific - just a common Chinese name I guess :D.
