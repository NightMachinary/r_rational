So in your version of the Red Ribbon arc, our heroes are working side by side with the Red Ribbon Army, at least at least so far as the make themselves trustworthy.

I like that reasoning for why such a large mercenary army exists when the country seems to be at peace in general. Being a dying holdover from a more violent era makes sense, and even explains their canon behavior a bit better than Commander Reds motivation.
