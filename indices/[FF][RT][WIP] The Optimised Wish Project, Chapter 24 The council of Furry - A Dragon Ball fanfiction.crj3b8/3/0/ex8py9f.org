Consider that while the RR isn't exactly a charity in this setting, it's not the cartoonishly villainous organisation of the original either. It's more or less like one of our real life mercenary organisations, except much bigger (due to the different distribution of power in this world), which allows it to get away more easily with some shady dealings. You can be a yakuza boss and still not be okay with the destruction of humanity. There are shades to immorality, and even within the RR there are different philosophies (the Instruments being an extreme example of a faction that thought the command had gone too soft). Black is someone I'd class as lawful neutral; he does what benefits him, he has a respect for order, but he doesn't go out of his way to be a bastard any more than he does it to be a saint.
