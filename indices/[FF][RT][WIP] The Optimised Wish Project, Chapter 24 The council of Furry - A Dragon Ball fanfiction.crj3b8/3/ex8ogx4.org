I love your dialogue, the interactions between Black and the others in particular.

I think Black truly believes that the RR army is finished... unless he does something about it. That's likely to be his true motivation for arguing against the destruction of the Dragon Balls. And for asking for Bulma's help. When talking with her he showed concern for the welfare of the world but... if he really cared about that would he have served in the RR army in the first place?
