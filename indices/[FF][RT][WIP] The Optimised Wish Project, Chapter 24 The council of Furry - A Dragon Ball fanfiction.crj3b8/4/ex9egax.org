I really don't understand your world's geopolitics. Some dynasty a few generations in managed to become the absolute (or at least some highest) authority of the whole planet and have every formerly independent country of any note swear realty to them, all without the use of force or even an overwhelming threat of such use? And kept it for decades despite being known to see armed conflict as a last resort even in the face of being threatened with the loss of its monopoly of violence? Why did not a single territory of notable size go "we'd rather make all our decisions more locally and would be willing to right for that"?

Also, the army numbers seem tiny. The legal military of literally the whole world can't even defeat an army of less than 100,000 soldiers. That's less than Poland's active military.

Then we have that the top General talks about enemy forces close to their cities, but isn't that always the case, globally speaking?

The only thing that would explain all this is if the world is literally so depopulated that, combined with instant information exchange and quick transportation, it simply makes sense to administrate the whole planet as if it were a medium sized country. Civilization got decimated so much that Furry's nation of origin was pretty much the only place that still had its shit together to the point where most of the rest of the world flocked to being part of an actually functional government and there actually aren't that many places on the globe that deserve to be called a city. Also real estate is so abundant that if people say "this here spot is mine and mine alone to rule and exploit the resources of" no one actually cares as long as people are allowed to leave the place and no horrendous crimes reach the wider public.

But even then it seems like a weird world if everyone ceded power to a hereditary monarchy sometimes on the other side of the planet just in the last century or so and yet said King doesn't answer to any kind of federal council or permanent guarantees of autonomy or whatever.
