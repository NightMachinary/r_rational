I mean, I'm pretty sure there are only five major cities portrayed in canon, so saying the world is severely depopulated makes sense. It would also help to think of the political situation as one more similar to China or Japan than that of Europe, where unification is the goal and the former kingdoms had little difference culturally. Even so, the king doesn't seem to actually rule all of the world directly, the Ox Kingdom would have to be at least mostly autonomous for the events occurring in canon to take place.

The military situation isn't outlandish either. Given a much smaller, sparsely populated world, it makes sense its active military would be quite small. The US directly prior to WWI had a population of 100 million, but a standing army of less than a hundred thousand. This wasn't even during a truly peaceful time, as it was currently dealing with military raids from across the Mexican border, which was in a civil war. If the world here has a smaller population than that, it stands to reason their military wouldn't be all that large either.
