1) Why assume the probability distribution is lopsided? That's less parsimonious for no benefit. 2) Is it so "/very/ badly flawed" to point out that the conjunction of a repeated series of events converges to 0? Even if the probability of no result is 1-3^^-3 (i.e., the device is practically unusable), that still won't save you.
