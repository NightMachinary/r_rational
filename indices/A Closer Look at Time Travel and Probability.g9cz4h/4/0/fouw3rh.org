I've probably read that story before, but I honestly wasn't thinking of it when I wrote the post. The [[/r/rational]] discord logs show that my original conception was in the form of a special register or variable in a programming language which stores future data. When I decided to write this post, I thought it best to ditch the programming analogy in the interest of broadest understanding, but I wanted something that kept its cut and dried, binary simplicity. A device with buttons was the first thing I thought of.

I can edit a link to the story into the post, but I contend that this is a fairly obvious answer to the question, "What is the minimum viable time machine?"
