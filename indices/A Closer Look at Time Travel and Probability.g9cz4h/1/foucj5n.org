Alright, lemme review this.

First off: This is fantastic! I've been looking for a reference like this for a good while, and now here we have one. It's all very well thought out, and took me way longer than twenty minutes to get all the concepts in my head. Overall, a definite thumbs up.

Now, for some nitpicks.

There are some rather critical typos and ambiguous sentences in the explanation sections, namely:

#+begin_quote
  The device flashes blue. You lift your hand. It's heads.

  You push the *red* button anyway, out of habit, the light flashing off.
#+end_quote

*blue

#+begin_quote
  There's a weirder consequence, though. If you splint ten times, you can see every combination of reds and blues; red-blue-blue-red-red-red-blue-red-red-red and all the others.
#+end_quote

Made me think that it somehow gave all the combinations at once every time. Maybe rephrase it to "you see the normal random mixture of reds and blues".

#+begin_quote
  But if you splint ten times, and if and only if every splint came up blue, you splint ten more times, you'll find that the first set of splints come up all blue half the time!
#+end_quote

Also had me rereading several times until I figured out that it's not the /act/ of splinting ten more times that causes it, it's the /intent/. Perhaps add "precommit that if and only if every splint..."

#+begin_quote
  The intermediate is more interesting: if you, as in the original experiment, splint and then splint again and crash if both splints come out *red*, then half the time the first splint will come out red, but if the first splint comes out blue, the next one always comes out red.
#+end_quote

*blue

#+begin_quote
  p(foo) = p(*C* = red) = 5/8, and
#+end_quote

*A

#+begin_quote
  The correct answer is B, which is about three times more likely barring unspecified details.
#+end_quote

"Three times more likely *than the second most likely*"

#+begin_quote
  *A* is the winner, because it only requires the TIME FORCE to act on the long, twelve-hour interval of 5:00-17:00
#+end_quote

*B

​

Next, terminology and concepts.

One: Using "flash" as a verb for the device showing red or blue can be misleading in some situations when you actually mean "turn on and not turn off until you press the button". For example,

#+begin_quote
  The device flashes blue. You lift your hand. It's heads.
#+end_quote

had me confused as to why the button only flashed and didn't stay on, until I realised that it was a problem of semantics.

Two: Paradoxes. While it's central in your writing that there can be no paradoxes, there obviously /are/ paradoxes outside of the models. For example, when first getting the device, we press the blue button because it's glowing. However, the only reason it's glowing is because we press it in the future, leading us to press it because it's glowing. Hence, paradox.

I don't think this is a solvable issue, though, so you can probably just gloss over it. In fact, I'd argue that it's impossible for static timeline time travel to not create paradoxes. For example, when you travel to the past, you'll disrupt photons from their original path, causing a chain reaction of quantum differences that will eventually reach your current self and change you a little - maybe delaying a neutron's fire in your brain - that chaos theories itself into a macro-scale paradox. The only way to avoid that would be to spacially appear a greater distance away from your original position than light can travel in the time elapsed, and even that isn't for sure due to quantum shenanigans.

(As an aside, I found that, rather than thinking of the device as prophetic, it was easier for me to visualise the concept by thinking of it as sending a pulse of light backwards in time whenever we press the button.)

Three: The probability of TIME FORCE. Less of a nitpick, and more of an addendum. The chance of TF happening has to be a function of time, so it would be something like "a one in a trillion chance of happening per second" rather than just "a one in a trillion chance", since the chance of it happening in a single instant is definitionally zero.

For the case of the relation between the time interval and probability, the chance of an event of probability P happening at least once after n tries is given by =1-(1-P)^n=. At one in a trillion per second, for the event to have a 90% chance of occurring, the time interval would be about 73 millennia. Whether or not this is rare enough for typographical lightning to form I'll leave for others to decide. And, for such a low probability per second for a time interval of only a couple dozen thousand seconds, the chance of B happening over A is indeed about three times more.

Four: Lastly, and most importantly, I'm not convinced that Weighted Branch Realism is a thing. I do agree with the concept of redistributing paradoxed probabilities as a model, but not as you describe it. As it is now, the distribution isn't equally weighted. Looking at your example, you're taking the 1/2 chance of blue!C, splitting it in half at B, then giving one resultant 1/4 to red!B and passing the other 1/4 down to A, leaving nothing for blue!B. Now the chance has been redistributed to red!B, but not red!C. In fact, the chance of getting red!C overall is now less than it was previously, at 3/32 vs 4/32.

An /equal/ weighted distribution would be taking the new total and dividing it by the old, then multiplying each element by that ratio to get the new set of numbers. In this case, we want the chances after distribution to add up to one, up from the total of one minus the chance for the paradox element. For instance, the new probability for red!C would be =1/(1-1/8) * 1/8 = 1/7=. In fact, if we were to carry on splinting the other branches in the example, each third-order element would have a probability of 1/7 - an equal distribution. And this may seem familiar, because that's exactly what Model D is doing. It's just another version of Bayes'.

That's some of the thoughts I had while reading this. And to reiterate the start: These are fantastic ideas, and I'm very glad you posted this. Great stuff!
