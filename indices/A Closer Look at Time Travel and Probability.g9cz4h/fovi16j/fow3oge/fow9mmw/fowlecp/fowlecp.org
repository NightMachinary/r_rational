  If this is the case, then under Reroll Realism, how far back does the universe rewind before rerolling? If it rewinds all the way back to the beginning of time (which is earlier than the coin flip), then there's a chance the coin will yield a different result on the next reroll.

That is a good point. Yes, I am modelling Reroll Realism as restarting the whole universe. (Incidentally, this thus seems to be the most plausible model to allow something like TIME FORCE.

  I'm honestly not sure whether the following is a technicality but it might be important so I'm bringing it up: I don't know how to define "causally related" under any of these systems. Independence (as in probability, independent(A,B) iff P(A | B) = P(A | not B)) would be easier to define. Under TimTravel's system they are not independent, so if they are independent under Reroll Realism then I don't understand Reroll Realism and I would like to know what makes them different.
#+end_quote

It's worth bringing up regardless. If you substitute 'independent' for 'causally related' (which is probably better way to say it), in Reroll they are not independent (I think, by the argument you gave above).

  I don't understand Weighted Branch Realism, but I am less interested in that system than I am in Reroll Realism so let's put it aside for now.
#+end_quote

Truth be told, in a certain sense I don't understand WBR, in that I can't point to you a system or mechanism where its distribution falls naturally out (except for a computer blindly implementing the equations, of course). In that sense, it's somewhat arcane and artificial. (Barring someone brighter than I finding a physical logic to it.)

  This is the passage I was referring to when I asked about how to define the probability of a paradox. If it's zero, then Alice wouldn't get the outcome described where the device does not give a prediction at all.
#+end_quote

This is also unfortunate, sloppy phrasing. It might be worth going through the post and tightening up a few misleading paragraphs.

Alice's device behaves suchly because the passage silently assumes WBR or RR (my pet interpretations). For clarity's sake (now that I understand where you're coming from), in RR the 'chance of paradox' is the chance the universe restarts, and in WBR it is the spf.
