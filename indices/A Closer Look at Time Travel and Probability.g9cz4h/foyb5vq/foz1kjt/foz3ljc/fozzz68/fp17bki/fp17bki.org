1) Most probability distributions are lopsided, one way or the other. There is a very small probability that I will be hit by lightning and killed tomorrow, and a much larger probability that I won't; it would be an error to assume that those odds are both 50%. In any attempt to claim that a probability is not lopsided, one should at the very least present an argument in support of that claim.

2) This is true only if we consider a truly infinite amount of time. However, it is easy to imagine a probability of "no result" that's small enough that there would be (say) a 90% chance of getting no result over the next thousand years; a finite amount of time, but a long enough amount of time that I am most unlikely to still be alive and committed to forcing a crash by the end of it. Human lifespan is finite; thus, the device would only need to show no result for a finite period of time.
