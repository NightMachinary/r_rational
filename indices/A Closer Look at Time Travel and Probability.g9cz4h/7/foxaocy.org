This post reminds me of a number of papers looking at the effect of Closed Timelike Curves on computational complexity. Especially interesting are [2] for the exact complexity class of classical and quantum computing augmented with CTC's, and [6] for a discussion of a number of paradoxes involving CTC's in both classical and quantum settings
