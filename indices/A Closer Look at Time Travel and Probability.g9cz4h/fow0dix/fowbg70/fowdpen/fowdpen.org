Thank you for helping me understand.

  If no light comes on, you can just push red or blue and that would be a paradox.

When you do this the correct light will turn on right before you push the button as given by the OP

#+begin_quote
  Furrowing your brow, you decide to press the button again. The blue light quickly shines on before you do, and again it winks out immediately as the button is depressed. You try to press the button again and again, and each time the light shines on, seemingly predicting or anticipating the button press.

Ignoring that point and assuming that you are right that crashing is always possible then how do you reconcile this with

#+begin_quote
  Imagine someone that would every time unconditionally always crash. If we didn't allow the device to output nothing in this situation then there would no valid reality because no matter what happens, the person crashes.
#+end_quote

If this cannot be resolved by /no light ever turns on again/ then what is the result? Every reality crashes.
