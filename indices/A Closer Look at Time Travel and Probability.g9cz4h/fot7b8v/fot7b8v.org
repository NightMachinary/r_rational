This is the most well thought out examination of stable time loop based time travel I've ever seen, thank you for putting all of the thought and effort into this that you did. I'm almost certainly going to be using insights from this essay thing when I include time travel in my stories. I'd also agree with your assessment of bayesian or reroll time travel making the most sense.
