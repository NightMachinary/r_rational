Edit: I did not read the post carefully, retracted.

+That was a (perhaps unnecessary, perhaps ill-advised) attempt at realism there. I believe it requires concentrated intent and will to press the button you precommitted to, especially if it looks like that would cause the universe (/your/ universe, that you're living in!) to stop existing via paradox. Forcing the prediction to be right only works if you can guarantee that you'll cause a paradox if the prediction is wrong. (It's counterfactual blackmail, almost.)+
