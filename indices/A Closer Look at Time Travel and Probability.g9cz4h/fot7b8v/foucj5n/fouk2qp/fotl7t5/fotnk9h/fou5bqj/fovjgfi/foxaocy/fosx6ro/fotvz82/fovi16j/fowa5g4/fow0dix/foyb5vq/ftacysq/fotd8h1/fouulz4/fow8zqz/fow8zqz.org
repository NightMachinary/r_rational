+Thank you. :) Can you explain why in Model B, (blue, red) is so common? If we were trying to prevent paradoxes, it seems it would make more sense to have (red,blue) be more likely (universe refuses to let red,red exist and prevents it).+

Looks like this got fixed at some point, makes more sense now.
