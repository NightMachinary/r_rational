I feel like there is something fundamental that I am not understanding. I can agree to /forcing/ but then

#+begin_quote
  The opposite of forcing would be splinting (after 'splinterpoint'). This is, pressing the button for whichever light comes on next, with no tricks and no conditionals.
#+end_quote

At this point the text seems to assume that when splinting there is a chance of 1/2 for either red or blue. But couldn't the device have any arbitrary distribution? For example, when you splint it could output left with a probability of 0.1, or 1.0. Or when you commit to splinting exactly 3 times in a row maybe the device always goes /left left right/ but for any other splint it is back to fifty-fifty.

Even more confusing to me, wouldn't outputting nothing also be a valid reality when you splint? You say you will press the button for whichever light turns on but when no light turns on you press no button so there is no paradox.

#+begin_quote
  crashing. This is: pressing the button of whichever light doesn't blink on. It's less that you can do this, and more that you can intend this, and reality responds to that.

  It seems that splints are basically coin tosses; it either comes up blue or it comes up red. The exception is if one of those options always leads to paradox. If you commit to crashing when the light shines blue, then it will always shine red. If you commit to splinting, then crashing if the first splint comes out blue, then the splint will similarly always shine red.
#+end_quote

Again, another valid outcome seems to be that when you commit to crashing no light turns on. This way you cannot crash, you just disable the device because any further output would lead to a crash.

#+begin_quote
  If you commit to crashing when the light shines blue, then it will always shine red.
#+end_quote

Or no light turns on.

#+begin_quote
  If you commit to splinting, then crashing if the first splint comes out blue, then the splint will similarly always shine red.
#+end_quote

Or the splint comes out blue and there is no next output.

In fact that result has to be valid. Imagine someone that would every time unconditionally always crash. If we didn't allow the device to output nothing in this situation then there would no valid reality because no matter what happens, the person crashes.

Furthermore, I suspect that if I (or really any human) had the device then after understanding how it worked it would never output anything again either because I simply could not with absolut certainty commit myself to not crash. Even with my best intentions of splinting there would be a small chance in the spur of the moment that I would decide to crash thus there cannot be any output.
