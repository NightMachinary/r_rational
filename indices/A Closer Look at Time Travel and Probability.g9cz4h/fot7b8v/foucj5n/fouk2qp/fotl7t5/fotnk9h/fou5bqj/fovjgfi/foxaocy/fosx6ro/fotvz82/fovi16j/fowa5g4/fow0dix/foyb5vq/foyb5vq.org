There's one bizarre thing I note about your original paths, with the red/blue retrocausation device. And that is this: you /can't/ crash. It's pretty clearly physically impossible. (Sure, you can intend to, but that's about all).

Let's assume that you splint twice, and commit to crashing if both splints come out red. Then both come out red. So, what do you do? You resolve to press the button that matches whichever light comes on next.

The logical result of this intention is that /neither light comes on, ever again/. This prevents crashing, because there's no paradox if there's no prediction for you to subvert. So, there's no need for the universe to avoid a branch of time in which you /intended/ to Crash; because even when you get to that time, you can't actually /do/ it.
