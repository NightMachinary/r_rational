  When you do this the correct light will turn on right before you push the button as given by the OP

Set the interval to one minute instead of one second. Observe the light at t0, then wait one minute. If it was red, push blue. If it was blue, push red. If the light was off, push red.

    Imagine someone that would every time unconditionally always crash. If we didn't allow the device to output nothing in this situation then there would no valid reality because no matter what happens, the person crashes.

  If this cannot be resolved by no light ever turns on again then what is the result? Every reality crashes.

Under TimTravel's model, such a person will necessarily fail to crash, because their finger will slip, or they will never get access to the device in the first place, or they'll get scared and push the right button after all, etc.
