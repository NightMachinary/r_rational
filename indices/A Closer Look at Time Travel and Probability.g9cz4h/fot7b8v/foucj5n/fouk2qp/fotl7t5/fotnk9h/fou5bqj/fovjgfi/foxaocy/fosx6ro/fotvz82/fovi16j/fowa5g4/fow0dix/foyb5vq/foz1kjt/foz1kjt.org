You aren't the first in this thread to notice, and this objection actually depends on the model. It's only valid in Path Realism and Local Branch Realism. In the other two models, your reasoning is substantially weaker, if correct at all; a timeline where neither light comes on ever again has measure zero, because it requires an infinite conjunction of events of probability 1/3 (either no light comes on, or blue comes on, or red comes on; the former has to happen /every single time without fail/): which translates to spf = 1 in WBR; to probability 1 of restarting in RR; and to p(light never comes on | consistent) = 0 in BBR.

And even in those two cases, the objection is technical, and reasoning proceeds unchanged if you posit a special button which forces the device to yield a prediction, as was added in the Alice & Bob example.
