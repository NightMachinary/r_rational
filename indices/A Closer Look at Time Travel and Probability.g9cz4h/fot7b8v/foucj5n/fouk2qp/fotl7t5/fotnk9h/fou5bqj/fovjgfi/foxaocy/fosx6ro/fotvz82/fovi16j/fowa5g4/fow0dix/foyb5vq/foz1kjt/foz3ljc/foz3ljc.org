Your point in the first paragraph here is /very/ badly flawed; just because there are three things that can happen, doesn't mean that they each have probability 1/3. (To take an example; if you flip a coin, it might land on heads, it might land on tails, and it might land on the edge. That's three outcomes, with nowhere /near/ equal probabilities of occurring).

However, your point in the second paragraph is much more solid. A special button which forces a prediction would appear to make a crash a possibility. However, even in the case where you intend to force a crash /and/ can force a prediction, it's /still/ not certain that you will be able to force a crash. (For example; once you force a prediction and see a blue light, you may intend to push the red button but instead drop the device, which lands blue-button-first on the floor). Of course, all the ways in which you fail to force a crash would be low-probability timelines that happen as the universe avoids paradox; so, in at least some of your models, the universe would be avoiding the timeline in which you /intend/ to force a crash to a greater or lesser degree in any case (and by measuring how much it avoids those timelines, you can gain some information over which model is correct).
