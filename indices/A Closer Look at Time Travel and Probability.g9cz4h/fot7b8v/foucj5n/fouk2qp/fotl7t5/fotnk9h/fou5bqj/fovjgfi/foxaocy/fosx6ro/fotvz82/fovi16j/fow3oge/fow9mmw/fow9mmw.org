  I think it's irrelevant? The device seems to have no strong causal connection to your coin flip. You are committing to not pressing the button at all in the ten seconds, right?
#+end_quote

Yes.

  Either way, the only way I could see it matter is if, even if the lights dont flash, the electronics inside the device can generate heat in just the right pattern to cause variations in the air flow which affects the flight of the coin and might have some effect. But if the device is well designed and doesn't send information back and forth unless the user requests, without leaking information, I think the answer is no. TIME FORCE will have to intervene if it comes up tails.

If this is the case, then under Reroll Realism, how far back does the universe rewind before rerolling? If it rewinds all the way back to the beginning of time (which is earlier than the coin flip), then there's a chance the coin will yield a different result on the next reroll. If it only rewinds to some point later than the coin flip, then the coin flip would be unaffected by the device holder intending to follow the scheme I came up with, and something else would prevent you from pushing the wrong button.

I'm honestly not sure whether the following is a technicality but it might be important so I'm bringing it up: I don't know how to define "causally related" under any of these systems. Independence (as in probability, =independent(A,B) iff P(A | B) = P(A | not B)=) would be easier to define. Under TimTravel's system they are not independent, so if they are independent under Reroll Realism then I don't understand Reroll Realism and I would like to know what makes them different.

  I doubt it. ip = prior sounds possible on the face of it. But spf is It's not even a probability, but a fraction of how many children of this branch are paradoxical (weighted so that closer descendants count more than distant ones.
#+end_quote

I don't understand Weighted Branch Realism, but I am less interested in that system than I am in Reroll Realism so let's put it aside for now.

  The culprit's there: it's said the devices exhibit a phenomena called "paradox aversion"; where if the chance of paradox is too high, it's just vastly more likely for no prediction to happen.
#+end_quote

This is the passage I was referring to when I asked about how to define the probability of a paradox. If it's zero, then Alice wouldn't get the outcome described where the device does not give a prediction at all.
