  Turn the dial on the device so it is configured to send information back one second in the past. Flip a coin. Wait ten seconds. If it was heads, clap your hands three times. If it was tails, crash. In which of your models does this force the coin to come up heads*?
#+end_quote

I think it's irrelevant? The device seems to have no strong causal connection to your coin flip. You are committing to not pressing the button at all in the ten seconds, right? Either way, the only way I could see it matter is if, /even if the lights dont flash/, the electronics inside the device can generate heat in just the right pattern to cause variations in the air flow which affects the flight of the coin and /might/ have some effect. But if the device is well designed and doesn't send information back and forth unless the user requests, without leaking information, I think the answer is no. TIME FORCE will have to intervene if it comes up tails.

  I would understand if it said "if the first splint comes out red, the next splint always comes out blue" but as written I don't understand what you mean.
#+end_quote

That was a typo. Thank you for catching, but it's not there on my end. I think what happened is you loaded an old version of the post, and I fixed the typo before you posted.

  Do static paradox fraction and intrinsic probability correspond to the prior and posterior probability distributions in TimTravel's post, respectively or the other way around (other way around: spf = posterior and ip = prior)? Or do they not correspond at all? edit 2b: No, they don't correspond.
#+end_quote

I doubt it. ip = prior sounds possible on the face of it. But spf is It's not even a probability, but a fraction of how many children of this branch are paradoxical (weighted so that closer descendants count more than distant ones.

  Alice and Bob: I assume Bob also consults his device to see where he should look and crashes if he looks in the wrong place. Is that the case?
#+end_quote

Correct.

#+begin_quote
  Surely the "time force" effectively works differently under the different models?
#+end_quote

I'd presume so, yeah. Didn't have enough think-juice left over last night to think hard about the details, unfortunately.

#+begin_quote
  I think it would increase monotonically (but not linearly) with the duration of the interval. It can't increase linearly, otherwise eventually the probability it affects the interval would be greater than one.
#+end_quote

Good catch. Sloppy use of terminology on my part.

#+begin_quote
  If you mean "force blue a million times" I follow. I don't know what "force blue splints" means if not that.
#+end_quote

My bad, it's the same thing.

#+begin_quote
  This is a different version of the device than the original, and it is unclear to me how to define the probability of a paradox in each of your models.
#+end_quote

Easy, it's always 0 :^{)}

But no, this is just sloppiness on my part. The passage above assumes RR/BBR, or WBR. In PR and LBR, it's just false.
