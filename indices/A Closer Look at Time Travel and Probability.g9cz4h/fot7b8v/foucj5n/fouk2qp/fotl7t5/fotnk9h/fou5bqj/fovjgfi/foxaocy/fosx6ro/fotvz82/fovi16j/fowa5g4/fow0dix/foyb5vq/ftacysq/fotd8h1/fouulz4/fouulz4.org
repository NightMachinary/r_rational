Being the OP, I might not be the in the best position to convey things clearer than I originally did, but a one sentence summation of each would be:

- Path Realism: every possibility, no matter how complex, is as likely as any other.
- Local Branch Realism: the universe effectively has save slots, and paradoxes cause it to reload its newest save until things are consistent.
- Weighted Branch Realism: the more paradoxes which could result from a time travel event, the less likely it is.
- Reroll Realism: paradoxes make the universe restart from the beginning, and keep restarting until it's consistent.
