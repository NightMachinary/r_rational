I looked into it a bit, and still not really convinced MWI is remotely plausible. Mostly, because the rules of quantum physics seem to apply to the micro level, but not reliably to the macro level (quantum decoupling), and creating a new universe is as macro as it gets. Plus it sorta seems like people are using the lack of opposing evidence to presume the theory makes sense, rather than having any actual proof this could/does happen.

Still, I guess the point of the article isn't to prove anything, and if you're willing to work within the internal system it's a fun thought experiment. :)
