Can someone explain something to me that I never understood about reroll/many worlds theory? It takes a lot of energy to create a universe and all the creatures within it. Why would the universe completely restart due to a single paradox?

It just seems weird that anything on that large of a scale could happen based on one person's actions. Entropy would kick in at some point and just off the person trying to start paradoxes in the first place.

Actually, this might explain why time travel doesn't exist, universe is like 'you people can't have nice things.'
