  Even more confusing to me, wouldn't outputting nothing also be a valid reality when you splint? You say you will press the button for whichever light turns on but when no light turns on you press no button so there is no paradox.

Have a policy that if this happens, you crash. With such a policy you'll guarantee it won't happen. (see next section for how to crash more properly)

#+begin_quote
  Again, another valid outcome seems to be that when you commit to crashing no light turns on. This way you cannot crash, you just disable the device because any further output would lead to a crash.
#+end_quote

If no light comes on, you can just push red or blue and that would be a paradox.

    The opposite of forcing would be splinting (after 'splinterpoint'). This is, pressing the button for whichever light comes on next, with no tricks and no conditionals.
  #+end_quote

  At this point the text seems to assume that when splinting there is a chance of 1/2 for either red or blue. But couldn't the device have any arbitrary distribution?

It depends on the model, but I don't see why to choose a model where they aren't equally likely. That just makes things more complicated for no benefit I can see. So yes, you do have to mathematically require that it is equally likely when defining the model, but I don't see any reason not to do so.
