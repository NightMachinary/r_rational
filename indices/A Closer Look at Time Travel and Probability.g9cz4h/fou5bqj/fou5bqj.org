This is lovely. I can't wait to be chewing on this for the next week.

For anyone like me who has trouble reading non fiction, I reccomend a TTS (text to speech) reader. My brain is able to hold on to concepts better if I'm able to hear them, and better still if I listen and read at the same time.

Thanks again for the post. I'm really excited about this :D
