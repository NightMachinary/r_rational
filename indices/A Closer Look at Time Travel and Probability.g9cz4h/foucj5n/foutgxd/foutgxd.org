Thank you for taking the time to read and share your thoughts!

I appreciate the typos you caught. Clarity where clarity is due, I should mention the ones I didn't fix:

#+begin_quote
  The device flashes blue. You lift your hand. It's heads.

  You push the red button anyway, out of habit, the light flashing off.
#+end_quote

Edit: I misread; you are right.

+The prediction /is/ wrong here. This was a deliberate choice, to illustrate that it requires concentrated intent and will. If you aren't ironclad in your precommitment, the trick won't work, and I didn't want to gloss over that completely. (It's plausible to me that many people could entirely fail to 'force'; either out of fear of 'ceasing to exist', or out of indecisive wills which can't ensure precommitment.)+

#+begin_quote
  Also had me rereading several times until I figured out that it's not the act of splinting ten more times that causes it, it's the intent. Perhaps add "precommit that if and only if every splint..."
#+end_quote

That's not quite it either. "Causing" is something of a strained framing here. In a meaningful sense, it is exactly splinting ten more times which causes it. Specifically, what's happening here is that there's 1024 time-paths that go through that specific branch of the tree, and 1023 that don't, and thus, getting to that second batch of splints underneath the specific branch is more likely.

Those 1024 extra paths exist /because/ you splinting ten times extra. Now granted, you splinted ten times extra because you precommited to splinting ten times extra, so you can pass the buck there.

That said, he most immediately plausible way to run a scheme like this is if the 2047 timelines were already pre-allocated and each one is made to instantiate a different possibility. These timelines would exist /before/ anything actually happens. Noting that, it would be the simulation which causes it. Maybe it's a magical *0'* program which can statically analyse a *0* universe and determine exactly how many timepaths it will spawn.

--------------

Those two caveats mentioned, again thank you for noting the other typos. They've been fixed. (I've changed positive instances of 'flash' (i.e. flash /on/) to 'shine'. It's a more bit awkward, prose-wise, but I hope it's less confusing.)

#+begin_quote
  For example, when first getting the device, we press the blue button because it's glowing. However, the only reason it's glowing is because we press it in the future, leading us to press it because it's glowing. Hence, paradox.
#+end_quote

It's worth distinguishing two different kinds of paradox. For lack of better terms, let's say negative paradox and positive paradox. Positive paradox is the sort of thing you describe. (More generally, it has similarity to the so-called bootstrap paradox.) Negative paradoxes, then, are what I've till now simply called paradoxes. The distinction is that positive paradoxes permit resolution, and negative paradoxes do not. My rule is that negative paradoxes are impossible, but positive paradoxes are just fine.

#+begin_quote
  In fact, I'd argue that it's impossible for static timeline time travel to not create paradoxes. For example, when you travel to the past, you'll disrupt photons from their original path, causing a chain reaction of quantum differences that will eventually reach your current self and change you a little - maybe delaying a neutron's fire in your brain - that chaos theories itself into a macro-scale paradox. The only way to avoid that would be to spacially appear a greater distance away from your original position than light can travel in the time elapsed, and even that isn't for sure due to quantum shenanigans.
#+end_quote

This objection is vacuous. Fixed points aren't a rare thing (in fact, the proliferation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_theorem][fix-point theorems]], inclines me to think it's downright inevitable.

Specifically, you say "when you travel to the past, you'll disrupt photons from their original path," but this isn't true. By our very assumption, in traveling the past --- /your/ past --- the "disruption" isn't knocking photons /off/ their original path, it's /putting/ them on their original path, right on schedule. The only way the notion of 'original path' as you use it makes sense is if you're conceptualizing the agent as traveling to a past which they did not exist in, which is contrary to the assumptions. The past which they arose in must have already included their time-traveling future self, whether they were aware of it or not. Second- and third- and nth-order effects of this meddling future-self which affect the past would be account for in the future self which arrives.

#+begin_quote
  (As an aside, I found that, rather than thinking of the device as prophetic, it was easier for me to visualise the concept by thinking of it as sending a pulse of light backwards in time whenever we press the button.)
#+end_quote

Ha, I've had similar thoughts when designing my own systems. It is easier to conceptualize that way. I always thought there must be some sort of "time particles" to carry time-travelling information.

#+begin_quote
  In fact, the chance of getting red!C overall is now less than it was previously, at 3/32 vs 4/32.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is by design. Really, I can't speak too accurately about 'intent' (as this is something that fell out of the equations more than something I designed), but I would say the idea behind it is to model the phenomena of time "preferring" less paradoxical branches. The reason red!C becomes less probable is in a sense to "punish" it for requiring the universe to dodge so many paradoxes.

While I do have some appreciation for WBR, I think we have a comparable distaste for it, coming from different directions. I so far haven't been able to think of any mechanism the WBR equations could be modelling (other than a computer blindly implementing them) where such a distribution falls out naturally. It's a neat idea, I feel, but seems somewhat arcane and artificial.

#+begin_quote
  That's some of the thoughts I had while reading this. And to reiterate the start: These are fantastic ideas, and I'm very glad you posted this. Great stuff!
#+end_quote

No problem :D. I have to say, it really made my morning to wake up to such a positive response to my essay.

(I may have been a little blunt in some of my replies, but I hope not too much. I mean you no personal insult.)
