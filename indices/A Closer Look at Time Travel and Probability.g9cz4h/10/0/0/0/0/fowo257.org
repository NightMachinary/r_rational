  That is a good point. Yes, I am modelling Reroll Realism as restarting the whole universe. (Incidentally, this thus seems to be the most plausible model to allow something like TIME FORCE.
#+end_quote

If that's the case, then I think Reroll Realism is the same as TimTravel's system, so let me revisit a few earlier points.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    An obvious corollary to all this is that TIME FORCE is almost never relevant. If you had a bigger device that spat out 32 red/blue pairs at a time, you could predict the lottery without worrying about time force.
  #+end_quote

  Under reroll realism TimTravel's system, if Old Man Wek has a policy to crash unless he win the lottery, and he has a 1% chance of death on the day he buys the ticket (he is very sickly in this hypothetical) then he will almost certainly die. See [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-988]] for a similar thought experiment.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, if Old Man Wek is very unlikely to die, and very unlikely to fail to purchase a ticket and very unlikely to fail to turn in a winning ticket for the money then he will likely win the lottery. Let's say if probability that he fails to get a ticket + probability he fails to turn in a winning ticket given that he won < 1/10^{1000000} then he'll almost certainly win the lottery. The time force matters in proportion to the (prior) probability that you'll fail to follow through on crashing. Prior in the sense of "prior to conditioning on the universe having zero paradoxes".

It would be logical to set up a very robust system that crashes if you die, otherwise time will just kill you to get you out of the way. You could also set up a sort of "probabilistic safety valve" and commit to not mess with time if you get ten heads in a row when you flip a coin before starting. As long as your death is notably less likely than 1/1024, the time force will be more likely to make that event happen to prevent you messing with time than it would be to kill you.

#+begin_quote
  It's worth bringing up regardless. If you substitute 'independent' for 'causally related' (which is probably better way to say it), in Reroll they are not independent (I think, by the argument you gave above).
#+end_quote

OK, cool!

#+begin_quote
  Alice's device behaves suchly because the passage silently assumes WBR or RR (my pet interpretations). For clarity's sake (now that I understand where you're coming from), in RR the 'chance of paradox' is the chance the universe restarts, and in WBR it is the spf.
#+end_quote

Ah, I see.

    Viz. if you do a quantum coin flip and, when it comes up heads, you take the strange device and force blue splints a million times, or, when if the q-coin comes up tails, you force red only once, the odds of seeing blue/red could be 50/50. I.e., by default, half the time there's 50% chance of a 100% chance of seeing blue, and a 50% chance of a 100% chance to see red.
  #+end_quote

  I don't follow where the parentheses go on this case. Can you rephrase?

  #+begin_quote
    The story is only necessarily different if instead of a quantum coin, you flip a time coin; i.e., cause a splinterpoint. When you do this, it's the... the exact same story in Path Realism and Local Branch Realism, but in Global Branch Realism and Restart Realism, the blue branch has a vastly smaller probability.
  #+end_quote

  (I assume restart realism = reroll realism.)

  If this is true, then reroll realism is NOT equivalent to TimTravel's system, because in TimTravel's system flipping a coin and flipping a "time coin" are equivalent. Therefore if this is true then I do not understand what reroll realism is.
#+end_quote

I now think that the two coin flip types are equivalent in Reroll Realism, because Reroll Realism is the same as TimTravel's system. I still don't follow the phrasing on the "Viz" paragraph.

I'll reread the Bound Time Travel and Free Time Travel sections later in this context. I'm mentally worn-out on the topic for today.
