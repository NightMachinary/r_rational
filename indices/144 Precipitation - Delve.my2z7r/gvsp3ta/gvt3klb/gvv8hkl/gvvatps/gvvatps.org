- stats affect your ability to work within the soul space. You dismiss this as obvious, but it's not exactly obvious that a physical stat would come into play here. It might be giving a hint into the underlying mechanism of the strength stat and how stats affect the “real” world.
- something (most likely something to do with the area Rain is in) affects the soul. Soul <-> Real world interaction could be key to future power developments. (Can you communicate through this channel? Interface through it to macros that are manipulating/observing mana levels?)
- Dozer is reforming now, not just scrambled
- Dozer's first thought upon re-emerging (“filth”) gives some hint about what might happen with him in the soul space going forward (will Dozer clean it up, removing Rain's need to process it before doing work there?)
