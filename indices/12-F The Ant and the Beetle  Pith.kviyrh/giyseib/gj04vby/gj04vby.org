It's a great story, but the odd morality is probably the most consistently difficult thing. Anna not taking a body never really makes much sense, she's headshotting dudes and stuff. She could also, which would make more sense, steal one, they're doing missions that are like 100 times more dangerous then stealing a body at this point, and the morality issue is really not there. Being a sub rosa counterrevolutionary with so many moral qualms seems pretty impossible, at some point early on you'd either give up because everything you do is inconsistent with your morality or just start acting from pragmatism. On the same issue, her body breaking down even more every chapter kind of loses its shine, it feels like she should have just died by now, or at least not be able to run around doing missions.

The interludes tend to be better in this story because the main story has to deal wtih these issues, but in general I still think it's great, and does some stuff perfectly that no other story does.
