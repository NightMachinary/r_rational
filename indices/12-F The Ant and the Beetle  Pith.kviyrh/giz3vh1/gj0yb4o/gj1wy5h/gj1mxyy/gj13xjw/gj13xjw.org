  “Because we're special!” Lord Benthey shouted.

  The wind whistled through the air.  Tunnel Vision stared at him, her eyes wide.  “What?”

  “If the world knew our secrets, in months, there would be tens of thousands who could do /everything/ we could.  The beauty and majesty of our art would be reduced to fodder.  We wouldn't be the greatest craftsmen in the world, we would be /relics/.”  He talked faster and faster.  “And if that many Humdrums get a taste of projection like that, they'll start asking for more magic, more invitations to our world.  More power.  Just like they /already have been doing/ since the Pyre Witch's massacre.”

  Tunnel Vision grabbed the rope, her knuckles turning pale.  /He doesn't know she's the Pyre Witch./

  “Paragon is safe and noble and good, because we're exclusive.  Because only a few people have overwhelming power.  When we lose that, our world shatters.  /Everything/shatters.  We need to be special.  We need to be.”
