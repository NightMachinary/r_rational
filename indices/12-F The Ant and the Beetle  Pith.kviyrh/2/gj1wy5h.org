I want to steel man Cuthbert Benthey's argument, because right now he sounds whiny. Even if you believe that elitists only want to keep their power because it makes them feel special, they rarely say it in those words. I know it's hard to make an argument while being threatened with death, but the following version should be basically cached.

The stronger form of the argument goes like this (note that I am not endorsing this argument -- but this is what Benthey should actually say):

1. Humdrums are idiots. Look at the morons they elect to Parliament. We are the cream of society, raised since birth to rule. They listen to talk radio. We have ousting to get rid of the unfit.
2. It's too dangerous to give Humdrums power. Look at what happened when they got machine guns! They went and invented trench warfare. We have the Treaty of Silence to reduce the horrors of war. If we tell Humdrums about projection, so will the Shenti and everyone else. Imagine how terrible war would be if projectors fought. War is Hell. War with Palefire is unimaginably worse.
3. We, Paragon, use Nudging as a tool of last resort. As you learned in your first week at Paragon Academy, it's already saved our entire country on six separate occasions. If everyone had the power to Nudge, we would have to teach everyone to resist it (to stop the vast number of unspeakable crimes which would otherwise be committed). And then we would lose that tool. And the next time some demagogue came along, the country would be toast.
