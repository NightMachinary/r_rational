Fucking FINALLY! It's taken far too long and far too many revelations, but Ana's finally starting to think that maybe Paragon isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's a shame it took so long, especially since she's coming to this realization immediately after she helped foil Commonplace's revolution, but I'll take what I can get.

This place definitely seems like it's some sort of representation of Grace's mind. The sun being the same color as the lightning of her pith, the flashbacks to important moments in her life, the environment as a whole (the electric fence, the factory, the watchtowers) being reminiscent of the Shenti redemption camp, etc. Hell, when we first glimpsed this place back in [[https://pithserial.com/2020/08/18/8-d-grace/][chapter 8-D]] the factory was constantly rebuilding itself, which sounds to me like a metaphor for her vocation. I'm not sure what exactly it means that Grace has a door in her submarine that lets people physically enter her mind, where she got it, or what she uses it for, but that definitely seems to be what it is.

Grace's magic door being front and center here makes me hopeful that some of the weird background elements of the story might be moving into the foreground. There are a lot of things that are really fucking strange about this world or about the events that have occurred that have just sort of been lurking there without too much commentary, and they've slowly been piling up while the revolutionary drama has been getting most of the attention. The lack of stars, whatever happened to Tasia's sister, the rising ocean and how apparently the water gets /weird/ if you go too deep, the oracle snakes, the pit in Buttercup Lodge, the guy who freed Maxine Clive, etc. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the politics and the revolutionary plotline, but the more this weird stuff gets hinted at the more curious I get about it, so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that it gets the spotlight now that the revolution has had its climax and Ana's (FINALLY) having a change of heart.
