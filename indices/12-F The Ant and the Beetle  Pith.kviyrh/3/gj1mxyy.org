It feels like Ana's potential in this story kind of got spent early on, and that her arc has been... well, stretched, for a while, and now is the chapter where it can finally progress at a normal pace again.

(unless she dies; please don't die, Ana, you can still become a butterfly!)

I'm not just talking about her morality problems, by the way. Her body keeps decaying somehow without stopping her from performing high-intensity James Bond theatrics; recently she commented that she was medically expected to be dead weeks ago, and that feels like a meta point.

Same thing with her illusions. A big part of early Pith was the constant escalation between her learning to use her vocation better, and her enemies trying new countermeasures. But it feels like ever since she's been outed from Paragon nobody tries to defend against her anymore. At multiple points she asks people questions that her assumed identity has absolutely no reason to be asking, which earlier in the story would have gotten her busted fast, and now the bad guys roll with it, even in Tunnel Vision's own sub.

I still like the story and especially this chapter, mind you. I just hope that now that Ana's initial arc is over the story keeps its momentum going. A lot of the non-Ana characters (Max, Tunnel Vision, Wes) have shown that the story can still pump out interesting ideas outside of the initial concept.
