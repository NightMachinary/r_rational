Agreed about the Zats; one shot to put someone out without the potential side effects of a taser or tranquilizer and two shots to kill makes it pretty darn useful.

The Kull weapons I remember as not really being any more accurate than staff weapons. If they were, given how indestructible the Kull were, SG1 probably wouldn't have stood a chance.

Small naquada explosives would probably just be too expensive to be practical.
