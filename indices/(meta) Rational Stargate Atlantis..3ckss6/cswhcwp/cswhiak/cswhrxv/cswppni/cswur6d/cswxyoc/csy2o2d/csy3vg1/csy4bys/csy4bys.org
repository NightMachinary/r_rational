  The Kull weapons I remember as not really being any more accurate than staff weapons. If they were, given how indestructible the Kull were, SG1 probably wouldn't have stood a chance.

Plot armor mostly. Many SG teams did die to them, and one Kull killed entire legions of Jaffa and the Goauld they defended. 4 Kull killed the entire Alpha Site once.

  Small naquada explosives would probably just be too expensive to be practical.

Yeah, about that...

Anubis in season 8ish sends a planet killer asteroid at Earth.

They almost nuke it, then realize it is like 40% naquadah by volume, and nuking it would have made a small nova.

Instead, they hyperspace it through the planet.

So, it's still in the system then right?

And you have functional spaceships?

And it contains several billion metric tons of a material worth more to you than solid platinum?

So, you should probably mine that then.

That's an obscene amount of Naquadah. Like, insane amounts. Enough for centuries of fleet growth and power generation.
