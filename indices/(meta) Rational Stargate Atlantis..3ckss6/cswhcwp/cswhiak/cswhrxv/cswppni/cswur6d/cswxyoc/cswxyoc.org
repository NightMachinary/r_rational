There was an SG1 episode where the free Jaffa are disappointed that a weapons shipment from Earth is all P90s, but the humans demonstrate that human weapons are actually much more accurate and deadly. The Goa'uld were more interested in developing intimidating weapons that make big explosions.

Given that nobody had advanced the state of the art in personal energy weapons even to parity with projectile weapons, it would have made more sense to stick with improving rifles and leave personal energy weapons as blue-sky research.
