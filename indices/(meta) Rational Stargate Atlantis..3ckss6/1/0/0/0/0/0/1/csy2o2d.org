For Staff Weapons absolutely, but Zats were the best non-lethal sidearm in the series, and Go'auld Shock Grenades were amazingly useful.

The Kull Plasma Repeater was the best general man-portable weapon in the series. It combined the Armor Piercing and suppression ability of a P90 with the ammo and compactness of a staff.

Why they never made a naquada enhanced C4 for demolotions I have no idea.
