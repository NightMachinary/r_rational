I've seen a clip of the scene where they do that demonstration, although not the entire episode (recently enough to remember it). I liked the scene a lot, but I wish the writers hadn't cheated. They had Sam fire the P90 at a swinging log target and it chewed right through the log, basically blew it up. Nothing less than a minigun can do that, so I wish they had stuck with a more realistic demo.

It was still full of awesome, though.
