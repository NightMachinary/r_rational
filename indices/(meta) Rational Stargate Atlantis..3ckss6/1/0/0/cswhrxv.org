Each Mk 1 Naquadah Generator had an output equivalent to a good sized fission nuclear plant, so there wouldn't be the need for too many more of those - they never came close to hitting cap outside of trying to power the parts of the city that required exponentially more power anyway, and so it wouldn't have helped.

Seedlings or some kind of hydroponics setup makes sense.

But more importantly, they have no way (shown) of making bullets. If there is one thing that a Stargate team needs lots of, it's bullets. Ditto with any equipment that's lost, damaged, or stolen. Modern military hardware can't exactly be put together with a few wrenches and pliers. They'd need some kind of effective construction system.
