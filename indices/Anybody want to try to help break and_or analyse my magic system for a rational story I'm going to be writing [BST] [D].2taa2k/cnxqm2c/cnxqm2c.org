I personally dislike how much it feels like every aspect comes down to word-of-author. The way people receive powers comes down to what feels like a mind projection fallacy , because the difference between all of these is like 100 kelvin, while for the previous 250 kelvin there weren't any distinctions, you know? Water's just water.
