Thanks for all the feedback, this is awesome.

So, stasis. From a conduit's perspective, it feels like they touch a piece of ice, pull the "essence" of it inside them, and then shove it into whatever body part's they want. If they want it stasis'd longer, they shove more into that part. Once they shove it, depending on how much they need, some of the ice will poof into vapor. They have some control, but not enough to choose specifically skin on the arms but not on the joints. With practice and meditation, they can get better at specific regions, but there's still an upper limit.

For the iceputers(I'm sad I can't use that name in the book), that is a very very good point. I think I'm going to change it so that you can't remember your time inside it, but you do keep what amounts to gut feelings and hunches based on your time there. For example, you're in a forest, examining some mushrooms, unsure if ou should eat them, so you go into your iceputer where you've stored memories of learning about poisonous fungi. You study it for a bit, and then come back out, not remembering the studying, but still having the gut feeling that eating the one with red dots is a really bad idea. If you spent a year inside one working on some math problems, you might come out with the feeling that you were on the right track, and when you try to solve it in the real world, you would have leaps of intuition that you wouldn't have had otherwise. That way, they still can use it for combat (Duck!), and it doesn't equal god mode technology instantly.

Can't believe I didn't see the senses and the shadow. This is what happens when you keep on changing things constantly without having it written down. I'm going to go with yes. However, on an other comments suggestion, I'm changing the water shadow so that instead of making infinite water that disappears, a water conduct must instead suck up fresh (I'll say salt messes with the required purity, but that's mostly so theres still oceans) water by touching it, at which point it get's moved to hammerspace, waiting to get used. However, the feedback when you try to do the senses thing with the water from your personal stash, fucks up your water shadow big time, and it stops working for a couple minutes. Plus, all that water used at the same moment will be roughly like setting off a flashbang in front of your face. Too much information is not a good thing. So it's possible, but difficult and dangerous.

With the water shadow and the speed limit, yes, it is possible, it's just generally a bad idea, unless you have insane amounts of practice. For instance, if you swing your arm fast enough, water will come out of your stash, at which point your arm gets pushed forward even faster. If you have a sword and you're swinging it, this can work, but otherwise, you the unbalanced force will probably just knock you on your ass, if it doesn't break your arm when it accelerates at a bad angle. A grand master might be able to do some pretty kickass martial arts using that though, crazy flying kick leaps and shit. With enough practice, you might even be able to redirect that water from the punch into a cutting jet, but well, it's alright if a story has some incredibly badass villains.

Heat storage and then I should really go to bed. Yeah I've been thinking about that, and I'm kinda unsure what to do. I might give their tree's big ass seeds that are incredibly pressure resistant, while still being relatively light and come filled with mostly water. That feels pretty hand wavey, any other suggestions as how to make them more powerful would be welcome.
