It sounds like an interesting system. A few questions:

Stasising parts of my body, what are the limits? Apparently If I stasis my forearm I can still move it, does the same apply if I stasis my skin for example, perhaps leaving unstasised parts at the joints if flexibility would become an issue?

With the memory storage, can you store memories generated while in an ice memory palace in another memory palace? If I am a scientist and I sit in my giant ice palace for hundreds of years thinking and doing mental research, learning all sorts of cool stuff, can I then make another memory palace that contains that entire experience and my memory of it and then work in there for an even longer time? Seems dangerous that potentially something that creates memory (time to think) is also part of the fuel for the power.

How does the water shadow and water sense interact. Can I freeze my enormous water shadow quickly to gain insane senses?

With the 25 mph limit: I can move my hand or foot at 25 mph with little difficulty. Would it be possible to use this method to create shadows instead of sprinting?

The heat storage seems interesting but so limited and vulnerable. The sorts of pressure vessels that can hold large amounts of steam are very heavy, and I wonder how limited these guys would be by that. Especially if they are vulnerable to their own movement, moving something small that weighs 50 pounds or more at any sort of high speed is super dangerous.

Anyway it all sounds pretty awesome, there's a lot more questions to ask I suppose but I have to go. Have fun!
