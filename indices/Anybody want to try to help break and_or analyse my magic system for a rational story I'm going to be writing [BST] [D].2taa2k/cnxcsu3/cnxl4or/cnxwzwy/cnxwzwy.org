Dizzy is fine, health effects are why I limited the acceleration to 3g, but I was mostly thinking about it in the context of lots of Conduits in parallel, and dizziness doesn't apply to vertical climb and descents which are more damaging.

The Ice user could stasis until the water person collapses, assuming they're not then entirely encased in fresh ice (they can't rapidly consume ice with stasis, and memorice doesn't change volume or temp). I am assuming that the newly created water doesn't disappear if it changes forms - if it does, then I would imagine being around water conduits long term while breathing would lead to horrible medical complications from parts of chemicals within your body vanishing.

Invincible walls just means the erosive effects of the temporary water are concentrated and will undermine the foundations (along with all the other buildings). Make the floor of stasis people too (who wants to be walked over all the time?), and water will still flow through the gaps so every so often the whole village drops a bit into the new hollow below. Probably not good for non-invincible buildings or people.

Remember, the invaders don't have to be inside, just overhead less than 5 minutes drop. Good luck hitting someone that high with a crude steam cannon or similar tech.
