Do you think the water people don't get dizzy? I don't believe that spinning in a circle very fast is going to be very good for a person. Of course, in your scenario, an Ice type user could just stasis him/herself until the water person collapses. Thoughts?

And the Ice type fortresses would be difficult to break due to their invincible walls of stasis'd old people. If the political situation(nations) are similar to the Avatar-verse, any invaders would be pretty much incapable of getting inside.
