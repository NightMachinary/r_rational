Ice and Steam suffer the same problem - they are fortress powers (both ice powers decrease mobility, steam needs a local heat source for most of their abilities). Water have insane mobility and incredible attacking powers.

Water Conduits seem overpowered for siege scale attacks. Consider the amount of water you could drop on your enemy by spinning in a circle (2 people, spinning at 3g in a 600m diameter circle gives about 60mm per 5 minutes of rainfall, which is over world record rainfall level... remember, from 2 Conduits). They could fly vertically up and down (well, near vertically assuming they can go faster than terminal velocity) hammering a column of water onto the unfortunates underneath. If it does look a bit dodgy, away they go and the Ice and Steam people can't follow (Ice at all, Steam for long).

On the world-building front, the major travel routes between Water cities are going to be cut quickly into grand canyon style landscapes by erosion from the high-powered water jets passing regularly overhead (assuming there is any regular travel, you could avoid it with an intensely feudal structure). If the nobles have any sense, irrigation wouldn't be a problem so they could spread over most terrain, encroaching on the tropics quickly. With enhanced senses, mining becomes much less about guesswork, so there would be no shortage of materiel for the expansion. They're going to cover the world very quickly.
