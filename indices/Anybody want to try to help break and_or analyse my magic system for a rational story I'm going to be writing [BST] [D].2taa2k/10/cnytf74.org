  Stasis is relatively straightforward, touch a piece of ice, and make parts or all of you utterly invincible, but also immovable. Whatever you stasis gets a silvery, icy sheen. You choose how long the stasis will last, when you activate it, so with a big chunk of ice, you could stasis yourself for years. You can't affect clothing or anything you're holding, limiting turning thin string into an impossibly sharp blade.
#+end_quote

"Parts of yourself" mean you can still create impossibly sharp blades. Stasis a single cell thick layer of your epidermis, or a single hair if dead parts of your body are allowed, and you still get an impossibly sharp blade. You could create thousands of 30Î¼m-thin needles by Stasising alternating rows of skin cells.

As a more macabre option, dying people could turn their bodies into 3D printers, Stasising sections of body parts with arbitrary shapes. Morbid obesity would help with the size limits, and of course the head can be preserved so it's not a costly sacrifice in a Utilitarian sense.

  If you stasis all of yourself, you will become immovable by anything, even gravity, but you won't be able to see what's happening.
#+end_quote

"Immovable by gravity": unconstrained by the clutches of the sun, earth, galaxy, or supercluster components, you immediately fly off into space at thousands of kilometers per second.

This needs clarification.

This is going to be awkward in ten thousand years when the first octogenarians thaw and are immediately crushed to death by later generations.

You wot m8. This is either superconductivity, a perfect insulator, or a cheap source of energy. If it perfectly reflects all heat at the point where it receives it, use it as perfect insulation: furnaces, clothes, etc. If it perfectly reflects all heat it receives, evenly distributed over its surface, coat a thin, very long memory shard with insulating materials (easy to create with ridiculously sharp human skin-knives in the form of a grating), heat it at one end to cause heating at the other end, allowing for long-distance communications. If it always feels the same temperature regardless of heat sources, place it in an environment with a different temperature (e.g. outside) and harvest energy from the heat exchange. Export it to the tropics for refrigeration.

Also: these memory shards add with the Stasis cannons to make perfect pneumatic cannons. Place 1 L of memory ice in the back end of a Stasis barrel, which has one tiny hole in the back. Have someone stand against the back of the Stasis barrel, touching the memory ice through the hole. Have them Stasis their body, except for a cubic micrometer around the hole and whatever else is necessary to be safe. Have them enter the memory ice, and wait there until the memory ice will completely sublimate upon leaving. Then, have them leave. 1000L of sublimated steam propels the projectile forward, having nowhere else to go because it is completely surrounded by infinitely strong materials.
