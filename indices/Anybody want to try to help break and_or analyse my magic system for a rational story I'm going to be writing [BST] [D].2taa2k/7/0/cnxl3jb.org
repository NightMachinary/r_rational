Man, this is why I love [[/r/rational]]. Triggering stasis for the whole body can happen as fast as "oh shit", but triggering it for specific places takes more time and mental effort, probably about up to a half second with enough training and practice. Entering and leaving can happen instantaneously, but it does use up the ice. And I think I'm going to change it, based on some other comments about infinite loops of memories, so that you can't remember what you exactly did in the iceputer, but you do keep conclusions as gut feelings and instincts. For example, you're in a forest, examining some mushrooms, unsure if you should eat them, so you go into your iceputer where you've stored memories of learning about poisonous fungi. You study it for a bit, and then come back out, not remembering the studying, but still having the gut feeling that eating the one with red dots is a really bad idea.

I was planning on perfect insulators, since that would give the ice people an easy way to power their technology. Or maybe it'd be better to simply have them as really, really efficient insulators, like 99%. That way, they would melt eventually, just really, really slowly, and could still be used to make efficient engines for their airships, without breaking the laws of physics. Airships fueled by the consumption of memories sounds fun. I think with the level of technology they have, around 1800's-ish, insanely efficient engines won't be too broken?

Iceputers can be broken just like normal ice, and once broken they turn back into ice. (However, you need normal ice for stasis...) No suits of ice armor, though the armor of insulating ice is possible, if you want to to spend the time to put enough memories into enough small pieces of ice, that will melt eventually.
