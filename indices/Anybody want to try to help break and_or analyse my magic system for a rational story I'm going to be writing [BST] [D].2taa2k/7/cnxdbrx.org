How long does it take for a ice conduit user to apply personal stasis? If it can be triggered instantly, then you have the perfect shield for any attack that you can predict.

How fast can you enter and leave your iceputer? If you can go in and out of your ice mind palace at a high rate, you could spend a minute or so to completely process what you heard/saw/felt/smelled in each 1/10th of a second. This would effectively give you the increased thinking speed of the steam users without the drawbacks.

Do iceputers act as perfect heat insulators (do not conduct heat), or do they just have an infinite specific heat (tend force the environment to match their temperature)? If they force the environment to match their temperature, then they are severely overpowered since 1) they could suck the heat right out of steam users before it could be used, 2) they could prevent a water user from using any of their powers by freezing the water-shadow to their skin as it is generated. If they are perfect heat insulators, then they would obviously have a lot of industrial uses. Aside from making metallurgy much more efficient, they could be used to create engines that are 100% thermodynamically efficient. Heck, with something like that, it may even be possible to create usable fusion power (put water in an almost perfectly sealed iceputer container, add energy until you are getting more energy out than you put in).

Can iceputers be altered mechanically -- can they be cut/carved/drilled/shattered with appropriate tools and force? If so, what what would the appropriate tools/force be? What happens with the pieces of the original iceputer that result -- do I end up with a bunch of smaller iceputers (each with a fragment of the memory), or do I end up with regular ice fragments and the memory is destroyed?

If they are can't be altered mechanically, they would be unbreakable and would be the perfect material for armor and weapons. Even if they break to smaller iceputers, they could be used to fashion armor practically impermeable to heat (Your heat can't get through my bag of iceputer dust armor!).
