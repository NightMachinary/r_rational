*General*

There isn't a specific reason for the theme of water other than it sounded cool, I admit. The segregation of different populations, though, is actually based on the shape of the world. There's heavier gravity at the poles and lesser gravity at the equator(see explanation in parentheses), so the populations have each adapted for their environment, weight wise as well as temperature wise, and so don't do super well outside their region. The powers are actually fairly recent, only having occurred within the last 500 years, when a giant, incredibly intense aurora swept across the world one night. Almost everyone gained the genetic marker at that point, but only young people could become conduits. More exposure, up until the end of puberty makes it more likely, but still not guaranteed. A potential water conduit could spend hours every day swimming during their childhood, and still not become one, though that's very, very unlikely. It's a somewhat random process, but influenced by both the total amount of time spent around the phase and the quantity of the phase around them.

(Take a smallish world, and make it mostly out of dense metals, so that it will naturally have 1.5g. Then, spin it really fast, probably at a minimum of around 3 times earths rotation, though I haven't done the exact calculations. This means that the closer you go to the equator, the more centrifugal force there is, which will offset the gravity. Earth actually has this, it's just a very minor effect. At the poles, you have almost no spin, therefore the full gravity, but at the equatorial hot lands, you have enough spin to give you around .7g. Since its fairly dense, it won't deform nearly as much as a regular world, and if it's a fairly young world, it won't have had enough time to deform out into a more discus shape. )\\
Side note, anyone want to tell if that's actually possible, with the world? The research I did made it seem so, but no else had done the math, and I'm not sure what to do to check it.

So, *Ice*.

I guess unbreakable and unbendable would be a better term, as long as you're not stasising everything, at which you truly do become immovable with respect to the ground. If you stasis your arm, you could use it as an unbreakable lever. Just be careful not to rip off your shoulder. As for degree of control, from a conduit's perspective, it feels like they touch a piece of ice, pull the "essence" of it inside them, and then shove it into whatever body part's they want. If they want it stasis'd longer, they shove more into that part. Once they shove it, depending on how much they need, some of the ice will poof into vapor. They have some control, but not enough to choose specifically skin on the arms but not on the joints. With practice and meditation, they can get better at specific regions, but there's still an upper limit. And yes, stasising your hands or forearm and blocking with it will definitely hurt whoever is punching you.

The efficient heat sink was on purpose, I wanted to give them a way to help power their technology. I think I'm going to silghtly change things, though, and instead of having them be utterly incapable of changing temperature, instead make them very, very efficient insulators. They can still use them for heat engines, but they'll very slowly melt. Makes their civilization consume memory for fuel, which is fun. You can only access your own iceputer, and can't stasis using it. However, you can break your iceputer, physically, at which point it turns back into normal ice and you can use it. There's actually a cultural belief that someday they'll fix all the old people and make them young, cryonics style, so the old people keep all the memories they have left when they stasis. They agree to be part of wall to keep the city safe, and it return the city will someday try to revive them.

*Water* I was trying to make them scary, since they were going to be some of the main antagonists, but I think I succeeded way too well. I'm going to nerf them by having the water shadow only draw on water that they've siphoned off into a personal hammerspace, which also neatly solves the problems of just how the aristocrats are keeping their stranglehold on the peasants. The peasants have no water to make them trigger, becuase the aristocrats are hoarding all of it to fight each other. The ice people do have firearms, but they're not amazing, no rifling yet.

I'm going to say that the senses with the water shadow is possible, but the feedback from your hammerspace and the using it for senses messes up the connection to your reservoir, and it stops working for a bit. If you just use a little bit, it'll only mess it up for a couple seconds, but if you try to convert the whole thing into ice, it'll stop working for minutes, at which point you very well might die from hitting the ground. Additionally, increasing senses by that much all at once will be roughly like setting off a flashbang in close proximity to your face, i.e. not helpful. So, the ice bombing trick is possible, but very tricky to pull off, and leaves you vulnerable to assassination by say your son, the prince.

*Steam* Yeah, I'm not really sure how to define the containers, because right the steamlander do seem by far the weakest, and the need for source of heat is their biggest weakness. I guess I could add the ability to concentrate on steam that's closeby and telekinetically squeeze it and slowly move it, making it so they can mentally deal with the pressure, up until they decide to release it. They wouldn't even need a container for pressure purposes, they could mentally tow around a ball of superheated steam. A vessel would be very helpful for insulation purposes, though, and I'm sure they would love to get their hands on some iceputers... They pull heat through themselves, so I'm going to go with hotter than body temperature. Also, since they can dump heat from themselves into water with a touch, I suppose that means that a violent enough person could make people's heads explode with a touch.
