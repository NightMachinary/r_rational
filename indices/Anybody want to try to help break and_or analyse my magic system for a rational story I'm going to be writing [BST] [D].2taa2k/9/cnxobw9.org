Sorry about the double post, just wanted to give a list of useful 19th century inventions:

- the electric dynamo
- the battery
- steam locomotives
- photography
- the typewriter
- the refrigerator
- mechanical calculators
- the revolver
- the telegraph
- the internal combustion engine
- the machine gun
- dynamite
- the telephone
- the steam turbine
- radar
- smokeless gunpowder

Do all these apply to the ice people? If so, that is one hell of an out of context problem for the water people.
