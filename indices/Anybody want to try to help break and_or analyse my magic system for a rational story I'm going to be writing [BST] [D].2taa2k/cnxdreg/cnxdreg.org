What's the tech like in this universe? Do the steam people have anything more complex than stone tools? Do the water people have steel yet? How far ahead are the ice people?

Also, does ice stasis apply to clothes/held objects as well the people using it? and are there powers for the other two states of matter?

+Lastly, a suggested nerf for the water people; the water shadow doesn't draw from an infinite supply of water, but rather from a finite store that can be replenished by the users+

EDIT: What are the restriction on what can/can't be absorbed? Assuming low tech level for the water people, any water will contain impurities. It it just limited to salt?

How insular is ice society? to the others have any access to their tech? How likely is it for different phase users to work together? Is there a lower limit on steam-heat taking?

Electric dynamos were invented during the 1800's so what an ice user could do is have an iceputer encased steam-powered (heat provided by a steam user) source of electricity. This is something of a trump against the water people.
