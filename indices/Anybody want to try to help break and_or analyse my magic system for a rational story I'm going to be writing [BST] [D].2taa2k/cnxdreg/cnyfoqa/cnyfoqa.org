That's a very good suggestion for the water users and I thank you. It even gives them the water kingdoms a reason to be fighting each other all the time, lands with plentiful rainfall would be very, very desirable, plus it explains why none of the peasants are conduits. Steam has metal tools, mostly iron, helped along by their ability to manipulate glowing hot metal barehanded. They also have a variety of weapons based around rapid steam expansion, effectively really powerful blow guns. Water Kingdoms have 1200's-ish They trade a little bit with the Ice people, for more advanced stuff, but the Ice people are leery of giving up their biggest advantage.

Stasis does not apply, a 200 foot long stasised piece of string would be a little strong on the battlefield. Do you mean Bose-Einstein Condensates for the 5th? I was going to have one of the villains discover plasma, and become a plasma conduit, but I'm not entirely sure what it's going to do yet.

Hmmm. Good points. Only salt is a bit arbitrary, but salt does destroy farmland as well. From a medieval perspective, it wouldn't seem weird that salt stops you from sucking up the water as well.

Ice society is quite insular, the state makes trading away any of their technologies, except for things they consider harmless, a crime punishable by forced stasis. They know it's their biggest advantage, so they don't want it spreading too far. They would love to work with the steam people, since easy heat transfer has a lot of industrial advantages, but the one thing that the assorted water kingdoms agree on is that any trading happens through them, and they are very protective of their territory.
