Some questions to flesh things out:

*General*

Is there an in-world reason for the thematic nature of their magic system? There are a lot of "why?" questions that'd be most easily answered by 'water god said so when he made the system.' Why only 1 type of conduit power per person? Why segregated by geography? Just how much exposure is required to activate a conduit?

*Ice*

Wouldn't the immovable clause preclude punching? If it's immobility with respect to some frame of reference (the ground, probably) then alternatively freezing the bottom of your feet would be a valid method of walking through the air.

If old folk can be used for a wall, I guess than means the length of the stasis is chosen upon activation and the ice cost is 'paid' then as well. Can you change the duration actively? How selective can you be with the process? Can I perma-stasis the skin of my forearm and shin and retain full mobility with nigh infinite blocking power? Getting a super-speed punch blocked by an utterly unyielding forearm would hurt.

Iceputers seem interesting. I'm sure the 'cannot change the temp of an iceputer' clause could be manipulated for tech applications. (super efficient heat sink) It also seems like it may have some crazy synergy with non-ice conduits' abilities. Make a 'container' out of ice, store 'I had toast this morning' and now a steam user has complete immunity to heat/fire while holding it.

An active piece of memory ice seems to be only affected by its creator 'going in.' Can others ever view the stored memory? What if I try to stasis using an active iceputer? When the owner of an active piece of memorice dies, does it persist? If I have an absurd capacity for learning, could I make an ice memory (huge, my entire knowledge of math) then relearn the concept and keep the permanent ice around? Old folk doing the noble sacrifice of 10000 year stasis could probably get a little more yield by more or less wiping their own minds beforehand. Make an entire perma-cool ice palace and turn into a (frozen) vegetable!

*Water*

Water seems outright broken to me. Once you hit 25 mph, you've got super mobility that comes with the ability to shoot cutting jets. If this is a no-firearms type of world, that's nigh unstoppable. Add in the fact that being inundated by an overhead water conduit would really mess up the capabilities of both ice and steam conduits by way of melting/cooling their respective 'fuels.'

'Water sense' consumes water, but someone actively leaving a water trail could just freeze some of that infinite source for arbitrarily strong perception, or make enormous blocks of ice rain down from miles up. Even if water is consumed, rather than frozen, this would be 'always on' for an actively mobile water conduit.

*Steam*

What defines/bounds the idea of a container? If I make a stainless steel sphere 1/2 full of water, then redirect heat into it, I've got the best-case scenario for a fuel tank, but it still seems somewhat limited.

How hot does something need to be to serve as a heat source to a steam user? The cutoff there could make or break its applications. That said, in a fantasy-level world's tech, being able to manipulate molten metal by hand would have interesting outcomes...
