How do the water aristocrats keep the commoners away from bodies of water? You'd think that when the water people were first developing they'd have built all of their settlements along rivers and oceans, even more so than people in real life did. In order to change that, the aristocrats would have had to force people to move inland, which would have resulted in a war that I don't see the aristocrats winning since the water people would have had a large number of commoner Conduits at that point in time. Basically, the history isn't making sense to me.
