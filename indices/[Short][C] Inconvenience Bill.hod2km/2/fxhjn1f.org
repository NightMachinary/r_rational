Why?! I mean, yes, I get the reason why she'd be useful, but you've already had her in much the same position, with her daughter as a hostage, and she attempted to murder you. Yes, you have her imprisoned, but that has never done more than briefly inconvenience her before. Why wouldn't she escape and do it again, now that you're in a significantly worse position?!

This violates a whole bunch of Evil Overlord rules, most especially #16.

Also, handwaving away the part where she gets recaptured seems both like a wasted opportunity for something badass, as well as a real challenge to maintain suspension of disbelief. The idea of Bill not dying due to a technicality is one thing; the idea of a bunch of mooks standing any chance against the force of nature that the Bride showed herself to be in the movies just renders the whole thing nonsensical without some sort of explanation.
