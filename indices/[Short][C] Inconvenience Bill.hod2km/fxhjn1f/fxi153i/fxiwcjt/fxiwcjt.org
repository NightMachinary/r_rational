As I said, /I get why she's useful/, but honestly, this feels like about two scenes in the movie, /maybe/ three if there's a flashback explaining how she acquired the skill to do it, before she murders him. Again. More painfully, this time.

He has a /very/ long time, presumably a lot of money, lots of loyal followers, and the memory of what was done to him, to use to figure out how to replicate the technique himself. It's a stupid, unnecessary risk to keep the person who knows his weakness, has shown an ability to overcome any obstacles between herself and revenge, and /has every reason in the world to want to murder him/, including /keeping her daughter from her/ */again/*, in an easily-escapable trap near where he sleeps.

Congratulations, Bill. You had the chance to become functionally immortal, and instead, added a half hour (at most) to the movie's run time and gave it back its original title.
