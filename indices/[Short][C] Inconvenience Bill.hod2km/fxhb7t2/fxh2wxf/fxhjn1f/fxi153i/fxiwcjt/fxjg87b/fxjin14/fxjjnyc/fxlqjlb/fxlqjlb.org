  he has done a lot more this time around to minimize the risk

I'm sorry, I'm not seeing anything he's done to minimize the risk other than throwing her in a pit and recruiting some more mooks to guard her, which, I admit, should mildly inconvenience her for the ten minutes (screen-time, maybe one night in real-time) it'll take for her to overcome those obstacles. Am I missing something?

Seriously, it's a pit. Since nothing is specified otherwise, I'm assuming the walls are made of the default thing that pits are dug into, which is earth.

I'm not any expert in prison design, but I'm pretty sure that the professionals don't segregate a maximum security prisoner by putting them in an earthen pit with a grate at the top. And, again, not an expert, but I suspect there's a good reason for that.

  And he is not simply provoking her, he is minimizing the risk by enforcing the Snake technique
#+end_quote

By enforcing the Snake technique that she's overcome enough to attempt to kill him once already? And holding hostage her daughter, when his theory of how she was able to overcome that technique in the first place was that "parental love overrode my charm"?! Come on.
