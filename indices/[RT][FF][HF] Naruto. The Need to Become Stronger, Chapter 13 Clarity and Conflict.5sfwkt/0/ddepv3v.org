All right, time for some action! I have to say, I'm really curious to see how you guys like this chapter - since it's the first one with real ninja combat.

I wanted to emphasize the sheer /speed/ and lethality of ninja combat in my writing (which is what you would expect from rational ninjas who are actually trying to kill each other), as opposed to the dull "and he punched the other guys forehead with his left arm, and the other guys said 'ow you bastard!' as he kicked at the hero, and then..."

(And of course, rational ninjas wouldn't be so nice as to just show up and go "Hi I am here to kill you shall we fight?" No, they would use things like Haku's ice mirror to gain an actual /tactical advantage/, instead of just using it as an attack technique.)

Let me know if my combat writing style worked for you or not.
