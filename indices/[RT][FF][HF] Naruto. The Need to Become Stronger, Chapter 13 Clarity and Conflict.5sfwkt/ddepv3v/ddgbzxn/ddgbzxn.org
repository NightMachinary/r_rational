Great chapter! We really see the payoff from the slow-paced buildup of the mission. Haku's surveillance and clever planning has paid off, while Kakashi's Constant Vigilance has allowed him to survive the first strike. Both sides have wasted resources on initial strikes that didn't pan out, and now we're set up to have an epic confrontation where our heroes will hopefully escape by the skin of their teeth and show everyone that... well-preparedness saves lives? That our protagonists' mercenary military dictatorship is morally superior? I'm not sure what the moral of the arc will be, but I am sure thag you already know!
