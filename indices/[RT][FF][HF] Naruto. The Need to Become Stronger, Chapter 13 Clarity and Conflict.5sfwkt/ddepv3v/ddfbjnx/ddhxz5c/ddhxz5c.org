Hah, yeah, resource management is incredibly important for ninjas, as part of countless snap-decisions regarding your opponent's abilities relative to your own, risk-reward trade-offs with respect to your objectives and lightning-fast experimentation by using techniques and seeing how your opponent counters them. Realistically the skill-cap for ninjas would be insanely high I think - I could write a whole book about optimal ninja strategies, probably.

In fact, I think I'll have a couple scenes about the subject, later on in the story. There should be some interesting material in there, and I'm getting the impression that quite a few people would like to see more explicitly rational material in the story anyway.
