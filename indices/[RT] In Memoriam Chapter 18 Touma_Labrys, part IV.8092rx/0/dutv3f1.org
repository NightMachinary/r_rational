We're coming up on the conclusion of the story with the second to last chapter. I know this has some fans here from the last time it was posted.

For those of you who haven't been following it, the premise is that Japanese scientists from a fictional Academy City have managed to unlock and study native psychic, or esper, abilities from the human population. There's also a separate, but potentially related, genuine magic kept hidden by religious organizations.

It's a major AU from the source material, and while knowledge may be useful at times it's unreliable and entirely unnecessary for enjoyment of this work.
