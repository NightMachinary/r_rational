Yeah. it's always a problem with vampires in stories like buffy. I will point out that the resouling ritual does seem like very dangerous high magic as Giles couldn't cast it, and it seemed to be very risky for the caster. It also may not really be modifiable as even Willow just recast it instead of removing the "one moment of true happiness" caveat.
