From what I recall Angel's soul is still condemned to go to hell after his eventual death, and /I think/ it's not just because of the evil he has done. It's the default for vampires, like they get burned by crosses even if they are freshly risen and never did anything unholy.

So, that would actually be a terrible idea as it trades eternal torment for health, strength and a longer lifespan. Which admittedly is the kind of Faustian pact we usually see in media. But still just bad math, temporary happiness for eternal suffering.
