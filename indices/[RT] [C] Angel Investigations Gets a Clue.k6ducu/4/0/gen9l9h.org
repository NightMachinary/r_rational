Vampires in Buffy are corpses animated by "blood demons". Their original soul is not present. At the start of Angel, he is unique in that regard. So I don't think we can draw conclusions from the other vampires as to what happens to his soul.

That being said, Willow casts the curse to re-ensoul Angel again in the show without modification, implying that his soul is wherever it originally was before the first time it was stuffed back into Angelus.
