Alright, I looked through some transcripts, came about this in S05E04 Hellbound

"You think any of it matters? The things we did? The lives we destroyed. That's all that's ever gonna count. So, yeah, surprise. You're going to hell. We both are."

So it may not be the default but punishment for their deeds. Still, feels weird to punish the soul for what the person did when they were a soul-less demonkin.

Either way, I wouldn't consider mass vampirification a good idea. Soul or not, human blood is still a strong temptation and plenty of ensouled people are not the kind of person to trust withstanding the lure, or not to abuse their new-found power.
