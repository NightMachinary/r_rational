According to your description it wasn't a spell we saw able to achieve this but a curse. There is therefore the possibility that the necessary components for a spell that returns a soul to a vampire is deep personal hatred for the vampire in question and deep pain from the recent death of a loved one.

As an aside, if there is a creator god in the buffyverse it is obviously a sadistic one. It would fit its profile if it made it so the only one who could restore a vampire's soul is someone who hates it personally.
