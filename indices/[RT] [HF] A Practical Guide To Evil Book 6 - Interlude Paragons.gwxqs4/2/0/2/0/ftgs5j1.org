I think this does a disservice to Lawrence.

Lawrence started from an opposite point of MK when she was his age. She was willing to give people the benefit of the doubt and a second chance. Years of bitter endings and cleaning up messes made her a hardliner (even though she was stilling willing to bend a bit when Grey asked).

Christophe jumped straight at being a hardliner without any history giving him a justification, other than a) being young and sheltered b) not know how to deal with his inner turmoil.

The sad thing is, I sympathize with MK. If someone had actually taking him under their wing, I think he could have turned out a fine lad (and he can still redeem himself)
