You're expecting far too much nuance of Christophe. So far as I can tell, his core character trait is refusing to compromise.

It kinda reminds me of the SSC post about "epistemic learned helplessness" [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/]]

If you /know/ you can be convinced to take a course of action against your interests by people who are cleverer or more practiced, your recourse becomes refusal to consider otherwise convincing arguments. Christophe has to know he's more a strategic asset than a chessmaster. Now that he distrusts the people in the chessmaster role, his fallback authority is just capital-G Good, defined here as opposition to evil.

Solution: Throw him at the dead king ASAP, rather than letting him make a hash of the Truce and Terms. He'll probably just oppose whatever evil is nearest to hand.

Alternative: Throw him at the Wandering Bard. Lack of nuance and refusal to compromise might work as assets under the right circumstances.
