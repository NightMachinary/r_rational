It really stinks of a story with no good ending for anyone. MK might just be one of those metaphorically unyielding heroes, fit's the theme, but it's hard with this story to tell if there's some 5d chess going on. I'm kinda hoping for a simple "Look how much mess one stupid hero can make" perfect storm, maybe some unknown backstory for it.
