Thinking about the conflict between White Knight and Mirror Knight as on a meta level a conflict between a rules based approach and a conflict based one.

When Hanno agrees with MK he sees Hanno as on his side, then is confused when he doesn't agree with him on the next issue, but Hanno is impartially implementing a set of rules that are independent of who is involved. Eg. As he says, he think MK is the best person to weild the sword but it's not his decision.

You could see this as a microcosm of what's happening in the whole book of transitioning to a modern notion of what a state and political system should be. First was establishing professional armies rather than the personal forces of individual Lords/named. Then the formation of something like a professional meritocratic civil service in procer and the arsenal. And establishing laws that are binding on everyone impertially rather than being extensions of a ruler's power.

Mirror Knight is effectively a hold out of the old approach who doesn't realise the world has changed
