Hey, its not guaranteed that Sai will take it as his opportunity to strike. Sure Hinata is alone and he thinks Naruto and Sasuke are tired from sparing each other, but maybe he will wait for another opportunity. And killing Hinata, she is a fan favorite, the author can't just kill her after giving her so much character development. /s

Oh crap, I wasn't sure it was going to happen before, but now I've convinced myself. My only hope is that Hinata figured out something was wrong and manages to take out the ANBU guy herself.
