I felt the same way about Kakashi at first. Protagonists can't die offscreen, dying of food poisoning is pretty anticlimactic, he'll probably come back later and be all "Nah. I was just testing you."

But then I remembered that 2 chapters ago Hinata CRUSHED NEJI TO DEATH, and I decided he was probably gone.
