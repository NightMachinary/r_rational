Wow you basically destroyed the canon plot. Talking about going off the roles. This Danzo seems to much more competent then his canon equivalent, he doesn't sound like a fascist sociopathic warmonger.

By the way, I don't think that Kakashi is dead yet. Maybe he's being tortured by Danzo in some dungoen somewhere but not dead.

Sai is definetly planning on killing Hinata. Hope she lives.
