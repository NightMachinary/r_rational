Well that was gratuitous.

I understand why you killed Kakashi -- Danzo is evil, you needed a way to demonstrate that that had emotional impact. Ok fine. Killing Gai offstage as well doesn't serve any visible purpose other than to remove an interesting character and a good source of comic relief. At this point I'm pretty much assuming that a major canon character is going to die every chapter, just to show that it's a crapsack of world.
