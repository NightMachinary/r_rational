Killing Kakashi also makes the trio not be able to rely on adult help, so they have to do stuff alone. Gai would most probably be their next jounin of choice. I'm betting he is planning to make them get out of the village for good and turn traitor, which might be much easier to do when you don't have friends fighting against you.

edit: I never liked Gai and his eternal springtime of youth crap. :D
