That's what I thought when I saw little snips of the show...it was much too shonen for me to enjoy today. I thought maybe there's something not easily seen at first. (Like Fullmetal or Madoka Magika - you can't immediately tell that they're good)

I'd wonder why it's inspired so many fanfics, but then again I still have a fondness for the pokemon-verse and I don't think I'd have the patience for such a grind-heavy game today either! (Seriously they could be raking in so much cash if they made a more sophisticated game along the same lines, for the kids who grew up, in addition to just repeatedly replicating the same game with more pokemon...)

...although I can't say I liked the pokemon anime, at any age :P
