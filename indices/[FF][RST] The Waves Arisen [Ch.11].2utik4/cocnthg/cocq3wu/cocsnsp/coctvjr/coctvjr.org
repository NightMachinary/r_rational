Naruto is shonen's shonen- not only does hit have DBZ-level of slow pacing (5-episode fight scenes, extensive monologues to give important plot details), but the anime continually outpaced the manga as it was being written, so there are entire filler arcs, where nothing of consequence happens to the main characters. Many of them.

Also, the longer it went on (and it went on for years and years and years) the less sense any of it made- it very clearly wasn't plotted out before it started in any level of detail, so by the end there's like 7 levels of villains manipulating each other down the line, and of course you only find out about the newest one once the last one is defeated.
