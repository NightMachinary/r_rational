I am getting that feeling I had when I read A Song of Ice and Fire, where I literally wonder every chapter who is going to die off next. Naruto left Hinata alone with Sai... Lee still back at Leaf...

Great job playing up Pein as a dark Naruto. You chose the perfect time to introduce him and his basic motivations as similar to Naruto's.

Danzo seems like a obvious culprit for the assassination, from canon we know he has the motives and means. We also know about Orochimaru from canon. Perhaps they colluded directly or indirectly.

Congratulations, you've gotten me to the point where I genuinely believe any character might die at any time. I would remind you to be careful of darkness induced audience apathy (to use the TvTropes terminology), but you've already written the draft and are just editing as you post apparently so I will just hope for the best.
