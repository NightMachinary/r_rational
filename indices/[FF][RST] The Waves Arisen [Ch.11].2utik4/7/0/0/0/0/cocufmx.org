Haha back in my shonen-age days some of my friends watched DBZ. All I remember is a blur of Bu, a green person, Saiyans with tails and changing hair colors, a whole lot of screaming and people holding energy balls for the entire episode. I don't think I could give a coherent summary of what it was all about, and I kind of suspect it wasn't actually about /anything/ in particular.

It's interesting that animation (which is hard to create) could /ever/ outpace a manga (which is fairly easy to create), especially a manga without a particularly tight plot.
