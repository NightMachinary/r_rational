Not really. HJPEV is completely wrong about Quirrel. Lex Luthor from alexanderwales rational fic was wrong in his assessment of superman for much of the story and was probably wrong to kill him. Hana (the person who designed CelestiAI) from Friendship is Optimal should have just programmed CelestiAI to satisfy human values and left out the friendship and ponies part.

I would say in rationalistfics the protagonist doesn't make casual, stupid mistakes (i.e. plot driven idiot ball, failure to communicate, forgetting to use their powers, etc.), not that they don't make any mistakes.
