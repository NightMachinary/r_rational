  It would be hilarious in a dark way if it turns out that Sai never had any plans to kill them and the team is forced to run from their village due to Naruto's paranoia.

Everything else is weak circumstantial evidence, however Sai asking Naruto to turn off his Byakugan, right as the get close to enemy territory, only really makes sense if Sai is plotting something he doesn't want Naruto to see.

  In addition, it would be an awesome ending if Naruto figures out a way to abuse the Rinnegan to revive everyone who has die in the story, but that has a really low chance.

Ah yes... I almost forgot we were reading a rationalist story and not a dark fic. I can definitely see at least a distant epilogue where the manage to use all their OP ninja to actually do some lasting good.
