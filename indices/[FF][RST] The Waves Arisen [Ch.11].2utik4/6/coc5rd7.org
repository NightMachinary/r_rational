It would be hilarious in a dark way if it turns out that Sai never had any plans to kill them and the team is forced to run from their village due to Naruto's paranoia. But while it fits with the darkness of the story, it doesn't fit with the rationalist theme where the protagonist needs to have a good reason for most things and never turns out to be wrong.

I fully expect Hinata to die, and Naruto and Sasuke kill Sai before joining up with Pein (or Orochimaru if he's working separately from Pein). Less likely scenarios are ones where Sasuke dies instead of Hinata or only Naruto survives.

In addition, it would be an awesome ending if Naruto figures out a way to abuse the Rinnegan to revive everyone who has die in the story, but that has a really low chance.

Does anyone else think Madara is dead or did he fake Pein out?
