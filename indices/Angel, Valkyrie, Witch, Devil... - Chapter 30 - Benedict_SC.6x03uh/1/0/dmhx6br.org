McCree and Amari were jointly escorting Morrison to a cell- they didn't have any reason to suspect she would help him escape.

IDK if that didn't come across- I started writing a (pretty boring) scene that went into the details, but I decided to cut it and let Sombra recap instead. Skimming the chapter, I /think/ I didn't miss anything, but from the inside it can be hard to tell when you're making inferential leaps the reader isn't making.
