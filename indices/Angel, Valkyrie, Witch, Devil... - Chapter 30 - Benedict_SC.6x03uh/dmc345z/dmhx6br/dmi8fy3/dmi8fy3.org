Escape isn't the problem-Ziegler had mentioned earlier that Amari had reacted badly to the Ending Death bit, so to have McCree be the one to escort her is to have Ana re-find out through someone who doesn't understand the full story. Better she find out from Ziegler or Athena who can actually explain things before she develops an incorrect conclusion based on limited evidence.

All in all, it's a tiny amount of "why did she let that happen" for me, easily explained by them being distracted, but I think it is there.
