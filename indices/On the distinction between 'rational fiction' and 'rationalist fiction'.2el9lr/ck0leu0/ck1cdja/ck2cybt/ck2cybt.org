I agree with eaglejarl - get it out there! If you don't, it's much easier to just let yourself stop and falter. And reading reviews of your story is really a bit of a motivational boost, at least for me.

To expand on the website choice part, fanfiction.net's interface truly is horrendous, though you can make it very easy to work with and minimize exposure to it if you do things right. Here's my process (after several bumpy iterations using different tools, and some variations of version control):

I do the bulk of my writing in Scrivener, using plain-text [[http://michaelhyatt.com/multimarkdown.html][MultiMarkdown]] (tip: use it - it saves time and is easier to work with), but any editor capable of writing plaintext works. After that, I upload to Google Drive where my multitude of betas use the suggestion and comment features to give feedback, which I can then implement. The idea here, though, is that I then download the Google Drive document as a plaintext file, which I can then compile into any format from MultiMarkdown using a program like [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/][pandoc]].

I've found that fanfiction.net seems to accept .html files best, so I tend to convert to HTML5 and then upload and do some final formatting in fanfiction.net's horrendous interface, which is mostly just centering a few sections (MMD does not support centering).

Overall, exporting things and converting things and uploading things etc. is kept to a minimum. Overall, I don't spend much more on those parts than at most 10-15 minutes per chapter.

Archive of Our Own (which I also post on and keep updated) has a much better, easier and sleeker interface than fanfiction.net, though actually I find myself importing to fanfiction.net's interface, and then doing a select-all copy paste from their rich text editor into AO3's rich text editor. That's just the easiest for me. However, AO3 has a much neater layout for reading. The counterpoint is that way fewer people use AO3, so you'll have much fewer readers.

And also, my fic (In Fire Forged) only counts as rational fiction and is tagged as [RT], but is not rationalist fiction - so I'm benefiting from that distinction, since I'm posting here whenever it updates! Happy to see that the tag I'm using really is allowed. I've still had a few feelings of guilt or am-I-doing-this-properly-I'm-probably-not-argh-help whenever I used it.

There should maybe be a separate tag to distinguish them though, so we know if something's rationalist, or only rational.

Edit: Whoops, this was supposed to be in reply to ignirtoq. Ah well, guess this way works too.
