Well, the basic idea is: write it in plaintext MultiMarkdown somehow, then convert that to something which fanfiction.net swallows easily without needing extra work from your side. <--- condensed version of the post above.

I honestly don't spend a lot of time fiddling with interfaces, though I can see, reading the comment, that I went into a bit too much detail regarding my /entire/ process, perhaps, including quite a few unnecessary details :D

Still, I think my point holds: fanfiction.net has more readers, which means you need some good reason to skip it, and I don't think the interface is sufficiently awful to be that reason. I guess it also depends on the fandom, of course.

Your point about threaded comments is good, though. I /wish/ I could do that with reviews.

Edit: Also, writing it in HTML sounds absolutely awful. I much prefer MultiMarkdown, mostly for the reasons listed in the post I linked in my reply above.
