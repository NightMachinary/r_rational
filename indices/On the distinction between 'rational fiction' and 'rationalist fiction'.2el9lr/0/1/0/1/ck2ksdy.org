  And also, my fic (In Fire Forged) only counts as rational fiction and is tagged as [RT], but is not rationalist fiction - so I'm benefiting from that distinction, since I'm posting here whenever it updates! Happy to see that the tag I'm using really is allowed. I've still had a few feelings of guilt or am-I-doing-this-properly-I'm-probably-not-argh-help whenever I used it.

  There should maybe be a separate tag to distinguish them though, so we know if something's rationalist, or only rational.

Given that this is among my favorite Naruto fics, keep posting! I'll add a tag specifically for rationalist stuff - I'm just not sure exactly what. =[RT-ist]= is the least-but-still-awkward option I can see...
