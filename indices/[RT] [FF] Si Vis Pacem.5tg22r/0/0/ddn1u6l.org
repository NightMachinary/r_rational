I had similar issues early on in the story, but I think it gets much better later on. The author actually has a decent explanation for the idiot ball Taylor has early on in the story but it takes a while for it to come up and the foreshadowing/reveal is a bit luckluster. The saving grace of the reveal though is it is totally possible to come up with the reason very early on.

Honestly the story is more rationalist than rational, especially later on. But there are definitely issues with its execution that I didn't mind too much but YMMV. The author is definitely attempting to write a rational fiction though.

My recommendation is to keep reading if you don't mind the beginning too much as it definitely gets better later own. I ended up really liking the story but I totally see others not liking it. Especially as someone else mentioned it's tone is a lot like a fix it fic. Things in general sort of work out instead of horribly backfiring.
