I really wouldn't call it rational. Taylor holds big and blatant idiot ball - just to preserve the stations of canon. Fighting Lung alone and joining the Undersiders in situations like this are so non-optimal, the vast majority of worm fanfics try to avoid it these days. And that's not even taking under consideration that Taylor here apparently is superintelligent and mostly clear of bias. In the comments, the author blames Simurgh, Entities mind control and the story "not being a wish-fullfillment fic", whatever that means...

I mean, it's not bad, but it's also not really what it advertises at the beginning.
