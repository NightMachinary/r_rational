A bit too fix-fic for me. I'm up to chapter 12, and so far "enhanced intelligence" seems to mean "everything goes well for Taylor". Which is nice for her, but not especially Rational. Maybe it changes later on, but I don't read Worm fanfic to read about things going well.

This line in particular:

#+begin_quote
  While I lacked wisdom, I was sure to pick it up quickly. My principles of humility and forgiveness already served me well.
#+end_quote

is quite ironically funny. If there's one quality this Taylor hasn't demonstrated yet, it's humility.
