Yeah I basically agree. There are a couple of developments later on that make me say its more "rationalist", but it's not strong enough to argue the point, though I will say that a lot of the reasons that it doesn't qualify boil down to execution related. A lot of the ideas are there, and an attempt has been made to bring it all togeather in a rational way, but it doesn't quite get there. All in all, I like the story, but I acknowledge its flaws.
