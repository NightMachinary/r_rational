I kept reading because I think it's fun to see where it eventually goes. Although, I think I would have used Taylor's powers differently. She's underutilizing her powers, in my opinion, but I guess she has different interests in subject matter than me. (And I've gorged myself on diverse fiction and Wikipedia articles for years; so I'm probably a wee bit more savvy than she is.)

I think I would have probably had way too much fun playing around with biology, and taken a long time to venture out and try any "cape activities". For example, I would have liked to see if I could create an organ like a specialized brain, that could act as a dedicated calculator, or something that lets me sense and interpret radio (at least analog) signals.
