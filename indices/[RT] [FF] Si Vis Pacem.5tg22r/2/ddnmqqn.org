I agree that it genuinely looks like Taylor's self-modification was always intended to be not that great. I think there are two reasons why this is communicated poorly.

Reason one is that her weird decisions often lead to her repeating the plot of Worm, rather than going too far off the rails, at least early on. She joins the Undersiders. She wants Brian. She robs a bank. Even if there /is/ a reason for her decisions being bad, once readers notice that the author has a specific goal, it will feel like there's an idiot ball.

The second is that unreliable viewpoint characters are a lot harder to read than they are to write. Check out Umberto Eco's Baudolino. Practically every time the frame narrative appears we are reminded that Baudolino is an untrustworthy source. Frankly it gets repetitive. And yet it's /almost not enough reminders/. Readers will tend to try to believe the viewpoint character unless there are intrusive cues to disbelive.
