  Destroying the Earth is harder than you may have been led to believe.

  This is not a guide for wusses whose aim is merely to wipe out humanity.

  This is a guide for those who do not want the Earth to be there anymore.

  Special effects no longer satisfy me.

  You'd get into trouble.

  Number of times the Earth has been destroyed: 1

  However, as a rule, you will probably want to keep the true purpose of your project secret from as many people as possible for as long as possible.

  *You will need:* An entire planet Earth made from antimatter.

  *You will need:* .....an unimaginable amount of energy.

  You're looking at billions of years minimum, folks.

  This is left as an exercise to the reader.

  Hmm. The problem is, the microscopic black hole would still be in hydrostatic equilibrium, so it would still qualify as a planet according to the IAU!

  Earth, like the liquid metal Terminator, will reform from its shattered shards.

  It's clear that dropping the Earth into a singularity is massive overkill.

  But if you have the technology to build a Dyson sphere, why are you reading this?

  It's surprisingly easy to end up with Earth in a loopy elliptical orbit which merely roasts it for four months in every eight. Careful planning will be needed to avoid this.

  If your best efforts fail, you needn't fret. Nothing lasts forever; the Earth is, ultimately, doomed, whatever you do.

  *Total existence failure.* You will need: nothing. Method: No method. Simply sit back and twiddle your thumbs.

  Swallowed up as the Sun enters red giant stage. *You will need:* patience.

  Crunched. *You will need:* considerably more patience.

  Torn a new one. *You will need:* about half as much patience.

  Decayed. *You will need:* all-surpassing patience.

  White dwarf is good, but we're not fussy.

  Atmospheric considerations are ignored here since it is far more energy-efficient to manually remove the Earth's atmosphere, move the planet, and reinstall it.

  It all depends how fussy you are about how the Earth looks afterwards, of course.

  Let me emphasize the words "big", "heavy" and "clonk".

  This can be employed to move the Sun and Earth in tandem to a place where the Earth can more easily be destroyed.

  Existence negated via time travel.

  Destroying Rob proved remarkably easy.

  Destroyed by God. *You will need:* God.

  In all three cases, the new Earth would still need destroying for real.

  A few people suggested...making [Earth] a moon rather than a planet. Yeah, yeah, very clever. /Get back to work./

  What would you do if the Earth were destroyed? C. Begin work on Venus

  Proving that 1 = 0.

  Gay marriage.

  Earth is old and obviously in pain; it should be put out of its misery.
