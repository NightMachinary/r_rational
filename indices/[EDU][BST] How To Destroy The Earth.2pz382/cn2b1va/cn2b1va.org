I'm not sure if this would fall into one of the subclasses, but how about Von Neumann machines creating themselves from Earth's mass, and then leaving Earth via orbital mechanics?

Solar powered self-replicating machines slowly reproduce themselves from the planet's mass, and start moving to the equator. Over time, the Earth becomes a plate-shape instead of a sphere. Eventually, the self-replicating machines reach a plate diameter sufficient to start shedding any machines that manage to crawl high enough on top of their bretheren.

At that point, the Von Neumann machines are sufficiently established, and they would begin building space elevators by simply erecting them directly from the surface of the planet, supporting them within the plate until they extend beyond the escape point. Connect as many space elevators as you like to a ring of carbon nanotubes surrounding the Earth. Two elevators would work - more is just faster.

Now, all the Von Neumann machines start carrying water, non-metals, and other materials they don't need for their own manufacturing up the space elevator and simply dump it off into space, where the orbital velocity at the ends of the counterbalanced space elevators exceeds the escape velocity from Earth.

After all the less useful solids and liquids are gone, the machines simply walk up the elevators and jump off into space.

You never have to worry about disposing of Earth's gaseous mass, because the gasses will disperse as the Earth gets less massive.

The power for all this could be any number of things, but solar would probably be the easiest after humans are gone. You could use orbital mirrors to light the dark side of the Earth, so there is sunlight 24x7. More mirrors would allow more energy to be directed to Earth but there would likely be a point of diminishing returns, as the mass and complexity of the mirrors grows.

It sounds a lot like a grey goo scenario, but it's not. The Von Neumann machines can use themselves to build infrastructure to allow for very low energy dispersal of Earth's mass into space.

I'm fairly confident it's not the same as meticulous destruction (as currently described in the article) because the space elevators make it so much more efficient to shed Earth's mass
