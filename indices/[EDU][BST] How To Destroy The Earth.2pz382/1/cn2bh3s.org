I was thinking that the antimatter Earth collision wasn't such a great solution because you'd have to fire this anti-Earth at Earth extremely fast in order to ensure a high percentage of each collides with the other. However, on reflection, this isn't true; the anti-Earth and Earth will have a contact explosion, knocking both away, but the shearing forces will cause both to crumble.

This suggests that a much smaller anti-planetoid would work, or a moderately smaller sabot round.
