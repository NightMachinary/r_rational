I agree there won't be much use for a peanut that can't be altered either physically nor chemically. You can make a good armor if you have a whole lot of peanut. Just make a frame that house a whole lot of them. But a single one? Hmmm.... I think there's industrial use that depend on small volume of material with high integrity/durability. But again, a single peanut? It won't change the industry! You'll need a contraption that even a single one of it can change the world. Do death ray make use unbreakable peanut?

BTW, what makes a projectile armor piercing? I would guess inertia, or maybe momentum, but ultimately speed and its refusal to deform. The next question, how fast can we speed up an inert unbreakable peanut?
