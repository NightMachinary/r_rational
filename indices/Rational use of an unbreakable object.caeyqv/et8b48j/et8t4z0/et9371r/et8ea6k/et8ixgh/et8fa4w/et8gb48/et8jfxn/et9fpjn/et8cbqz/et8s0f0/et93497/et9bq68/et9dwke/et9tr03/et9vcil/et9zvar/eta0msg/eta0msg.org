Well now my question is what exactly is your plan. It's certainly not going to be a handheld weapon now that you're talking about other methods of potentially firing this thing. I fail to see how a small if unbreakable projectile is worth putting huge resources into firing at absurd speeds to do a lot less damage than you might imagine. Why not just use a conventional piece of artillery or a small missile? If you're thinking even bigger why not just use a nuke, or drop orbital kinetic bombardment via titanium rods? Why bother making a huge railgun or something just to fire something the size of a peanut?
