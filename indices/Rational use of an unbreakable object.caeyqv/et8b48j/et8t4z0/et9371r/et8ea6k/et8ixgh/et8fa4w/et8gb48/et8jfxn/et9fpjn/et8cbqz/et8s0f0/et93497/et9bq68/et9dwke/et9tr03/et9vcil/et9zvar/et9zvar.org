  The reason we can only launch a projectile so fast has nothing to do with the material.

I don't think that is true. As you increase the acceleration applied to a breakable projectile, at some point the projectile will break (deform or have pieces crack off).

Also, you seem to be assuming that the projectile will be launched by expanding gas from combustion. But that is not the only way to launch a projectile, especially if you have an unbreakable projectile.
