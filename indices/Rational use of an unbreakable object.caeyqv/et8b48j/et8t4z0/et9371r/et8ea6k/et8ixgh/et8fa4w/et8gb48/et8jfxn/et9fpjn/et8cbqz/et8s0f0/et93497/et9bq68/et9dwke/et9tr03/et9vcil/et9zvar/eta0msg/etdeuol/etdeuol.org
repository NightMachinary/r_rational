I agree, however we are simply trying to find a rational use for an in breakable object. If it is truly unbreakable and is shaped where it has a small diameter and given great energy it would be an extremely powerful kinetic weapon. Most modern APDSFS (sabot tank ammunition) requires some diameter to not simply shatter on target. It utilizes a thin and strong core (tungsten or DU as an example) this unbreakable material could be made even thinner meaning that even fired at similar speeds it's penetration would be greater as it concentrates more energy into a single place. This would be useful as there are some targets that can't be penetrated by any current kinetic rounds. Yes you could just use a large bomb or nuke or even larger more powerful cannon. However the strength of an unbreakable penetration core and the improved shape it can provide would be an improvement to smaller weapons systems. Its not about it being a stronger effect per say it's about how such ammunition would improve current weapon's effectiveness not creating a whole new class of weapon. I think that a projectile with enough force only a few mm thick could cause damage to even the largest armored vehicles if it penetrated in the right place so now it's more a problem of accuracy instead of power or size. Either way an unbreakable projectile certainly has benefits in chemical or alternative powered kinetic weapons systems.
