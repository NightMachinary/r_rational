That's entirely fair, I was thinking that it would be immune to the typical effects of adding energy to an object, but that doesn't mean it is locked in at a particular energy level.

I have more thoughts about potential uses for it, but those all depend on the nature of the object. For example, the object could be unbreakable while still retaining elasticity, making it a way to store incredible amounts of kinetic energy. I'm sure there's a way to munchkin that further into infinite energy, but I can't think of it at the moment. There's just too many unknowns to delve into it too far.
