Honestly that's kind of a waste. You can't make it too thin or light because without any weight it would be useless against even basic armor and would be too light to effectively use defensively, so it would end up being roughly a regular sword but unbreakable. This is nice, but not particularly special or helpful.

Also an unbreakable material is intrinsically unshapable by physical means because, as some above said, melting is just atomic bonds breaking after you add enough energy.
