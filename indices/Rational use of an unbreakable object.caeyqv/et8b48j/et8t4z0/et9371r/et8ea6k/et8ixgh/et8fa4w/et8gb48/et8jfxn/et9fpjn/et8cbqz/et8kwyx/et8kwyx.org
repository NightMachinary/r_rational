People always say you can flatten a matchbox sized bit of gold out enough to cover a tennis court. Assuming you can work this material (maybe a dodgy assumption, given it's unbreakable) you could flatten it out into quite a large area or long length, and it would remain completely unbreakable. Uses from there are pretty straightforward, for example super thin and strong armour or weapons, assuming the material is light enough.

If we stick with the peanut shape, probably not so useful. Doesn't look like a good shape for hammering, seems unlikely to have any particularly sharp edges. You could use it for party tricks, but you could probably accomplish most of them with a piece of steel shaped like a peanut.
