Worst case scenario it's slightly deformable so you can't violate the speed of light but you still can't deform it enough to really change its shape much. You can't use it for infinite thermal energy storage because at some point it will simply radiate the energy back as fast as you're adding it. With these limitations I can't think of much you could do with it.

If what you get back is black-body radiation and you can get it hot enough then I suppose it would work as a "any kind of radiation to gamma ray converter" but what would you do with that? If you're in a "close to modern day tech but without the nuclear bomb"-scenario it could be a weapon?

You might be able to find a way to store an infinite amount of kinetic energy by spinning it while suspended in a vacuum, but getting that energy back in a controlled manner wouldn't be easy. Getting it back in an uncontrolled manner gets you a bomb with an insanely high upper limit on the energy output. You might end up having a problem before then since the mass of the object will increase at relativistic speeds, but if you accelerate it while it's far enough away from any gravity wells (e.g. by pelting it with a particle accelerator) then you have a "variable-mass point-source" which I guess could be useful but doesn't seem terrible world-breaking given the time required to add or remove mass. Back of the napkin math says turning it into a black hole would take on the order of gigayears even if you could direct the entire energy output of the sun into it.

Of course it might again just radiate the energy away somehow when you try to store kinetic energy, depending on how intent the DM is on preventing your world-breaking.

I suppose you could use a large enough explosion to launch it into space from sea level, but you couldn't attach anything to it so the only benefit would be shooting down a single satellite with very low technology. Or with very high technology it could potentially be used as a planet-killing bullet, but I'm not sure how you'd accelerate it that much. Get it into orbit around a black hole and keep increasing its speed with particle accelerators while nudging it closer and close to the event horizon, then nudging it out of orbit? If someone can travel to black holes then they probably have better ways of destroying planets, but maybe the scenario includes a race of beings who just happen to live near one.
