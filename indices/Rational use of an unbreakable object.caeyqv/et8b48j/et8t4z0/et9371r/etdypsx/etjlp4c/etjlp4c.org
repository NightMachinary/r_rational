It's an interesting question. I really don't know what would happen. If it had enough kinetic energy I'd assume the impacted matter would turn into plasma (which would make for some extremely dense plasma at the pressures inside the planet) so maybe all you'd get is a briefly existing small tunnel of plasma through the planet.
