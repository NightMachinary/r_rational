Would it actually destroy a planet though? I think if you got it going fast enough, it would just pass straight through the planet without much commotion, dragging a peanut sized column of mass out the other side. And if it was slow enough to dump a decent amount of energy into the particles it's hitting without just sending them out the other side, it wouldn't have enough energy to destroy the planet.

Most kinetic near c impacters rely on the concept of the imacter expending the majority of its energy into the planet, often by breaking apart and spreading out when it hits things. An unbreakable object wouldn't do that.
