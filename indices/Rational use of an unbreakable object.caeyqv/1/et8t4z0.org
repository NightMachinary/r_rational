Break the laws of physics, utterly.

Let's say you have a platonic solid - a cube - that is the literal ideal "rigid body", just a bit of volume that can't be deformed or broken, it only possesses mass and a moment of inertia.

Such an object will allow you to fundamentally violate relativity.

Push it on one end, the other end will move /instantly/, because it can't deform. That means it allows FTL signalling.

If it /can/ deform, it must have an elastic modulus to do so, but I guess then you could exploit the fact that it can accumulate literally infinite elastic energy because it never breaks. And I'm not even sure how /that/ would work because where is that energy stored? The object doesn't have any individual atoms, it can't be in the potential of the electromagnetic field that keeps them together. So does that energy just go somewhere else? Does it even contribute to the local stress-energy tensor? Everything basically stops making sense.
