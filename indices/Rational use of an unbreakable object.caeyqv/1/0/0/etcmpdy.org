Well, you couldn't use it to send FTL messages to Mars that way if it's just peanut-sized of course. But it still breaks physics. I mean, basically, if any part of it can move FTL, it can /all/ move FTL. So maybe you can just slam it into a railgun and keep accelerating it to infinity?

It's hard to figure out how it would work because /it should not work/, so all bets are off. I'm also trying to think if there's some clever experimental setup with subatomic particles or photons where you exploit its FTL movement qualities. It should be an infinite potential barrier, so it should completely bar quantum particles from tunnelling or even having a vanishing wavefunction in it, and combined with the FTL stuff that means if you just used it as a piston in a cylinder full of some kind of gas or plasma, and one of those particles happened to be colliding with it when suddenly you push it a bit inside... I have /no idea/ WTF would happen, that sounds like it ought to transfer infinite energy to that particle. Oh, and anything that's FTL is basically travelling backwards in time in certain frames of reference, to make things more complicated. Easy stuff.

As for the deformable version, it's less outrageous, but still outrageous. At a basic level it's the perfect energy storage. No losses, 100% efficiency, infinite capacity. Can you break the first principle and create free energy with it? I don't think so, not in an obvious way I can think of, though the fact that this ought to be a /classical/ object in a quantum world might still give rise to some serious mindfucky consequences which may or may not break thermodynamics. But due to 100% efficiency it's basically already breaking the /second/ principle. Or... skirting the limit, really, since that's just zero entropy creation, not negative entropy. But perhaps you can use it also to extract energy from a colder body, and thus reduce entropy. Suppose for example it's perfectly reflective (it ought to be, it's not like it has individual atoms to absorb light!). Then I think you could use this setup: put it in a chamber with a gas at T > 0 and shine a laser on it at an angle, then collect that laser with a photoelectric cell and turn it back into electrical energy. The molecules of the gas hit it and make it oscillate, and that oscillation modulates the laser's frequency, thus transmitting some of its energy to it. I /think/ you could use some variation on this theme to extract energy out of the gas, making use of the fact that the cube doesn't have thermal radiation, doesn't have a temperature, and is perfectly reflective. But I should try and run the numbers to be sure, and it's likely that it wouldn't be very useful regardless due to the losses in the laser + photovoltaic cell apparatus.
