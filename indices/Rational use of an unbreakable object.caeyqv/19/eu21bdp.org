Late comer, but again depending on the specific properties of our object, if it's unable to absorb any energy it would be a perfect reflector.

Such a perfect reflector could be used to turn almost anything into a nuclear explosion, assuming your peanut can be shaped into a bottle.

A perfect reflector would be opaque to neutrinos. so you could gather a bottle of neutrinos. No one knows what that would be good for.
