You have a good point. If an object that was an "infinite heat sink" existed, you could obtain energy even in environments where the temperature is the same everywhere.

​

Why would an unbreakable material be an infinite heat sink? Because as materials heat up, the molecules move faster and faster. A hot solid transfers energy in both directions if you put it in contact with some other liquid or gas.

​

An "unbreakable" material can't really have it's atoms moving around above a certain velocity, or the material will turn to gas.
