Elasticity is a good point. To be considered unbreakable, I would think that the object must either be perfectly elastic, or perfectly rigid. If it is elastic, then it would be able to store arbitrary amounts of kinetic energy, as you say. If it is rigid, with no elasticity at all, then...wouldn't that mean that pressure on one side is transmitted /instantly/ throughout the object? As in, FTL signalling?
