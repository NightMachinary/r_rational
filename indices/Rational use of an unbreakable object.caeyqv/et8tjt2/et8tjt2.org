I assume it can't bend or compress, which means that sound has to travel through it instantly (maybe just at c?). If it took time, the energy from the wave would have to actually be somewhere in the interim.

Heat and electricity need to either be transmitted or stored in the material. The storage side is potentially useful since the material doesn't melt, which could mean higher capacity than real-world options. So if we want to assume the unbreakable material is as useless as possible, it should be a good conductor (but not a superconductor or anything).
