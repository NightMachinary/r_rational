An unbreakable material cannot melt, because melting really means breaking apart on the molecular level. Thus you can use it to build containers for ridiculously hot materials, like molten tungsten.

An unbreakable material is immune to most chemical reactions. It's atomic bonds cannot be broken, so at best only layers of new atoms can be created. Thus it should be a completely safe container for pretty much every chemical, no matter how reactive.

Though it's not clear how you would forge the unbreakable material into containers in the first place...
