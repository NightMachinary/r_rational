I don't think so. There is an assumption that the two rods are linked such that tapping one causes the other to move instantaneously. That premise is valid for an unbreakable object that cannot distort as any movement would have to transfer through the entire object instantaneously. But why would that hold true for two separate instances of unconnected immovable object? Maybe if it were one single object rotating such that one end is moving relatavistically while the other end is not but that would have its own problems and is also not as described.
