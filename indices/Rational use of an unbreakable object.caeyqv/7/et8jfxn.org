So lets use the senario where you only get a peanuts worth. Assuming: Its indestructible (chemically non-reactive, never changes temperture, weighs roughly the same as its equivalent weight in iron and is non-magnetic, and of course its volume and shape is equal to that of a average peanut.

Assuming all that, the peanut size piece would be pretty much useless. Like, you could probably sell it for a bunch to a rich dude/scientist or try to find a break-anything material and try to use the two of them together to crash the universe, but it would have no practical use.

If you could make it (or found enough of it in a convenient enough shape) you could find quite a few uses for it (eg. armor, weapons, in construction, for tools like drills or axes, as the main part of a space elevator), although none of them would be really "exploits" and would simply be relying on its extraordinary material properties.
