  what makes a projectile armor piercing?
#+end_quote

It should be hard (does not deform) and tough (does not crack). The distinction between those qualities loses meaning for an unbreakable object, since it would be infinitely hard and tough.

Beyond that, the kinetic energy of the projectile should be transferred to as small an area of the armor as possible, and the projectile should have high velocity on impact and as much kinetic energy as possible. But a peanut is already fairly small compared to the size of a projectile intended to pierce armor on a tank or warship. With an unbreakable peanut, you do not have to worry about the tradeoff of making the projectile sharper versus losing structural integrity on impact. You would want to encase the peanut in something to make it aerodynamic and to put the peanut's sharpest edge or point forward. Put the peanut in the tip of a long, sharpened tungsten cylinder so there is a lot of kinetic energy behind it, and aerodynamic drag is minimized. Launch it at the highest possible velocity towards the target.
