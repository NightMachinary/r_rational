An unbreakable peanut? Reminds me of a story by Lois Bujold where they had an unbreakable walnut. One guy wanted to take it to a bar and bet big strong guys that they could not crack it.

But seriously, I'm not sure that you could do much with a small chunk of unbreakable material, unless you had some way to shape it or sharpen it. If that is not possible, then the only thing I can think of is to load it into a very high velocity gun and use it as the ultimate armor piercing round.
