#+begin_quote
  Say you have one unbreakable rod that's at rest, and another one moving towards you at relativistic speeds. You tap on the rod moving towards you, and the other end moves instantly from its frame of reference, which happens to be in the past from your reference frame. Then someone on the other end taps on the rod that's at rest from your frame, reaching you instantly, and the message arrives before you send the first one.

In the description as given. At least, that was how I interpreted the fact that information reaches you instantly from the rod at rest. I could be interpreting incorrectly.
