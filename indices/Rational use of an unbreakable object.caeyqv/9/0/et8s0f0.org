Sounds similar to the molecular stiletto in the Timothy Zahn Star Wars novels, or the monomolecular cutter in Full Metal Panic. More generally: "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomolecular_wire][monomolecular wire]] is often used as a weapon in fiction. It has applications in cutting objects and severing adjacent molecules. A similar or identical concept may be called a microfilament wire or, as a weapon, a microfilament whip."

As a real-world analog, obsidian can be sharpened to the point where its edge can literally be measured in nanometers across the cutting edge). They were frequently used in arrowheads and they are even used in modern medical contexts (for example, see [[https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/health/surgery-scalpels-obsidian/index.html][this article]] about the use of obsidian scalpels in modern surgery).

The downside of obsidian is that it shatters easily; it is literally volcanic glass, and much like you would expect from glass, it can shatter just as easily as it can be made into a sharp point that can cut. Most fictional depictions feature this as well; as is the case with the monomolecular knives in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash: they can easily cut through body armor, but are prone to shattering at inopportune moments. Having a blade made from unbreakable material would give you all of the upside with none of the downside. Though I'm unsure whether this would be the optimal use of such a material, you certainly could do worse than making a monomolecular cutter.
