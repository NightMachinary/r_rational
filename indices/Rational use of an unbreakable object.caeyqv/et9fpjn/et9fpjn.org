5e D&D has unbreakable arrows in xanathars. fun stuff really. only an antimagic field can break them, and as a common magic item they cost 50gp each to craft (woodworking tools).

some of the obvious uses are as traps, ways to wedge things open or shut, and as climbing aids. an unbreakable arrow could help wedge the moving wall or ceiling in place, and arrows tend to be a couple feet long. you would likely need more than one however, as the PSI on an arrowhead may just make a hole in the material its holding back.

unbreakable also implies that it wont take damage from other sources, like fire or acid. it would be nasty for a dragon to have one shot into its throat. could be very useful for some types of alchemy.
