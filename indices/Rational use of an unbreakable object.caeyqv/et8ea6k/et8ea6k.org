Hmm. Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is if you had an unbreakable material, that means you could use it to put something under incredible pressure inside of it without it breaking. If you could do that with water you could store an incredible amount of energy in a small area by compressing water until it becomes solid at high temperatures. If you did that with an isotope of hydrogen then I guess you could create fusion?

Of course it depends what "unbreakable" means; after a certain amount of energy is put in, pressure or force applied becomes heat, so is the "unbreakable" object something that can melt or boil, or is it really indestructible?
