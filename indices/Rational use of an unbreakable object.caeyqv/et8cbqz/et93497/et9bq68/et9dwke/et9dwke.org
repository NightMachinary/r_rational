With a bullet it's again a function of size. The energy lost through bullet deformation is relatively small, and deformation is actually desirable in anti personnel round as they cause more damage. A tiny super hard bullet would actually just pass right through and actually do less damage than a normal bullet. Against armor the lack of deformation actually does help, but since KE =1/2 MV^{2,} and we can only propel a bullet so fast, you want a really heavy bullet. That's why they use depleted uranium rounds against armor IRL, Uranium is really heavy and it's a good use for the depleted mostly non-radioative isotope.
