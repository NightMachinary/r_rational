The reason we can only launch a projectile so fast has nothing to do with the material. It's a combination of drag, although that can be minimized, and more importantly the expansion speed of the combusting gas. You can't make something move faster than the throwing mechanism. To make a bullet go faster you'd need to use a more energetic reaction, which means a much beefier gun to withstand the forces, etc. Modern Smokeless powders max out at about 5000FPS, which certain modern rounds already approach in niche uses. Why spend so much time and effort on R&D to solve a non-existant problem? We can already shoot bullets that penetrate everything they have to.
