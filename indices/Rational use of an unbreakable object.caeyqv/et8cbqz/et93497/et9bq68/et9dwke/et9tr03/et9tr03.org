But what is the limiting factor? I think it may be avoiding damage to the projectile before it is even in the air. If you had an unbreakable projectile, it may be possible to launch it much faster than a breakable projectile. But then the problem becomes making it aerodynamic so it does not slow down too much before hitting the target. Unless the unbreakable peanut can be shaped, that would mean using some breakable material around the unbreakable. And then you would have problems with ultra-high velocity launching since you would break the shell.

I suppose the solution to that would be to build the ultra-high velocity launcher into a super-projectile. You launch the super-projectile as fast as is feasible, and when the tip impacts the armor, the embedded launcher fires, launching the embedded unbreakable peanut at ultra-high velocity into the armor.
