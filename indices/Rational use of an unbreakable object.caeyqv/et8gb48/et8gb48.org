Unbreakable would mean that it can absorb an infinite amount of energy without being affected, thus violating the first law of thermodynamics. If that works in reverse, you could potentially surround it with objects much, much colder than it and have infinite energy flow out of it and into the surroundings. Some kind of liquid nitrogen-powered steam turbine, or something to that effect, maybe?

As you can no doubt tell, I don't really have the physics knowledge to say for sure, and a lot of how to utilize it would depend on how precisely the object functioned.
