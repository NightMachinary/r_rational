An interesting question. I can think of several video games that feature 'Rational' things, like AI, or honest pursuits of your goals. As was mentioned in previous threads, most multiplayer games qualify by default. Restricting it to "video games with a somewhat robust ruleset that the player must figure out on their own to succeed" I came up with the following two games:

​

1) Kerbal Space Program. Near real life orbital physics (the biology is made up). The game will explain some aspects of how it works in tutorials, but most of it it won't.

​

2) Pathologic (2). A game about saving a small town from a plague. How the plague works is not explained, and figuring out what is important, how it works and what is a distraction is important if you want to save everyone / as many as possible.

​

There's also two other games I feel are rational, but can't justify from any principled definition

Blood bowl: This is a multiplayer game, but I want to plug it for being heavily reliant upon decision-making under uncertainty (everything is a diceroll, so to get good you really have to get a feel for how high a risk 1/36 actually is).

​

Return of the Obra Dinn. Puzzle game that will test your powers of deduction and inference.
