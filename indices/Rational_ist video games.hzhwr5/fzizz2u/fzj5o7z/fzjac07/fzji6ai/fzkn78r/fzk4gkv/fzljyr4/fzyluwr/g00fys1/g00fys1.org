So, this is one of the most frustrating pieces of Blow's style, which he has directly absorbed from Zen, Buddhism at large, mysticism as a whole, and modern art.

Blow's on the record as stating both that he can't verbalize the whole meaning/intent of his games, and that there /is/ a specific meaning/intent to every single thing in them. He's very much like the worst kind of art snob: “oh, I can't help you get it, you have to figure it out yourself. But if you don't you're dumb.” Blow and Buddhists could both do a lot better to first understand and then explain the concepts they're observing.

But they don't do so by and large---to plug it again, mctb.org, which Slate Star did a great review of, is the best counterexample I know of. Ingram calls this “mushroom culture”: they feed you shit and keep you in the dark.

As best I can tell, the value in this is that solving something on your own guidance---entirely, from start to finish---is not only The Skill that's being fostered, but is uniquely satisfying. Certainly that's the satisfaction I got from piecing this all together. However, I've also /ever been taught things/, and this made my eventual attempts at self learning /easier/ and /more satisfying/, not worse. So I personally agree with your frustrations, and think that having /any/ explanation put in front of players would be great. I don't think it's kind or helpful in any way to say to players, “well, if you don't automatically investigate what the game is about or search for interviews online about Blow's intent, then you don't really care about understanding, so you /shouldn't/ be given more help.” Giving someone the /first bit of context/ is not going to prevent them from developing self-motivation. But /not/ giving it, is gonna result in exactly the state you've gotten to.

Having said that...I may be wrong. There may be some really important reason why giving any guidance to people is gonna deprive them of key value, and paradoxically, if that's the case then I can't be told why. But that strikes me as utter bullshit, so at very least I'm skeptical.

All that said, the value I /do/ get from the game is so earth-shattering that I can even excuse this major frustration. Especially if maybe, there's a good reason for it. But since I don't think there is, here's what I wish everyone was told.

* * *

When approaching these riddles, just like in approaching the content of the game, you'll need to treat /literally every object/ as relevant and content-conveying in order to “get it”. It's as though you're handed a puzzle with 100 pieces, and 78 of them seem like duplicates or ones that don't fit. But if you examine them all /very carefully/, you find that there's actually ways to incorporate many of those pieces into a finished puzzle; and exactly one way to incorporate them all. That's what's happening here, and the pieces in Braid and The Witness are literally every event and object. Some only have small meanings, but until every piece is used, you're not done.

The hidden puzzles in The Witness are the part that convey this content, so people who aren't fully completing the game will just miss them and be frustrated. That's intentional: the cyclical ending you referenced is a direct analogue of the Buddhist cycle of death and rebirth. Just like in Buddhism, the way out is to be frustrated that that keeps happening, and resolve to figure out what can be done about it. Blow seems to intentionally let players just quit if this frustrates them, which seems like a giant missed opportunity when all he'd have to do is include an intro:

“Hi, I'm Jonathan Blow, and this game is trying to teach you something. It's necessary that I explain as little as possible, as learning how to figure things out for yourself is /the whole point/, but I want to let you know that everything you see here is a clue, so as long as that's worth your interest, don't be discouraged. And if it's not, then sincerely, that's great! This game is meant to be used and then moved on from, so your moving on once it's finished being useful is exactly our hope. Sure, if you leave before you fully “get” it, there may be some useful stuff still to be mined; but if you feel frustrated, then even if coming back later would help, beating yourself up mentally probably won't. So please don't waste your energy on this at times when it's not genuinely rewarding for you.

If you investigate this as if it were a world you were actually stuck in, albeit with your ability to look up information about the quotes and clips while you play kept intact, you should be able to solve it the way physicists or engineers solve problems. Very much the same way Feynman approaches everything in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman. Good luck, and if you do get fed up: apologies, I know it can be rough. Hopefully you'll agree, when you solve it, that the difficulty/unguidedness was necessary for conveying the full epiphany.”

So, I wish he'd done that. But yeah: getting confused at the end, and feeling like you've missed something, is almost certainly the intent. That's why the very first recording in the game is Gautama's quote about being trapped in a cycle of rebirth. The fact of the gameplay mirroring this cycle is meant to have the same effect that Buddhists ascribe to rebirth: you'll have to keep trying until you get it right. If you stop caring, cool: you'll just go do something else until it becomes worth your time to re-engage. Blow uses it as a filter: gamers who want to figure out what's happening will try again, gamers who don't won't.
