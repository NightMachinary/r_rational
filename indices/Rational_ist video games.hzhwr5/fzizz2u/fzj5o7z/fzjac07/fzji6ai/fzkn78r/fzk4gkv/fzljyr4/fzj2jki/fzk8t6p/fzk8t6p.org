The Witness.

I don't know how to describe it. A puzzle solving game that only ever uses it's puzzles to explain it's puzzles, never words. It will /make you think/ and make you examine and justify your thinking. Absolutely a rational/ist/ videogame that is very much trying to teach something.

Heavy themes of perception, understanding, belief and hypothesis formation, wonder at discovery, and the 'hand of the designer being heavy in the world' -- I don't know how else to say that. It makes the world feel purposeful and deliberate and internally-structured, then references God and scientific discovery in that context. Highly recommended.
