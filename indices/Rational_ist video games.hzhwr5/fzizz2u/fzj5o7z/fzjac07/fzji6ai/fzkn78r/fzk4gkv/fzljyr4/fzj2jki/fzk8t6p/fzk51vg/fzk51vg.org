Noita is a rational-ish physics driven rogue-like game where you have to make/program your magic wand/weapon of mass destruction to get to the end. Also it's super hard, check out [[/r/noita][r/noita]] to see gifs of people showing of their wands and dying in hilarious ways ! (mostly you end up killing yourself wanting to experiment with spells)
