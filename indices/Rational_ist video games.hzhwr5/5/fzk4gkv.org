Same people that made Baba Is You made Noita which I'd definitely recommend as well. You can do a lot of creative stuff with the wand customization and physics engine. I also liked the world that it creates, a world that seems like linear descent through a dungeon with trophy rooms inbetween. But the whole thing takes place in one discrete world, so you can dig yourself back up, go to the parallel universes on the left and right and find a bazillion secrets.
