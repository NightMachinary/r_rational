I have no idea. I don't do mobile. I haven't had a smartphone in probably at least like four years, all I use a phone for is calling and texting so having a smartphone would be a waste. When I'm out in the world I'm out in the world, and when I'm at home I'm not going to look at a six-inch phone screen when I have a 23-inch desktop monitor available.
