For the curious, the specific reference here is The Golden Age by John C. Wright. It's a hyper-capitalist, hyper-transhumanist, fairly hard sci-fi novel, the first in a trilogy.

One of the conceits of the setting is that self agency is paramount, hence if you turn yourself into one of the black devas nobody will rescue you because you can no longer consent to it.

The first novel is brilliant; it's one of the best examples of a high conflict yet low violence sci-fi books I've ever seen. Unfortunately the rest of the series didn't live up to the promise, but the ending is good enough to treat it as a stand alone book.
