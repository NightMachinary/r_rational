The following is not really worth reading if you haven't played the game.

I played through The Witness once, coming to the end with the island flyover. I don't remember feeling anything like this buddhist progression you describe. Is this buddhist concept a thing I should research, then play the game again? I didn't get to many of the extra challenges or even try to understand the 'koans'. I got pissed when they undid all my puzzle completion at the end. The video felt pretentious, not demonstrative.

I looked at a walkthrough twice; once for the sound patterns part, as I had my headphones off, and once for the dividing the colour groups mechanic, because I think I missed the tutorial puzzle for that? I couldn't get a single passing answer so eventually I gave up and looked up what the symbol meant.
