You can get insane sounding ideas with Baba is you, and still win because the rules are very easy to understand and very consistent. Since you can set up the rules governing the majority of the game, like who you control, what destroys what, what opens what, and what the victory condition actually is, you can win a level in a myriad of ways, all depending on your creative interpretation of what you can do in that level.

My favourite moment was to change the rule about who I was to make myself the wall, and suddenly I was half the map. Moved one step to the left and half the map moved, and instantly died because one of the walls hit a patch of water, and water had a rule about killing you.
