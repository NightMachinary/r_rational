I'd recommend Baba Is You and Disco Elesium. Baba Is You is a puzzler that requires metacognitive and programatic thinking. Disco Elesium is a deep and truly impressive Planescapelike where you spend about half the time talking to your own psyche and the other half fucking up and trying to solve a murder.
