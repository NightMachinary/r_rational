I can't find the specific reference, but what came to mind from this suggestion was a quote from some old SF whose setting included widespread self-modification capacities, of a father advising his son on the many traps someone can drive themselves into in the first few moments of self-modifying. This was quoted in one of Eliezer's Sequence posts, IIRC something like "you must not become one of the Black Devas who pursue their momentary drives with such impossible fervor that they never surface, nor one of the White Devas who create so many walls cutting them off from their old biological instincts that they lose all motivation to act at all, nor the..." (there were at least a couple more cases). Eliezer's reply was "if these are universally agreed to be bad, /why would you give people the option/?"

Bioshock is a lot like that. It doesn't introduce the premise "Rationally self-interested society", it introduces the premise "Rationally self-interested society /which discovers addictive magic/". In other words, a society which values self-determination highly and discovers a potent and dangerous form of self-modification, which it then allows everyone access to... /mostly/ before learning that it's incredibly addictive and seems to cause insanity. Take a non-Flanderized society like the modern USA and it would have the same problems with a different spin.
