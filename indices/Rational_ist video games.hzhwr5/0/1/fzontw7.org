:END:

I think the /gameplay/ is "rational" (if that even means anything) but I'd strongly disagree that the /themes/ are rational, for the following very-spoilery reason. (Seriously, this comment is meant to engage conversation with people who have already played the game; don't click if you intend to play!)

All throughout the game I assumed the endgame would involve saving everyone. My assumption the whole way through was that all the lovable Hearthians I met on Timber Hearth, plus the Hearthian astronauts scattered across the solar system who had become my friends, I was gonna somehow be able to round them all up and save them from the approaching destruction of the sun. Then I got to the endgame and the moral of the story turned out to be: Sometimes the Universe ends, killing everyone, and the correct thing to do is to be at peace with that eventuality. Which thoroughly transhuman me found to be some real bullshit. So the entire ending sequence left me pretty mad!

Still heartily recommend the experience of playing the game though!
