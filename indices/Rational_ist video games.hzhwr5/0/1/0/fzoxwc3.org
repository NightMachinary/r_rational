I agree with you.

Major spoilers below.

I was mostly talking about the gameplay itself. There's a lot I would do to bring the narrative more in line with rationalist ideals. Personally I still found the ending emotionally satisfying as a tragedy. I don't think the little scout in the epilogue implies survival was possible. I think being able to witness and influence the events that take place is the "ultimate reward" given to the character for their boundless curiosity, in pure ludonarrative harmony.

I don't think there are any other games where the game is the mystery and the pure joy of discovery to this extent. The Hearthians are the only irrational actors in the narrative they've been left with, but they're endearing in that. It's not rationalist, but it's smart and well-written enough to fit my take on the classification as rational.
