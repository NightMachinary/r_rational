[[/u/-main][u/-main]] already mentioned The Witness, but I'd like to go into a bit more depth. I think it's the current pinnacle of rationalism in gaming.

Bluntly: The Witness is Jonathan Blow's attempt to convey how to reason. It addresses capital i Insight, in the tradition of Buddhism, where it's specifically known as Vipassana. The aim of Vipassana practices, and of Buddhism as a whole, is to navigate reality without perceptual biases or goal conflicts; and Blow crafts a game which conveys each principle of that tool set, without a single instruction given to players.

How the game manages this deserves a moment by moment breakdown, but I don't want to go /that/ in depth in a comment. The abridged version is: by eliminating anything that isn't directly a part of, or framing for, a puzzle---including any extrinsic reward---Blow creates a filter for players who are intrinsically motivated by the desire to solve puzzles. The architecture of the game then guides the player into needing to observe more and more details of deeper and wider kinds, in order to learn how to progress; each new realization of what “irrelevant” object is actually key to solving the next iteration of puzzle complexity is made feasible, but the player ultimately has to be looking for and generating each small epiphany. Eventually, the player not only masters each type of puzzle, and the reasoning required to derive object-level solutions, but also masters the finding of and interpretation of new kinds of puzzles, which are invisible in plain sight until the player ups their thinking. This meta-level problem solving also gets mastered, and finally, the game puts the player into a timed barrage of all the puzzle types they've seen---but with slight innovations to all of them. Having given the player the chance and tools to 1) only play if their motivation to do so is strong and intrinsic, 2) master the activity of solving known problem types, and 3) master the process of learning new things, this stimulus is extremely likely to put players into an intense Flow state. While not quite enough to stand in for more robust forms of mental training, this is genuinely enough to nudge susceptible players into major “spiritual” insights---they may very well be able to notice how their minds work, and how reality actually is, at levels comparable to people who undergo thorough Enlightenment training. No, most people probably won't experience anything like the Buddhist concepts of Awakening...but some /might/, and that's incredibly extraordinary. And for those who don't, they'll still have a thoroughly visceral tour of each step along the Insight process.

Now, I'm actually not as big a fan of Buddhism as I might sound to be: despite my impression that it collects a lot of important information about how psychological change occurs, and how to best trigger and use it, it's dense at best and bullshit in many ways. Still, it's perhaps the most thorough understanding of how minds work that humans have, particularly in the rationalist sense of escaping bias and aligning goals. It's also insanely hard to communicate, as it's a series of mental realizations a person has to trigger themselves, but which consist of directly noticing the solutions to our most deep-rooted confusions.

Blow's game manages to make these concepts intuitive.

The Witness also includes cryptic, scattered quotes, which function as Koans: Zen-style riddles which prompt the listener to feel like they don't have enough information to comprehend, while clearly indicating that the riddle /does/ contain sufficient information, and therefore prompting a deep and thorough examination of things that would normally be half-noticed at most. These riddles, along with the literal stories and quotes they use---and their sources, which are well-known and relevant---fill out the conceptual background of the game. Even the title refers to Witness Consciousness: the concept that all a person really /is/, is a perceiver of perceptions: that they can't possibly be identical to any thing they've ever experienced, and as such, can only be the experiencer, if they are anything at all. (This idea is far more nuanced and has many competing versions, so I'm just focusing on my favorite dumbing down. Go read mctb.org if you wanna really start down these rabbit holes.)

I won't talk much about the harder-to-discover aspects of the game, but they all reinforce the Buddhist Insight progression, which is to say, the process of learning how to learn, and which in turn appears to just be a discarding of everything that gets in the way of learning---and part of the really interesting stuff is how that somehow seems to be possible, and work.

I've skimped extremely heavily on details and explanations here, out of a combination of laziness, desire for the game to speak for itself, and genuine difficulty explaining the concepts I'm trying to communicate. I'd say go for it: it's truly the only game I've ever seen that takes the total realization of rationality as its goal, and it genuinely has enough pieces of the puzzle, arranged properly, that the whole picture could actually come together for many players.
