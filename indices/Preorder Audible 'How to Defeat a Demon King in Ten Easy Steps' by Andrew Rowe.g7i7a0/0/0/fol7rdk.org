Hey, thanks for posting this here! There's definitely a lot of the same kind of lateral thinking and weird rules exploits stuff that I generally write. It's a comedy/parody, so keep that in mind, but it's probably something people who are in the mood for a light rationalish work might enjoy.

Also, free for the first few days for Audible subscribers, so that's a plus.
