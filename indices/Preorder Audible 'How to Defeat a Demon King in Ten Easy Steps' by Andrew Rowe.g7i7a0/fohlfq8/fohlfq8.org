Andrew Rowe ([[https://www.reddit.com/u/Salaris/][u/Salaris]]) is the author of the Arcane Ascension series and he's coming out with another book, /How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps./

#+begin_quote
  For thousands of years, there has been a cycle: a Demon King rises and conquers, and a Hero is reborn a hundred years later to defeat him. Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him to save.

  And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan.

  She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'll travel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete. And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy.

  She might not be a Hero -- but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.

So I figured since people here already loved the previous books he's written, you guys would want to jump in and preorder the audible before it comes out on April 30th.

So far, I don't know if the book is audible only or not. It doesn't appear to be coming in epub or mobi formats, but I don't know. I've already left comments on the website asking about it and I'll post an edit here later when I find out.

EDIT: It'll be a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimbersCourt/comments/g7hkt1/how_to_defeat_a_demon_king_in_ten_easy_steps/fohkkdl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][year]] before it gets released into text.
