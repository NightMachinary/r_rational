Wars will be fought over maintaining or changing scientific consensus. If you can make competitor states' circles all stop working and fill the market void by printing your own with laws you already know inside and out, you can both cause ruin to your enemies and rake in the gold for yourself. It's a good question how you would fight such a war, but strong public education (and foreign attacks upon your schools) would probably come into play.
