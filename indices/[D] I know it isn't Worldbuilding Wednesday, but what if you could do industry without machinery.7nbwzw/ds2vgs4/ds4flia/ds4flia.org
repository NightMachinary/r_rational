Energy consumption is roughly square with the distance, so you are limited by energy usage and integrity of the teleportation capability. A powerful 'wizard' (in universe, an Emanationist) can teleport a couple of people up to a few dozen kilometers.

As for the rest: yes, yes, yes, and yes. The /interesting/ limitation is that to teleport is to swap, and if you want to swap a chunk of rock out of a wall, you have to overcome the binding energy --- portal cutting is equal to regular cutting. Since the binding energy in air is virtually nil, air-to-air teleportation is virtually free.
