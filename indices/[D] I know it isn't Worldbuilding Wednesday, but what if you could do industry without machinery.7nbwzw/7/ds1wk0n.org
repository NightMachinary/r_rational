I can see poison, corrosives and explosives used a lot in combat due to how easy chemistry and energy storage is in this world. Easy teleportation ss also abuseable when you have the above. Since you favor magical gun in combat, maybe make shield spells against those combat magic 101, or cheaply sold in stores.
