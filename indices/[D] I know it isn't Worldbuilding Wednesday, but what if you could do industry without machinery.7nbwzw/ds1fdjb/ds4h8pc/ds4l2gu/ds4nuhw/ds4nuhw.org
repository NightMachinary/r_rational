Hm. Food for thought.

There'd probably be some stark regulation on teleport spells, brianjars and HE, meaning the black market sale would be very expensive.

Perhaps there are ways to make dowsing pendulums that point towards such illegal production --- or a spirit/devil/entity to employ in such endeavors.

ETA: Emanationists/Wizards would frown upon the proliferation of teleportation spells. Don't make enemies of wizards.
