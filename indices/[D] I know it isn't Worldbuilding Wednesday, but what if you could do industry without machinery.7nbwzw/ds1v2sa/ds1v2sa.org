  Convert energy of one kind into another, for instance, convert sunlight to chemical energy (carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water in the atmosphere go together to create octanitrocubane.)

So... any nut with some knowhow can spend a week in a big open field and generate enough explosives to level a city, out of nothing but sunlight and air?

Sure, they'd probably need a big circle to catch enough light, but that won't stop the Crazy Cultist Club from taking over a farm and trying it with "crop circles". If there's no way to detect large circles there are going to be some nasty surprises.

There's going to be a pretty big market for energy-dense materials, whether they're used for your coin-op guns or heating homes or powering mechanical things (cars, airships, non-magic parts of factories...). Think oil industry, minus the refineries, and based on solar power. Hydrocarbons should probably be the preferred energy source; gasoline is more energy dense than high explosives, it just can't release all the energy all at once. I imagine factories may need blowers to move air over the circles to provide O2 for reactions.

How much height above the circle can be considered a part of the circle's affected area, for transmutation purposes? You may be able to turn a circle on its side and punch holes through walls that way.

Antimatter thankfully doesn't matter to your economy yet, since our knowledge of that relied on both relativistic and quantum physics. It could be a fun plot point, though. Similarly, radioactivity requires knowledge of subatomic physics, but if it's ever worked out, energy gets waaaay cheaper (hydrogen fusion from water as the most abundant fuel).
