- Your circles are software, with many of the benefits and failings thereof. Specifically, if you get a circle /wrong/, you can blow things up (just try making an error in the sign of the electric charge on your subatomic particles and see what happens when you synthesise a bunch of antimatter)

- Circles will be regulated, with government-approved circles being sold in the market (perhaps printed on carpets). These are guaranteed not to blow up on you, but also don't produce anything all that exciting (circles to produce food or clothing from dirt are common). Circles to produce new printed circles are /not/ sold (but can be legal and are commonly used by merchants)

- Most people refuse to create their own circles, thinking themselves unable to learn how to do so. However, every now and then a young farm boy will develop an interest in Circles and study them, either blowing himself (and likely his farm) up or finding himself successful in his endeavours.

- Illegal circles are often obfuscated to make it hard to see what they are doing.

- Circles bought on the black market can make pretty near anything. However, a percentage of them will go things like teleport any users to a slave market, or teleport the user's children away and hold them for ransom. Anyone caught making such a circle is executed.

- Getting government approval for a Circle involves paying the high Inspection fees. Making a Circle without government approval risks being arrested.
