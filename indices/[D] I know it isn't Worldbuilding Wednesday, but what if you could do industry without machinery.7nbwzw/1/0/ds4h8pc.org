Antimatter isn't a thing, since these idiots don't know relativity and quantum /anything/. But yes, circles are software.

Yes, gov't regulations, and yeah, carpets and metal plates would be a cheap way to transport them --- if you don't have the money to hire a professional imitationist to draw you a circle. Producing food is a bit beyond what modern imitationism can make, but fuel, medicine (i.e. sulfa drug antibiotics and what not) and heat (for heating, cooking, etc) are common. Circles can be safely and easily printed in a printing press --- mechanisms are not common, but have their use.

Nice touch with the 'circles are mumbo jumbo' thing. There's a second kind of imitationism which uses spirits/true names/witchcraft/etc, which is closer to 'folk magic.' Caloric imitationism is programming.

Freemasons/illuminati style secret symbolism encryption.

Teleportation is a bit more expensive --- you'd notice if your circle requires a pound of HE and a brainjar with a teleportation spell pattern to function, when it is supposed to do a simple chemical reaction (like synthesizing heroin --- although the world at large is in a pre-drug war state.) Witchcraft circles are illegal --- mostly. Your firstborn for wealth and good fortune (caveats may apply) is certainly something you can get on the black market.

Certified imitationists from the University of Imitationism in the capital; complete with ethics committees. Gold!
