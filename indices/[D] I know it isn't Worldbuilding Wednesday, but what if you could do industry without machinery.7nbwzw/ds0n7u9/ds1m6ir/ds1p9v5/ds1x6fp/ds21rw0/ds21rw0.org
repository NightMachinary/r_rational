  I'd like to have a world where magic exists, magic is not "special snowflake" superpowers and where creating magical items is possible. But I don't want that to result in everyone having horseless carriages, animated looms, etc.

These aren't directly related. Creating magic items is stil entirely possible with special snowflake abilities.

But the point is that there's no point industrializing when there's no stabdardization. Barrier to entry isn't what matters; it's still easily possible to industrialize under those conditions (remember; coal powered trains used to be incredibly expensive, brand new technology), it's the economies of scale.
