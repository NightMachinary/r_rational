By making magic and magic items unique(ish) and preventing interchangability. Much if the modern world runs on agree-upon standards, like the diameter of hex bolts or the voltage of phone chargers or the arrangment of pins in an HDMI cable. If magic users are incapable of casting the exact same (or suffuciently similar) spell twice in tge same way, then that prevents interchangability. Each part would need to be custom made, instead of mass produced, effectively preventing standardization.
