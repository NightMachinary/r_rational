I have a good fix for that kind of interesting but arguably silly issue: circles work to the extent that they accurately describe things, not because people believe in stuff. Four-elements alchemy circles still work, but there is lots they can't do.

Also, gods dont need beleief to exist, but retroactively pop into history when critical belief mass is achieved.
