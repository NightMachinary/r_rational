So what you're saying is, these magic pots are machinery. And which spells work depends on the 'majority theory' on how the population of people (or just wizards) think the universe works.

So I guess if you, for instance, used a viewing spell to look at the sun during an eclipse, you wouldn't see gravitational lensing on the spell output but it would mysteriously take more mana because silently the magic is correcting for this real physical effect?

And in some cases, spells mysteriously fail when they try to do something so incompatible with the laws of nature as they actually are, versus how people think they work, that the magic can't compensate?

I have always thought if you could build some sort of device that can be powered by people who do not have the wizardry talents, but get the same effects, you could end up with a world that resembles ours, even if natural wizards were fairly uncommon.

Especially if one magical device can be used to produce another.

You'd probably end up with lots and lots of non-wizard jobs, and presumably most soldiers would not be wizards, as wizards would be too valuable to risk. Assuming that you can make things like enchanted body armor and then overwhelm with concentrated fire even a 'dumbledore' of the age.
