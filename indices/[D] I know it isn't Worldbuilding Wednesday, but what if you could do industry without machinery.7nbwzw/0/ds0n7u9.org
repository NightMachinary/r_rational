There's a distinction to be made between "industry" and "technology."

The reason industrialization happened was because mechanization allowed massive economies of scale that lead to mass production of goods and resources. But depending on how your magic system is set up, it's entirely possible that the economies of scale available don't outweigh the chance to get more customized goods, leading instead to specialty manufacturers like the tailors and shoemakers of old.
