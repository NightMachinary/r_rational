I realize I was a bit unclear.

I'd like to have a world where magic exists, magic is not "special snowflake" superpowers and where creating magical items is possible. But I /don't/ want that to result in everyone having horseless carriages, animated looms, etc.

So I was looking for factors that results in masters doing customized goods rather than stores full of the latest ManaPhone. Factors that are needed to go from "technology" to "industry" that can be averted.

One such factor could be the amount of effort and resources needed to become a mage. If mage studies are the equivalent of PhD in time, intellectual challenge and financial burden, then maybe it is more plausible to have a "tailor and shoemaker" world.

So the question was really "how to design magic for a fictional world to plausibly avert magic reasonably leading to industrialization."
