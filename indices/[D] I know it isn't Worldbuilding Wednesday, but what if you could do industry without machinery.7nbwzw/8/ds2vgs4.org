What's the range on teleportation? Can you teleport living things? Can you teleport inside an object? Can you teleport a piece of an object? Is there a way to ward an area against hostile teleports?

There are a lot of ways to use teleportation as a weapon, or as the delivery system for a weapon. So be careful with that one.
