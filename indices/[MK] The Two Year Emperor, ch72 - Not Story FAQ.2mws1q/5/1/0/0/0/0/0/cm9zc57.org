#+begin_quote
  The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. *If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on.* The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.

My emphasis added. I was excited for this, ate a chocolate for the good idea by posting, then went and looked at the RAW and decided it might be less useful than I though, but It'll be interesting to see if it shows up. After all, I don't think an if then else decision tree is complicated, but does the god of magic think it is convoluted, and if so can you use plane shift cast using the cleric level as an escape hatch?
