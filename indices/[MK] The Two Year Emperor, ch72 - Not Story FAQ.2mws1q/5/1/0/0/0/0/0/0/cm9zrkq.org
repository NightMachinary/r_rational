Yeah, I was familiar with the "complicated" restriction. Still, you could probably make it work with something like

" SLOT ONE: If I am ever attacked, cast Time Stop. SLOT TWO: I have a bunch of nested contingencies in this slot; if the conditions that would cause one of them to be activated are ever met, activate the Contingency in this slot. "

That Contingency then has something like:

" SLOT ONE: If I am ever reduced to -9 hit points or below, cast Delay Death. SLOT TWO: I have a bunch of nested contingencies in this slot; if the conditions that would cause one of them to be activated are ever met, activate the Contingency in this slot. "

And so on.
