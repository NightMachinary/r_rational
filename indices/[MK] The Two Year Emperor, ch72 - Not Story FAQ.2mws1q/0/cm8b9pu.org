UPDATE:

It's irked me for a long time that I put the rules notes in Chapter 10 instead of in a separate document but I can't do anything about it now without renumbering all the chapters, which would mean updating all my source HTML to match. Immediately after posting this here I found myself thinking:

"Hey, maybe I should avoid making the same mistake twice."

So, now the contents of this chapter have been moved to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10838202/1/Not-a-story-FAQ-for-The-Two-Year-Emperor][a separate document]]. Chapter 72 will be replaced when I post on Saturday.
