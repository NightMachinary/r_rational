Ding!

Death in D&D is actually defined as: "[t]he character's hit points are reduced to -10, his Constitution drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. +The character's soul leaves his body.+ [EDIT: removed this sentence because it was confusing and not part of the point I was making]"

Trap the Soul pulls the soul and the life force out of the body; I'm considering that to be death. Neklos didn't get any warning because he'd already killed them; when the soul gems shattered their material bodies would have reformed but been instantly vaporized. I'm considering this as "they were dead-but-in-the-gems, then they were dead-but-not-in-the-gems" with no actual intervening time that would allow Neklos's portfolio sense to alert him.
