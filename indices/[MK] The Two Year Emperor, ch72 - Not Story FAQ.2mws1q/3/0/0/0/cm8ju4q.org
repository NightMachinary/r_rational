That definition seems to say that death is one possible thing that triggers a soul leaving a body, not that the soul leaving the body is itself a sufficient condition for death. It reads like the first sentence are the things which trigger death, and then death triggers the soul departure as a separate event. Soul separation triggering death is getting the causality backwards.
