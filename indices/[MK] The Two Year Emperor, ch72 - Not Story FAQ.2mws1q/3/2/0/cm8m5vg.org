No the surprise round wouldn't help, portfolio sense extends into the future. Quoth [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm]] which [[/u/eaglejarl]] says is the canonical source.

#+begin_quote
  Greater deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every divine rank they have. When a deity senses an event, it merely knows that the event is occurring and where it is. The deity receives no sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices an event, it can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.

Death has more than 1 million worshipers so he has at least a week into the future of portfolio sense.
