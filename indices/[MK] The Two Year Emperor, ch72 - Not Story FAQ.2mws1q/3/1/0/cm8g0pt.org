Since you seem to be pretty diligent about sticking to the source material I expect I'd be best served by researching how the portfolio sense from the rulebooks, but I think it's more interesting to try and discern how things work based on what's been presented in the story so far.

The portfolio sense described in most detail so far is Herrun's, particularly in reference to how she becomes aware of any plot against her whether it's public or private knowledge since those are explicitly part of her domain. She's also shown or at least heavily implied to be aware of Suze's secret desires when Suze is immediately thinking of them.

I think's it's realistic to generalize to portfolio sense therefore being sensitive to matters that relate directly to the god in question, or to those who they're paying attention to at the moment. I think my original confustion stemmed from the assumption that gods are pretty much totally aware of anything related to their domains at all times, but given that Herrun was defeated, however, she either isn't consciously aware of literally all knowledge at all times, or the plot was so sophisticated and capable that she was defeated even seeing it coming.

The latter seems less likely, especially since the "not pseudo-omniscient" hypothesis is supported by Arros leaving behind a shard to attend to Jake's questions, suggesting that gods consciousnesses aren't as unlimited as they would have to be to deal with that level of awareness.

It could be argued that since Neklos wasn't paying attention to Suze and she wasn't attempting to kill him his sense wasn't triggered, but that's a very conveniently shaped loophole, and I expect that's not your actual, implied answer. Maybe I'll hunt back through the text to find something I'm missing, but that feels like cheating.
