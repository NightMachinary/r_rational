You know, I was thinking that it had something to do with the wording of the spell ([[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trapTheSoul.htm][/Trap the Soul/]]) in that it wouldn't technically qualify as death, but looking at it that doesn't seem right unless death is defined as the separation of the soul from the body and /Trap the Soul/ already separates the soul causing them not to die but merely be released to the afterlife without dying.
