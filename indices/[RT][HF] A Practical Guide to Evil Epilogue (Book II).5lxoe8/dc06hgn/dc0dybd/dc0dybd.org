Elon Musk would probably get The Engineer. Rodrigo Duterte seems to be gunning for Tyrant. Donald Trump would probably be The Demagogue. Dwayne Johnson would be, if not The Rock, or The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment, something like The Superstar.

Mark Zuckerburg would be, I dunno, The Watcher? Warren Buffet would be The Investor.

The difficulty is that many of the roles that are cultural touchstones for us are cultural touchstones specifically because they can generically apply to a broad range of people, and the most exemplary individual is probably unknown to the public at large. There's certainly evidence via Heiress' plan that public perception has influence on Naming, but for instance, The Soldier in our world is probably some Spec Ops badass no one has ever heard of, Assassin likewise. Plus, just the fact that we're a post industrial society where most of the stories that affect are business dealings and politicking instead of heroic epics. We'd probably see names like The Manager, The Teacher, The Nurse, or The Lawyer, The Salesman, The Accountant, and again most of those people are completely unknown to the public at large.
