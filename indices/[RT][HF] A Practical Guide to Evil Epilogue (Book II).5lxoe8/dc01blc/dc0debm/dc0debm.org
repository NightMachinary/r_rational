I think, essentially, the Wandering Bard's personae exist only in the capacity to be attached to another Hero's story. Almorava was part of the Lone Swordsman's story, and now her new persona will be a part of the White Knight's. I think "died" is almost as much a figurative description as a literal one - Almorava simply ceased to exist. The storyteller's death is never a part of the story, and with this chapter done, Almorava just disappears from history.

We may get more details on it later, but my guess is that Aoede simply didn't exist before the Wandering Bard took up the identity. My immediate comparison was to regenerations of the Doctor in Doctor Who. This is just the next mask worn by the Bard.
