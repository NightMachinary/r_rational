(Sings along)

/We have seen each other, through it all!/

/And when push comes to shove.../

/I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love/

/Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da/

/Da da dat dat da ya da!/

... I hope I wasn't the only one who thought of this while reading the opening quote. Maybe I need to stop listening to Hamilton...

Anyway, good ending to the second book. I really want to know the deal with the Wandering Bard. Anyone have theories on what it means that Almorava died, or what exactly triggered it? Doesn't seem like an acute case of alcohol poisoning, but... maybe? It also very much seems like her Name is like a complete invasion-of-the-body-snatchers kind of thing. That's... creepy.

There's been a lot of non-human name drops in the past two chapters too. More about the Giants, Elves, and ratlings. I'm looking forward to the worldbuilding that's almost certain to come in the next book.

I'm trying to wrap my head around what the history of the Elves is. The author confirmed that there is an entire kingdom of elves on another continent, but it won't come into play. It sounds like these Elves were kicked out, took over the Golden Bloom (from whom?), hid in Arcadia for a while, and are now back... do I have that right?
