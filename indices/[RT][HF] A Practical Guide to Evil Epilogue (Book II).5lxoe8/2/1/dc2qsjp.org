I think Janus is mostly right. Wandering Bard is like...

If this was Worm, the character is the Shard, not the human with the powers. If this was Exalted, it's a sentient Exaltation. The intelligence isn't in the body, it's in the metaphysical entity above the body.

The Wandering Bard is a sentient soul which occasionally switches bodies, but maintains a perfect stream of consciousness throughout. It's true immortality, but only in a completely deterministic way - she seems to have very little control. She follows the stories because that's what she is.

As to the Elves, well...

What would you call a group who opposed race-mixing, believed in full racial superiority, lost a battle with visually similar ideological opponents, and fled to a distant land to hide in the forest?

The concept sounds [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratlines_(World_War_II_aftermath)][pretty familiar]] to a student of history.
