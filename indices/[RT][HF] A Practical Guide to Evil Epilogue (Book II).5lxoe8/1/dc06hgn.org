So I've been thinking: If, as of tommorow, our planet had Names, who would get them, and what would they be?

Obviously we'd have stuff like President and Pope and Prime Minister and Chairman and so on, but not every name is just for the leader of an organization. For example, I think we'd have a NASA exec gain the name Missile Man, and Oprah would probably get a name of some sort.
