I'd probably see Demagogue as a transitional name. Could be Demagogue -> President, or Demagogue -> Revolutionary, etc. I can see your point about not getting names people don't want, but would argue that Catherine damned near had Queen of Callow forced on her by the Angelic Choir, and was only able to refuse it via monumental spite. I'd bet there have been plenty of people who were Named something they didn't intend or didn't want, but either by magical compulsion of the Name, or just by practicality came to fully inhabit and embody the name.

Black is also an interesting point of data as he seems to have deliberately distanced himself from the more self destructive tendencies of his predecessors, but I'd be interested to find a character who regrets, resents, or is actively trying to rid themselves of their Name.
