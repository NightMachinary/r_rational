Is Diabolist a previously mentioned name? I know that there's probably a handful of inactive names- but is there any mention of them?

Also, unless I'm missing something, Dread Empress Triumphant's Name was Empress, not Triumphant. Maybe a new name of Triumphant has been forged, but I doubt it wouldn't have been mentioned when talking about said Empress.
