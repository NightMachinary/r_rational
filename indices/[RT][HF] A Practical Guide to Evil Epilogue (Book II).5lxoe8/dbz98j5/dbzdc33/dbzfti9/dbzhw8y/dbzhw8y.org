My guess? Part of it is she didn't get to properly *speak*, not before he attacked. If Heiress'^{1} theory is correct, without that, Black doesn't get bound to banter with her. Then, Wander might save her from Black's attack, but it doesn't let her counter-attack, and he had a nice series of lethal-to-a-normal-human strikes prepared before she even appeared. Three strikes and you're out- at least for someone as bound in patterns as the Bards.

Bard has high social power, connections, and a deep understanding of the pattern... but in-so-far as brute force combat power? I suspect even Page or Heiress could trump her in a fight. If you can flee, though... you don't need a combat power, and Wander is good at fleeing.

^{1} well, someone else's theory that Heiress noted, but I don't believe we know the original source.
