Based on what I found from the sylometric analysis, I think it's pretty unlikely that this will be able to definitively say that any works are by Bavitz, since you can't test /too/ many stories at a time, since IIRC the time it takes to process is exponential with the number of comparative texts (literally exponential, not polynomial). With just the number of texts I had in that analysis, it took about twenty seconds, but trying to do the hundreds of thousands of stories on fanfiction.net would probably take decades.

If you had a small number you wanted to check it with, that would be feasible, but at that point you could probably just read them all.
