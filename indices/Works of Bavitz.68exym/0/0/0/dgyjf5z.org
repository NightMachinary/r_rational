Interesting. Well, we can maybe buy a few hours of a supercomputer's time to do it? I seem to recall an offer to buy an hour of a 80-teraflop one for $1500, which isn't /that/ much.

*Edit:* ... Or maybe we could give this money to Bavitz instead in exchange for them telling us where the other stories are. But that's way less fun.

*Edit 2:* I did the math, under the assumption that you were comparing 27 stories. Unless I'm mistaken, it would take combinatorially large (as in, larger than the universe's lifespan) amounts of time to compare even one /thousand/ of stories. About forty stories would take a year. Okay, so that particular idea is indeed not feasible.
