For the sake of convenience: */Fargo/* *([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][fanfiction.net]] | [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Fargo][TV Tropes]])*.

I have no idea what else Bavitz may have written, but I do have an idea on how it could be determined if a work is his: using the methodology [[/u/gbear605][u/gbear605]] had used [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/461h03/d_who_is_wertifloke/][here]], i.e. stylometric analysis. Anyone has a backup of all stories from fanfiction.net? It would be a start.

*Edit:* by the way, the author of /Fargo/ recently posted another story under the 'Bavitz' account, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals][a /Homestuck/ fanfiction]], which updated... 19 hours ago.

Well, well, well. Interesting timing, [[/u/AndrasKovacs][u/AndrasKovacs]]. You mean to imply you didn't notice them posting it? Or... are you in fact 'Bavitz', and you've posted this thread to get us to find any obvious holes in your anonymity? Hmm?
