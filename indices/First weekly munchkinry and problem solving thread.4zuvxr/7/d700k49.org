A more interesting variant of the knights and knaves puzzle I once heard runs as follows:

There are three statues. You know that when asked a yes-no question, one responds truthfully, one lies, and one produces a random response (say based on some long ago recorded data). Unfortunately, they respond in a language that you do not speak, using the words Da or Ja. Given three questions, solve which statue is which (and ideally also what Da and Ja mean, though I do not remember if this is part of the problem).

Silly tricks like asking non-yes-no questions (which only the random statue can respond to) or paradoxical questions (same) should probably not be required.
