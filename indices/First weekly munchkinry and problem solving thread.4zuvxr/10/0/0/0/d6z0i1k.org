You can try, but it won't change the fact that they don't know.

Your solution only works if you interpret "always tells the truth" as "tells the best possible objective answer given the question" instead of "tells the best possible answer given their own state of knowledge."

After all, if you say that someone is truthful, you aren't calling them omniscient, you're saying they tell the truth as they see it.

Also, you're mixing the challenges. I'm pretty sure that the infinite question challenge, and the 2 door challenge are separate.
