Yeah, that's the rough outline of the correct answer. I need to double check the exact numbers which I don't have time for now, but you got the idea right with minimizing the number of tries. I worded the problem a little poorly and didn't mean for people to think they needed to minimize the number of flight stairs to travel rather than the number of tries. I updated the original post.
