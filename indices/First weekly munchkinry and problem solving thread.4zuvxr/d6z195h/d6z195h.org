On the first, it's important what happens after the fifteen minutes is up.

Does the belief disappear afterwards, or only your ability to continue influencing? If it lasts, then when people meet you again after your fifteen minutes, do they recognize you as the pretend person (only to be dissuaded as they get a chance to interact with you) or do they recognize you and not know why, do they recognize you as a giant fraud, or do they not recognize you at all?

Does the power work over video or audio broadcasting channels... and (if so) does that broadcast then work as a believable fifteen minutes forever or does it immediately seem absurd afterwards?

Also: Do you have to be a specific individual or can you be a generalized ideal: The Creator of the Universe, your most trusted friend, your own great-grandchild time traveling from the future?
