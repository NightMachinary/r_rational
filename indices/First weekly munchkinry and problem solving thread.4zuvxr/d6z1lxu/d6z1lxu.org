1) I'd choose Jesus as my best option. 15 minutes is enough for a worldwide TV broadcast. From there I can undermine worldwide churches' leadership and basically deliver 'The Newest Testament', which describes unambiguosly the new commandments, forbids finding 'deeper meanings' as the false ones and has a mechanism of text integrity self verification (and meanings'). As for content, it establishes basic 'game theory' society interactions, instigates rationality, defines mechanism of "content updates" and builds a framework for switching from religion altogether later.
