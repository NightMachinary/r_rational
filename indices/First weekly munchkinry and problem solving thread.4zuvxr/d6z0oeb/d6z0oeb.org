What's the worst you can do?

Well there was no limitation you could only fool someone into thinking you're a real person, so presumably you could make them think you were Harry Potter or Superman or whoever, and there's no limitation that you need proximity, so can you just make everyone in the city you're in or whatever assume you're Obama or the like. Useful as you can only use it once so being able to indiscriminately use it on everyone prevents people being missed even if they miss the start of your message.

So what's the worst you can do? Choose some super well known being that means the apocalypse is happening, or just fool people into that. For fifteen consecutive minutes everyone in the world think you are the nigh-omnipotent 15min mark herald of the apocalypse and that anyone alive then will be tortured for eternity or whatever. Now the catch is, if people don't know you exist wouldn't they not know the herald-you exists? Except you've fooled everyone so everyone believes you are them, by the nature of the character and the prompt everyone should know they exist.

Note if the power is based off something like super social skills it's not as effective at all. As is that requires exploiting some vagueness but in theory it could result in most of the world killing themselves and as many others as possible within the 15mins, since they all now believe the world will end in fifteen minutes and eternal torturefest for the living. Abusing it to basically turn it into a limited power to make everyone on earth believe one thing for fifteen minutes is kinda cheating though.
