Omega (omnipotent, omniscient, super-intelligent, neutral morality) appears before you and informs you that he wishes to play a game.

You are able to choose the game, however the definition of "game" cannot be cheesed. "Whoever fulfills my CEV first wins!" does not count.

You can set a wager, however the wager is always balanced. If you wager fulfilment of your CEV, losing results in your Coherent Extrapolated Nightmare being fulfilled.

He will play to win, using all of his abilities, but is not a sore loser and won't cheat.

What do you do?
