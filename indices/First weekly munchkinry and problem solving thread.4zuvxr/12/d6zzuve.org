Since the power is adaptive you can make people believe that you are someone or something without you knowing what it is so that's insanely broken because you can convince anyone by chosing "someone that will convince this person to do x "so you have mind control ,a bit unpredictable but maybe you can be more concrete at specifying what you want to your power (I wonder what happens if you try something impossible ) . Also it occurs to me that maybe(depending on how your power detects what you want) you can use conditionals and use it as a one use computer with infinite processing power and who other people believe you are as ouput(maybe the power works like this but does't have infinite processing power but it has at least enought to adapt to a person and that level of mind reading isn't a trivial feat)
