Chapter 15 frustrated me so much with its justification for why the protagonist isn't particularly smart that I can't bring myself to read further at the moment. Hard to say definitively whether this has direct bearing on RT aspect, but it struck me as a very implausible explanation and a clumsy way to justify the abilities and intellectual level of the protagonist. It pretty much takes the straw vulcan view of super-intelligence peppered with a bunch of other obnoxious anti-intellectual cliches, which I suspect many people here would find similarly frustrating.

I suppose it's at least consistent that a (momentarily) stupid person would be too stupid to realise that deliberately keeping themselves stupid isn't really a good way forward.
