I loved this story! Especially the first bunch of chapters, where he figures out how the magic system works from scratch. There's still some Deus Ex Machinas/Diabolos and the story slows down a bit when the kids get involved, but it was a fun, refreshing take on the Xianxia genre, especially the “ok, he has godlike powers, now what?” part, which I feel is where most other cultivation stories start to get bad. Keep up the good work!
