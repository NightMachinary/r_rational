It's pretty clear that you are talking about science that you don't really know. I specifically recall a comment about water being harder to understand than wind, because water is fluid dynamics, when they are both fluid dynamics. Try to avoid that. More generally, there seems to be an overapplication of scientific concepts and an implicit scientific reductionism which doesn't reflect the practice of actual scientists. For a more realistic and more modern picture of what the essence of science is, I recommend the book [[https://www.amazon.com/Water-H2O-Evidence-Pluralism-Philosophy/dp/9400796463][Is Water H20]]. PM me and I can send a copy. It's a light and engaging read.

The reduction of martial arts to sequences of moves also seems unrealistic and impractical. If you reflect on the mindset which had you produce that as a solution to the problem of teaching martial arts, then I think you will see a bunch of other errors that you make, including some of the scientific ones I mentioned.
