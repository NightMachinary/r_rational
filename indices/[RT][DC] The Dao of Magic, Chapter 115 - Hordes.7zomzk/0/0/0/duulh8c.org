Well, for non-fiction you have, for example, Bostrom's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies][Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]] and [[https://youtu.be/gP4ZNUHdwp8][Miles' stuff]].

For fiction, HPMOR is a decent example, both in what a smart protagonist behaves like and a practical demonstration of what a super-intelligence of sorts can achieve with the final exam. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for death]] may also be useful, since players are encouraged to invest a lot of effort into making the character behave optimally, which (sometimes, arguably) results in super-intelligent behaviour from in-universe perspective. Although both HPMOR final exam and MfD are examples of what happens when normal humans collaborate with each other, rather than examples of a single superhumanly smart agent. But it's probably the best we're gonna get, practically speaking.
