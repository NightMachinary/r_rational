Also, as someone with a CS minor and with experience in C, assembler, and embedded systems programming, this story remarkably does not induce Gell-Mann Amnesia - the author knows his stuff and uses all the right tech at all the right times. Even the dev timelines are reasonably accurate! ...if not the dev team who gets paid for weeks of work chasing down something useless.
