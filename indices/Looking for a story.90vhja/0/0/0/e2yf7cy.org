I don't have a CS degree and I have never worked with any language lower down than Python. Although some of the specifics of what they were talking about went past me, the gist of it was clear enough that I was able to understand and thoroughly enjoy the story. This is a sign of EXCELLENT writing. I agree with all of your points about what makes the story good, I just think that it's also well written enough that anyone with even a passing familiarity with computers will be able to enjoy it.
