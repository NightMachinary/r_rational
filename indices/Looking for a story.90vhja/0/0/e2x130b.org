Thanks for the link. I *really* like this story. The story sells the fundamental alienness of computers. It is in some sense a "first contact" story, except instead of sci-fi-astronomy aimed at distant aliens, it is real-life computer engineering, forcing the reader to take a new perspective on the computers already in front of us.

I'm constantly disappointed by how little top-tier sci-fi really addresses computation, instead extrapolating on other sciences, such as futuristic space travel, or future ecological catastrophes. This story by contrast is a breath of fresh air, for making me thoroughly freaked out about computation while staying totally grounded in the reality of the technology. Amazingly, the computational concepts are all accurate, nothing made up, and used in a plausible way so as to illuminate plot developments. I can't say how much of the nuance in the story will be missed by people who aren't familiar with all the jargon, so the story might not work for everyone however.
