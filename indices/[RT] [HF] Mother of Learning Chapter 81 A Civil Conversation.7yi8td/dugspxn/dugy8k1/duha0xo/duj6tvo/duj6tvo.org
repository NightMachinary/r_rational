Does Zach remember when he acquired that blessing? I'd imagine that he might not, given that it could be subjective decades ago.

But it would be interesting to know if he did actually win over an angel with a feat that was subsequently removed from his memory (or simply forgotten), and if Zorian might discover it upon Zach letting Zorian read his mind.
