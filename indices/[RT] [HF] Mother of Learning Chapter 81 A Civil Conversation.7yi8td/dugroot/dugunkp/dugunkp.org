Zorian has soul sight now, he might be able to investigate it himself. On that front, did they ever try to get Zach soul sight? Zorian mentioned it as a possibility before but it hasn't been brought up again since.

Also, Zach has more than double the normal mana doesn't he, or maybe I am wrong, I can't remember the exact numbers getting thrown around?
