  Z&Z could spend 2-3 restarts on every one of those topics

I don't think they have time to cover most of those. At chapter 55, they had about 4 years left (52 restarts), and a lot of time has passed since then.

But yes, he is a goldmine of info. That's likely in large part why red robe helped him with the invasion. He may not even be on his side, but giving him enough info to steamroll Cyoria would grant him quite a bit of favor...

Especially as Red Robe is a soul magic specialist. I'm curious if he's going to be buffed to be able to counter Zorian and Zach, as he really wasn't strong enough to fight Zach last time they fought, which was around when he left the loop.

I'm hoping not. It's better to use him as a wrench in their plans, given they have Quatach, his army, the cultists, Sudomir, and the primordial to deal with after the loop.
