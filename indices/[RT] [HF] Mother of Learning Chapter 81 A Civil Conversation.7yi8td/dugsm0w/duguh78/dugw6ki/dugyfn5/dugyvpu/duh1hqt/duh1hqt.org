Especially considering QI know about SO MANY different topics.

Alanic knew about fire magic and soul magic (Zorian studied both at once)

Xvim knew about shaping (with Xvim's methods it took Zorian years to exhaust all of it)

In both cases once Zorian mastered it, they became suspicious.

QI knows about:

- soul magic
- all kinds of combat magic, which can be studied independently
- a lot of history stuff that could be helpful
- dimensionalism magic
- divine artifacts / blessings / gods intel
- I do bet he has to have some really cool shaping exercises

Z&Z could spend 2-3 restarts on every one of those topics without QI becoming suspicious about them knowing too much ... just offer him some divine artifacts and information in return!
