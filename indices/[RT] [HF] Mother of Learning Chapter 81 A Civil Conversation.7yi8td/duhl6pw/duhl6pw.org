Seriously not a fan of how Q was written. He sounds and reads like a fellow teenager, even saying "oh come on" at one point.

Nobody desperately needs an editor who can help him give characters distinct voices. This did not sound like an ancient entity, just a fellow ordinary human raised in modern times.
