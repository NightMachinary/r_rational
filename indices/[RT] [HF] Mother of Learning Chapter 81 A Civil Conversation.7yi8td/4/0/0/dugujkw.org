After which Zorian found himself in the loop due to a weird quirk in the way the Lich decided to deal with him? I was thinking that's not an accident, maybe the Lich hasn't seen how the marker operated and decided to try to enter the loop, but first he was going to experiment using a random bystander to make sure that adding the marker to himself would be safe.
