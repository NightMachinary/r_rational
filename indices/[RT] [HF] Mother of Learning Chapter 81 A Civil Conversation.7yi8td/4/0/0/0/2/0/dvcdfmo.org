Isn't the marker self-copying? It covers the soul of the person with it like a self-replicating stamp, so if even a piece of Zach's soul with a full copy of the minimum viable marker got embedded into Zorian's, the replication feature (there to ensure the marker's integrity, continuity, and functionality) would replicate it again and again until Zorian's soul was covered in it, too.
