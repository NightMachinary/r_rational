I also feel like Zorian getting in by pure accident to be incredibly unlikely, but I feel like it's more due to divine meddling. There are some subtle hints so far (zach s doubled reserves, the artifacts, story about the founder of the Ikosian empire, the artifacts, zorian's presenxr, how zorian is almost the perfect complement to zach and fills out his weak spots, etc)
