i'm starting to wonder if red robe might not be an agent of the gate primordial, being turned into a gate is probably plenty horrible and freeing a brother that might have the power to break it out seems like a good plan.

however the priordial might have very limited power over itself after it's gateification, so it did what it could, it kept one person from getting wiped to make sure his brother is freed, something the angels having sent Zach is doing their best to prevent.

but it's just speculation, since i have no proof of the theory at all atm.
