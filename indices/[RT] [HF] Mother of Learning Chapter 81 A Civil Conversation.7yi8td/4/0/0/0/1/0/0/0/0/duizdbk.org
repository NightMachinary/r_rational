to add to this it might be the god that originally creating the sovereign gate. as far as z&z know (and they have look/asked/investigated) the gate hasn't been activated since the original emperor. the gods are whimsical as we know but if something you created hasn't been touched (or you intentional made it difficult to use) in hundreds of years wouldnt you want to check on it an see whats happening.

i mean shit for the gods who have pulled away, this would be an epic movie that could/would completely alter the world. id pay to watch that movie so its not too far to suggest that the gods would watch as well. unless of course they are all dead, which is possible
