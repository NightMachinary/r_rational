I was thinking it was going to go down that route when Qual was about to explain how he doubled his reserves (since a fan theory is that the doubling is caused by the controller's soul being merged with a copy soul or something like that), but I guess not.

I think I'm actually glad that he wasn't a previous looper though. Makes his accomplishments that much more impressive.
