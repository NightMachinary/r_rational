I've reread Spear of Resolve's confession letter, and you're right, she specifically sought out Ghost Serpent to get that information, so she didn't just happen to know things.

But in any case, the fact that an incredibly old being that does not seem particularly connected to the whole Sovereign Gate story knew about it supports the theory that it didn't use to be a really big secret in the past. Maybe another incredibly old being will know about it as well? (Granted, he's a sample size of 1.)
