I think Mind Blank can be taken out by a strong enough dispell. We know it works for mind shielding, and it is a spell like any other.

In most situations dispelling mind blank wouldn't be your highest priority if you're close enough to touch them.

Edit: I keep forgetting he has soul sight now, so at least people can't sneak up on him with mind blank.

If he really needs to, I think a dispell should do the trick.
