you are mixing up transformation potions with perception potions.

Transformation was explained like clothes over the soul. You just wear different clothes temporary. Nochka and any other shifter have two set of clothes over the soul so they can easily switch them. Transformation potion gives temporary clothing. So most likely soul clothes would match the breed of cat it was made from.

With perception potions you gain additional sense on your current clothes. We've seen some combinations from via grey hunter. Some of the potions were created from parts of grey hunter which were responsible for like magic perception, the others vibrations.

Killing kittens would involve is someone wanted to create transformation potion (soul clothes). Chopping them up would include if you'd want to get one of their senses (like hearing/vision) for any human.

Kirille wants to be dragon, who cares about kittens ;)
