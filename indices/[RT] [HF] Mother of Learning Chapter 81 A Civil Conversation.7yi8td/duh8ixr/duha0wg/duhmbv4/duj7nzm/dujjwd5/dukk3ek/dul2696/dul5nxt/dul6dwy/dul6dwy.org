  So most likely soul clothes would match the breed of cat it was made from.

I think I've shared my opinion already. The better answer could be provided by author. From what I've read/recall you provide body to alchemist/potionmaster and then they brew potions from it. The process was never defined as well as quantity. I would assume from one sample body more than one transformation potion would be created (but not sure if it really linked to the size). Also the grey part on this whole potion creating business is - most likely efficiency should be better if specimen is alive while potion is being created/extracted from it (if the current soul is present) - but that's just a educated guess for me.

What I'd like to see for amusement would be creating transformation potion from a big cat (e.g., panther) and giving it to both kirille/nochka.

I guess in a way it's a great way to create fan fiction. There is very little fanfiction about this - so I would suggest just try to write up some how nochka and kirille steals some crystalised mana from under the bed, buys cat transformation potions and cause trouble/fights cranium rats/whatever and are known as bad ass cat duo during one particular restart. Great way to amuse oneself especially if you are fan. Not many people are asking questions like this, author is for sure don't have time to side stories/fillers. I'm pretty sure he'd even give some pointers after you create a draft.
