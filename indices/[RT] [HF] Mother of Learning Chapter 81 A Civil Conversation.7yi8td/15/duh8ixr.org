I've been wondering if there's any possible technique that could be used to circumvent Mind Blank. Because at this point it's pretty much a showstopper for Zorian's effectiveness against all of his current major opponents.

Maybe if you can figure out where I mind should be (for example, by touching somebody) You could forcibly connect to their mind.
