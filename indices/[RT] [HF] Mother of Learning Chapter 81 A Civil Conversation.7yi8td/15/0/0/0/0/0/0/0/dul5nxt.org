i don't mix them up, yes they are clothes for the soul, but those clothes are they in the image of the thing you killed or just the same species?

basically would you look like that particular cat you "killed" for parts or would you look like a generic cat.

and i'm sure kirelle would love to be a dragon, the police would not however love her being one and would cause unneeded attention something letting kirelle be a kitten would not, also letting a 9 year old be something that can kill you by sitting on you seems more then slightly reckless.
