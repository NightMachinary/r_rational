sorry but a quick question about transformation potions, do you turn into a copy of the very beast you killed for parts or do you just turn into the same species?

wondered since i thought about Nochka and Kirelle playing together, and how Kirelle would probably love to be a kitten for a while since she loves anything magical, but killing kittens for parts seem cruel rather then just chopping up a cat that died of natural causes.

yea... rereading MoL makes thoughts go into weird places.
