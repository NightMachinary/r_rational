I guess in a way it's the similar thing like breathing. You can consciously stop breathing and while someone can't force you to breath all you have to do is disrupt this person a LOT so he reverts to instincts (like knocking one out would work 100%).

It is a bit of catch 22 in this particular case. Since you cannot influence person via mind magic, the only other means are other mental inputs (like vision/smell/sound). It seems one would need to overwhelm some other senses - and I'd argue that technically this is not a dispelling. At best you can call it indirect dispelling.

Talking about QI - as a lich he has less senses and during his long life he's seen a lot of stuff so it would be really hard to impact him on battlefield or not.
