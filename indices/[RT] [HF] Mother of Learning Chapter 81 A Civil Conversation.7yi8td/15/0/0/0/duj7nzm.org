Mind blank is a disconnect from 'the great web', which means there is nothing for mind magic to target. A dispell is just regular ol magic. Mind blank won't protect you from being physically targeted by other magic.

In the early chapters, in the classroom when they discuss dispelling, Ilsa says "Disruptor spells are the simplest form of dispelling, and virtually every spell can be disrupted if you put enough power into the disruptor, but sometimes disrupting the spell can have worse consequences than letting it run its course. This is especially true for higher-order spells, which almost always react explosively to disruption because of the vast amount of mana that goes into their casting"

She also says shortly after when the students try to dispell the magically started fire "This is another weakness of disruptor spells. They break down mana constructs, but any fundamentally non-magical effects caused by the spell are unaffected..."

I am curious to know if Mind Blank is one of the exceptions that falls under 'virtually all', but I still think it should be able to dispelled if it's a magically maintained effect.
