It's the right website, yes. I think the overlap of people who enjoy MoL and WtC and people who enjoy TGS is sizeable, but they are fairly different stories in many regards, like pacing, how the world feels and the kind of thing they are trying to do in general, so I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't sit right with everyone. IMO The Good Student is the least good of the three, and I expect this to be a common opinion.
