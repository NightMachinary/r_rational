It's possible that the mana could be being drawn somehow from deep within the dungeon. If there was a way to get past the way the deep dungeon interferes with teleportation/dimensionalism spells (perhaps with a stabilization frame like the Bakora gates or the Ibaasan's gates) then the high ambient mana could easily be siphoned though a dimensional gate to power a pocket dimension, warding scheme or airship.

There would be a risk of some magical creature coming along and destroying whatever used to stabilize the gate (if anything is needed) on the dungeon side, but that can be mitigated by having multiple gates for backup. The other risk would be the creature using the gate to attack you, but that could be reduced by making the gate very small - just big enough to suck mana through, but not big enough for anything to enter - or having other defenses against magical creatures.
