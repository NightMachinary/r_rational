Your point about Silverlake claiming that the orb is achievable through mortal magic makes me think that all of the artefact can be 'reproduced' -with more or less success. What is not reproduceable though is their 'hidden function', that only time looper can use.

Considering this, there is a high possibility that Silverlake created a similar object to the crown which would poser her pocket dimension. It would just work with ambient mana instead and maybe it can't be moved/requires extremely rare materials.
