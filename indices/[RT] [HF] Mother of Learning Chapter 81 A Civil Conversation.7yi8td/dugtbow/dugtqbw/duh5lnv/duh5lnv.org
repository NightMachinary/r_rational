I feel suspicious of QI's admission though. Like why would you just tell your enemies you have 10x more mana? ZZ told him the truth of how the orb stores a functionally infinite amount of memories, so I have a suspicion that the crown also holds a functionally infinite amount of mana and QI just said 10x so they would underestimate him. He's probably been storing and building up mana for the past thousand years or for however long he's had the crown.
