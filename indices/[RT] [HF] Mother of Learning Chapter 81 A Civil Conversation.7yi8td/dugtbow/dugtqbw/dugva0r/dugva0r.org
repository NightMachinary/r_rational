  reserves can grow anywhere from 3x to 5x, if I remember correctly

But that's just what they say today based on 'normal' people. Zorian also said that in his case this didn't work, because he worked really hard on his shaping skills (=lowering the mana cost of spells).

So in case of 1000 years old lich we can expect him to have like 5x-7x mana growth just by practicing while also having some additional bonus from extreme shaping skills.
