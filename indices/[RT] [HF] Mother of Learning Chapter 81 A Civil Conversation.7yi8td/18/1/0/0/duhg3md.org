That is indeed part of why I think it's unlikely. Though it would be a great way to store and retrieve items he values and wants to ensure he keeps hold of more than his body. And he probably has more protections on his soul than any real place he could send such an item. Except the place his soul resides. Though teleporting an item directly to your soul sounds more dangerous than creating a well built and secure soul based storage interface... Words I'd never thought I'd type or say.
