The sovereign gates only deals with souls anyways. The original zach soul was transferred into machine. The rest of souls were copied together with bodies. When Zach will exit (administrative mode), his soul will be transferred back to his original body. So it is very unlikely there will be a solution which involves anything else besides soul entities.

I'm not a tech. engineer, I suppose I like puzzles.

Yes, I think that generic design for gates is like you've described. I'd say some little details are different. Like: The main soul/gate would be actually the one under Cyoria mana hole and has terribly large original mana pool + ultra divine blessing. Cyoria - because the largest mana hole, so the best place for original/central/modified soul to regenerate mana.

Remote gates are designed so that simulacra upkeep is the minimal (like Zorian cut his upkeep with golem design). This design takes it to extremes. There is no mind blank - the gate would be reachable via mental contact, but specific engagement sequence / port knock is either unique for each gate or same for every node. Each gate node is very passive+gate specific design makes it very difficult to notice that there's soul (or simulacra) present. We didn't hear any comment from a mage with a very well developed soul sight though.

I'm not sure there's a need for mana battery, however remote node have "limited" mana allowance from coordinating node - that's why for gate to open, enough local ambient mana concentration have to be present. It is possible that there is a mana battery present which absorbs ambient mana. By using crystallized mana aranea hasten mana absorbtion process.

But, as always, the author might have designed it some other different fashion. However such design we are discussing here makes a lot of sense.
