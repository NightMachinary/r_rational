I don't really want to venture too deeply into speculation into where the story will go in the endgame, but I do at least expect Zorian to end up as more of a soul entity than not in order to get out. he's already most of the way there.

that gate network method is some pretty good thinking. are you an engineer by any chance? let me make sure I understand what you are suggesting: there is a single gate spirit which is capable of producing dimensional gates, creating simulacrums and using its soul to communicate with them, using mind blank, and communicate mentally with (at a minimum) humans and aranea. the gate overlord spirit is somewhere, it ultimately doesn't matter where. it creates and permanently maintains a simulacrum for each gate frame. when some specific signal is received at a gate frame, it reveals itself and contacts the person who sent the signal to find out the address of the target gate. it then contacts the overlord to coordinate with the simulacrum at the target gate, and the two simulacrums communicate through the overlord to produce the dimensional passage. that's actually a really nice solution, especially considering Silverlake's insistence that massive mana batteries are within the reach of mortal magics, which would allow a spirit to support so many simulacrums indefinitely.
