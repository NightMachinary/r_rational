think of it like material science, in which each sort of distinct magical energy is a material used to build something. mana is used to build common spells, and is also burnt to power them. sometimes physical materials are used (in spell formula) to support and stabilize things made of mana. primordials seems to be made of something distinct as well, as primordial essence is used to create some effects which the story suggests are not possibly with normal magic alone. souls are made of something different. It is only detectable using soul sight, and it clearly has different properties from mana - it doesn't seem to be usable to make any sort of spells, it can nourish spirits and magical creatures who consume it, it can produce mana, and it can be made functionally indestructible (this is assuming only one magical material is used to make souls, which might not be the case). divine power seems to be another distinct sort of building material. the frame around QI's soul is made from it, which means that it can apparently be made into something which can stabilize soul material. its other important quality is that it cannot be detected even through typical use of soul sight. this is the important quality which potentially reveals the mechanism for many things in this world which weren't yet explained: the perfect ability of divine artifacts to resist any sort of magical analysis, the perfect concealment of the bakora gate spirits. there may be more, but those come to mind mainly because they are both perfect concealment effects. it seems to me that an excellent reason for why these things cannot be detected is if they are created entirely from this divine power material. I am not suggesting that any mortals would be able to do much with divine power, but that the bakora gate ritual might be the key to developing an interface to detect and interact with existing divine constructs.

also, bakora gates require some obscure means of contacting the gate spirit which is unknown to modern magic as well as a convenient means of mentally communicating with the spirit to receive and transmit the gate code. that is quite a high bar of personal ability and one which humans don't meet. plus they are extremely widespread, meaning that whoever built them probably was not a small, elite group but instead a population. if they weren't made by and for gods, I am not entirely sure what sort of horrifyingly powerful entities they were made for.
