We know very little, mostly some speculations.

They are very old.

General consensus was the dimension gate spell was reverse engineer from those gates.

Looking how aranea is using crystal mana to open connection we can conclude that a long time ago ambient mana might have been much more dense (or not).

I would think this is legacy of another great magic civilization. QI was complaining about how non-sharing mages were millenia ago and just how much knowledge was lost. I would think that most of (barely surviving) heritage of this civilization was lost on that period.

The first ikosian emperor created his empire after he used an artifact. But he just found this artifact somewhere and used it. It does not mean that he was the first user ever. Those gates could have been from previous users / civilization which flourished by usage of this divine time dilation artifact.
