There wasn't any recent news about soul bonds, so those a the lose facts I build this upon:

Both soul bonding and un-bonding techniques exist. The domination thing is a longer term issue - they would need to bond for a very short term. As who would dominate who - no clear answer. There wouldn't be any attempt to dominate since they already have enough trust. In the end even if Zach got more fighting instincts, Zorian is much more subtle. It's like woman vs man - man is the head, woman is the neck and she just makes sure the head is looking at the right direction.

The Machine would replace current Zach soul (with all extras, including bonded souls) because it is designed to do so. Zorian would need to do something about his original copy soul/body, since he would need to take over. Looking at the foreshadowing Zorian is preparing for this already. I didn't see a lot of low hanging fruit in this novel.

I'm pretty sure even with the key they won't be able to leave both. The machine was pretty strict about modifying/replacing the souls other than for operator. There might be no need for soul bonding, but looking at how the novel is built/designed from start, the exiting should make a LOT of sense. and for me - soul bond is the most RATIONAL choice.
