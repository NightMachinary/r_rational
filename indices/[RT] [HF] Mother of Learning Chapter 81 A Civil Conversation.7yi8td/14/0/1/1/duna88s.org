I don't think that there is a specific rule for "once the Controller has left, don't let a second Controller out." The rule is, "once the Controller has left, don't let /anyone/ out." And the Guardian has explicitly stated that gathering the Key would override that rule.

So theoretically the Guardian should let them out once they have the Key - one of them, at least. Exactly what will happen depends on how the Gate handles itself in an inconsistent state. Complications include:

- Red Robe has already left. Which body did he land in, his own or Zach's?
- What happens to the Key after they use it? Will the one left behind be able to reuse it to un-bar the Gate a second time? Will he get reset and have to collect it again?
- What body could Zorian land in? The Guardian won't allow him to kick out the original copy of his own soul (essentially killing his pre-loop self).
