soul bonds are really bad though, as zorian says one of them will become a dominant partner (zach) while the other one becomes basically a copy of that parter.

so with a soul bond we wound end up with 2 Zachs but one being psychic and one not, it's not a optimal solution to anything.

if they get the key the could just both leave, as long as Zorian leave before Zach that is, since the gate won't stop operating while the operator is inside, and Zach is recognized as the operator.
