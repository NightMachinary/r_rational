One mystery is unraveled (the Zach 2x mana - divine blessing), but conspiracy/background story got even more complex. According to QI the angels are really stingy with divine blessings - the forces behind putting Zach into looping (or opposing to it) are very heavyweight. I don't think it's a "compassion/compensation" due to loss from weeping from church/angels.

The whole interacting with QI avenu gives options of easily slipping "banish lich" trojan horse. Come to his location, ask him to trade knowledge. give him divine dagger, ask some questions, get some knowledge. give him another three items to choose from, all of them booby trapped - he might pick it up out of curiosity and they would easily gain a crown.

I've got some pet theories I'd like to share as well. The current main problem for Zorian is how to get out of the loop. And the funny thing is the author already explained how this happened ages ago. It's... souls bond. The Zach and Zorian will bound their souls, with Zach being as anchor. They already got soul fragments and machine does not care much about souls. So as soon as they get full key unlocked, Zorian should be able to piggy back on Zach to the real world. There's plenty of literature to research (including massive library he found hidden but never read up in Knyazov Dveri on his search for soul mages. Looking how rational everything is and heavy foreshadowing from author I'll be really surprised is the anything else will pop up as means to escape loop for Zorian. This level of trickery - huge approval from me. Nice done.

As for current invaders/QI dilemma, there is actual solution for the problem as well. Let me elaborate on this a bit more. The problem for Ulquaan Ibasa / necromancers is they live in very bad location. Nothern bare islands (cold/etc). Also the necromancers are not welcome due to well... undeads, etc. The solution Z&Z can come up with for the big shots of Ibasa - create a gate to Blantyrre (preferably the furthest away region) with QI and migrate everyone from there. Blantyrre is ruled by lizardman. Previous attempts to conquer it failed spectacularly. By flying the ship to Blantyrre, getting portal open with Arachna in the closest side, then finding the furthest away portal and getting password from there - Zorian needs to open gate for QI in there and offer: I'll open the gate for you, you transfer your operational gate to blantyrre instead from Cyoria and conquer that continent. No one gives a damn (besides some local lizardmen). Win-win-win (besides huge loss for lizardmen, but who cares about them ;) )
