I think they're quite confident in reaching Blantyrre now without help - they know how to 'easily' steal and operate the airship (now without damaging the core = at full speed); once they get there and find a Bakora gate, they don't need the airship anymore (they already have Bakora gate at Ziggurath and in Koth).

Btw I don't think QI fully knows how to operate Bakora gates - he doesn't use the one under Cyoria. I think he just realized what does the icosahedron do (from studying his own blessing) and how to apply it to self-made gates.

I can't find at the moment how exactly does the mana cost scale with the distance of teleport, but I suspect it's more than lineary (because 'mages chain teleports when going bigger distances' [ch. 65] and 'costs increase exposively with the volume being teleported [ch. 69])

Or over here 'people chain teleports all the time instead of simply teleporting to the destination outright' [ [[http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Word_of_Domagoj]] ].

So even if we estimate QI's mana reserves to be 16x bigger than Zach's (both same base, both divine blessing, QI +10xbase from crown, let's guess QI +6xbase from practicing shaping and having bigger reserves by using magic for 20 times as long as Zach) and we guess (for the sake of this argument) that mana cost increases quadratically with distance, that means that QI can teleport 4 times further than Zach (4^{2} = 16).

That doesn't really get him to Blantyrre (that should be far away). Although one of the biggest problem with teleporting is that you have to divine where you want to teleport - which is way easier if you've already been there. Maybe QI has some additional bonuses in this area :-D

btw would QI pass ALL of the shaping exercises that Xvim would think of? (I specifically remember him being awed at Xvim deflecting one of his attacks with his hand :-D )
