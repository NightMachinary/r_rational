  That doesn't really get him to Blantyrre (that should be far away). Although one of the biggest problem with teleporting is that you have to divine where you want to teleport - which is way easier if you've already been there. Maybe QI has some additional bonuses in this area :-D

Even with some huge range increases, there's no teleporting to Blantyrre. The maps show the island chains from Eldemar to Koth, and there if Zach can't skip most of those islands, then there is no way for anyone to teleport across the much larger distance to Blantyrre.

  btw would QI pass ALL of the shaping exercises that Xvim would think of? (I specifically remember him being awed at Xvim deflecting one of his attacks with his hand :-D )

That reaction could be surprise that someone else can do something so impressive, not necessarily that QI couldn't do the same thing.
