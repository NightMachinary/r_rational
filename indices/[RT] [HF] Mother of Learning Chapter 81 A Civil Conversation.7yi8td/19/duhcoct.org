So Zorian seems very interested in Divine Blessings. It appears that he won't be able to have one in the time loop but understanding them might be a key to understanding the isocahedron stabiliser. He just has to find people with divine blessing who would agree to share information. Alanic might be of good help to find them.

Many things are being set up for this particular loop. Hopefully their intereaction with QI will be fruitful since they can't afford to contact him like that in each loop: he is unpredictable and might attack them instead if they're not careful. They might do like Red Robe and side with QI in some of the loops. I feel like it would be the smartest way to gain intel and skills. I doubt Zach would be okay with that but they can still end the loop before the attack anyway if it bothers him too much.
