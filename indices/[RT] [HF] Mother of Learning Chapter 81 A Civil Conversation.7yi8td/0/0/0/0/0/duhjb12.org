  Shaping skill allows you to go farther with that Mana, but it doesn't give you additional Mana capacity.

In the extreme case you manage to have shaping skills so good every single spell costs you half as much mana as for other people, you effectively doubled your mana reserves and regeneration. Yes, we don't know what the exact limit of this is, but if we estimate something like ~20-40 % cheaper spells due to good shaping, that would mean ~1.25-1.666 bigger reserves and mana regeneration.

  Measuring Zorian's growth is hard only because he spent a lot of time getting better at the simple spell they use to measure Mana capacity

You are correct with this, but while Zorian managed to master that one simple spell, he also practiced whole bunch of different shaping skills - if we estimate that he's currently in top 10 % mages considering dimensionalism skills, that would mean that he's able to cast any dimensionalism spell cheaper than 90 % of mages ...

At this moment the only spell he mastered is the magic missile, his second most trained spell is probably teleportation. He hasn't trained all the other spells he knows that hard - he trained them by getting very impressive shaping skills in different magic fields.

btw would magic missile be even cheaper if he learned it like a shaping exercise - without the use of his hands? There still is some difference between reflexive spells and unstructured magic (source [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/08/10/basics-of-magic-spellcasting/]] ).
