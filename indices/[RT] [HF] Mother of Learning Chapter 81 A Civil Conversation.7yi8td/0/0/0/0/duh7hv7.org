Magnitude just measures your mana reserves. Shaping skill allows you to go farther with that Mana, but it doesn't give you additional Mana capacity. Measuring Zorian's growth is hard only because he spent a lot of time getting better at the simple spell they use to measure Mana capacity, but his actual reserve haven't been changed by that. He can go a lot farther with that same Mana than a pre-loop Zorian would, but we have no reason to suspect that Zorian's Mana reserves have grown to abnormal levels, nor that there are easy methods of doing so.
