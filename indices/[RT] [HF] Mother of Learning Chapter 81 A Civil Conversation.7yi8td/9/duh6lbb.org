A battlemage, a mind mage and a necromancer walk into a bar...

Well, now we know the sercret behind QI's inexhaustible mana reserves. I wonder if they can try confiscating his crown during battle to make him lose the access to his stored mana.

I also wonder if this exchange means that QI will immediately confront them during the invasion, disrupting any plan they might have for that time.

Coming out as time travelers is probably a stupid idea in this restart. But it might work in the next one, should they feel it's worth it.
