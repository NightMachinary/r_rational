From what Silverlake said I think that all the artefacts WILL be reproduced - expect Z&Z&friends having their own, weaker crowns in a few restarts!

tbh I think even the hidden function is reproducible, but considering that there is no living soul mage who can create such complex soul marker and then you need to bind the function to the marker ...

#+begin_quote
  Silverlake created a similar object to the crown which would power her pocket dimension. It would just work with ambient mana instead
#+end_quote

The interesting thing about the crown is that the mana remains attained to the mage. Ambient mana is unattained by default, so it would just be a big mana core that would charge in mana-rich areas and then power the wards. It would still require Silverlake to move her home to mana rich areas once in a while ...
