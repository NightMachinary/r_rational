There's still something about 'mana cores' we don't know about.

-the Pearl of Aranhal 'boasts an experimental power core'

-Silverlake's home is in area with weak ambient mana - too weak for her heavy wards + maintaining medium sized pocket dimension

-Silverlake claims that 'the whole orb is potentially achievable through familiar mortal magic. Yes, even the power source thing.'

The airship could potentially have crystallized mana engine - just more advanced than trains. Silverlake's home could run on souls - whatever. But I don't think either of the two mentioned things powers the orb. So what is the secret?

So to summarize what we know about increasing your available mana:

1) Using souls of others -to power magic items (Z&Z won't use) - either killed people or already 'prepared' souls (from soul-eating plants, or stealing from necromancers (from Sudomirs wards...)).

2) Engines running on crystallized mana (too risky for combat, very easy for enemies to detonate once they know what they're dealing with).

3) Some unknown power source (definitely used in orb, maybe in Silverlake's cottage?).

^ all those should give you unattuned mana - only for magic items (=items with preset spells)

4) Divine blessing - enhancing your soul (icosahedron+soul magic around your soul which stabilizes it). Enhances both maximum mana and mana regeneration (by the same factor).

5) Your own mana battery (which is recharged when you don't use mana and the stored mana is kept attuned). Enhances maximum mana, but doesn't change mana regeneration.

^ these two should give you mana to use as you please.
