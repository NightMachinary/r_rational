I came here to talk about this possibility too. That's what I'd do if I was QI, listening devices in everything I gave to anyone else. I'd also make copies of and trap everything I'm wearing. If he was in disguise at the tavern, he could've went further and wore a fake crown with a listening device that he could've exchanged for information or whatever. He could've made a mana battery and then lie that the crown actually only doubles mana reserves.

As the conversation proceeded, I would've also been stuffing invisible bugs in every pocket Zach and Zorian had. If I was them, I'd be super paranoid about that sort of thing at least.
