There are multiple rules. I'm pretty sure it goes something like this instead of having "second controller" anywhere there. Having a simple if for the controller leaving solves why it wouldn't let every controller leave, without makers having to had thought about multiple controllers.

"Keep the thing running until the controller is not inside anymore."

"If controller has not left, let the controller leave."

"If someone has the ADMIN keys, do what they say."

The thing can copy souls, so it could probably overwrite them as well. Thus I'd believe they go to their original bodies. Why wouldn't guardian allow him to enter his body? Guardian has had no problems with killing thousands of Zorians. Instead he should have problems killing the more advanced one.

It would be more dramatic if the keys would reset and Zach left with them and Zorian would have to do some dimension jumping with the prison not having time and strength to get all keys himself.
