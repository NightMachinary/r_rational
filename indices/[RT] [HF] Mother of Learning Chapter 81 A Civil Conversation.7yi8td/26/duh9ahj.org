Quatorian's state of being:

Zorian didn't like to be ever vigilant, it's stressing him out. But, he's quite open to another heart to heart at further date. This, in part, was due to Zach expressing great interest for such occasion. His statement may suggest he was interested in the person himself, to Zorian's ire, especially since Zorian knew Zach's taste very well. But in the end, he kept things as they are, preventing himself jumping to conclusion. Thinking too much about possiblity of Quazach, he thought, will surely mess everything up.
