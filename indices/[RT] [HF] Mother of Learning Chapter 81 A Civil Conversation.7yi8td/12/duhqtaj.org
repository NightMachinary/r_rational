looks like we have a solid lead on a new tier of magical fuckery. QI's blessing is made out of divine power, whatever that actually ends up being, which is impossible to detect except for very uncommonly experienced soul mages. this type of energy could pretty easily answer questions about how the bakora gate spirit works, as it seems to act like a spirit, but isn't detectable in any normal way. that gate opening ritual the aranea sorted out might be Zorian's lead into actually interacting with things made from divine power.
