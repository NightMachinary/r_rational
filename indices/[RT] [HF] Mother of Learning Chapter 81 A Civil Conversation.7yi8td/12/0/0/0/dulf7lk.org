It's an even greater benifit having the crown and exra 2250 because the benefit is not strictly linear. It means he has had 10x more mana regeneration time once the capacity of the crown is used.

He hasn't even touched his natural reserves yet and he's had 37.5 minutes of mana regen pumped into the crown.
