  2x multiplier is for massive mana pool people like QI or Zach (...)

I actually thought about this in terms of the crown, too.

From what we know, their current magnitudes (in terms of magic missiles) are:

- QI: ~250
- Zach: ~232 (can he cast invisible ones now?)
- Zorian: ~35 (also before he could cast invisible ones)

If QI says that the crown makes his reserves 10 times larger, that would mean the capacity of the crown would be ~2250 magic missiles (in terms of people who can cast missiles effectively).

Fully trained mage in area with sufficient ambient mana can fully restore their mana in 30 minutes. So Zach or QI wearing crown can fully restore in 5 hours, while Zorian would need about 40 hours.
