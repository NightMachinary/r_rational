I've actually asked the author about divine magic in the comments of worldbuilding site (about magic types) and his answer about divine magic was: It is indeed not accessible for non-divine entities. Even the angels are basically drawing upon certain blessings and mechanisms left to to them by the gods rather than being innately capable of it themselves.

No new tier magic. Maybe one can learn something from it, but no way to influence it. It is very unlikely that bakora gates are created with divine magic so don't think it will influence it a lot.

I also think that 2x multiplier is for massive mana pool people like QI or Zach and 2x rate is a massive simplification so it is easier to understand for people how this blessing works. All it does it stabilizes the mana. Chances are it would give larger boost for smaller mana pools (lets say 5x, more) since the smaller pools are easier to stabilize. There aren't that many people with divine blessings and the it's not like you can accurately measure mana pools anyway. It is all rough estimates.
