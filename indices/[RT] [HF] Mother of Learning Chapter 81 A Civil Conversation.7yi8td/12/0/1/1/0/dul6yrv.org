I admit that I am familiar with electromagnetism and fundamental electronics only, any deeper disciplines in that branch of science/engineering are not within my purview. the main problem with looking at mana like electricity at all is that electricity always needs a medium. mana can be used to construct things all on its own. that's what spells are. that comparison would hold water if, in this world, mages needed some sort of physical object to cast magic - a staff or wand or similar item. spells, however, stand on their own. mana is not electricity-like, it is much more like a building material that can also be consumed for energy.

looking at divine works as if they were steel is a perfect analogy for what I was trying to convey, if steel were also impossible to perceive normally. I've made small batches of crucible steel, so I am familiar with what a pain it is. you can understand the hardness of a diamond (or steel for that matter) by simply inspecting it. you cannot understand why it is so hard without a deeper understanding and better tools (tools which, in this case rest in the hands of the gods alone).

perhaps you misunderstood my statement. I do not think that Zorian will at any point be capable of "casting divine magic" or anything like that. that doesn't seem like it is a thing at all. I am suggesting that, through this lead, they may gain the ability to detect and scrutinize existing divine works, which will put them head and shoulders above anyone else in terms of making use of them.

regarding gate spirits, the problem is that with networking, things are arranged into neat little routes, with no real analogue for free space. if there is no connection between two points, you can never move between them. this allows many schemes in which it is very easy to occlude things. this pattern does not hold for the reality of the MoL world. generally, when you have power in some field, you can detect that thing. at the very least you can detect the existence of a thing. the ability to hide the existence of something is generally not all-encompassing. invisibility spells work imperfectly and work through optical trickery - there are no illusions that 'make the area look empty' directly. methods of reducing the detectability of a magic item are still limited to reducing its profile, not hiding it entirely. hiding from soul perception also seems to reduce visibility rather than hiding entirely (as red robe was still able to find Zorian eventually), and pocket dimensions can also be detected by those who know enough about them, despite their normally hidden state. telepaths using 'normal' skills can reduce or inflate their telepathic signature, but not disappear entirely. 'going dark' and mind blank seem to be the only other examples of any sort of perfect effect, and there seem to be some dire drawbacks and oddly specific techniques to make use of them. I would be shocked if something deeper was not at work with that. so given all that - knowing that a spirit exists, knowing how to detect spirits/souls, how to detect minds, how to spot a pocket dimension if it is hiding in one, and still not being able to detect the spirit without this specific and obscure spell? that isn't a security protocol using known magic, that's something outside it.
