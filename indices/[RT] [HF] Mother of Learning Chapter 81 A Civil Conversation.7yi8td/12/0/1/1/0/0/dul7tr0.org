I overgeneralized a lot as well. I was talking about spell formulas / crafting. The tools which allows you feed it with your mana and you don't need to do anything else. What I meant it really translates very well into our general technology. So those schemas relate only to crafting and mana is energy which powers such constructs as electricity powers out technology.

And yes, I totally agree that mana is much more different than electricity.

Divine magic is very very interesting topic. (There are at least two more: spell formulas of aranea. medical magic). But Z&Z are on very very short time. Zorian needs to improve his soul magic ASAP as much as possible (if you'd see my other speculation about soul bonds), also continue into dimensionalism studies. They are out of time and connot fork larger amount attention to the studies of these subjects. At this stage we can just speculate on this fantastical topic.

The reason why QI was able to spot divine construction - he should have a VERY VERY ADVANCED soul magic/perception. And even with high skill like this he was barely able to detect this divine construct. I would also think he noticed soul strain of divine magic. The different strain of divine magic should be applied to physical forms and I'm not sure what kind of perception one needs to detect structure of divine enhancement. The general detection seems to be easy enough - otherwise people wouldn't distinguish divine items easily like this. But unfortunately I don't think we will see any headway into this...

As a side note to this all divine stuff I also like how the author used the modern myth "the stuff they were producing in the past was better quality than today". This argument is destroyed by statement "they made a lot of crap in the past and only quality items survived so you get a quality bias".

talking about networking and gate spirits, I can point out to dedicated private network. What is even more likely - master gate we don't know of which is handling the connections between all the nodes. The mechanism similar to Zorian uses to exchange information between his simulacrums using his soul. the soul/mind connections are idle and since there is no traffic you cannot detect anything. There is a single soul overlooking whole network, while each remote node has its identification (like simulacrum 3 for Zorian). And via soul links separate gates can communicate/coordinate with opening gate. It is simple explanation and if you rely on argument like Occams razor it is more likely than divine craft.
