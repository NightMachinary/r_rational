You are looking at the wrong material science. For me the best analogue for mana would be science related to electrical networks (EN). Not sure if you had any exposure.

Souls are... well, mana sources. So in EN think of them as of generators/energy sources. Mana shaping or magic formulas are the pathways to limit the flow. A schema in EN. you think what you need to do and you start designing schema. At least I'd think author had some inspiration for electrical networks. Unstructured magic/mana shaping exercises allow you create such schemas on the fly. Some time ago (like 25-30 years), the domestic appliances like TVs came with their own EN schemas attached. If something was broken and you were knowledgeable enough, you could fix the item.

Mind magic - the best analogue would be networking/pcs. You find the node you are interested in, check the ports, perform some remote flaw exploiting technics and you are intruded on someone elses PC (mind) and you either steal stuff or just mess everything up (mind bomb). There are different OSes (aranea / whatever), so the approach for different species is a bit different.

For soul magic I cannot come up with exact analogue, but it's something like electromagnetism. The changes in electromagnetic field phases/whatever can generate electricity. You can see electromagnetic fields. The soul well is the huge electromagnet which tries to pulls various random electromagnetic entities (souls). If you can see magnetic fields, it is much easier to avoid impact.

Now the divine magic is something totally different. It's like metal making industry, where gods can build a factory and do some heavy metal working (like building metal pots, spoons, knives, whatever). The general public (or even the lesser forms) can put some use to it, can maybe break the stuff, but have no way to the metal furnaces to create something from metal. Angels that left are able to create something like blessing because it's like form created by gods, and they have access to furnace, so they can fill it with hot metal and know how to cool it, can produce something.

While someone can get some aspirations (like try to create knife from stone or whatever), the science for this is way beyond and there's no way to replicate the whole industry until you ascend from ant/critter to the god level and then you may start fiddling with industrial stuff.

Can you understand hardness of diamond without microscope, without knowledge of atomic structure, etc. I guess the similar limits apply understanding divine magic.

As for contacting gate spirits, the easily understood material networking technique is "port knock". If you want to connect to something on port you need D, first you need to contact port a, wait a second, contact port b, wait two second contact port c. Only if you follow the correct prior sequence, connection to port d will be accepted. No need for divine magic.
