Remember how time magic works? Tons of mana is needed to accelerate something, and even then, to reduce the mana cost, you have to seal off the space you are accelerating in a Black room.

Yet QI is able to cast time magic on himself, without any sealing, to speed himself up several times in combat. That probably costs insane amounts of mana, and now we know how he can fuel it.
