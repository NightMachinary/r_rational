  we still haven't seen QI use any offensive spell so overpowered that Xvim/Alanic would have no defense against it.

he's never particularly needed to before though. In all the past fighs we've seen in him during teh invasion he was fighting against pretty standard mundane enemies he could defeat easily.

He did the soul magic thing that started this all off very easily, and thats probably beyond every other soul mage we've encountered so far. If he can do something of that level as a spiteful whim he could do a lot more if he was actually feeling threatened.
