One thing to note is that the crown works as a battery.

For a trained mage it takes around 30 minutes to replenish their mana reserves from 0 to 100 % [ [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/]] ].

So if we say that QI's mana reserves without the crown are the same as Zach's, that means that their mana replenishes at the same rate.

With the crown: QI needs ~5 hours to fill it, then he has 10 times more mana than Zach, but same replenishment rate.

So Zach + Zorian + Alanic + Xvim using some mana-efficient defense while keeping QI trapped (anti-teleport + soul trap field) can still theoretically force QI to go out of mana.

Even though some people suggest this after current chapter, we still haven't seen QI use any offensive spell so overpowered that Xvim/Alanic would have no defense against it. Might be still hidden up his sleeve, though.
