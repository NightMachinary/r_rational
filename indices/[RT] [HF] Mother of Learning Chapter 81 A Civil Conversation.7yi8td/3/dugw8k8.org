So in chapter 62, we find out that Zach started as magnitude 25 and appeared to have it doubled without affecting his mana reserves. In chapter 8, he says he maxed out at magnitude 232. In this chapter, Quatach-Ichl basically said he followed the same path...so if he's being truthful about the crown's powers, he could have a magnitude of 2000+.

2000+. He's basically like a demi-god among men at this point. It makes me wonder how much magic he has at his disposal that's simply too mana-exhaustive to be practical for others to cast. He probably could cast the much vaunted "dragon magic" at this point.

It does make me wonder if its a potential weakness though. In chapter 26, Zach is able to knock the crown off Qual's head. Does that mean Qual lost access to his stored mana? He still would be magnitude 200+ ofc, but Zach has already shown to become exhausted during a battle, even with his doubled reserves.

I also wonder if the crown would work if Qual absorbed it into his body like he did with the dagger. I'm skeptical though, since if there would possible, it would be silly to risk leaving it on his head so that it could be knocked off like in Chapter 26.
