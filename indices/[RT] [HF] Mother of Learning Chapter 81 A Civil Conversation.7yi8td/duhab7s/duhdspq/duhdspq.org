Hey, that's an interesting theory! If QI is 'attaching' the dagger to his soul in some way the loop decides to carry across, it could be an indicator to QI about the loop. I doubt, however, both that the loop 'reset' would work in a way that carries to dagger across for QI and that it would disappear from the orb if it did.
