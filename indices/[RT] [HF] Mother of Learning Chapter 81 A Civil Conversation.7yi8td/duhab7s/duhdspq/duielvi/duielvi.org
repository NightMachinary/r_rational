The loop indeed does not work that way. It creates the entire world, including new people with new souls copied from the originals, runs it for a month. Then it destroys everything, killing everyone except the marked souls.

So even if a QI instance does something permanent to his soul, the next instance will have a newly generated soul without the change.
