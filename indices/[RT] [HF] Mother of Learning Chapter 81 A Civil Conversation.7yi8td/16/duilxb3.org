I love this chapter, especially as it highlights the impact of morality. Zorian is dedicated towards saving Cyoria as a result of the sum of his actions. This is exemplified by his hesitance towards using mind magic or soul magic on innocents.

Contrasting this attitude with the Zorian that exists outside the time loop shows just how much he has changed. I can imagine the previous Zorian arranging for himself to leave the country, with a minimal effort to try to get his brother Fortov to safety (so he can say that he tried).

In regards to the incoming war, I'm interested in how Zorian will react when it starts. Though it is unlikely that the story will cover it, it has repeatedly hinted that the current peace cannot last. Zorian might not believe that war will come but his perceptive is skewed. He has lived his whole life in the "eye of the storm", a peaceful intermission of the Splinter Wars, & the time loop has artificially extended this peace from Zorian's perceptive.
