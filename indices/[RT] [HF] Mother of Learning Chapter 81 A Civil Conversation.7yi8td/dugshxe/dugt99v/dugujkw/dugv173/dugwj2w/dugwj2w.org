Okay, so this is a bit of a stretch, I admit, but I think an even bigger stretch is that, as Zorian suspects, he got a functional copy of the marker broken in /just/ the right way to get around its copy protection entirely by accident. It sounds as likely as when you flipped two random bits in a binary and got around copy protection in a game without meaning to, which I believe would be vanishingly unlikely.

I envision the following scenario:

1. Everything is as it appears, Zach brags, the lich responds thinking exactly what he is saying, and then starts the soul melding process.
2. While he's doing that, he notices a weird marker. He examines it, finds lots of copy protection, intricate work not commonly seen. Then he remembers an old tale about the sovereign gate and time loops, remembers that the loop is supposed to start during planet alignment, which is exactly now, and puts the pieces together. "That would explain what the guy was saying even better. Can I get around this protection?" he wonders, and alters whatever he's doing to try to replicate the marker in Zorian whithout triggering the copy protection mechanisms. Being the best necromancer around, he succeeds. Zorian seems not harmed significantly.
3. Then he decides to copy the marker into himself. But first he needs to make sure that if he does something wrong, he will have another chance. So he tries to modify Zach to become his loyal servant / stamps some notes into his soul and adds a mental compulsion to visit him next time he wakes up / does something else invasive to Zach's soul that trips the anti-tampering protection that triggers a new loop.

Now, I'm not entirely convinced by this theory (this giant coincidence is the basis of the whole story and might be excused as selection bias -- we wouldn't even have a story if it hadn't happened), but it is narratively compelling as well -- seems like a neat twist. Though this latest chapter did lower my evaluation of the probability of this theory a lot.
