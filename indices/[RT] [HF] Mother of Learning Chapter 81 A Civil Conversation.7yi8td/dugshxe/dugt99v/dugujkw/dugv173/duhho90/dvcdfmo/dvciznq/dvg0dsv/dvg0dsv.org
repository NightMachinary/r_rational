To make sure the marker---including its function that monitors the Controller's soul's status and auto-restarts if his soul gets mangled or altered significantly---survives soul magic attacks, I would think. If someone attacks the Controller's soul and he's only got one copy of the marker on it, it's conceivable that the attack could completely destroy the marker before it can fulfill its function. If the marker is copied such that copies of it completely cover the surface of the Controller's soul, the only way it could fail is if the entire soul were completely obliterated at once, which is impossible because souls can't be destroyed by soul magic---only altered.

Maybe "self-propagating" would be a better way to describe it than self-copying.
