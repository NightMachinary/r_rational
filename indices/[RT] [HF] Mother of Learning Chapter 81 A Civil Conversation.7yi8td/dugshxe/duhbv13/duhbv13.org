He could still be aware of it. Just sees no reason to bring it up. He gains nothing by revealing knowledge to them.

If they are loopers then he can fight them and/or defend himself far more effectively if they don't know he knows. If they aren't then he also gains nothing by making them aware of the possibility.

We have no particular reason to believe he's being entirely honest, especially when he says that he doesn't know much about the special abilities of the crown. Which seems a bit implausible if he's a super powerful sorceror who has had it for centuries.
