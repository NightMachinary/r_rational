The author has commented several times that the series are divided into 3 arcs, all of which were /roughly/ equal in length. As the lengths of the arcs have been 26 (I) and 28 (II), and the third arc is now up to 27 chapters, it should be drawing to a close soon.

Although I personally believe the third arc to run on a bit longer than stated, mostly because there is a good deal of major goals left to adress before the story can wind down to a satisfying conclusion.
