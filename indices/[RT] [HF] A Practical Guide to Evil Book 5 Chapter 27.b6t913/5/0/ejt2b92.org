  I personally think Cat would have gotten a lot more mileage out of the "every body made here is one less on the line against the Dead King and potentially one more on his side" tack

I don't think she would have gotten anywhere with it. Malanza has to fight or, according to the Augor, Procer pretty much collapses from the inside. They can't fight against the Dead King if they can't function as a coherent organising body.
