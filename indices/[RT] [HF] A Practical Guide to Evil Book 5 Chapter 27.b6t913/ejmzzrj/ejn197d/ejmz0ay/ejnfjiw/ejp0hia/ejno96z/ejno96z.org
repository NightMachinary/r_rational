I personally think Cat would have gotten a lot more mileage out of the "every body made here is one less on the line against the Dead King and potentially one more on his side" tack, especially from Malanza, who was on that front until very recently. IIRC she did bring up a similar line to the princess earlier, but pushing here, especially after Andronike hit that pain point, might have worked in planning the "loss and retreat" farce a little more in Cat's favor. Probably she's right and Pilgrim wouldn't have stood for it, though, and would sic the Levantine more than half of the army on her during a retreat in good order, especially if it was a stalemate instead of an outright loss.
