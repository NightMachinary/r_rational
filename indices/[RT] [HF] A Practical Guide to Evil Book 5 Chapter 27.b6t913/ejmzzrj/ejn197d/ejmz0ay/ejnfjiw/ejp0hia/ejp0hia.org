  “Make your peace with it,” Princess Rozala said

So she wants Cat to throw a fight on purpose, lose however many men, all the while hoping she *won't* get backstabbed by a guy who has repeatedly tried to kill her *and* has happily broken promises that were inconvenient to him in the past... after *just* having the other hero try and murder her during parley... and when called out on this, her response is basically 'Get over it'?

What a pathetic pile of meat. I begin to see why the Drow call everyone else 'cattle'.

I guess it'd be too much to hope that /her/ crown will be one of the Seven and One? Because at this point, my sympathy meter for her just pegged zero.
