Just cleared 18k last night...and finally hit my first major plot point. The buildup may have been drawn out, but I used it to establish worldbuilding and develop characters/character interactions.

As I progress, I've become a lot more liberal with my use of placeholders, such as #charactername, or #thatthingImentionedduringtheintro, so that I can just keep writing without breaking my flow by going to check whatever it is, or spending time coming up with a name for a side character that just decided to show up. It makes for some pretty interesting scenes upon rereading. "I, #studentname, son of #mothername and #fathername, put forth 75 #standarddenominationsofcurrency towards my prediction of the #scientificnameforsomeflora being dead by the end of next #amIjustusingweeksormakingupsomeconfusingalternative."
