Thank you! As I mentioned previously, my goal is less to write a certain number of words in one month, and more to write a certain number of words /every day/, so as to create for myself a habit that will persist, in some fashion, beyond the month of November.

This is the first book I've written that I truly feel I'll be able to publish one day. Progress is awesome.
