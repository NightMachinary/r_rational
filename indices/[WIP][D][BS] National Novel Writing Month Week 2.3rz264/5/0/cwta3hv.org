The advice I've always followed is to start as close to the inciting event as possible. You want to launch into "the plot" as quickly as possible, because that (more than characterization and worldbuilding) is what's going to keep attention. One of the primary things I do when editing something that I've been freewriting is look for bits at the start to lop off.

I would guess that you /do/ have some bloat, since bloat is one of those things that editing is meant to remove and you haven't done much if any editing at this point.

As to the question of plot to wordcount ratio ... that's a little harder to answer, and I'm not sure it's a good metric because I've always been of the belief that it doesn't matter how much plot you cover so long as it's gripping (and plot progression is only one element of what makes a thing gripping). But I can look at what I have and give you that answer:

- Prologue (main characters are babies) covers about 6K words
- Early childhood (main characters are five years old) covers 20K words
- Middle childhood (main characters are ten years old) covers 12K words, though this needs to either be expanded or cut entirely
- Setup to the Main Plot covers another 20K words

I'm not sure that this answers your question though. The weird thing is, plot is fractal. You can take something like:

#+begin_quote
  Two dark wizards kidnap the princess
#+end_quote

And then expand that plot point out into a dozen others. That could be the plot of an entire novel, if you wanted it to be. You could easily spend tens of thousands of words on just /preparation/ for the kidnapping, scouting out the location and getting supplies, recruiting people, etc.
