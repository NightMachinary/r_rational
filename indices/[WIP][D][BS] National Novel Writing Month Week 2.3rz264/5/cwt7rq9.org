Okay, this is ridiculous. I passed 20,000 words today, and am still in the middle of my Inciting Incident, which only even started two thousand words ago. At this point my book is going to need 250,000 words, easy, if I keep up with this pacing.

Am I just writing a whole lot of bloated nothing, or is this normal? I haven't even been adding much description, just making some notes here and there and sticking my placeholder tag so that I can add it all in upon revision. I'd definitely appreciate some other people's wordcount-to-plotpercent comparisons, or some other form of assurance that, yes, sometimes your book is just going to be that long.
