The other one is going up whenever it's done. That one will be "On the Nature of Fame" (though that title might not stick) and acts as a companion to the one that got put out a few days ago. It focuses more on what's known about standing. I'll be writing it whenever I'm ahead on NaNo, or need a break from that. (And hopefully I'll have the formatting issues figured out then.)
