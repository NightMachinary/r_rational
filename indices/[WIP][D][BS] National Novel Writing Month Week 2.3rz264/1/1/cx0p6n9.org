Just encountered this story, and all I can say is I'm surprised this is the first time I've seen it, because it is really good. I have to say I like this slightly better than Shadows, mostly because I find these magic systems more interesting. More personal preference than anything; your skill as a writer is clear in both stories. Well done.

Rowan... I can't help but admire his determination, cleverness and work ethic. Of course, he's taken some big risks, over and over, and eventually that's going to cost him. But in the mean time, I really hope he becomes king soon, because he makes for a great antagonist, and I'd love to see how he shakes things up.
