Yeah, it's not super pretty right now. The problem with adding in more styling is that any styling which isn't done directly by Scrivener when I hit "Compile" needs to be re-added by me every time I put in an update - which right now means once a night. (The other thing that I really want is an HTML table of contents that links to anchors within the text.)
