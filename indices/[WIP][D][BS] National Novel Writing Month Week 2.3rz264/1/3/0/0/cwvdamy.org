You have python? I don't really know how scrivener works, but something like this might work.

#+begin_example
  """
  Template.html needs to have {body} somewhere in it. 
  {body} gets replaced with content from scrivener
  """

  #Define all the file paths
  template = open("tempalate.html", "r+").read()
  scriv = open("compiledScriv.html", "r+").read()
  output = open("out.html", "w+")

  #We'll use markdown to generate a table of contents.
  #This means that headers need to look like #ChapterTitle
  #Markdown will convert those to <h1> tags, and ##ChapterTitle into <h2> tags

  #Configure our markdown to use the "table of contents" plugin, and run it over the "scriv" text
  import markdown

  scriv = markdown.markdown(scriv, extensions=["markdown.extensions.tables","markdown.extensions.smart_strong","https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html","markdown.extensions.footnotes"]

  #Put the newly markdowned text into our template.

  formattedText = template.format(body=scriv)
  output.write(formattedText)
#+end_example

This will wrap your scriv html in another html file called "template" and run it through a markdown parser which will pass any existing html through, but will apply markdown formatting like footnotes and headers. It will also generate a table of contents based on markdown headers.

#headers like this

* headers like this
