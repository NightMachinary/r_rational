I'll look into it. It's been a few months since I've used any python. Mostly I just want to minimize the steps between finishing my writing for the night and putting the chapter on the web (which I guess means that I could wrap the FTP transfer into that script). I'll try to figure something out tonight to make the process better and more pretty.
