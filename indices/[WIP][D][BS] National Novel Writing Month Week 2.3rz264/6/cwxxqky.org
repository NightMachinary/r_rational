I basically need a double word count day today in order to catch up. This November is turning out to be a really crappy time for NaNo for me for two reasons; I'm working with two different clients that have very tight deadlines and both want to monopolize my time, and I took on an obligation to host a large D&D game in mid-November, which means that I need to finish writing dialogue and descriptions for that (it's Hogwarts themed and should be fun). On top of that, I have two lingering obligations for /Shadows/ that I'm going to have to put off, mostly because the thought of hitting deadlines at work and going home to hit more deadlines is enough to drive me nuts.

Those are my excuses for why I'm 1.5K words behind right now. NaNo isn't really about making excuses. I think I can catch up and get a comfortable lead this weekend, if things go well.
