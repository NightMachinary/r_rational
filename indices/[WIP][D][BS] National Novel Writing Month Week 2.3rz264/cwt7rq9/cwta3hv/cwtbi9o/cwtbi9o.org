Yeah, my first 18,000 is preparation - and character interactions ("Meet the Cast!"). Preparation for the inciting incident, that is. I wanted to have a lot of buildup to show how important the event is to the main character, and to have it be meaningful to the reader as well when it goes wrong. May have stretched that out a bit too much, but it really sets the stage for the entire rest of the story...

The world I have is going to be very unfamiliar to people, in terms of...well, everything. Odd geography/meteorology, the different races, flora/fauna, skewed levels of scientific knowledge. I kind of wanted to ease the reader in while at the same time using that intro period for the main character to do his prep, and get that buildup in tension. I'll probably end up slimming down this part a lot during editing.

I'm planning on ramping up the plot-per-word value after this inciting incident has finished, but there's just /so much/ that needs to occur for the main character to be where he needs to be at the resolution. I originally had this novel planned out as a trilogy, but each of the three were too bare plot-wise to really stand on their own, so I turned the trilogy into a three-act plot for one book.

Well. We'll see where I am another 20,000 down the line. Thanks for your advice! (As always!)
