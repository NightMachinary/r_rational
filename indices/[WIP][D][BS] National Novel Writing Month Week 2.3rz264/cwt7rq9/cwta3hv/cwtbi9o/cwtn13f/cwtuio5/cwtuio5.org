I think the fact that I've been working with the worldbuilding aspects for so long before I started writing sort of numbed me to the oddness, such that I don't feel like there's much going on in the beginning. From a new reader's perspective, it's probably pretty busy. And yes, there actually is a lot of marble, but it's sculpting /his mind/. Cue scary music.
