The only rule is whether or not it keeps the reader's interest. If it does, every sin is forgivable. Just write what you want to write and show it to some strangers (us being a good option) -- do it early, as soon as you can. If we're bored, cut. If we're going "MORE!", then keep doing what you're doing.

Take a look at Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. It's been a long time since I read it, but I don't remember anything particularly plot-critical in the first half book. (Which means about 300 pages, the size of a normal book.) Despite that, it was really engaging and swept me right along -- well, except for the first 50 pages, which were mind-shatteringly boring. After that, though, all very engaging.
