Well, looks like I am the poster child for the planning fallacy.

I had a great plan: finish /Induction/ in October, write a romance for NaNoWriMo, use December to edit both of those and as much of the two remaining 2YE novels, publish all of it. There was some wiggle in there due to travel for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but it seemed doable.

Nope.

I'm still not finished with Induction, which means I haven't even started the romance -- this is both due to it ending up being longer than expected and to me having some writing days that produced a lot of required backstory (usually "How does this power work"?) but little to no prose.

I will in fact have written ~50,000 words in November, but it won't be on the book it was supposed to be on.

Damn.
