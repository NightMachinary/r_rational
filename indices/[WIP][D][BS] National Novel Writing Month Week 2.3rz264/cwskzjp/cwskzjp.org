For myself, I'm caught up on my initial deficit and trying to move the plot forward. After one more minor timeskip (the third) I think everything will be in place for the pieces moving. As always, the most current copy [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html][is here.]]

Also, finished up the appendix for /Shadows/, which means that's no longer eating into NaNo time.
