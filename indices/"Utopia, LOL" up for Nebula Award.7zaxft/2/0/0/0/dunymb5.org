sure but I mean transhumanism has been a thing for a long time. Rational fiction and EY don't have a specific monopoly on any of the ideas in the story, nor are those ideas required to make it rational fiction. as a short story with pretty limited time for plot, few of the 'conventions' of rational fiction apply - ie. consistent rules and worldbuilding, intelligent antagonists, logical problem solving, application of methods of rationality or science, etc. You could say some of these are used a bit in the brief plot, but not in a way far off of anything, say, Herbert wrote.

I mean I liked the story, it feels similar to The Last Question a bit, but I wouldn't have said "now THIS is a prime example of rational fiction!"
