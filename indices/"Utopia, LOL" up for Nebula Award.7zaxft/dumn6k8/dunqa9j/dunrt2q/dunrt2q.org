I'd say Jamie Wahls working at MIRI and being intimately familiar with the genre makes a big difference. You can write things that are cyberpunk-esque back before cyberpunk was a thing, but it's not explicitly cyberpunk until both A. the genre is an acknowledged Thing, and B. you are aware of it and its conventions.
