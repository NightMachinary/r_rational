First, I finally caught up with ongoing, and this WN is awesome. Great respect to to the author.

So, I have a theory about Druids.

What we know about them is: a) It's safe to ask what they can do and b) It's not safe to ask how or profess your disbelief when they actually do it.

That sounds remarkably like a belief-based magic system. A druid can do things she absolutely beliefs she can do, her faith overpowering reality, and if she starts second-guessing herself (which is a possible outcome of questioning) her powers would diminish. And if there is someone actively disbelieving a feat of druidic magic, the conflicting beliefs might cause what Mage: the Ascension calls "paradox", and create a backlash for the caster, which, from Solace's story, sounds like a possible cause for the Druidic demise.

Have Joon actually played anything except D&D and it's improvised variations? World of Darkness is a massively popular system too, so I find it likely he at least researched it and knows about Mage.
