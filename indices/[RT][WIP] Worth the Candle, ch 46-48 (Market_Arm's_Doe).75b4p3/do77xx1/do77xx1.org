Sooo, Grak's companion bio was littered with dwarvish pronoun replacements. I wonder what the six eyed doe's will be, if there won't be any language mixing given that it's not bilingual. Bunch of onomatopoeias for snorting, bleats and mews? Or transcribing the six eyes' blink patterns into written form?
