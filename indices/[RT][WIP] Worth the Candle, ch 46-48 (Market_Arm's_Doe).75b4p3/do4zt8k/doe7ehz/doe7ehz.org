Grak x Juniper doesn't make any sense. Neither of them has shown any physical interest\attraction in the other. Grak looks identical to the classic male Dwarf and this combined with the fact that Juniper is as straight as they come (If he wasn't we would have known by now after so much time spent in his head) makes that romance option unrealistic. I also recall that Joon was disgusted by what he read in the book of blood about Dwarfs intercourse, and I am pretty sure that going from disgust to physical attraction is biologically impossible. Some things are just not meant to be, forcing it would personally ruin the story for me.
