Well, I never read Wheel of Time, but it's a bit of a common phenomenon... A Song of Ice and Fire felt that way to me, as well as the Malazan Book of the Fallen (though I read that one pretty fast, which means I'm kind of bad at telling what happened in which books, anyway). It might be a systemic problem of long fantasy. I'm not looking forward to the long wait in the middle of the Stormlight Archives :(
