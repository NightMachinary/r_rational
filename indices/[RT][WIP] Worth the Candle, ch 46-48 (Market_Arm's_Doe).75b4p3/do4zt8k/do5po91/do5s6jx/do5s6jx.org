My personal opinion is that Twig contains a whole lot of neat concepts and character development stuff. I initially disliked most of the characters, but with time, they really came to grow on me (which is when I became invested in the romance aspects).

However, Twig is also way, way too long for its own good. At times, entire arcs passed without anything "noteworthy" happening. Though the plot progressed, there weren't any "high points" which really felt like something. I think Twig would be far better if it didn't follow the structure of Worm so closely... while no arc could have been cut entirely, compressing some of them might have been wise.

So to answer your question: it depends. Are you the sort of person who regularly pushes through, when reading becomes a chore? Did you ever persevere through boring middle books in a far too long fantasy series and feel it was worth it? If you highly value your time, it's likely it won't be.
