First thing I thought, when I woke up, was a possible tracking method. Part of one. Maybe.

Remember that amulet that has one some ancestor of Amaryllis? What if Larkspur got an /old copy of Amaryllis/ at some point, in a similar amulet? It wouldn't be enough to know everything she knows now, but maybe it could figure out her plans with her goals.

On the other hand, the primary reason to be /here/ was because Juniper is dream-skewered. Did that slip out? Otherwise Past Mary has nearly no reason to model the real one here.

...but it would certainly make her angry. Hey, this time she can participate in her own rescue.
