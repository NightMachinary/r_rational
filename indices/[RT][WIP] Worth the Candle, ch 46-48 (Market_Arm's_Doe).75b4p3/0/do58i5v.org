This chapter set has increased my confidence that there actually are book-length themes, enough that I think it might warrant a post.

Book I covers up until the newly founded crew leaves the tower they went up, and I would posit that the central theme of that book is Death:

- The primary enemy are +zombies+ undead.
- Juniper administers last rites.
- Juniper gives backstory on his friend Arthur dying.
- For my money, the most "personal" kills happen in this book, as they're with characters who have been onscreen and had dialogue in at least a few instances.
- The nature of the afterlife is given.
- Literal souls are a focus.
- Juniper is left for dead.
- The book begins with Juniper's figurative or maybe literal death, depending on what the true nature of reality is.

Book III starts at the idyllic vacation home, and goes to present, and I think the central theme is Innocence (or maybe Purity):

- The unicorn, obviously, plus all the direct discussions of unicorns and their relationship to purity
- Grak talks briefly about having sex for the first time
- Juniper talks about losing his virginity and/or his first kiss(es)
- Two different D&D group discussions of innocence/purity
- Amaryllis is a virgin
- Fenn talks (very indirectly) about her first time having sex
- Less directly, the Six-Eyed Doe is a symbol of innocence and has magic that (sort of) runs on innocence/ignorance
- Less directly, Cranberry Bay was the first place Juniper made, from a more innocent time
- Less directly, Ropey is remarked to be innocent and pure

I think Book II is a little bit harder to pin down, either because it's less heavy on a particular theme, or because it's something even less specific. My best guess would be something like Cooperation/Defection or similar, but when I try to pin things down it doesn't seem like there's enough evidence without having to stretch, though there certainly things that I could point out on that score.

Symbolism is a little bit weird in this work, since Joon makes the majority of it literal by either claiming to have created it with symbolic intent in mind, or by recognizing the symbolism.

There are also obviously things that don't fit within theme, which are "only" references, digressions, or things like that, but this is my first pass at making thematic sense of the book.
