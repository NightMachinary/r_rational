Well, we have to break it down a little bit, because "theme" and "symbolism" are different but related concepts.

I do write with /theme/ in mind, at least a little bit, because I think of that as just being part of the craft of writing. A story is built of different strands (those of character, plot, and setting), and it's usually better to have those strands working in parallel, because that makes them stronger than they would be on their own, working at cross-purposes. If you wrote a short romance between two people, I would hope that their different circumstances and personalities /somehow/ relate to each other, and that inter-relation then becomes the theme that a lot of the work rests on, whether that's by contrast or complement. Personally, I think that you'll see a lot of authors write on a particular theme on accident, because that's the thing that they care about, and the avenue by which they naturally connect disparate things.

(Some of this comes naturally, which is when I think it's best; characters interact with each other, which reveals their differences and similarities, and the themes arise from that. Or characters interact with the plot, which makes them focus on the things that look like the plot for in-story reasons.)

/Symbolism/ is more complicated. In the sense of "X represents Y", I don't do that at all, because I think that it's hard to do properly without being heavy-handed and figuratively screaming at the audience, "do you see? do you get it?". There's a line about this back in ch 35:

  “Ugh, Jesus, please no,” said Reimer. “Please don't ask Juniper to get fancy. You weren't here for when we played Long Stairs, it was supposed to be this neat little dungeon crawl thing where we were army guys going into an endless fantasy dungeon in Oregon, but we just got constantly bogged down in these moral dilemmas and parallels to American imperial jingoism in the Middle East, or something.”

... but that's sort of it, because sometimes there are /parallels/, which I'm fond of, and you might argue that if things are sufficiently parallel, then one of them is, in fact, symbolic of the other, especially if that other is outside the story. This can be the case when the author is drawing on the real world for inspiration, as I like to do, and as I've often done in the past for D&D. I wouldn't ever do an "X is Jesus" story, but I'm familiar with the story of Jesus, and might us that to inform the story of someone I'm writing about, and maybe that's symbolism, from a certain point of view.

(Now with that said, this story is being written very fast, probably in the top 0.1% of stories by speed, which means that sometimes sacrifices get made, and the deal I made with myself was that symbolism was mostly not worth worrying about, and theme could take a backseat if the plot or characters didn't end up going quite in the direction that I intended them to. So I would expect for people to have to dig a bit for symbolism and theme to be a bit weak, since this is not a story that's been optimized for theme, nor edited down for thematic coherence.)
