There have been a few upward trends in Worth the Candle, so far. Given that I just binged Twig, I have a perspective to offer.

First trend: the number of party members is going up, which is somewhat obvious and expected. Let's hope this one keeps going because while the goldmine of Fenn's interactions with everyone else is far from running dry, further comedy goldmines are yet to be unearthed.

Second trend: every party member is less human than the last (or more nonhuman). First, we had Amaryllis, who's as human as they come, followed by a half-elf, a full dwarf and a six-eyed doe.^{1} I really, really want this trend to continue, because I adore the social strangeness of the non-human characters, and Juniper's sincerity and respect in interacting with them.

Third trend: the number and seriousness of romantic interests within the party has continued to rise. Fenn in particular is getting one romance upgrade after another. As the trends I observe grow more outlandish, my wishes grow more fervent. Please, for the love of all that's good and holy, let Grak become a viable romance option. That would be so utterly awkward and yet supremely heartwarming. I want to see how Juniper would handle Grak's social and cultural properties combined with his biological weirdness.

Also, the doe.

(I'm so sorry for my unrealistic expectations, cthulhuraejepsen. You will now have to live with the knowledge that any reasonable course of character development will disappoint at least one reader.)

^{1} Both Ropey and Solace mar the strict upwardness of the trend, but then again, they're not really companions in game terms.

EDIT: I guess I should elaborate why I even mentioned Twig: in my opinion, one of the best parts of Twig is that it's the only Harem Romance which I ever liked. (The jury's still out on how much Worth the Candle is going to have a Harem Romance plot.)
