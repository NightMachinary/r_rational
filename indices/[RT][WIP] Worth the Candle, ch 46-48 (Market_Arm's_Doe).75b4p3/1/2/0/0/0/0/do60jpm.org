It was what I immediately thought of, but yeah, I can imagine it's a somewhat common problem. I get the impression that the Wheel of Time is an especially bad offender, though that could just be because it's especially long. I haven't read the Malazan Book of the Fallen, but I hear good things about it. I don't remember feeling that way about ASoIaF, but it has been a while since I read it, and it's harder to judge the pacing of the series as a whole when it's not finished.

I responded with a joke, before, but I did really appreciate your previous comment and it confirms that Twig will be worth reading, for me, since I've plenty of time to stick with it. Thanks for that. :)
