I'm partly kidding when I say this. The term "Harem Romance" is strongly associated with Anime, and Twig does not use the corresponding Anime tropes for its relationships.

However, the general setup is similar: the protagonist has /three/ serious love interests. It's not much of a classic "love triangle situation" in terms of drama, but a lot of the romantic tension exists because the main character has some sort of feelings for all of them, which isn't easy to sort out.
