Have you read Twig? It's following a group of children/teenagers as they grow up and a lot of the focus is on the characters and the character dynamics. There's not a /huge/ emphasis on romance, but it's there and the relationships get messy. And the fandom, being what it is, latched on and made harem jokes and shipping charts, with varying degrees of irony.

(Here's the obligatory message saying go and read Twig if you haven't - it's easily one of the best things I've ever read, though it took a bit to get into it.)
