Let's hope cthulhuraejepsen won't feel forced to do anything because of stupid comments like mine :)

For an interesting fictional exploration of the interplay between disgust and physical attraction, read /Perdido Street Station/ by China Mieville. One of the central characters has a loving (and sexual) relationship with a woman who has a scarab for a head, and his primal disgust fuels his desire for her. In a non-fictional example, many of the less vanilla fetishes are inherently disgusting and some people argue that this is part of what makes them interesting to people.

I'm not saying that it would be a likely development in our case, but I think calling it "biologically impossible" reaches a bit too far.
