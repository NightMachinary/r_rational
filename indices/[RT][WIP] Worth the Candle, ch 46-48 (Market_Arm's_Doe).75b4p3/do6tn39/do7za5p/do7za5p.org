First Aerb society is not our global village. Not many care about private vendetta of one of the princes. Juniper can burn city to ground and genocide whole species, and still no one would care beside victims, their immediate allies and few morally motivated individuals . Because no internet, no press, no global economy, no global religion. Also any accusation from Larkspur and any of his appeal to the law would be considered in the context of his vendetta. Of cause he accuse his prey of all possible crimes, because that is what anyone would do in his place. What prey is actally did is not imortant.
