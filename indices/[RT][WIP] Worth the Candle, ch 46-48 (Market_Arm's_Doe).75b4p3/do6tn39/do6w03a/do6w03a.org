This was a "strike first so we can at least engage with the element of surprise on our side" type of thing. I'm not sure what alternate course of action you're suggesting? Waiting and hoping that Amaryllis spots Larkspur before he spots her, and then successfully evades him? Calling out to her and ruining the advantage of surprise in the hopes that everyone can run away?

It's already assumed, since ch 43, that Larkspur has both the power and motive to put out an imperial warrant for them, and might have already done so. This is mentioned explicitly in ch 47, along with a guess at how efficient such actions might be (i.e. not very, given the group's resources and a rudimentary level of paranoia about checkpoints).
