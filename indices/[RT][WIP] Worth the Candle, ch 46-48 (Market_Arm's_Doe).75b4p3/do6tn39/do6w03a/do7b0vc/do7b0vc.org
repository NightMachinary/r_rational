Juniper may not have had much of an alternative (for the reasons you give), but I read the comment made by [[/u/Arganthonius]] as suggesting that Juniper's and Fenn's overt acts of aggression towards Larkspur (and perhaps by extension Anglecynn) provide a perfectly legitimate and legal reason for Larkspur to launch a very public witch hunt against both of them without any obvious connection to Amaryllis or her disappearance.

Larkspur's first encounter with Juniper was at the Athenaeum of Bone and Flesh. Larkspur guessed Juniper's full name and expressed his belief that Juniper is a "travelling companion" to Amaryllis. His intelligence reports associated Juniper with Fenn Greenglass, and he knew Juniper was at the athenaeum to research an obscure disease from the Risen Lands ("rat rot").

Larkspur's second encounter with Juniper was in the city that is home to the Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny. Juniper was with Fenn. Witnesses would say Larkspur was ambushed by Juniper and Fenn, and perhaps the rest of the fellowship, depending on their involvement. By all appearances, Juniper and Fenn attempted to murder Prince Larkspur, Foreign Security Director of Anglecynn, in cold blood, and did in fact murder Leroy Castillo.

If Larkspur is in the habit of taking a probabilistic approach to guessing Juniper's future destinations, the other athenaeums might be near the top of his list, or at least the other cities in which those athenaeums are located. He might call on the athenaeums or those nations to aid Anglecynn in capturing and extraditing known fugitives, and anyone accompanying them. Places of knowledge and learning become places of danger.

On the first occasion, Juniper gloated to Larkspur: /“My guess is that your powers as a Foreign Whatever don't include going into an athenaeum and kidnapping or killing a random person there. I'm sure that you could make up some kind of story about how I was a dangerous criminal that you tracked down, or something more clever, but there would be an awful lot of witnesses, and my guess is that you're bound by politics just like any other Prince or Princess of Anglecynn is.”/ If the "random person" is a dangerous criminal wanted for murder or attempted murder (or even regicide, if Larkspur is a prince), maybe Juniper has now given Larkspur the power to do exactly that.

I encourage you to ignore all of this if you feel the slightest inclination to do so, as I love your writing and don't want to influence it. The above was just a bit of fun.
