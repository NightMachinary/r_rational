Yeah, I guess I see "there will be consequences", along with guesses at those consequences, to be part of reading and enjoying a work (or at any rate, at least reading and engaging with a work), and usually won't respond to those with anything more than "you'll have to read more".

Whereas if something is perceived to be a plot hole or character stupidity, then I do want to defend the work, or at the very least, get more information about what's causing the disconnect between my intent and the reader's interpretation, because maybe there's something I missed or could have written more clearly.
