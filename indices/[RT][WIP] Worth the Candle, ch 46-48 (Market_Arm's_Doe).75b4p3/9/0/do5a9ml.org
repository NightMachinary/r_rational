From Chapter 11

#+begin_quote
  I was looking her over. The fatigues she was wearing had no insignias or other symbols on them. She was blonde, roughly as tall as I was, and with a smattering of freckles across her face, marking otherwise pale and flawless skin. My eyes kept being drawn to her ears, which came up into long points.

  ...

  She smiled at me, and whatever she thought I had seen, her smile didn't really help me figure it out, because her teeth looked normal, if a little bit unnaturally white

Chapter 18

  She had a towel wrapped around her, leaving her with some modesty. When I looked at her arms, I realized that I had never seen them uncovered. She had keloid scars in precise patterns starting at the joint of her shoulder and running down to the middle of her forearm. They were curlicue, almost organic looking in their shape, but exactly identical on both arms.

Chapter 26

  Fenn was slender bordering on skinny, somewhat flat-chested, and not very muscular at all, though you wouldn't have known that if you'd taken a punch from her, because elves laughed in the face of muscle mass, and half-elves at least gave the concept a chuckle. I had thought her scarred arms were pretty, before she'd told me her story, and I still thought that they were pretty, beautiful even, but it was tinted with a sense of “fuck those elves for leaving their mark on you”, and I knew that neither part of that was something that she wanted to hear.

  I liked the freckles on her face, more now after days in the desert than when we'd first met, clustered around her cheekbones and across the bridge of her nose. I liked the shape of her ears, her slightly crooked and inhumanly white teeth, and it was all more than the sum of its parts, especially in the way that she smiled and joked. She was pretty, and I don't want to diminish that by comparing her to anyone.

Joon describes himself in chapter 2:

  (I won't belabor my physical description. My friend Greg had once said that I looked like someone had chosen ‘default' for every option in the character creator, which I'd tried to laugh at but cut kind of deep. I wasn't handsome, I wasn't ugly, none of my features were very prominent, my eyes were blue, my hair was brown, average build, average height ... After Greg had made his comment at one of our D&D games, my nickname had been ‘default' for a while, at least until I stopped pretending to find it funny, and even after that my friends would use similar lines to trash talk me, saying that I was “the most generic man alive”, “a white bread with skim milk motherfucker”, or “the human equivalent of vanilla ice cream”. Not that I was any less of an asshole to them.)

And I think we can infer that he's good looking, from varios characters around him. (Tiff makes a comment at one point, and Juniper himself mentions how dumping points into Phy has changed himself).
