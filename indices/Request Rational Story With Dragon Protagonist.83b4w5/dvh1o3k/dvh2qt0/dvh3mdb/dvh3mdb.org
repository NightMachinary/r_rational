She was a character from a much earlier book, the big bad at the end killed by the heroes, black wing was a prequel. She was always doomed to die.

I always felt it was a very successful re-envisionising of a bland evil dragon from the original book, really fleshed her out and made you root for her.

I'm totally grasping at straws here, but was her name Khisanth?
