No, that book is speculative biology rather than traditional fiction; not even really a story per se.

I'll quote Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  In 1982, Rankin/Bass Productions released a made-for-TV animated film The Flight of Dragons, aspects of which were based on Dickinson's novel. For example, the character design in the film bears a resemblance to the illustrations in the book, and its lead character takes his name from the author, Peter Dickinson. However, the animated film derives most elements of its story line from the novel The Dragon and the George.

Of course the incorporation of the "scientific" elements from Dickinson's novel is likely why the film feels more rationalist at times. There's a whole scene where the older dragon teaches Peter!Gorbash about dragon flight and he works out the chemistry of it.
