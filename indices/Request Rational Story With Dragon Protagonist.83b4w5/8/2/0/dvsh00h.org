I was under the impression that The Flight Of Dragons was based on the book of the same name.

(google)

Holy cow, it's literally an SI fanfic with Peter Dickinson (the author of 'The Flight Of Dragons' book) taking the place of Jim. Including using Trope Knowledge and everything.

Edit: at least he didn't play (voice) himself. That would have been too meta.
