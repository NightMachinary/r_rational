I'm not sure that's fair. I don't see any evidence that Dickinson was involved with the screenplay for the movie at all. Rankin and Bass certainly aren't known for feeling the need to consult authors in their adaptation of source material.

The complete lack of subtlety in the insert actually bolsters the position that it's not a /self/-insert.
