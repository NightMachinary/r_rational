Was that crack about knitting supplies you saying you've read the Pern series, or you saying you're not interested in it?

Imho the main characters are fairly rational in the two books I've read (first chronological and first to print), and they're at least good backstory for the Dragons Loops corner of the Immortal/Innortal/Infinite Loops collection of fanfiction.
