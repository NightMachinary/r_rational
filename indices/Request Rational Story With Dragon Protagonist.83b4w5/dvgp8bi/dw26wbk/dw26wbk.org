Thanks for the recommendation, I gave it a try, and it's not bad.

It has grim darkness of Dark Ages with all the gory social mores, a dragon protagonist that tries to do the right thing in a smart way, and awesome moments like [[#s][minor spoiler]], but it also has some strange moments like [[#s][spoilers]]

In my opinion, it qualifies as a rational story (with some caveats), but not really as a rationalist one, because protagonist consistently fails to see applications for technology he possesses and to learn from his mistakes.

Oh, and I personally found female characters to be somewhat insane, and protagonist as well.
