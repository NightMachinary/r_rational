The protagonist is not a dragon but you might enjoy the Temeraire series as highly intelligent but decidedly inhuman dragons play a key role. I personally think that the characterization of the dragons in this series is the best part as it is executed exceptionally well but does not overshadow the main plot.

The series is not marketed as an explicitly "rational" series but I believe that the world and characters created in this series meet most of the needed criteria.
