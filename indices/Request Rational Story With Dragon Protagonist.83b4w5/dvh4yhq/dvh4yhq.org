Have your read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632579.Dragon_Champion][Dragon Champion]] by E.E. Knight? It's been a while since I read it, so I don't remember how rational it is, but the main character is a dragon. There are six books in the series right now.

It doesn't fit your request as well and it's been much much longer since I've read them, but the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/50060-pern-publication-order][Dragonriders of Pern]] books by Anne McCaffrey has many dragons in it, bonded to the protagonists. I can't recall if any of the books are from the perspective of the dragons directly though.
