There was a parable about the use of capital where a dragon was either a imperial treasurer or a tycoon, who either way had his hoard made up of deeds for productive companies, that I was looking for recently. I haven't found it after more than a half hour later night/early morning googling, but I'm pretty sure it was posted here or on [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] within the last 5 years.
