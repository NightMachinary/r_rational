/disclaimer: This series is in Russian./

It has been quite a while since I've read it, but if I remember correctly [[http://fan.lib.ru/s/shumil_p/][/Слово о драконе/ by Павел Шумил]] (~550k words total) should either be rational or at least not have too many disqualifying bad writing tropes.

/(spoilers)/

It had technological uplift, colonisation of new planets, interdimensional travel (I think), some worldbuilding regarding the nature of the dragon species, etc.

The protag of the first set of books is somewhat MarySue-ish.
