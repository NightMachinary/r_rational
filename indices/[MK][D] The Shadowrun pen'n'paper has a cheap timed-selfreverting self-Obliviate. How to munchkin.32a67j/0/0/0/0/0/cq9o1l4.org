Ah, I found a different description in a sourcebook:

This adept power allows an adept to temporarily re- move selected memories for a predetermined amount of time with the use of a Complex Action. *While the memory is displaced, the adept has no recollection of the erasure or its contents,* rendering attempts at Intimidation, Inter- rogation, or mental manipulation spells ineffective, except for any physical trauma caused. Once the predetermined time has elapsed, the memory returns.
