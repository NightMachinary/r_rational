I think the biggest weakness here is that it is probably impossible to activate memory displacement without having some memory of engaging memory displacement.

In other words you can hide information, but you can't hide that you are hiding information, if someone looks closely enough, (and if it has as much potential as it seems to have, someone's done it before), the might be able to detect memory displacement, either by the missing memories, or the memory of activating memory displacement.

Do you have any canon examples of how it works?
