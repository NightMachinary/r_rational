  I'm super skeptical of the idea that the internet is a force for super-propaganda in a way the printing press isn't.

I think this perspective misses a few elements of modern communication that make it especially suited to "what you're seeing and what you're hearing aren't what's happening" levels of propaganda. The advent of social media marked the point where the same authority figures who so carefully warned about the dangers of Wikipedia began wholeheartedly embracing misinformation because its source no longer seemed to be a third party but /their own friends and family,/ a night and day difference neurologically speaking. Word of mouth existed before; A/B tested modern misinformation campaigns can update the message on the fly to specifically craft the lies to be more virulent. You don't have to check in at the end of the week anymore to see how the word of mouth is spreading; you measure it as it happens with Google Analytics. And it's /cheap./ He can do with 200 people what the KGB couldn't with 20,000 people.

But he is the first to this degree on the incompetence, narcissism and dishonesty fronts, and he's the first backed up by a Putin-funded social media machine.
