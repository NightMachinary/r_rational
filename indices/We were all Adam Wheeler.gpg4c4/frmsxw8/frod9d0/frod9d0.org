Yeah, I don't think it's so much that [[/u/sam512]] divined the future as much as his Antimemetics writings tap into a real-life source of horror and anxiety: two people in the same room given the same facts witnessing the same events can then recite two entirely different interpretations of those events, to the point that it seems that questions of object fact are in dispute. The man who wasn't there, the thing that didn't happen, the milk you KNOW you bought, the political candidate who it seems like ANYONE should be able to see is an actual inhuman monster.

I'll echo [[/u/valenciansun]] that the rise of 21st-century fascism is pretty squarely at the center of all these threads-- the war on truth, the disenfranchisement of science and scientists-- but one level deeper, here's what I see going on.

The printing press was at the center of a diaspora of diasporas. Writing permeated and influenced all subjects of inquiry, and looking at writing from the Macluhanian perspective, books are write-once-read-many-times, nearly entirely non-interactive, they require bulky physical objects to exist, and thereby their censorship always looks extremely cumbersome (book-burnings are hard to hide.)

When the internet and the world wide web first started to find their way out to the world, the read-and-write-often, interactive, non-physical nature of the medium made it difficult to censor, much to the excitement of hacker-libertarian-anarchist types, who envisioned a cyber future where everyone would have access to all the information they needed and the world would benefit in a nonlinear way from this educational, informational, transformational resource.

And for a while that's kind of what happened online, if you squinted a bit. The dot-com bubble burst was a blow, but it maybe helped the period continue a while longer where the internet was mainly for people who liked computers a little bit too much, and there was Wikipedia (which everyone's teachers and parents scolded wasn't a /trusted/ information source, so /be careful!/) and video games and a lot of blossoming creativity.

Then, Facebook and the iPhone happened. This got everyone online, which was a good thing as far as the hacker-libertarian-anarchists were concerned, but it also meant that the Internet went from this Wild West island of misfit boys to a propaganda platform for nation-states, and Vladimir Putin is the world leader who fully recognized and exploited the implications of this. Where Obama used the internet and cell phones to organize his supporters, Putin paid trolls to flood cyberspace with misinformation, and this is the failure mode the 80s guys weren't thinking about. Nobody was filling libraries with fake news because books are write-once, read-many-times artifacts with bulky physical presence. Misinformation online has no such limitations.

And that's how truth is crumbling out from under us, to the point we feel the physical sensation of horror when we realize our perceptions are fundamentally different from those around us. That's what Antimemetics draws on imho. The idea that a totally normal, familiar person sitting next to you could comment on how the BLTs are delicious today one moment and the next, casually, say gosh the clouds today sure are gootl for this part of the fleth but they're not sure about time, and stab you in the neck. Are they crazy? Or are we surrounded by things we just can't see? What else is invisible? What else do our minds throw away because they wouldn't be /minds/ if they didn't?

So President Racist Twitter says, there is no virus, it's all a hoax, and it strikes that same chord of horror, because they come from the same place-- the corruption of the internet over the course of the last ten years by an infusion of money to turn it from an informational platform into a propaganda platform.
