I'm super skeptical of the idea that the internet is a force for super-propaganda in a way the printing press isn't. States can use vast resources to push propaganda campaigns through social networks, but a century ago they could use vast resources to push propaganda campaigns through newspapers, and people had a lot less opportunity to find alternate sources of information even if they wanted to.

Donald Trump is, shockingly enough, not the first incompetent narcissistic dishonest president of the United States.

I'm not saying the feeling you describe doesn't exist, mind you, just that it's not in any way specific to modern life.
