Hard disagree from me, in regards to insight. Consider how easily you (seem to have) jumped to calling a large group of people, 'unrecognizable, alien, anti-human' But this is standard propaganda, hell standard psychology even. People have been saying such things about eachother since forever. I would suggest that having insight into such phenomena should allow you to avoid this pitfall.

And if course make you aware of a deeper existential horror. The fact that the same thing has almost certainly happened to you. You are human after all, and if you believe it's possible to trick humans into believing in such anti-human beliefs then you admit the possibility that it can happen to you. And considering the number of sources of such propaganda, what are the odds that you've avoided them all?
