Aside from all the issues of who beats who under what circumstances, you're forgetting the most important faction: the Protectorate. They're the strongest locally and have massive power they can call in. Any potential fight against other factions needs to be planned out to: be worthwhile (is the territory worth the losses), be winnable, AND not bring down the Protectorate.

Fight takes too long? Protectorate. Too close leaving your faction weak? Protectorate. Too much collateral damage? Protectorate, maybe even a national response.

The Protectorate are the ones in story that have to condone major faction wars for them to happen such as vs the ABB. They're also generally trying to preserve cape numbers, so cape murder would draw their focus. Later they lose a lot of power and get manipulated, but at that point things are overall breaking down.

Other considerations: ABB capes are powerhouses and have powers that lend themselves to larger fights. Bringing more people makes Lung stronger faster and Bakuda's bombs hit more people. Oni Lee is also a nightmare in larger fights with explosives and friendly fire, but is even more concerning if he's out assassinating people in daily life. E88 might be able to ambush them, but there's a lot of ways it could go very wrong.

The Merchants are too good at running and being annoying. They aren't worth the hassle to hunt down for bad territory.
