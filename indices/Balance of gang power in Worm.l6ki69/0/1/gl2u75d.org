The Merchants are a direct affront to Kaiser's stated values (admittedly, Nazis can be hypocrites), and as Skitter finds out, you can't hold territory without standing to protect it. As for the ABB, in practice they have a mixed record. Bakuda is sufficiently unhinged that she fails in an ambush against the Undersiders minus Bitch and under circumstances where Skitter is both reluctant to use her power and hampered in its execution. Effectively, she was fighting pre-fridge Grue and Regent (minor power only) with intel support from Tattletale and limited help from Skitter. While aided by a small army.

Oni Lee is more of a problem, but against the sheer number and variety concerned I don't see him winning. Oni Lee vs. Night and Fog? IIRC he needs line of sight to teleport somewhere. And of course Skitter knocks Lung out twice, bio/chem attacks being a significant weakness, and you'd think somebody would have figured that out with such a substantial problem staring them in the face. What happens when Lung breathes Fog? Has Stormtiger never tried to waft a whole tank of sarin gas into his airway?

As for escalation and the Protectorate, you have the problem that Bakuda and Lung's powers are both inherently escalating factors. Bakuda always causes collateral damage and Lung basically turns into Godzilla. The situation should at least have degraded to the point where it required PRT intervention some time ago. Some of Kaiser's obnoxious ubermenschen should have gotten angry and wiped out an ABB cadre, forcing retaliation by Lung taking out a couple of city blocks.

(this is sort of an omnibus reply, since I'm outnumbered in this argument; I think you cover most of the others' objections thus far, and apologies for those I've missed)
