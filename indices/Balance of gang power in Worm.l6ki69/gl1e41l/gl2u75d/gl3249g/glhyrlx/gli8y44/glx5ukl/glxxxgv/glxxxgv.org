1. I'm saying Lung's durability varies so wildly for story purposes that you can't stake a clear position on what would or would not take him down. I assume the Trickster-Ballistic scenario would snuff him (starting from baseline) because anybody who couldn't be snuffed by that would be practically indistinguishable from Alexandria and he doesn't get treated as quite that heavy of a hitter.

2. E88 still should have dominated through simple numbers--Lung can't be everywhere at once and isn't particularly clever or effective as a leader. Also, again, intrinsically escalating power. Kaiser, by contrast, seems perfectly competent at leadership.

3. Coil's whole schtick is to take over the city, which he does. He emphatically doesn't have infinite money; he dies because he runs dry and Tattletale can outspend him. If anything, he might have challenged the Empire via the Travelers, but they're very new to the area and have their own agenda.

However, the single likeliest outcome would still be Bakuda wasting her boss to take over. She can (don't tell me her bombs can kill Crawler but not baseline Lung) and she's certainly crazy enough to try.
