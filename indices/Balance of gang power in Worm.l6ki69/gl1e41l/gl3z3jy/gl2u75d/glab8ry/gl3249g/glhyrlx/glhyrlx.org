You appear to be going from the misconception that Lung's baseline is "normal human" and he gets stronger with his transformation, but he actually starts from a powerful parahuman with the inhuman toughness and rapid regeneration as a baseline and only gets stronger from there, to where he can rival Endbringers.

Also, Skitter didn't knock out Lung by herself. His healing was fighting off her toxins (he was defeated, yes, but not knocked out yet, the Undersiders ran) and then Armsmaster used his specially made tranqs which took him out

It's very much, kill him on the very first moment of the fight or you lose. He took a blow from Leviathan that destroys his bones and organs and was back into it moments later before being anywhere close to Leviathan's size. At half-leviathan size he could outheal Leviathan. He survived one of Scion's golden light blasts.
