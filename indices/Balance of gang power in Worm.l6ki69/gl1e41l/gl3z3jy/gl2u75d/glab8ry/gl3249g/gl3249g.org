Actually, re: Lung, a few other objections apply. First, it seems to me that another natural counter to Lung is to apply force so rapidly that he cannot be expected to grow bigger to compensate in time. Given Bakuda's talent for devices which do that, plus her instability and megalomania, I would expect Lung to have died some time ago.

Failing that, it may be that the ABB's natural nemesis is not E88 but Coil, because Coil has hired the Travelers. A fun Lung prank:

1. Find out when Lung is going to be outdoors at a known location, or arrange for him to do so.
2. Put Trickster on location in disguise.
3. Hire a small plane to fly overhead and drop a mannequin from a significant height.
4. Trickster!

This may be repeated indefinitely if it fails, varying the height to see what works best. Coil may use his power to deny Lung experience with these attempts, or just do it repeatedly and let him remember so he develops a crippling fear of appearing in public. If he does happen to grow bigger for the few seconds he's aloft, the beautiful thing is that gravity scales up against its opponent too.

(if Coil gets bored doing it with Trickster, a variant would involve Ballistic and a fully-loaded semi truck, but this has limitations)
