Another significant consideration would be that E88 are openly white nationalists and admirers of fascism. All of the strength that OP is describing is likely necessary to allow them to be a major player in Brockton Bay /at all./ Their willingness to be relatively passive is why they can remain a major player.

The need for strict cops-and-robbers is even greater for them because their optics are terrible from the start and they represent a /political/ threat to the status quo as well as a criminal one. The background of their group would be fascinating to explore as well as the idea of politically radical parahumans.
