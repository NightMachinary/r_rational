The Merchants I agree, it doesn't make sense that they haven't been plastered.

But the ABB is literally just Lung. Lung can take on the entire E88 roster at once and not lose. Lung fought Leviathan to a standstill until Japan sunk under his feet

He didn't win, but he didn't die either and against an Endbringer that's saying something.

Lung is an A tier parahuman. None of the other gang members are even B tier except maybe Bakuda, who is in his gang, and Othala who gets bonus points for being a healer. The next closest is likely Hookwolf, who is apparently super tanky.

The rest have generic ' only good at street level fights' powers. No major game changers.
