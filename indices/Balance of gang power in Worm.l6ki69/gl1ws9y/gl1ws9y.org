Does the E88 actually participate in organized crime? The ABB is stated to do all the usual crimes and has sex trafficking shown in the text. The Merchants are almost entirely characterized by how they relate to the drug trade. The E88 hands out cushy jobs at Medhall to compensate its toadies, but it sounds like Medhall's revenue streams are all actual legitimate business. There's a dog fighting ring, but even that seems like it's Hookwolf's pet project and not a major part of the organization.

It could just be that they're not really a rival to these other gangs in material terms. Beating up random minorities is core to their ideology, so they have to posture like they're actually fighting the other gangs for control. But at the same time, do they actually want to win the rights to sell drugs in a predominantly minority neighborhood? Or are they just going to make a show of force, move on, and then control of illegal activity in that territory goes back to the status quo?

Then again, Wildbow repeatedly mentions the E88 having "territory" or "turf," so maybe he assumed the E88 was actually doing something with it. Or he realizes they don't do anything, but Taylor doesn't.

Another possibility is that the E88 was always split into the factions we see after they lose their leader, so they didn't actually have the unified purpose and ability to deliver a unified strike that they liked to pretend they did.
