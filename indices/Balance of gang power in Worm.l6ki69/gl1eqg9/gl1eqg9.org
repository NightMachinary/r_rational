If I had to venture a guess, I would say that short of outright genocide there's no way to really eradicate every single other gang. What I mean is, we know E88, ABB, and the Merchants are the big names /right now/, but we don't know much about what Brockton Bay looked like five years ago. It could be that E88 has destroyed other gangs in the past. But there are still people in town who, being otherwise inclined to start or join a gang, can't or refuse to join E88. And there are still neighborhoods. Am I remembering right that Lung had a HQ in something akin to Chinatown? I can't imagine that E88 would /care/ what was going on there.

Ultimately, they're not really in competition for criminal market share, either, in a couple of ways. Firstly, in that people exist who want to do criminal trade (drugs or whatever) who can't or won't go to E88. Merch and ABB fill those gaps without actually taking anything from E88. Secondly, in that they might not be involved in the same - or all of the same - criminal enterprises. Again, consider neighborhoods. It doesn't do the Empire any good to try to run a protection racket in a neighborhood where they have no presence, so the others doing that doesn't cost them anything. If the Empire is all about prostitution, someone else selling drugs doesn't cost them anything. (Obviously this is oversimplified, but you get my meaning.)

So, yes, it would be entirely possible for the Empire to roflstomp the other gangs without much effort, but aside from their own prejudice and willingness to commit hate crimes there's not necessarily anything to be gained for them by doing so. Especially when running a cape-fueled gang war on that scale has a non-zero chance of attracting the attention of the Protectorate on a level that can't be swept under the rug. Even if they could survive that, it's the kind of thing that makes life very expensively worse, makes business harder to do (because they'll keep picking off your minions), and just overall a bad time.
