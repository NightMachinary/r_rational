I think you are somewhat misguided in labeling The Merchants a major player. At the start of the story Faultline, Coil and the Travelers are bigger players and the Travelers are ultimately Coil's henchmen.

I went back to 5.01, the chapter when all non-ABB villain factions in Brockton sit down to discuss the ABB, to check and I feel the pecking order is made pretty clear.

  Another group arrived, and it was like you could see a wave of distaste wash over the faces in the room. I had seen references on the web and news articles about these guys, but they weren't the sort you took pictures of. Skidmark, Moist, Squealer. Two guys and a girl, the lot of them proving that capes weren't necessarily attractive, successful or immune to the influences of substance abuse. Hardcore addicts and dealers who happened to have superpowers.

  Skidmark wore a mask that covered the top half of his face. The lower half was dark skinned, with badly chapped lips and teeth that looked more like shelled pistachio nuts than anything else. He stepped up to the table and reached for a chair. Before he could move it, though, Kaiser kicked the chair out of reach, sending it toppling onto its side, sliding across the floor.

  “The fuck?” Skidmark snarled.

  “You can sit in a booth,” Kaiser spoke. Even though his voice was completely calm, like he was talking to a stranger about the weather, it felt threatening.

  “This is because I'm black, hunh? That's what you're all about, yeah?”

  Still calm, Kaiser replied, “You can sit in a booth because you and your team are pathetic, deranged losers that aren't worth talking to. The people at this table? I don't like them, but I'll listen to them. That isn't the case with you.”

  “Fuck you. What about this guy?” Skidmark pointed at Grue, “I don't even know his name, and he's sitting.”

  Faultline answered him, “His team hit the Brockton Bay Central Bank a week ago. They've gone up against Lung several times in the past and they're still here, which is better than most. Not even counting the events of a week ago, he knows about the ABB and he can share that information with the rest of us.” She gave Grue a look that made it clear that he didn't have a choice if he wanted to sit at the table. He dipped his head in the smallest of nods in response. We'd discussed things beforehand and agreed on what details we'd share.

  “What have you done that's worth a seat at this table?” she asked Skidmark.

  “We hold territory-”

  “You hold nothing,” Grue answered, raising his voice, his powers warping it, “You're cowards that hold onto the areas nobody else cares about, making drugs and selling them to children.”

  “We sell to everyone, not just-”

  “Find a booth,” Grue's echoing voice interrupted him. Skidmark gave him a look, then looked at the others sitting around the table. All still, every set of eyes he could see behind the masks was staring him down.

  “Assholes. Puckered, juicy assholes, all of you,” Skidmark snarled, stomping off to the booth where his teammates already sat.

The Merchants are literally denied a seat at the table. The same table the Undersiders, a bunch of teenagers with one or two jobs under their belts, have a seat at.

The Merchants would go on to /become/ a major player, but only because they didn't show up for Leviathan and were able to exploit the damage inflicted by the Endbringer on infrastructre and other gangs. Even then, they only lasted a few weeks before being casually massacred.

Regardless, you are right that there is a serious imbalance in Brockton Bay. Empire 88 has more capes, and strong ones, then any other villain faction except Coil and Coil is deliberately obfuscating how many capes work for him. E88 even has international support from a nazi group in germany.

The ABB has been able to hold out against them mostly because, as others have said, Lung can stalemate almost anyone almost all the time and that is all you really /need/ when the PRT showing up will end most fights.

But it's important to note that the chaos in Brockton during the time of the story is essentially kicked off by the ABB making a power grab and getting crushed.
