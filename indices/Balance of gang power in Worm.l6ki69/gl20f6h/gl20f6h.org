Lung has demonstrated that he can take in entire cape teams all by himself.

There's also the fact that the E88 has no way of holding non-white neigborhoods without extermination. No amount of capes will stop the people from simply murdering gang members out of self preservation. Especially a Neo-Nazi gang that hates their existence and will only brutally oppress them. The only way the Empire could've dominated is if they weren't Neo-Nazis.

If the E88 did try they would quickly veer into the territory of actions that would unite Brockton Bay as well as maybe even bringing the greater Protectorate on them.
