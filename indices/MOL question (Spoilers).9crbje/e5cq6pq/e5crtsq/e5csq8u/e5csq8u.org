Because they're trying to implement one of those solutions before the loop restarts. At the end of the most recent chapter, Zach said to unbar the gate. Had the intervention not happened, they probably would have asked about any additional privileges they now have, and then work out if those additional privileges would allow them to transport all the marked people to the real world.

Similarly for the physical exit plan, they will do it before the current restart ends.

Where did you get the idea that they weren't doing it in the current loop? Zorian said that they were willing to leave the loop early, and that they wanted to do it now because if they didn't, they would have to wait more than 6 months before they could get the help they currently have from the people they recruited.
