If they get all the Keys to unbar the Gate, they can have the guardian place their souls into the real world. Not at the end of the time loop, but whenever they choose within it. So all the people who got marked would be able to have their souls put into the real world. Zorian discussed how for most people, this wouldn't end up doing any good.

For physically walking out, they would open a gateway between the time loop dimension and the real world. Since the time loop isn't a simulation, but an actual world created inside a living universe, they would simply walk out into the real world and be fine because they are ordinary physical beings. It *would* be the current people who exit.

I wonder if the additional connection to the real world would destroy the time acceleration effect. They mention a number of times how the only reason it can be accelerated so fast is that the pocket dimension is only connected to the real world at a single point. Opening up another connection, a far larger one, would change that and potentially cause havoc for a short while.
