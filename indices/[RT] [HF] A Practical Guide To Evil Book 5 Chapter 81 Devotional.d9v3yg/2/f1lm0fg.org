...oh. Kairos is implying that the Dead King is breaking the truce. Not a lot of heroes in Salia, and relatively small forces. Though he could attack anywhere in Calernia, couldn't he? Might be going for the weapon at Artoise.

Edit: Or the drow might not be attacking the Kingdom of the Dead. I mean, it's not exactly a nice place to live. Might've just decided to live in Twilight, maybe invade Arcadia.

Or the fae could be attacking. I mean, they just stole a chunk of Arcadia. And wasn't there royalty in that shard? One tried to hijack Cat's gate when she first took a peek there.
