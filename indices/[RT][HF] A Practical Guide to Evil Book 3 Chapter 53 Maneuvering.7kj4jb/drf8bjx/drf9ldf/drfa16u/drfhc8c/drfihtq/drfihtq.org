Good. I'm of a mood to see another Lord Voldemort (HPMOR version obviously).

Given his experience and power (he managed to tank a goddamn bitch slap from a Hashmallim and live) and given that his aspects are geared toward leading an army as opposed to personal power and finally given his expertise with Necromancy he's the perfect asset to have against a moron that employs an Undead army. Added to the fact that THE Warlock is also accompanying him and he is in a foul mood, Akua is fucked six ways from Sunday.

This will be good...
