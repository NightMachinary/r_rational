Can somebody tell me why Malicia hasn't asked Black to ask Assassin to pretty please slit that sexy Demon summoning wench Akua's throat?

Or failing that, Fasili and the higher command in Akua's army? If I had a tool like Assassin at my side, I'd use him to off higher command on a routine basis. Hell, that would be S.O.P.

I don't think wards or whatever Akua could dream up would be a match for the incarnation of Death itself.
