I really wonder how she plans to retrieve said weapon, being in Praes and all. I don't think Cat or the Deoraithe would be inclined to have Malicia possess the Gestalt based superweapon.

Phrased like that the only person that could conceivably bring the weapon back to her would be Black. So the Black Knight will be joining this theatre then?

This will be awesome!
