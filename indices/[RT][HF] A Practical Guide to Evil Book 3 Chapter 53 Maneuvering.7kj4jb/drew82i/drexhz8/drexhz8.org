  What did Akua do that was so clever?
#+end_quote

There's three contingents of Callowan militia coming to the battle, two of which have to march around Liesse to link up with the legions. Akua made a sortie against one and, when Cat sent a detachment to save them, made another sortie against the other, forcing Cat to choose one.

It isn't clever, just more strategically enlightened than expected from someone who is so adamant on acting like old school villains. Catherine merely outsmarted herself by betting on Akua holing up in her fortress and then losing that bet.

  What does Catherine's decision imply?
#+end_quote

She is leaving the Southpoole militia to their own device, choosing to save the Ankou militia instead. That will most likely result in five thousand dead Southpooleans. Her objective is to avoid Ankou's force getting wiped and killing Fasili, who is Akua's best general and currently in command of the undead army attacking the Ankouans.

  What was the trap they avoided?
#+end_quote

Fasili had his army march through the night to get there closer than expected. Had it worked, he would have wiped the militia and retreated before Cat's legions could get there. Meaning both militia detachments would have died at absolutely no cost for Akua, severely weakening Cat and making her look like an idiot. Our Squire felt it coming and so had her own army also march through most of the night to get there on time.

  What's going to happen to the Callowan reinforcements?
#+end_quote

The Southpooleans are dead. The Ankouans are going to battle against twenty-five thousand undead but, with three legions backing up, they may survive it. The third militia detachment is most likely getting to the main force unharmed, barring some bullshit from Akua.
