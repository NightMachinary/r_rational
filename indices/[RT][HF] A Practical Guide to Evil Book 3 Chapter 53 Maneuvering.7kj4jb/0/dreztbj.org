So it seems like the Named are split up. Hierophant is not part of the main group - preparing a countermeasure for whatever it is Akua's up to I would guess. Only Thief has been mentioned to be around with Cat so Adjutant and Archer are off doing a secret mission too?

It seems super risky to split up the group like that. Their combined combat prowess is a huge power multiplier and it feels like they can be picked off one by one if they're separated.

Cat fighting against the undead will be interesting to see - I wonder if she will be able to exert some sort of control over them. Death Knight hype!
