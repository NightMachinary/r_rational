  Caules was born into the Forvedge family as the younger brother of [[https://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Fiore_Forvedge_Yggdmillennia][Fiore]]. Though he had no interest, he began to study magecraft only to act as a "spare" for his sister. Despite his disinterest, it was a path he wanted for himself, and he was able to to do what was required of him to support the fate of their entire clan, simply to study his craft. As his sister became the head of the family and approached the highest seat of Yggdmillennia under [[https://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Darnic_Prestone_Yggdmillennia][Darnic]] after many months, he began to explore other avenues for his life rather than live as a piddling magus who would never accomplish anything. The Holy Grail War interrupted those plans, and while he was originally to travel to Romania as a simple backup, the [[https://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Command_Spells][Command Spells]] began to manifest upon his arrival. With no choice, he was to participate as a Master.
