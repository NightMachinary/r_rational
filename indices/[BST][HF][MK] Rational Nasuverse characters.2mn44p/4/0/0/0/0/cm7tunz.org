Yep. You could also apply it to a powerful biological computer in your own head. Combined with Thought Acceleration and Memory Partition (which are alchemical techniques that Shirou should be able to use) you could have one hell of a thinker. A protagonist severely limited magically, but smart enough to win anyway.

The question is, as always, what would a rational fast-thinking Shirou actually do with himself. That's what the story would be about, after all. There is also a distressingly small amount of canon material dealing with Atlas. Which is a pity, because it looks like the best fit for a rationalist Nasuverse story.
