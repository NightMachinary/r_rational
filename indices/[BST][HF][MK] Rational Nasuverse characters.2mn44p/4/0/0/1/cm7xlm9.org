I kinda think that Shirou is overused for Type-moon fanfiction. I mean that there is some many characters in the various side materials and side works, that it would be interesting to explore somone else though.

Shirou does have a clear backstory for how he got rationalist though, and it would be interesting to see an otherwise canon Shirou applying the rules of rational thinking. He is so perfectionist and mechanical in his thinking... I could imagine him being perfectly rational when he has time to think and plan out, but then acting like his canon idiot self and running in when push comes to shove.
