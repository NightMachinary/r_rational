For as long as he could remember, [[http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Caules_Forvedge_Yggdmillennia][Caules Forvedge]] [[http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1451-Fate-Apocrypha-Translation-%28no-spoilers%29/page130][Yggdmillennia]] had always appreciated magecraft, just as he knew that he would never manage anything truly great with it. His circuit count was low, he had no special sorcery attributes, and his much more talented sister had been selected to inherit the family crest. He had heard the occasional story of magi that turned out to be savants in particular areas although they were completely mediocre otherwise. So when his father finally lost interest in teaching him in favor of his sister, he systematically tried as many other systems of magecraft as he could. His family did have an extensive library, even if they themselves favored spiritual evocation. So he went through it, Astrology, Kabbalah, Alchemy, Shinsendou... he had found no hidden talent or special power within him for any of the major modern foundations. He went through the basics he had already learned, bounded fields, structural grasping, gradation air, if it wasn't clear already he simply lacked any particular ability to distinguish himself. Other magi might distinguish themselves by their ruthlessness, experimenting on humans subjects but Caules did not desire to achieve greatness this way.

As he entered adulthood, it occurred to Caules that perhaps he should simply look outside the moonlit world for opportunity. Had his family had a particular need for him, say with the Yggdmillenia's political conflicts with the rest of the association, he might have stayed even then. But as it was, their was simply more for him to accomplish in the mundane than in the magical.

The Clock Tower had fronts with which to grant its students with ordinary educational certifications. The study skills he had developed studying magic made passing the exams he needed easy. It was just a matter of choosing an appropriate area of research and educational institute. And apparently, independent research at the undergraduate level was uncommon in ordinary education, if anything, Caules thought he might be bored in his first several years of college.
