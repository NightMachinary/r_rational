  My reading is that they are outcome pumps with some weird optimisation criteria.

Yeah, my headcanon is that Alaya and Gaia are powerful and vast but not sapient or self-aware. Thus why they react to threats instead of engineering a situation where humanity gets off planet and spreads Gaia to other worlds.

  There is not enough information in canon to reliably model the CFs, so it's pretty much up to the author to decide how they will behave.

Yeah I will probably go with whatever interpretations fits the plot the best if I write a fanfic for it.

  that will cause Alaya to ignore it now?

I think Alaya's perception is limited to people's own collective perceptions, only forward and backward in time (thus resulting in precognition like effects). If no one ever perceives that an UFAI is threatening them Alaya would never be able to destroy it. Of course one single perception of the true threat UFAI in the future results in Alaya retroactively dealing with the problem. I think Gaia is similarly limited in perception. It need nature spirits and such to actually sense things in detail. Thus the UFAI just needs to hide until it has access to powerful time-travel and can beat Alaya's precognition... Sounds like a plot for a Terminator crossover.
