  The Counter Force would prevent activation of any unfriendly AI anyway.

That actually gives me an idea for a plot. The Counter Force should in theory be able to respond to both magical and mundane threats to humanity, but given how pervasive magic is, even degraded as it is, how does anyone really know it would respond properly to a purely mundane threat?

UFAI manages to get a foothold because lacking a magical component it hides from both Gaia and Alaya naturally. It has no magic of its own, and any attempt to gain magic will let Gaia and Alaya snuff it out. Even hidden from the World's natural direct detection, Gaia and Alaya can still indirectly sense it enough to disrupt it. The human characters would be pawns in this vast background conflict which threatens humanities extinction in a manner beyond the normal responses.
