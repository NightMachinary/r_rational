Isn't Alaya limited to the collective power of the subconscious of mankind? Although, the existence of Counter Guardian Emiya implies that Alaya exists in many possible worlds at once. So it seems to me that if one timeline successfully creates FAI, then it should propagate throughout Alaya in multiple other timelines. So maybe Alaya would have the knowledge, maybe not.

Alaya should be able to at least great some form of precognition, as indicated by Joan of Arc's revelation skill. It should also be able to grant peak human knowledge, skill, and intelligence.

So short answer is that it can empower you in extremely helpful ways, although probably not with specific knowledge. Maybe you could also make your end of the deal conditional on you succeeding in creating the FAI.

On the plus side, if you succeed, once you are a Counter Guardian, you could theoretically be summoned into other timelines where you could share your research and help them save their timelines additionally.
