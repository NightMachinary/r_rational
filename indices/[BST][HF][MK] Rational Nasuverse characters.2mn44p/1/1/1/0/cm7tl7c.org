  How smart is Alaya?
#+end_quote

According to canon, the Counter Forces are unconscious processes that somehow exert the exact needed amount of influence to prevent catastrophic events. My reading is that they are outcome pumps with some weird optimisation criteria.

  Is it doing intelligent forecasting, or is it precognitive?
#+end_quote

Judging by the access to the Throne of Heroes, the CFs are precognitive in some fashon. I'd say they see at least some neighbourhood of a timeless landscape around present day Earth. Honestly, I don't think Nasu had any strict mechanism of operation in mind when he wrote them, so their behaviour is kind of inconsistent.

  Is there anything a UFAI can postcommit to doing (after it analyzes Alaya) that will cause Alaya to ignore it now?
#+end_quote

Becoming friendly would probably do it, if anything ever could. Generally, the CFs deploy their big guns the moment shit hits the fan and after that no amount of postcommitment would help. At least that is how they would act if I was writing them. There is not enough information in canon to reliably model the CFs, so it's pretty much up to the author to decide how they will behave.
