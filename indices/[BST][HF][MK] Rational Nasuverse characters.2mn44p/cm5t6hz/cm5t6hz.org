Has anyone asked Zelretch to check that out? With his Magic he should be able to find out plenty of valuable info about this "end of the world".

The first way to ensure survival of humankind in Nasuverse that popped into my head is some kind of scenario along the lines of instrumentality from NGE. A unified will of all humankind would probably make Alaya powerful enough to defend it. You'd probably need access to Akasha to pull something like that off, though.

Alternatively you could do something sensible and boring like creating seed FAI and explaining the situation to it.
