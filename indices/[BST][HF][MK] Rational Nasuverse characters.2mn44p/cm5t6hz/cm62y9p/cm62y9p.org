  Has anyone asked Zelretch to check that out? With his Magic he should be able to find out plenty of valuable info about this "end of the world".

Not as far as any of the characters know in any of the existing Type-Moon works. Given the way magi normally treat knowledge, I would guess that if anyone has, they probably kept his answer secret. It does seem like the sensible sort of thing that someone who meet him would ask.

  Alternatively you could do something sensible and boring like creating seed FAI and explaining the situation to it.

That probably is the most straightforward and reasonable thing to do. How would a rational magus character leverage their magical training to aid in this? Atlas is described as having several advanced mental techniques, such as prediction and partitioning their minds, this would help with any type of research. Magi have probably probed the human mind much more thoroughly than psychology, this seems like another area to leverage.

  The first way to ensure survival of humankind in Nasuverse that popped into my head is some kind of scenario along the lines of instrumentality from NGE. A unified will of all humankind would probably make Alaya powerful enough to defend it.

Lol, given the way Nasu characters typically act this is probably what someone would try. It would probably involve some horrible ritual that endangers the world even as they try to save it.
