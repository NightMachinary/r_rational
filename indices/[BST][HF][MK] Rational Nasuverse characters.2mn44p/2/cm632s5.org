Thinking about Harry Potter, another munchkin idea occurred to me:

Develop a system of magecraft/thaumaturgical foundation with completely opaque and incomprehensible rules. Thus no matter how many people used it, its mystery would not degrade because no one would understand it. A spell creation/ritual creation method would have to be built into it, because no one would understand the underlying principles well enough to design spells from first principles... sounds like an explanation for canon Harry Potter existing in Nasuverse.

Of course, creating a new system of magecraft would be difficult to nearly impossible in modern times given the degradation of magic as a whole, but it might still be worth the effort.
