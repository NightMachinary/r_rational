Not bad.

Personally, I always thought that Shirou would be an ideal character for rationalist fiction. The only thing required is for Kiritsugu to pass on his mastery of "shut up and multiply" to him before dying. After that Shirou could probably figure out that the best way to go about saving people is along the lines of curing death rather than shooting people with a bow. At the same time he is broken enough to dedicate himself to this utterly. Plus he is a crappy magus severely limited in what he can do, which is always nice.
