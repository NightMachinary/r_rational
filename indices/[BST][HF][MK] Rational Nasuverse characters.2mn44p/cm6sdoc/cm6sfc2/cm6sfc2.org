Started this snippet without any plot in mind yet. Caules goes to college, decided to study AI, because of his magus training recognizes the need to solve for FAI, and then starts his own AI research organization sounds a little boring to me. Maybe his AI research attracts the interest of Atlas or some other organization... I need to think of how to bring it back into urban fantasy action.
