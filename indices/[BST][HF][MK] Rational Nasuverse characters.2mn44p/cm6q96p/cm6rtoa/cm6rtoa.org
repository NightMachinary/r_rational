It is possible that even though magical power is inherited, it is not based in genetics. I would guess some branch of the magus association probably knows. Even if their is a genetic component, if they couldn't find a way to boost their ability to sequence DNA and process that information with magecraft, they would only be recently figuring out what genetic traits correlate with magical power. And of course degradation of mysteries mean that any attempts to genetically engineer more mages simply weakens magic further.
