Maybe I'm A Lion is a really long Kara no Kyoukai/Prototype crossover fanfiction. Someone linked to it from [[/r/rational]] recently, although I had already read it up to its current point.

It takes a minor villain from KnK, Lio, and gives him the blacklight virus. Lio was already going crazy from having his origin awakened, but the blacklight virus craziness kind of cancels it out. Basically eating people and absorbing their memories lets him stabilize his own personality. Its not quite rational per se, but Lio and lots of the characters are introspective and self-aware, even as they carry out crazy goals (Magi vs. Demon Hunters vs. Blackwatch).
