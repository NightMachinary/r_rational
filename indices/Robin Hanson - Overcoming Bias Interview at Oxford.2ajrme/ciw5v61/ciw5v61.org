If you're gonna report stuff, message the mods with /why/. If you're about to complain that this sub is for /fiction/, well, ok, but there's a balance between having new rationalfic chapters to talk about, and having content on the subreddit when we don't.

And if you're going to complain that Robin Hanson is both epistemically and morally /evil/, yes, I agree, but we don't actually have a sub-wide rule against evil.
