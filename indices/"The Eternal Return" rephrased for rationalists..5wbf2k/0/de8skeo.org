I would go so far as to say even if you got to live the next subjective century in the simulated paradise of your choosing having it then repeated forever would /still/ be horrifying.\\
For someone like myself who feels the need for progress and is deeply uncomfortable with this sort of memory erasal, the idea of having one's memories erased and reliving events over and over forever is viscerally terrifying even without the extra terror of knowing that actually given the way you specified the scenario I can look forward to probably ceasing to exist once this simulation reaches its end and is replaced with another.
