Let me explain the thrust better then. The eternal return is a way to overcome the bias generated by directly asking the question "Does your life have value." By phrasing it in a way that removes you from the question that is really being asked. You don't think to yourself "Am I a person of value" and instead ask "Is the idea of living my life again as I have lived it a pleasant one? If I got to live my life again would I?" And in answering that question you discover if you are inherently valuable or if you must change to make your life worth living.

An insane syphilitic man more than a hundred years ago found a way to overcome the bias of his audience by getting them to answer a question they didn't know they were answering. You instead of simply reading the question and taking it seriously decided to rip on me because I posed an idea in a way you didn't recognize, not realizing that was the point.
