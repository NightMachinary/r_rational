If a, b, and c are all 10^{68,} wouldn't it be (10^{68)^{10^{68}}(10^{68)}} since "b" and "c" are discrete variables and...

Lemme just work this out with easier numbers...

(10^{2)^{10^{2}}(10^{2)}} = (100)^{100}(100) = 100^{10,000} = 10^{20,000}

10^{2(10^(2(10^{2}}))) = 10^{2(10^(200}) = 10^{200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000}

Those two ways of splitting the numbers give incredibly different results, and I'm incredibly confuddled. But I really don't think "(10^{68)(10^{68)"}} is equivalent to "10^{68(10^{68}})." Wait...

(10^{2)(10^{2)}} = (100)(100) = 10,000 = 10^{4}

10^{2(100}) = 10^{200}

Nope, still confuzzlated.

And Reddit really can't handle parentheses and carets used in conjunction.
