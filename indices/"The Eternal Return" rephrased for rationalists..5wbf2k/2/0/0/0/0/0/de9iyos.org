The formatting in your comment is really wonky, so I can't really tell what the expressions you're working with are meant to represent. In any case, let me try expanding your original number a bit more slowly:

#+begin_example
  (10^68)^(10^68)^(10^68)
#+end_example

Now, I'm going to place a set of dollar signs around the part of the expression that we're going to expand first, like so:

#+begin_example
  (10^68)^$(10^68)^(10^68)$
#+end_example

Let a = 10, b = 68, and c = 10^{68} . Then we have:

#+begin_example
  (10^68)^((a^b)^c) = (10^68)^(a^(b*c))
#+end_example

Replacing the variables with their actual values once more, we get:

#+begin_example
  (10^68)^(a^(b * c)) = (10^68)^(10^(68*10^68))
#+end_example

Now, let a = 10 and b = 68 again. This time, however, we'll let c equal the entire rightmost part of the expression (indicated with dollar signs):

#+begin_example
  (10^68)^$(10^(68*10^68))$
#+end_example

Performing the replacement:

#+begin_example
  (a^b)^c = a^(b*c)
#+end_example

Putting the numbers back in:

#+begin_example
  a^(b*c) = 10^(68*10^(68*10^68))
#+end_example

And so we have a final expansion of 10^{68 * 10^(68 * 10^{68}}).

Let me know if any part of that didn't make sense.
