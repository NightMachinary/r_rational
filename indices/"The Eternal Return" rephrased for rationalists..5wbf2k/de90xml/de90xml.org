I don't see how this is a problem. If the universe runs in cycles of "Big Bang followed by Big Crunch followed by Big Bang followed by Big Crunch followed by Big Bang ad infinitum," then it seems obvious that, eventually, after 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000^{100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000^{100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000}} iterations, the particular arrangement/organization of particles which we would recognize as "our universe" would occur again down to the atom.
