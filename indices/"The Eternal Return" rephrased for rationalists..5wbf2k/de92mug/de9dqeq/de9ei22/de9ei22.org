The main issue with your post is that it has no /thrust/. In effect, all you have done is plop down an idea in front of us, dressed it up in "rationalist" terminology, and said, "Discuss." All questions of plausibility aside, you have presented no reason that this particular scenario is one that is worthy of serious examination (except possibly "Nietzsche discussed it before"). Additionally, both the content of the post itself ("let me see if I can rephrase it") and one of your [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5wbf2k/the_eternal_return_rephrased_for_rationalists/de8qv3r/][other comments]] ("the question still seems to be phrased to create a negative bias") give me the impression that your main concern is with /phrasing/ rather than with /content/, and this response has only served to reinforce that impression. It's in this sense that I called your post "low-effort"--and that remains true regardless of how much time you spent on it.

Please don't misunderstand me: my remarks are not meant as discouragement, and if I came across as overly harsh, I apologize for that. But the fact remains that this post, as it currently is, does nothing for me--and given its current karma status, I think it's fair to say that at least a substantial fraction of this subreddit shares that opinion. This community tends to be a fairly open one, and I'm sure there are many here who'd be happy to have a discussion with you, myself included. Right now, however, that's a bit hard to do, mostly because /I don't know what you're trying to get at/. Clarify your meaning rather than mentioning how much time you spent coming up with this, and this conversation becomes that much more likely to be a productive one.
