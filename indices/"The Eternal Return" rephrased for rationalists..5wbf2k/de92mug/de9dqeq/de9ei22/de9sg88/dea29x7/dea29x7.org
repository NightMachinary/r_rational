'person of value' thought: If one assigns value to breaking new ground (treading new paths), or in the more common phrasing 'changing the world'(/universe), or even just 'discovering new things', then the situation as presented can be undesirable. --Specifically, the exact same lifetime can be treated as 'of value' if some of its fruits are retained for the next universe in a chain, and 'not of value' if absolutely nothing is left of it.

This can end up as a discussion of 'if each lifetime is inherently of no value, how can there be any value even in infinite potential influence?', a possible counterargument of 'lifetime of finite satisfactory value, the real prize being the value over infinite time outweighing any finite value', to which 'decreasing influence over time on reality after the end of personal influence', to which 'and /that's/ why reject death itself, aiming to always be existing and influential'...

In any case, (at least for me) the reaction to 'Your reality exists (and only exists, assuming it's a simulated-from-scratch universe not based on a real one with its own infinite future)' with a finite end of which nothing will remain' is 'Okay, let's devote every resource I have to cracking the system so that that's not the case any more' rather than deciding that there's a life I could live for which I wouldn't mind that.

...passing along memoreis or messages from one universe to the next comes to mind first, but the more tempting and realistic approach is to try to set things up such that my thoughts are encountered by someone during one of the universe-simulations ("This situation seems really controversial! Even if every single 'me' picks this same situation, I'm betting that the computer's user is going to pick this situation for fact-checking at some point, at which point they'll notice my giant really-convincing banner! Maybe! Best hope I have!") and eiher influence the outside infinite-future world in some meaningful way, or--better--open up a discussion with someone in the outside world, maybe giving a copy of me a chance to get out and do influential things in the infinite-future world.

...and if that world has an expected universe/multiverse death, again the raging against the dying of the light and trying to get to another universe/multiverse/[something] before the lights go out...

Gain through desire, gain through greed, gain through /curiosity/, gain through never allowing satisfaction, for apathy is death and a living gourmet of delicacies and stories is happier than a skeleton that feels nothing, a skeleton that used to be a gourmet for ten years no different from a skeleton that used to be a gourmet for five... rejection of the finite, rejection of the futile, striving for the eternal.

--Echoing another comment about identical programs effectively being the same: even if something takes place chronologically differently, if the exact same end--death, extermination, annihilation--take place then it's as though they all take place in parallel, leaving nothing. At least, when one cannot affect others, when there's no 'building', no changing-over-time like a single mind changing throughout phases of wake and sleep while inheriting memories from its prior self.

A world is snuffed out like a candle. Another world send out sparks of life to colonise and remember and feel joy. The one person dies, the other propagates. The one person sleeps an eternal sleep, the other picks up a new book and begins reading it with glee, always hungry for new stimuli. There are those who can be satisfied with a single lifetime, but if anyone survives past that boundary to represent our amalgamations of thought, curiosity, adventure--it will not be them.

I would rather be one of those hammering against that diamond wall, trying to be one of those who will break open a crack and get through, than be one who smiles at 'a life well lived' and then ceases all thought, memory, activity.
