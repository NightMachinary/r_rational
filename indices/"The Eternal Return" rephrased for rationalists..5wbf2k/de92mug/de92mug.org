Three points:

1. From a computational perspective, there is no meaningful distinction between a process occurring an infinite number of times and that process occurring only once. So from that perspective, the entire question becomes meaningless.
2. From a physical perspective, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem][Poincare recurrence theorem]] suggests that this could happen over the course of ordinary physics. If so, there's no need for demons or computer simulations--ordinary physics will suffice.
3. Giving a preexisting idea a new paint job does not appreciably alter any of the relevant features of that idea. If I find eternal recurrence to be a dubious concept, I'm not likely to change my mind about it just because you mentioned computer simulations while presenting it to me.

Overall, this post strikes me as somewhat low-effort, and as it is I don't think there's much productive discussion to be had on the topic.
