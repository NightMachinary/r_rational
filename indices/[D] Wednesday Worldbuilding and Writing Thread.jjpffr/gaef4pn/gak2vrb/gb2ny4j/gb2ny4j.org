I agree. Right now, keyblade users are at a pretty heavy disadvantage, especially because HP wizards have a lot of crowd control abilities that keyblade users don't have access to. Expelliarmus, in particular, would be devastating, but even Wingardium Leviosa could hamper a keyblade user.

Because of the gating costs of MP for keyblade users, I'd probably pick one or two changes from a few options:

- An equivalent gating mechanic for HP wizards.
- Heavily amped spells for keyblade users (because the standard spells are weaker than HP spells in general).
- Allow keyblade users to generally deflect /any/ spell, with a possible exception for "beam" spells.
- Fleshed out keyblade spells. We've got the three tier basic spells (fire, fira, firaga), but we should also add either new spells or different modifications to spells. For example, a typical fire cast might be a typical firebolt, but perhaps spinning your keyblade while casting fire does one thing while slamming the keyblade into the ground while casting does another, etc.
