Just to be clear I am not that familiar with Kingdom of Hearts.

But as I see it, it would be very hard for a normal Keyblade wielder to actually threaten a wizard, since the vast majority of wizard can just apparate out of range. Though this isn't a perfect defense, since Keyblade wielders can teleport too.

And as I understand it the magic in Kingdom of Hearts actually relies on magical energy, unlike Harry Potter magic which isn't more tiring than just saying words.

So just by fighting defensively for a while, the Wizard should be able to easily outlast the Keystone wielder before finishing them.

I think it would be best to just fully remove mp from Keyblade wielders, to balance things out and make their magic more like Harry Potter in regard that the hard part is actually learning it, while using it barely takes any effort.
