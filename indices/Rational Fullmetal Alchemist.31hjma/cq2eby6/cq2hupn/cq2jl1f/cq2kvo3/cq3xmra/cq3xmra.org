It is implied that the soul is bound to the original suit of armor in its entirety by the seal, and that only the original binder (Ed) can effectively transmute that. When Al lost pieces of his armor, Ed was able to fix it using transmutation, but noticably he was unable to restore the original mass; he is explicitly stated as having to make the armor thinner in order to fix the whole, and given that he is definitely smart enough to think of using another piece of iron, this means that the soul is bound only to the original suit, and that he can no longer add any mass to it.
