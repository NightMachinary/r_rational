--Yes, the limits are energy and knowledge. But what I'm saying is you should need far, far more than just knowledge of how to make a corresponding circle in order to work a transfiguration. Otherwise Alchemy wouldn't be so difficult.

--I know. I'm just saying, in most stories the soul has incomparable value, but in the Fullmetal Alchemist world, a soul can be equated to a certain (and very much finite) amount of energy.

--Even ignoring Wrath and Pride, a normal human can't do what the Homunculi can, no matter how great their alchemy. Especially since human transmutation automatically brings you to the gate. It's clear that the Dwarf in the Flask and all its spawn work with different rules from everyone else.

--Well, if you put several souls together they fall apart into a maelstrom of chaos and quickly lose all individual thought. The people in that particular stone could only be made to act again because much time was spent bringing their consciousness back to the surface.

Still, if it's just one person to a stone I could see them maintaining their personality. Of course their ability to do most things would be shot, due to being a stone that can probably barely move. All the same, that should be an effective means of preserving someone if you want to, there's certainly merit to it. So then it's not a matter of making stones to use for helping others, but that making stones is desirable in and of itself.
