Yes, the combat focus and reluctance to share research does seem to be a big bottleneck on actually getting anything done with Alchemy. But still, if all you needed were alchemical diagrams, you'd think more people would have caught on to more varieties of alchemy more quickly. I just don't get why you think the circle itself is so important. Yes, you need certain alchemical diagrams to do certain transmutations, but thinking that just getting the circle does the lion's share of the work for you just makes the FMA-verse woefully underoptimized when it would be so easy to change that. I said at the start, making things easier for no reason, when what you're getting at doesn't much bear out in canon, seems silly.
