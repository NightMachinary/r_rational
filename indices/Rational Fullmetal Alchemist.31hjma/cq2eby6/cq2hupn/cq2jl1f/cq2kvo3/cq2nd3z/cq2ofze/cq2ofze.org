- I think we might have different definitions of difficult; To a semi-experienced alchemist, preforming a new transmutation is not difficult. Becoming a semi-experienced alchemist is the challenge. Given that alchemy is portrayed as a science, it would be unsurprising to find out that sufficient knowledge of chemistry, physics, alchemic theory, and alchemic symbology is all that is required to do alchemy. Yes, it does fall flat from a narrative standpoint, but that's not the point I'm arguing.
- That's right, don't forget that this isn't a soul in the traditional qualia scene, but an extant, physical thing.
- We know that there are ways to brush up against the taboo. Mustang transmuted a human corpse, and medical alchemy is a thing. One might argue that the taboo isn't so much "human transmutation" as "soul generation". That way the homunculi pull a kubey and just keep their selves (and accompanying maton limits) in their cores. That leaves their bodies transmutable.
