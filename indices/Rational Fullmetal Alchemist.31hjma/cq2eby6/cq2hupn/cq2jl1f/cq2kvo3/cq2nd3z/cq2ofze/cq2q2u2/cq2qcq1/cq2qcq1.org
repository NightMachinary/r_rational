Let's not forget that most of the alchemists we see practice are using alchemy for combat. Knowing how to do other transmutations and using them effectively in combat are very different. Plus, some transmissions are better than others. Mustang uses fire because he is literally the only one able to do that. Armstrong uses an extremely refined muti-purpose circle. As for Kimberly, my headcannon is that beyond basic alchemy, he only has his explosives reaction. He's not terribly bright academically, but is an incredibly component combatant. Moreover, who's to say that independent researcher don't hoard developments? Master Hawkeye took his gaseous transmutation secrets with him to the grave, and the elric brothers aren't even surprised that Inzumi never taught them circle-less transmutation. And lets not forget that *all* alchemical notes are, as a rule, encrypted. Is that sad, yes, but also believable.
