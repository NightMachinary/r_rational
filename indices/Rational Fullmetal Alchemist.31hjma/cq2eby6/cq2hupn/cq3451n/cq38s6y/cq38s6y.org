Alchemy being powered by father's stone is debatable at best. The assumption made in the series is that father can use his stone to obstruct the alchemical prosses. Alchemy continues to function after he dies is fairly strong evidence for genuine geothermal energy.

On the other hand, a philosopher's stone lets you ignore circles and Scar's brother's alchemy discards them altogether.

There are no canonical elemental transmutations, and it seems like its impossible, especially given that there is no indication that subatomic particles are known.
