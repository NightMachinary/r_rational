I wouldn't mind the ironic cost thing so much, if Truth actually paid out what you wanted after taking his pound of flesh.

But instead of a human resurrection we get a mutilated zombie and a homunculus.

And there's no sign of /other/ alchemy failing to give you what you asked for, so if you don't get a human resurrection then we can only assume that this is a direct result of Truth fucking with your transmutation like "AHAH! Not only do you lose body parts but you don't even get the thing you were transmuting in return! Let that be a lesson to you about trying to overcome arbitrary natural laws that I just this second made up!".

And in my opinion, that /isn't/ an equivalent exchange.
