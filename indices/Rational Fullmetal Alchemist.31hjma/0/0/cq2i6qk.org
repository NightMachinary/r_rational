(I'm assuming you're being sarcastic here)

I agree that the setting has issues. The initial homunculus and the big reveal that [[#s][]] are big issues for the setting. Still, they could be related to souls being high energy identity constructs. Maybe human transmutation triggers some cosmic error code that queries the soul for a fitting punishment and also decrypts some of the admin data that they have access to.

If you weren't being sarcastic, my apologies for misinterpreting your post.
