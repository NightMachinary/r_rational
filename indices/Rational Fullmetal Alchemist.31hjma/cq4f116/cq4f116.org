"Ed, tell me more about alchemy. I've heard you say equivalent exchange a lot. But then you do things like throw up walls from nowhere, right when you need them, and clearly a wall you really need right now is worth more than whatever was there before and not saving your life."

"Well, Winry, it's kind of complicated. When you cook food, the food is better than the potatoes, raw chicken, and the fuel for the fire, but some of that comes from your skill. You've invested a portion of your life, that time is gone and paid, to learn knowledge about how to cook, what work to perform. For an alchemist, transmutations circles are kind of the same way. We burn away our lives in advance, studying, to learn specific tricks that may or may not be useful in certain situations. That time is gone from our clocks. It's spent, and irreplaceable. Each of the circles we learn to make perform a specific trick. We specialize, because nobody has time to learn every trick, and if everyone tried to learn all the simple tricks we'd run out of time to live before even making a dent. So we forge a path. Mustang studied for a very long time to learn to transmute against chemical stability, to split the air and water, to make oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen! Holy balls, free monatomic nitrogen. To shape the effect. That circle is on his glove. It's a seven hundred layer lattice he had to etch with individual threads of silk... That's way beyond my skill. I can't even strip wood into its component atoms and make soil from it. But I can make sugar from it."
