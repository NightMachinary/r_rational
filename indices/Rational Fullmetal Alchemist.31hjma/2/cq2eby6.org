I think that if you're planning on abusing Alchemy, you need to be really clear about what it can and can't do. Most of the alchemy performed in the series was pretty basic and obvious stuff, building walls, remaking clocks, etc. At worst there was just one degree of logic you had to follow to understand the conclusion. If you're gonna go into more exotic territory, you need to be very clear about the ground rules, and don't make it too easy for the protagonists.

Alchemy is itself a skill that is shown to be quite difficult to learn in-series, requiring years of dedicated research to really understand its principles and the composition of the world on a gut level. With just a few hundred alchemists around tops, that makes the world more consistent. If a useful application of alchemy hasn't been discovered yet, that's probably not so surprising; even low hanging fruit isn't always grabbed when there are few people to pick it. Which is a point in favor of FMA being a rational fic.

On the other hand, I don't feel like there's a lot of logical failings that the protagonists make. They're generally on the more intelligent side.

There is definitely potential for trying to properly exploit the FMA-verse, the obvious route is to have Edward and Alphonse not just give up on resurrection after their initial failure (after all, Edward did say while he was in the gate that they weren't wrong about their theory, they just didn't have enough knowledge). but I'm not sure if you could really incorporate that well into FMA's canon storyline.

Exploring the afterlife in some detail might be necessary to properly put things into perspective. It's ambiguous whether FMA has an afterlife or not, but if it does, then that mostly makes taking advantage of the stone ethically impossible. Otherwise you could just transmute people on the verge of death, then use the stone to help many more people.
