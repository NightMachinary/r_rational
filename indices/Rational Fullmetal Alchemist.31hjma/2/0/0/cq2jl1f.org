--If the core of the understanding is just in the circles, that would make it rather easy to figure out a very large variety of alchemic possibilities. There must be more to it than just that, don't you think?

--It is kinda quirky that the amount of alchemy a soul can do seriously gives you a value for a human soul. A human soul is worth "X" amount of alchemy. You could actually find that out, if you aren't morally concerned.

--If there's one thing that struck as more on the illogical side about the series, it's that a number of alchemists seemed to take "equivalent exchange" to be some sort of life principle, rather than just a rule of alchemy. I get how being so dedicated to a scientific principle could make you start seeing patterns like that in life, but life simply does not run on equivalent exchange.

--Alphonse's armor is curious. I can accept that you could bind a soul to something with alchemy, but that doesn't explain how it moves or talks. I presume it's just dramatic license in that regard. I do like that they established that it was both extremely difficult to pull off and not an immortal form, otherwise people would be all over that.

--Souls are also very strange things. Except for Alchemy and the Homunculi (which just seem to have random superpowers somehow), the world of FMA largely seems to operate on real life principles. So exploring the nature of the soul would be fruitful.

--But even if a soul is perfectly preserved as a philosopher's stone, they're basically imprisoned, unable to do anything (since apparently souls inside of Philosopher's stones can't move on their own for some reason, unlike the armor). It's kind of a fate worse than death. There'd be little point to keeping them alive at that point, so the dilemma still stands.
