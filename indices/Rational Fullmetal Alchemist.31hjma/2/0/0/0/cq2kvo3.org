- You would still need to know how exactly to parse the symbols and their meanings, but yeah, the only limiting factors with alchemy are energy and knowledge. I does explain Ed's knowledge of the periodic table and inzumi's approach to training
- You're getting distracted by the word value. A soul is worth some amount of energy (which may not be constant), but you have no way of knowing how much energy it takes to do a thing in alchemy, so that knowledge isn't terribly useful.
- totally agree with you on that point
- you misunderstood me, I'm asking why Al doesn't alter his armor, not why others don't do it. By worm standard self-propagating ferro-kenisis is ridiculously OP
- Well, Greed just has a pair of preset transmutations he an run at will (regen and armor) Gluttony operates on the same vague mechanics of the gate of truth. Envy just has very detailed self-transmutation. Sloth has optimized regen, and lust could have a reason behind her spear. Wrath and Pride are complete bullshit though.
- If they stay sane and are isolated from other souls, it seems that they can act, just look at [[#s][massive spoiler]]
