Oh, I guess I just thought of the circle and symbols as only being executable if the compiler could use the alchemists factual knowledge and experiences to define the actual meaning of each symbol and the order in which they are presented.

For example, if I were to write an equation for a sphere, cube, sine wave, or some other concept using a function I would have to make it as accurate a representation of the real world material as possible and have access to a known source of said material.

Then you would have to identify a possible source of those target materials and how much energy it would take to extract these materials for actual use and provide that energy in some manner in order to execute that command.

And in the case of processes, the same would also have to be true given whatever process you were trying to model would have to be as accurate as possible.

That in mind, it sounds like a really good way of testing the accuracy of different models of physical phenomena and extracting valuable materials if you use a more general equation with an unknown x value and some error margin that accurately takes into account the sizes of atoms while an almost perfect solid gold cylinder.

That might actually explain why alchemy never really came into its own until the early 20th century, because that is when things like atoms were proven to exist and quantum physics started to come into play and people had a sufficiently accurate means of modelling physical processes.

Kinda like how you have to travel at sub-light speeds to set up a stargate but once it's there you get there instantly.

So yeah, more basic material sciences would flourish while biological systems would still be extremely difficult to work with in general.

At least that's the simplest interpretation I can think of. The gate of truth probably just gets you to accept quantum theory at a gut level and take into account a more accurate error margin when dealing with different materials
