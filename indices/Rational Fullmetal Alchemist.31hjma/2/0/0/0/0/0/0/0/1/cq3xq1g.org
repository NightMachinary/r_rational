Alchemy is kept so guarded in FMA because it's dangerous. Really dangerous, more so than anything we have in really life. If you remember the scenes of the Ishval war, Mustang is shown destroying enormous areas (what appears to be entire neighbourhoods) instantaneously with no chance of injury to himself, and is said to have lain waste to cities in a day, which puts his destructive capabilities at or beyond nuclear weapons.

There's a good reason you wouldn't want how to do that to become common knowledge, and it's also the reason (as I've stated before) that alchemists are used as weapons instead of in R&D - there's no weapon you can make in 1914 that's going to be nearly as powerful as a man who can destroy a city with a snap of his fingers.
