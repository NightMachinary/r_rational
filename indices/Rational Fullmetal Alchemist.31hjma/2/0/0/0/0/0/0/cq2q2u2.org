--But if that were the case, you'd expect Alchemists to know all sorts of transmutations. Yet we see several alchemists (Mustang and Kimbley are the most obvious, but there are others) who only seem capable of one variety of transmutation. If learning different transmutations just took learning how to inscribe a circle, you wouldn't expect that to be the case. You'd also expect a lot of theft and hoarding of alchemical research. This does not seem like a particularly good development.
