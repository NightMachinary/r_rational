- Alchemy doesn't continue to function after Father dies, or at least it's never shown afterwards. The only Alchemy done once it's over is Ed opening the way to Truth, which is both a special case and based on the lost Xerxesian alchemy.\\
- Didn't his brother's arm tattoos include circles?\\
- I just think it's theoretically possible if you know about subatomics and can devote years or decades to converting that knowledge into a workable transmutation. Father does create a "miniature sun" briefly at the height of his power and knowledge.\\

Oh yeah, and it isn't any human transmutation that forces you before Truth, it's specifically attempting to retrieve/recreate a deceased soul that causes it.
