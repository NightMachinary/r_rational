- The source of the energy for Alchemy is a massive reservoir of souls/p. stone under Central, and the source of Alkestry is some kind of pervasive chi/lifeforce field. I'm not sure it's possible to power transmutation with energy sources from standard physics, despite Father's lies.\\
- They still have to make a circle, but they can use their own body for it, hence the clapping.\\
- I don't see why you couldn't engage in the classic transmutation of lead into gold, beyond the whole "understanding" stage being perhaps rather difficult without many years of R&D.\\
  Since Amestris is an aggressive, genocidal military dictatorship ruled from the shadows by an eldritch abomination and his twisted progeny, with it's elite forces and brightest minds powered by tormented souls...I think I'd like Winry to be the protagonist, and we can explore the oft-overshadowed human-machine interface technology that is automail.
