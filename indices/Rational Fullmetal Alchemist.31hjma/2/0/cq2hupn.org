My interpretation of alchemy is that:

- the source of the energy of the "transmutation" is deeply ingrained in the processes of mastering the art. meaning that you can't just switch from geothermal energy to the strong atomic force
- canonically the first step in alchemy was understating. To me, that seemed to be the purpose of the circles, and the reason that exposure to [[#s][]]. Any later steps relied on the definitions established in the circle, explaining why circle alchemy can create detailed and vastly varying results.
- however, the entire process of circles is ultimately a crutch, and can be circumvented with the application of sufficient energy
- equivalent exchange is just a poetic way of saying conservation of mass, "[[#s][]]" are expensive to transmute due to the energy involved and no other reason.
- [[#s][]]
- You can only alchemise constructs which you can perfectly visualize
- you cannot manipulate matter beyond the atomic level. no making new elements [] (#s "without a p-stone"

In my opinion, the biggest missed opportunity in the series is Al's armor. Why does it have to be human-shaped? Why does the core have to be so unprotected? But I wasn't talking about the events of the series, so much as the setting.

I'd say that there is no (detectable) afterlife in fma (remember this isn't the 2003 anime). the issue with transmuting people on the verge of death is that their minds are perfectly and dynamically preserved using the resulting stone would be literally killing them.
