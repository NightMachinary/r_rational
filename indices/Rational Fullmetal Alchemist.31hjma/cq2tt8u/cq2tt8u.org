In one of the early episodes of the 2003 anime (and probably he magna/brotherhood, too), Ed gives this speech about how he is a scientist, so Ed definitely thinks of himself as what we would call a rationalist. One could play that up. Though I wouldn't like it so much if they were to literally speak about 'rationality', that's too much like a religious tract. The world also fits very well with writing about science, philosophy and the people and institutions that do them, a bit like Anathem (the book by Neal Stephenson).
