/The very same/ lute and flask? The ones that Catherine can recognize? Even her Aspects are more malleable (since it looks like the Name "the Wandering Bard" reflects specifically her ability to Wander in asnd out of existence, which implies Miraculous Ministrel or Troubadour might not have had it, or at least had a different form of it). The only thing that bothers me more is how nobody noticed yet that all the Bards ever were female. I know she had tampered with the records and the elves pieced her identity together long ago, but you'd think in a progresive work such as this one she'd be allowed to identify as a bard in a male/female body, with less emphasis on the biological attributes that don't necessary pass over to the next incarnation.
