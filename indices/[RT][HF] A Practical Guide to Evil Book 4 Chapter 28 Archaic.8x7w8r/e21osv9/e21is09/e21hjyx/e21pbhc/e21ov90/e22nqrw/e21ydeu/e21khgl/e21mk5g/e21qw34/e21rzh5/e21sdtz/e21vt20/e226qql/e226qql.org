Nah, what I'm talking about is that since the Bard has been around forever, she's been around long enough to have had some influence on her Name. That or it may be one of those “how you think of yourself influences your appearance” thing that Names have (Like how Cat is always short and has a limp, Masego being fatter/thinner than logical, Black and crew being younger) except because she's been around forever she's stopped thinking of herself as who she once /was/ and only truly identifies as the Bard, meaning that the lite and flask are the closest thing to a proper self-perception she has.

Also, maybe the random teleporting to story-relevant locations is inherent to the Bard Name rather than being an aspect? Idk, Bard herself breaks a lot of Name rules
