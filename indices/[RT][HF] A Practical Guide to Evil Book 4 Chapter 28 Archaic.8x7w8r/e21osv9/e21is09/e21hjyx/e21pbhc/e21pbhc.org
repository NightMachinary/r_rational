The bard is either a god, or a creation of the gods above and below, meant to keep the story going forever. Whenever /either/ side is truly losing, she's there to rebalance the scales. She isn't a hero, she's just recently been acting like one because the Black Knight's new kind of villainy is a genuine threat to the conflict between good and evil.
