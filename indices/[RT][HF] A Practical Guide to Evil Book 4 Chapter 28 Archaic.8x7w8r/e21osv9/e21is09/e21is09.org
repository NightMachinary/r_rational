Wait, fuck, that means that the Bard /predates/ the Dead King? Was she attempting to make him take up a mantle from the heavens? Maybe he did, and maybe him being a powerful sorcerer allowed him to notice that his choices were being ripped from him, and in a fit of revenge and rage, he became the opposite of what Bard wanted him to be, the first of Bard's mistakes...

Or maybe that was part of her plan all along...
