I'm starting to get AI-in-a-box vibes from the Bard. Black inspires the same sort of feeling except that he's less of a threat because he makes it very obvious that he's hostile to being in the box and that every move he makes is about redecorating the box to be more to his liking and/or burning down the box.

Bard, however, keeps popping up in places and doing things that an ordinary role player in the story has no business being/doing - like the guy who shows up at a house party, introduces himself as a friend of a friend and then you keep finding him walking upstairs or out into the garage, but he insists someone told him it was okay.

Not openly hostile in and of itself, but speaks to a motive that's not exactly above-board. Or maybe the proper metaphor is a story-teller who's realized she doesn't have to tell the story exactly as its written. Or a journalist whose realized they can twist the facts to fit their narrative.

It feels like she's operating in a blindspot of the Gods Above and Below - maintaining the cover/Role of the Bard who monitors the narrative and pushes heroes/villains in the right direction, but actually pushing them to some other, possibly cataclysmic end. I feel like when the Bard's endgame is revealed it'll make both Akua's Folly and Malicia's gambit to sieze it look like child's play.
