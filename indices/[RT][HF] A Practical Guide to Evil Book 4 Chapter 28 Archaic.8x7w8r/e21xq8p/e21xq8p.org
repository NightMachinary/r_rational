  Among those present in the great crypt where the entombment took place was the young man I was fairly sure became the Dead King. Not because of anything he did, but because of who was talking to him. The face I didn't recognize, I'd admit. But the shoddy lute and the flask? Those I'd recognize anywhere.

Dead King could have been created by Bard.

My theory that "Good" Gods are just faction of Evil Gods is getting some support.
