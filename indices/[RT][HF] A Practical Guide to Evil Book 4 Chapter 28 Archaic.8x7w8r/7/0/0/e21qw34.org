Names are bound to stories, and are shaped by the culture they originated from. However, Bard has been around since forever, and I think it might be /because/ of her meddling that she keeps some aspects. If the first Bard had a lute and flask, then the second one might also get one and so on and so forth until the lute and flask become a part of the archetype.
