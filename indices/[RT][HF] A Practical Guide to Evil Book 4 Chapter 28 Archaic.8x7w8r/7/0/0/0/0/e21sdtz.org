You need to remember that the world is progressive /because/ Evil is a thing. Good is very much founded on “moral” views. Evil on the other hand is more socially progressive due to being both batshit insane and more pragmatic. How on earth can someone in-setting be sexist/homophobic when a large number of the fucking terrifying dread emperors/empresses fit in that category. Hell, of the major characters, the only ones that are openly racist are “good” guys (/cough/William/cough/).

On your other point, you need to remember that some Names only appear in certain cultures (Like Warlord for Orcs), so it wouldn't be too weird if some Names belonged to one sex. Especially if they belong to a body-hopping eldritch abomination whose whole purpose is to fuck with the story.

In addition, it's highly likely that Wander is an aspect inherent to the Bard Name (Like Learn was to Squire) due to the fact that it's heavily implied that there's only one Bard who's constantly body hopping (If it was unique to this Bard, Black would definitely have made note of it). Along with that, the only people who know what Bard really is are either Genre-savvy (Black, Malicia, Tyrant), long-lived (Saint, Pilgrim) or have narrative breaking powers (Hierarch). To a normal peasant she'd just be another Bard.
