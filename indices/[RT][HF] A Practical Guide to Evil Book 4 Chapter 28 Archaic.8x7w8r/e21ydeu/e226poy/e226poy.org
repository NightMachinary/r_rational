Crazy plot twist: Triumphant was a Bard from Wolof that accidentally ascended the throne of the Dread Empire, and had her brains shorted out by the Role of a mad tyrant the same way she had her normal behaviour was overridden when she was stuck in a schemer Role while talking with the Hierarch. Then she kept escalating and making infernal pacts, until she ran into an obstacle she couldn't just throw demons at - the Tyrian sea. It even fits with her final "Why not?", since the story of a madwoman running everything into the ground doesn't have that many ways to go, and a smallest initial impulse would be enough.
