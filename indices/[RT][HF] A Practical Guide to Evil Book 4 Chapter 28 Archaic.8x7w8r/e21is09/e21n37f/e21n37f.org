Probably part of the plan. Every story needs a villain. And what better villain than one that is way too powerful to die but is plot-bound to never be an actual threat to the status quo? A sort of Sauron-in-a-jar whose mere existence binds the rest of the world as Good just for balance.

That kind of bullshit has Bard written all over it. Nope out of that story right now, Cat, because nothing good will come out of it.
