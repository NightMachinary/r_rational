Are you sure about that? Why wouldn't he write a rational Where's Waldo fanfic? That actually would be kinda fun to read now that I think of it. An interactive rational fic where you have to find Waldo, and Waldo does more interesting and plot relevant things to try to hide himself, and you have to use actual evidence to find him rather than just searching in a crowd where he'll be hiding in plain sight.

...I want to read this now.
