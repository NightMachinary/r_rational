Erm, fanfiction that lacks the theme and flavor of the original work is hardly something new, even in the rational/ist genre. /Luminosity/ lacks the theme and flavor of the /Twilight/ series. [[/u/alexanderwales]]' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][rationalist!/Frozen/ fic]] sure doesn't keep to the original.

I'm not even sure that HPMOR /really/ maintains the theme and flavor of the /Harry Potter/ series. Certainly, it disposes of the themes, and as far as flavor goes it doesn't /read/ like a JK book.
