Nice scene. It stands pretty well on its own, but I'm interested to see where it goes from here!

The Spritelog format isn't ideal for AO3. In the absence of panels, we have no physical context for where anyone is - it's a shame to invoke the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeaturelessPlaneOfDisembodiedDialogue][Featureless Plane Of Disembodied Dialogue]] when Rose's Land is such a pretty place. Jaspersprite's text is also quite hard to read, especially mixed with Rose's text to form a solid block of pink. Hussie got away with it because he's Hussie and people expect him to be weird and eccentric (and because there aren't many long conversations between Jaspersprite and Rose).

Rose's thesis is quite right and could be the beginning of something really excellent. Her reaction to it is telling, and reminds me of the deuteragonist of CORDYCEPS: when trapped in unfamiliar territory, her paranoia becomes omnidirectional. She is driven to do the most dangerous thing she can think of, on the basis that everyone is telling her not to do it - /so what are they hiding?/ I love it, it fits her canon character and pretty much summarises the reasons she went grimdark in Homestuck proper.

(Edit: It's also telling that she doesn't re-evaluate everything Jaspersprite said once she's determined he's untrustworthy. Rose isn't entirely the rational protagonist she thinks she is!)

I wonder how the other kids will react. John might not follow her chain of logic, but he gets worried about his friend's mental health. Jade - at this point in Homestuck - trusts that Skaia knows what it's doing, and this Rose could come to see her as an agent of the enemy. Dave would affect an ironic uncaring facade about the whole business, to hide his real feelings. But that's just my interpretation. You may feel differently.

I wonder how this Rose will react to the discovery of ectobiology, and the revelation that she is herself a game construct. Not good, probably.
