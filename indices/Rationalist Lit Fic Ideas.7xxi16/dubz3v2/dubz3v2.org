As a lit fic reader, "no social commentary" as a term of the definition of lit fic seems bizarre, if not bizarre enough. "Lit fic" as we know it today evolved from the 19th century tradition of literary realism, which was almost always political, if not in the one-sided American culture war polemic sense. I'd adjust 5 to "if the fiction has a political stance, the reader should be able to deduce it on the strength of their own critical thinking skills without the author yelling it in their ear (treat it almost like the solution to a murder mystery), and have some grounds on which to appreciate the story even if they don't agree with it."
