This is a weirdly narrow definition of lit fic, especially the "no fancy psychology" and "no social commentary". For example, To The Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf is, I'm pretty sure, classified as literature. It is /packed/ with social commentary and weird psychology, with unhealthy people and deaths and dysfunctional families and delusions and just overall /weird/.
