Rational Lit Fic is a contradiction in terms.

Lit Fic is a /meta-style/ of writing in which the focus is on e.g. literary metatextuality, philosophy explained through otherwise mundane narrative, and insight into an 'ordinary' person. Lit Fic is an English professor committing adultery, or an Irishman going to a funeral.

Rat Fic is a /meta-style/ of writing in which the focus is on e.g. scientific literacy, psychology, problem-solving, learning, and often exemplified in a non-mundane narrative, etc.
