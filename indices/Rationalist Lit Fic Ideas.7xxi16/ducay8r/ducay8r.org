  1. No fancy psychology. No PTSD/DID/Sociopathy/Psychopathy/Schizophrenia. The protagonist's inner world should be healthy and mundane most of the time.

  2. No social commentary. Even if the readers want to believe the fiction has a political stance, they should have a hard time finding the evidence, if there's any, from the texts.

Huh? I fail to see how either of these conflict with either rational fiction, or lterary fiction.
