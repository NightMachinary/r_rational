I've talked about this before. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7mvsux/d_rationalist_fiction_that_takes_place_in_the/drxftmr/][tl;dr]], no "rational fic" can possibly be more rational that history itself, so there's no real reason to read rational fiction set in the real world, as opposed to just reading biographies or non-rational fiction set in the real world.
