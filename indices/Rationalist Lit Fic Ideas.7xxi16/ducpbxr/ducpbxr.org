This is similar to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7mvsux/d_rationalist_fiction_that_takes_place_in_the/?st=jdqaasyo&sh=80f0afb0][this post]] I made a little while ago. Though I was a bit less restrictive with my criteria. I have a story in mind which takes place in reality and adheres to your principles (1) and (3) but slightly violates or bends (2), (4), (5). If I ever write it and post it here, you can be the judge of whether the slight violations payed off in a highly interesting story. But I do think with enough creativity you could make an interesting story within all 5 constraints (the post I linked contains a more detailed answer).
