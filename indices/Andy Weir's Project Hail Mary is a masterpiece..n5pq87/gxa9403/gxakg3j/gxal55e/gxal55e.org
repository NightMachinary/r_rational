Thank you for your response. As I said, I do wish to avoid getting into a thorny discussion here. To answer, though, I'd say: like a woman whose behavior makes a lot more sense if she's regularly getting high doses of exogenous testosterone. Describing what that particularly /means/ is probably beyond the purview of this place, but I expect you can fill in the blanks.

And no, I had no issues with /The Martian/. I expect women who become astronauts to be brilliant, fearsomely competent, and have the hearts of lions, not to mention already having been selected for unusually-high risk tolerance.
