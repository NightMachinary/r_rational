Yes, yes, yes! I came here to find people who love this book and I am not disappointed!

I loved The Martian (Like, literally my favourite book I have ever read) thought Artemis was good. I decided when I first heard about Project Hail Mary I would want it so when the release day cam I bought an ebook without reading the back flap or anything. I basically just knew it was a space book, "the fate of humanity rests on a lone astronaut" or whatever.

This book was amazing! I have been recommending it constantly to all my friends for the last week and I barely slept one night I was so engrossed reading it.
