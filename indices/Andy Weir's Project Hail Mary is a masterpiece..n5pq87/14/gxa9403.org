Let me be up front that in accordance with the standards of this sub I do not wish to cast judgment either way or discuss politics, /but/: Offhand, how woke would you say it is? Does it go out of its way to portray women acting like psychological males with no one seeming to notice how odd that is? Did you get the sense that the author was working his way down a diversity and inclusion checklist? Some people like these things and that's okay; personally I'm getting fairly allergic and would appreciate a heads-up.
