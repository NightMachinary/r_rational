I'm definitely with you on that. I loved The Martian. This was a huge disappointment to me. Everything was cliche to me. The stakes were so high yet there was no suspense and no urgency for me at all. The main character felt like an outline. The entire novel felt like a redo of The Martian. I thought it was too long and too drawn out. I had to force myself to finish it. Rocky was cute and charming at times but nothing we haven't seen/read a million times before. The jokes and puns never worked for me. The science was ...there. In The Martian the science was interesting and readable. I found the science in Hail Mary to be a slog and eventually annoying. I just couldn't connect to this one at all. I noticed the shoddy writing whereas in The Martian I didn't..I was so captivated by the narrative. Everyone seems to love it though so I'm definitely in the minority here. Just wanted to give a different opinion on it. I was really looking forward to it too. I hate bashing a novel because the author put a lot of time and effort into it and it's much more than I could ever do but this one just left me cold. Weir has another success on his hands and will make a bundle off it and the eventual film adaptation but I'm baffled by the spectacular reviews. Clumsy and forgettable and in need of some serious tightening for me.
