Just finished. Relevant data: I really liked the Martian and also could not get more than a few chapters into Artemis. I quite liked this one, though. Very reminiscent of the Martian in its basic loop (problem -> do mad science to it -> new problem caused by mad science), but with unique wrinkles of its own.
