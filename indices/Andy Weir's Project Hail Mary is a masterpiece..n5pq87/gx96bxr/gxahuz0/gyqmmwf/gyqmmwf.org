Near the end of the book they said that Hail Mary's atmosphere was only 5psi. Running a pure oxygen atmosphere at 5psi, just like the early Apollo missions did, makes sense. It only becomes dangerous when pressuring it to 20psi on the ground for testing, which is what caused the Apollo 1 fire, but that shouldn't be a problem for a spacecraft that is assembled on orbit.

I did find several other "errors", however, including Grace sending a wax model to a ship he knew was hot, Grace being excited when he thought Rocky's biology didn't use water but showing no disappointment when he found out it did, Stratt assigning Grace the task of putting together a list of replacement science officers but Grace later having to ask Stratt for the list when they meet to choose a replacement, Grace trying to figure out whether 20,000kgs of methane was enough to get home while completely ignoring that he'd need 80,000kgs of oxygen to burn it (which he wouldn't have on his 120,000kg ship), Grace's shoddily repaired chair somehow surviving the second bought of high gravity (and Grace positioning himself in the worst possible way, head down, instead of lying on the ceiling), etc.
