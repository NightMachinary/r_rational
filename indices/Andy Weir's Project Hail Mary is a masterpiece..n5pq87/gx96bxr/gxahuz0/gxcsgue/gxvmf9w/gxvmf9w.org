Rocky says that the ratio of Oxygen to Ammonia is 29 to 1. Grace then interprets this as Erid's atmosphere being 29 times Earth's. But Rocky would have sampled the air from the Hail Mary, which only had 1/5th the pressure as Earth since it was basically all oxygen. So wouldn't Erid's atmosphere be more like 29/5 times Earth's?
