Late to the party, but this guy NAILED it. I willingly listened to the audiobook all the way through - I mostly listen to audiobooks when driving long distances when I physically can't read paper. I actually preferred the audiobook performance (and kudos to the audio engineers who worked on it), especially for his monotone superimposed over a musical tone filter that Rocky the Eridian communicates with and the overall cadence and inflection of his delivery, but I had to span it out during downtimes or tedious work at the office so it took me about 2 and a half weeks to finish on 1.5x speed. This has to be the closest voice that Andy Weir had in his own head while writing the novel.
