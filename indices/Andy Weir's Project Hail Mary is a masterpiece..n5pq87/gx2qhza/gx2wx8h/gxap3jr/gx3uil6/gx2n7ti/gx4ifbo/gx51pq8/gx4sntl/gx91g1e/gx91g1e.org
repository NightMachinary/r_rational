I picked it up on your recommendation, and enjoyed it very much! Thanks for posting about it! I started reading it around 10pm, had to force myself to go to sleep at 2:30, and finished it the next day.

I'll throw my hat on the 'hard recommend' side for anyone on the fence. (Enjoyed The Martian, never tried Artemis due to reviews.)
