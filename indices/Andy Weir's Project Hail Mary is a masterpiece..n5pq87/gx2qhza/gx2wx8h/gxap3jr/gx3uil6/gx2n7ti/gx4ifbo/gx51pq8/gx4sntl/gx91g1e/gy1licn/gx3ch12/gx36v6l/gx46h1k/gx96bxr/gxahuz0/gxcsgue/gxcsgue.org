  It's a process, and I think PHM does a great job of demonstrating science and rationality as processes even if they aren't being applied to real-world situations.

Yeah I guess it has some not completely bogus representations of the kind of work that scientists do and how to think through problems but so did the Martian and for me personally none of that was new information. I was disappointed that I didn't come away learning more about actual exoplanet and astrobiology research and instead just got a bunch of hand-wavy made up stuff.

  Also, The Martian stretched things a bit, too--"hab canvas" was basically unobtanium, and the inciting incident--the Martian storm--was not realistic at all.

Sure sure, but that was fairly minor in comparison to the completely made up new physics that forms the basis of the entire story in this book.

  the atmospheric comparison between the Hail Mary and the Blip A was...odd. Why would Rocky assess the Hail Mary's atmosphere as primarily O₂ rather than N₂? Were they really pressurizing the Hail Mary with pure O₂? If so, that would make the Blip A's atmosphere only 7-10atm, not 30.

The Hail Mary was using a low pressure high oxygen atmosphere. This is normal for space travel. Apparently the challenges of a high oxygen atmosphere are seen as lesser than than the challenges of higher pressure, maybe due to the extra material and thus extra weight required? I can't remember the details but I think it was specified at some point at least exactly what pressure the atmosphere was at.

  3D printers absolutely work in zero G, assuming they were using an FDM process--which you obviously would, /because they work in zero G./
#+end_quote

Well you could maybe defend optimizing for something other than "works in zero G" if you want as much versatility as possible but yeah it seems odd. If it's a metal 3D printer (I can't remember) it's less odd, as they were doing the whole "only using proven off-the-shelf technologies" and I don't think there are any non-powder off-the-shelf metal 3D printers except for WAAM which requires some non-trivial post-processing for fine detail that isn't generally compatible with spaceships.
