Given that terrestrial Muslims don't pray on inclined planes facing varying degrees of down, we can infer that prayer particles ("orations") can't penetrate the Earth's crust but /can/ undergo atmospheric reflection similar to certain radio frequencies. This makes Lunar Salaat problematic since A) the earth will be blocking line-of-sight to Mecca about 50% of the time and B) the very ionosphere which helps propogate the signal on earth could interfere with it from space, even when you /can/ see the Arabian Penensula.
