It is very similar in style to The Martian but because it concerns itself quite a bit with things that are more just fiction than actual science-based fiction it's not as interesting. The Martian was an interesting story where you learned a lot about Mars and what it would take for humans to exist there. This story is like that but with a fraction of the learning about anything real.
