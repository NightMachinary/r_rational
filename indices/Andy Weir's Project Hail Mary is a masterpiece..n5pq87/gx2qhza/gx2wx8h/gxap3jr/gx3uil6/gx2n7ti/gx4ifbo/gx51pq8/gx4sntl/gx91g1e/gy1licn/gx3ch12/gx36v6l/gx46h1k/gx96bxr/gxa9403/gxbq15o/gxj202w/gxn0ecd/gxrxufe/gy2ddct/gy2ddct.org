One question I had

Surely the astrophage only takes over a star if there is a nearby planet with a CO2 atmosphere, otherwise they cannot breed. Does this imply that *all* nearby stars have such a planet? Seems quite unlikely.

Also why he didn't send back at least one Beatle when they first achieved Venus-friendly astrophage makes zero sense to me. They do not have spare time, and frankly something could have gone wrong at any point!
