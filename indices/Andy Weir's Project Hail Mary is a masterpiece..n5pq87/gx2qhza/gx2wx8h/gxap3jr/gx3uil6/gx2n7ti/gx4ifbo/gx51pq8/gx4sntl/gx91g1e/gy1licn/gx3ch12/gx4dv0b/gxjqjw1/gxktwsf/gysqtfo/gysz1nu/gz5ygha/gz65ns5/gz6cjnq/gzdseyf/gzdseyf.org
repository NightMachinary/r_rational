I expected it would be his ship that failed again, but I did guess the ending otherwise. It was definitely way better than Artemis. I think I would have enjoyed it more if Artemis never existed.

When I was young there was practically a whole genre of "first contact in deadly alien environment" novels, where the human and the alien have to cooperate to keep one or the other or both alive. I guess they are out of fashion these days.
