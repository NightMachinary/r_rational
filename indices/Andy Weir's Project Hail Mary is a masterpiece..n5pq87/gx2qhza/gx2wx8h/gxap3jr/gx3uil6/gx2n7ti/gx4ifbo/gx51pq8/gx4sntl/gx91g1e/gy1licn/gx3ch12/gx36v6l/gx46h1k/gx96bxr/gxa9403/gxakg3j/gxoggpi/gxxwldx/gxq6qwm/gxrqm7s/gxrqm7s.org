  What book would you recommend that isn't woke and/or doesn't discuss politics? If it's rational , even better.

Highly, highly, highly recommend Neal Stephenson's /The Diamond Age/. One of the premises of the world is that the blank slate hypothesis is fundamentally true, which frees up the author to isolate and explore all kinds of cool stuff regarding culture and education. There are two major female characters, one of whom is a brilliant, ambitious, /psychologically normal/ woman that I like a lot, while the other is... well, psychologically exceptional, but for good reason, and the world and other characters /notice/ this about her, which makes it all work for me.

Probably my favorite book of all time.

If you do try it out, I'll issue a standard warning: It's one of those written from multiple character POVs, one per chapter, and relatively early on in the book one of the POV characters dies and is replaced by another. I've seen this throw off any number of people trying to get into the book, since it's sci-fi and losing a solid foothold like that can be challenging for the reader. OTOH, everyone I've warned has gotten through it just fine and loved the book. So, hopefully forewarned is forearmed! And do let me know how you like it.

Despite accepting for the sake of the argument what is perhaps the core of leftism -- that is, blank-slatism -- it is decidedly non-woke, and its politics are (mostly) solidly fictional enough to not be obnoxious.
