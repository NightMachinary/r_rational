I see where you're coming from, but I think I disagree. Yes, the premise of PHM is a lot further outside the bounds of known science--it's a lot more speculative--but I think it depends on what you're looking for. Science isn't a collection of facts, nor is it technology. It's a process, and I think PHM does a great job of demonstrating science and rationality as processes even if they aren't being applied to real-world situations.

Also, The Martian stretched things a bit, too--"hab canvas" was basically unobtanium, and the inciting incident--the Martian storm--was not realistic at all. The movie did an even worse job of Martian wind.

In PHM, the only errors I caught (outside the "we don't know how this could work" alien technology) were that

A) the atmospheric comparison between the Hail Mary and the Blip A was...odd. Why would Rocky assess the Hail Mary's atmosphere as primarily O₂ rather than N₂? Were they really pressurizing the Hail Mary with pure O₂? If so, that would make the Blip A's atmosphere only 7-10atm, not 30.

B) 3D printers absolutely work in zero G, assuming they were using an FDM process--which you obviously would, /because they work in zero G./
