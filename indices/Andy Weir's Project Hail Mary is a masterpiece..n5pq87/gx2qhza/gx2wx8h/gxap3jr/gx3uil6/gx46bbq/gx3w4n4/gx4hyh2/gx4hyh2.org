I honestly can't remember if I read this before, and it bothers me a bit because I had a similar idea before, except for the "becoming a god" thing, and now I'm not sure if it was original or came from this. Not to say that I believe this is reality, but this was my favorite answer to theodicy after reading unsong, partly inspired by that "one-electron universe" idea. It answered two of my core issues with the world cleanly: the limitation on experience people have due to mortality, and the amount of evil perpetrated by other people, as a single-soul universe has exactly balanced karma.
