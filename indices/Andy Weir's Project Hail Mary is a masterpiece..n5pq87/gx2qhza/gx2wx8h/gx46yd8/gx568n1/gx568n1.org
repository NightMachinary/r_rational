I don't think artificial suns would work to solve the global cooling problem. The way they enrich their astrophage is by having it absorb sunlight. Having it release that energy later is a net zero. You could use astrophage as a grow lamp in a greenhouse or something like that, but it's not clear that this is easier than getting the energy from solar panels.

If you set up infrastructure to collect the astrophage migrating towards Venus and return it to Earth on a massive scale, that could solve global cooling but would be far beyond the tech used in the book.
