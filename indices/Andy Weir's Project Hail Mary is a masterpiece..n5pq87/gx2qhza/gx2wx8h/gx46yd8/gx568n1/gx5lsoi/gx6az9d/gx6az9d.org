the problem with Black Panels at the L points is that there's no CO₂. They need carbon to undergo mitosis.

I think small spin drives *could* solve atmospheric spaceflight fairly well; if you can exert massive energy on demand, there's a way to do what you want with it. A nuclear rocket concept would translate incredibly well to using Astrophage as a power source--just superheating H₂ or whatever reaction mass you have on hand and throwing it out the back will get you to space eventually.

I haven't done the math, but it seems like spindrives would put the Epstein drives from The Expanse to shame--a lot fewer free neutrons flying around, for one thing. Pretty badass concept.
