I would love to see more in this universe. I don't think it makes sense for Ryland's story to continue; perhaps a brief cameo at most. He's kinda old for space travel by the end (53) and fragile due to high gravity. His character arc was given a proper end. Exploring Eridian society from a human's point of view would also be problematic since everything is in complete darkness and in a hot crushing atmosphere.ðŸ˜¬

I am super curious about the Eridians but also about what exactly happened on Earth. Though I'm also afraid that what happened on Earth was ugly despite humanity surviving and recovering in the end.
