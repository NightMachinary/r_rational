I was thinking the same thing. This could potentially make a better movie than The Martian, I think, since it's really hard to film a solitary character on their own in an interesting way--but two? Way easier. Plus, there's more visually exotic stuff going on with Rocky and his tech to work with.

Not only that, but I love the idea of an interstellar species that just got lucky with an incredible materials technology and consequently never had to work very hard on science in other areas--"Quantum what? Nah, man, we just strapped some Astrophage tanks to the back of our unobtanium party barge, hauled it up the space elevator and flew it to another star. Hey, have you noticed that there's something fucky about the speed of light?"
