Yes! I just finished it myself, and I loved the martian too, but my favorite thing about PHM is its basically and galactic buddy cop movie with a bunch of science thrown in.

Serious spoilers below, do not read if you haven't finished

Rocky and Grace's banter while they investigate astrophage, tau ceti, adrian, and taumeoba felt like a super fresh take on the classic buddy cop plot. Ryland is such an endearing character, and Rocky is the most lovable blind musical spider thing ever. I also really love that for a "first contact" story, it didn't both doing all the usual first contact bullshit... they both decided to trust each other from the get go, and it made for a much more enjoyable story. I think there's actually a framework to develop subsequent books off this foundation too. Using astrophage for interstellar travel, Ryland communicating with earth the let them know he survived and lives on an alien planet, Rocky and Ryland searching for life around other stars around the tau cluster, or even just "fixing" the other infected stars with more taumoeba, watching the Eridian society develop as they master electronics and computers. There is so much potential here.

I hope Weir gets another movie deal out of this because I think if done well it could be an incredible story on the big screen; actually, a 6 or 8 part mini series might be better so they don't have to trim stuff out
