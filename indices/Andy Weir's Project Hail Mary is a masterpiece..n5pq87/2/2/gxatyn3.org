Funny, the banter was my last favorite part, to put it mildly. When Rocky is suddenly talking just like a typical marvel bro at the end... it made me physically cringe.

I feel the current state of dialogue is similar to the '90s and early 2000s where everybody was copying Tarantino's style, only with marvel/whedon-esque banter instead. Most books or movies nowadays have this tonal disconnect where people are flippantly humorous in the middle of tense and dramatic situations.

"Uh, did you just shoot me in the spleen? I was using that!" Kill me, please.

It feels like our civilization was stealthily taken over by a cabal of hack writers and they've been slowly erasing the very concept of "cliche" and "hack line" from the collective consciousness.
