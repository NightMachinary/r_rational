Stylistic issue? Because he gave an alien 1 or 2 lines of cringy dialogue? No, I just think this one specific scene was out of place and not particularly plausible.

I think there is a huge difference between a character having a humorous inner monologue but being otherwise "hard scifi", as in The Martian and PHM, and being a straight up parody of a genre, as in The Orville. There's really no comparison between the two.
