My mother was very clever about a Christmas gift this year. Since we no longer live together, she doesn't know as much as she used to about my preferences. So she asked me outright what I wanted; I told her I could use some gym clothes.

She then proceeded to give me five (!) cheap-yet-functional sets, knowing I'd prefer that over anything fancy. Since I wasn't expecting that many outfits, I got the pleasant surprise of getting something I didn't expect. But, since she asked what I wanted, there was no chance of the gift being a dud.

So, that's my plan next year; ask someone what they want, then subvert their expectations in a pleasant way, thus achieving the best of both worlds.
