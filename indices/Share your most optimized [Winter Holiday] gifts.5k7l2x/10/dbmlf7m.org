In the past few years, in my family, people send out wishlists in advance (though some are late or flakey), supplemented by phone conversations and a bit of guessing.

I much prefer it to pure guessing. Sure, I have some well-known hobbies, but that doesn't mean I'll enjoy a random product within those hobbies selected by someone who knows a lot less about them than I do.

Well over half the gifts exchanged within my family are books though, so it's harder to fuck up too badly even when guessing.
