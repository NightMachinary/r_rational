And if you care enough about them to know their preferences in gifts, that probably means they told you at some point what they like. A gift doesn't have to be super costly to mean something special. And some people are probably better at guessing what people want for Christmas than others are. It's not a direct one to one correlation with how well you know the person or how much you care about them. Maybe you know what they like, but you don't know whether they want that particular gift /now/. Maybe they already have that gift, or they really want it but don't have any feasible space to put it in their homes. Maybe it's one of those things where they want to learn how to play guitar...in a few years, and they are too busy for it this year and if all you know is that they really want to learn how to play guitar you would be getting them a gift they wouldn't be using until years later.

Also, monetary gifts give the recipient the freedom to choose whatever they wish for for Christmas. The freedom to optimize my gift to whatever I like tends to outweigh the convenience of not having to shop for it in my mind. Plus some people actually like shopping.
