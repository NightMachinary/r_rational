I struggle with a lot of this and your comment has my mind churning through some problems and ramifications, so I'm going to think "aloud" here.

My understanding is that the giver (Alice) wants to have accomplished sending that signal, so the receiver (Bob) has a social pressure to confirm that the gift has done so whether or not it has. Outside certain edge cases, Bob's response needs to establish the success and needs to reflect the degree of success (without falling below a pleased floor).

I see many Alices complain about Bobs being difficult to shop for, so there also seems to be pressure for Bob to give Alice information to make this easier for her to accomplish. Sometimes the trouble is that Bob is too unknowable, having very specific or obscure interests, and sometimes it's that Bob's able to acquire whatever he's interested in; either way it seems to be regarded as a failing of Bob's that he didn't create or leave opportunities for Alice to express her understanding of him.

The system here also extends beyond closeness. Alice might feel obliged to give something to Bob despite not knowing him - even despite having no reason to know him - and so call upon Carol and Dave to receive insight on what would do well as a gift for Bob. This can be done openly or kept secret, and in some ways this is counterfeiting, in others this still signals some degree of caring.
