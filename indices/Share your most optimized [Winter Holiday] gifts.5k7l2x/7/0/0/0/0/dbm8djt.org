okay all good points i stand corrected. surprise gifts are a good way to give gifts on christmas, but they aren't for everyone necessarily. Most of the time how much you care about someone is directly one to one correlated with how well you know them. But in some cases there's a person who no matter how long you know them and how much time you spend with them you cannot figure out what kinds of gifts they want, and then you move away from them and then you no longer have frequent enough contact with them to figure that out in the first place. This might be something specific to communication-related and social disabilities now that I think of it. If someone can't express themselves clearly and accurately over a long period of time, then it's harder to get that good of an understanding of how they think and what kinds of gifts they might like. My mom and sisters love me but they have never been able to figure out what kinds of gifts to give me without just asking me, and eventually my mom gave up and just started giving me monetary gifts instead, while my sisters started giving time spent with me as a gift instead. Although the fact that I kinda friendzoned them all might have something to do with that too. Maybe they know it would make me feel awkward because whatever gift they might want to give me might be more than I feel comfortable giving to them.
