If you ask them they might tell you not about something they would really like but something that they would feel good about wanting. For example they might ask for a book that they feel they should own and then not read it.

Instead, recognize that people have preferences that they feel guilty about and try to fulfill them. For a frugal person that feels guilty when they buy something non-essential for themselves, buy them a luxury item that you think they probably want so they don't have to feel guilty about buying it. For a person who hates shopping for clothes, buy them a lot of clothes so they don't have to waste time buying clothes for a while.
