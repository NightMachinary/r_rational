tl;dr: giving each other equal amounts of money/requested items is missing the point of gifts, and you should just agree not to give gifts. Giving unequal amounts of money/requested items is better (assuming the person who receives more is in more material need); people are iffy about receiving material support, and special occasions are a good workaround. But good gifts are more than either, and you shouldn't ignore that.

--------------

Okay, so I think I didn't express myself clearly. I'm not arguing that monetary gifts are uniformly bad and no one should get them. I'm arguing about the general statement of "just get people money or ask them what they want", i.e. a claim that surprise gifts have no purpose and people who like them and want to get them are doing it wrong.

If both the gifter and the recipient are happy with a simple monetary exchange, more power to you. But if someone wants to get, or give, a surprise gift, you shouldn't be too surprised. There's solid reasons why they do, even if they might not express them or even be aware of them consciously. Signalling is /important/.

Giving someone money, or buying them something they asked you to buy, is effectively saying: "i have money, and I care enough about you to spend this much for you". (and if the gift exchange is mutual, it's even less; if the money is in balance it's basically "I care enough about you to order this thing for you"... which isn't much). Depending on the relation between the two people, this might be enough. But also depending on the context, it might be basically useless: both me and my father have enough money to buy basically whatever we want, day-to-day; anything we can't afford would not be a good gift because it'd be too expensive. The monetary and utility value of any gift we might get each other is basically zero; the gifts instead are about signalling attachment and reassuring the other person that we're still in touch with them. Surprise gift says all that the money says and /also/: "and I care about you enough to learn and remember your preferences, and find a gift of this quality for you", exactly because it's difficult to find a good one.

Addressing specific points:

#+begin_quote
  And if you care enough about them to know their preferences in gifts, that probably means they told you at some point what they like
#+end_quote

Maybe, or maybe you've observed them liking it. Doesn't matter, important thing is that you cared enough to remember.

#+begin_quote
  The never think of it themselves thing requires a lack of self awareness or a lack of understanding of what gifts are out there and of what you would want as a gift.
#+end_quote

Which is why I've said the point is /NOT/ to get them something they wouldn't think of themselves, I think you read me wrong. Or I'm reading this sentence wrong.

#+begin_quote
  And a gift doesn't have to be super costly to mean something special.
#+end_quote

Costly signal doesn't mean expensive. Costly, when talking about signalling, means difficult to fake. Asking someone what they want and then getting them that.. Anyone can do that. It doesn't signal anything, except maybe that you can afford it.\\
Knowing what someone likes without asking is much easier when you care about them and take the effort to know them well, and very difficult when you don't. Thus it's a good, costly, signal.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe you know what they like, but you don't know whether they want that particular gift now.
#+end_quote

Doesn't matter, the gift doesn't even have to be useful at all. Again, when giving surprise gifts, you're not trying to resolve the recipients material needs. (and if they do have significant material needs, then you shouldn't go for a surprise gift; just giving them money is a strong signal of attachment in that context). You're reinforcing your relationship by proving that you know them and care about them.

#+begin_quote
  And some people are probably better at guessing what people want for Christmas than others are. It's not a direct one to one correlation with how well you know the person or how much you care about them.
#+end_quote

Sure, there's exceptions and edge cases to every kind of signal. And if you're the kind of person who can at a glance tell someone else's tastes, you'll be able to 'cheat' this system. Doesn't mean the general approach is invalid.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe they already have that gift, or they really want it but don't have any feasible space to put it in their homes.
#+end_quote

Right; don't give surprise gifts if you /don't/ know someone elses day-to-day situation (where they live, if they have space, what they like). Knowing them well is a requirement, this is why the signalling works. If you get a gift and they don't like it / can't put it anywhere people will correctly interpret it as you not knowing them as well as you think you do.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe it's one of those things where they want to learn how to play guitar...in a few years, and they are too busy for it this year and if all you know is that they really want to learn how to play guitar you would get them a gift they wouldn't be using until a few years later.
#+end_quote

Yep, that's the point. If you don't know that and got them a guitar, you aren't very close with that person after all. The system's working as intended.

#+begin_quote
  Also, monetary gifts give the recipient the freedom to choose whatever they wish for for Christmas. The freedom to optimize my gift to whatever I like tends to outweigh the convenience of not having to shop for it in my mind. Plus some people actually like shopping.
#+end_quote

And if someone really likes shopping then a shopping coupon (or just money with a good message) might actually signal closeness and care.
