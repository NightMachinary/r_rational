For my parents and grandparents my sister and I had portrait photos taken and framed. Which seems pretty vain on the first glance, I guess, but everyone was pretty happy. Wish we lived close enough so that we could have taken photos of all of us together, but not really an option.

For one grandpa who's been struggling with sight loss and spending we've got a [[http://www.bones.ch/milestone212ace.php][audiobook reader]] that seems simple enough in operation that you don't really need to see the buttons. Took some hours to get it working (the software and language packs on their official site needed some hacking) because the simple model we wanted is not being officially sold anymore :P
