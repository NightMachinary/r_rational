For my parents, I got a new set of earbuds and an automatic catfood dispenser (since their cat wakes them up at the crack of dawn demanding food). For my sister, a pusheen mug and a pusheen plushie to join her stuffed animal collection. For one cousin, a young professional, a thermos. For another cousin, a scarf. For another, a different scarf. For another, recently engaged, a picnic knife (and a swiss army knife for his fiancee). For my cousin's young children, age-appropriate books. For my aunts and uncles, various small gifts. Candy, chocolate, and the like.
