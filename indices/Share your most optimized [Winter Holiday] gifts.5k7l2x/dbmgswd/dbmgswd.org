In terms of value-for-money, I'd rank gifts something like this:

Best: find something that they would like, but don't know about. Example: I got my mom the Scrabble Word-building Dictionary a few years ago.

Good: get some thing that you know they would like, but they wouldn't go out and buy. This could be either an extension on something they already have (like when I got my brother the next Dominion expansion, or my dad more Vinyl Cafe CDs) or else pure luxuries they would enjoy (like good chocolate or socks).

Okay: generic gifts, gift cards, money, everyday items, etc. This can also be valuable to redistribute wealth among a group within a socially accepted context.

Worse: useless gifts, like tools that are worse than the ones they have or accessiries for things they don't have/want.

Worst: gifts which create obligations that the person doesn't want, like a puppy.
