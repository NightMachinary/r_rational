I do love the style of descriptions, but in the 2nd page of prologues I've yet to really find any description, summary or hint of what kind of story I'm in for.

This makes me hesitant in putting more time into what amounts to a very large quantity of text eventually describing very few things taking place to characters I've yet to be given a reason to care about in a world that I cannot yet tell what it consists of, with a strong feeling over it that it's the last days of a doomed universe (or planet?) that I have already been told to give up hope for.
