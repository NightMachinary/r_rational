Still chugging along with this if anyone is interested, despite a disruption in December. For those not familar, this is intended to be a fairly hard mystery story in a science fantasy setting (for want of a better descriptor).

I'm planning to set a hard weekly update day following the next update, but first, I'm going to go back and clean up the story a little bit, and maybe make some small alterations to the pacing without messing with people who are already following. As always, I'd appreciate feedback on everything from the overall concept, to the general flow and how easy/fun it is to read, to typos. Of which there are probably many, as I still don't have a dedicated proofreader.

I'd especially like to know what point any one who tries it out but doesn't enjoy stops being able to maintain interest, even in absence of further detail.
