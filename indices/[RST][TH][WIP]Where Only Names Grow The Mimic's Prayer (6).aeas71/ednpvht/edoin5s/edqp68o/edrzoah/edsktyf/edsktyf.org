I've studied some rhetoric, and my teachers suggested that it's always important to capture the audience/reader and set up expectations in the beginning of stories, speeches, etc, so like you say, worldbuilding may be better off waiting until you've given the reader an example of what is to come, kind of why Lord of the Rings starts with a minimal setup of the situation you're about to see, and then shows you an example of one of the massive fantastic battles that the series later became famous for before it goes back to the Shire to begin the story, dispensing more worldbuilding throughout the work.

Finding out that it's a mystery story in some kind of summary in the beginning (like how many fanfics have a short summary to tell you the central premise, or the blurb on the back of books - it's all about attracting the kind of audience that you think your story will appeal most to. Attracting someone hoping for a political thriller or an action story isn't very useful since they'll just get bored.

Other than advertising what kind of story it is in advance, you seem to have a pretty good handle of what the story needs to capture the audience you want, so my suggestions would simply be to implement those very changes you just mentioned.

I'm not personally a fan of mystery stories, but I imagine that starting the mystery story by writing (or if that'd be spoiling, tease with it) the parts of a mystery that you yourself find most tantalizing in other stories, like the hints at whodunnit that the investigator doesn't have access to and the like (Not certain this is a tantalizing part, just a suggestion).
