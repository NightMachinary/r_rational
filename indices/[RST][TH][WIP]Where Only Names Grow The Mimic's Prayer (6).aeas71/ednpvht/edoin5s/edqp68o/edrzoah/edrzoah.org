You stopped right before the story really starts contextualizing itself properly (the chapter after Prologue 2) but I agree with you that the slow, melancholy opening is one of the biggest problems. As a solution, I've considered cutting the first prologue out completely and just dispensing the information slowly later, but at least a bit of it is essential to understanding the general premise, so it's been difficult for me to find a way to do that which feels natural.

A lot of the issue is that when I was structuring the story initially, something which is difficult for a mystery story to change without tearing a lot of it down, I was in a mindset that a serial could be written much the same as a novel, but that's obviously not the case. You need something to grab the reader quickly.

Do you have any suggestions?
