Well, the Genie chapter had this:

​

"Fine. Might as well make the most of whatever I have left, then. There were multiple facts that I always wanted to know, and now I guess I can know them, if you don't mind obliging." "Not at all. Go ahead." "Is there somebody in charge of everything? I always wondered about that." Cleo received a vision of a pickle on a dark street. "Hm. Is it possible for me to make a complaint?" Cleo did not receive a vision.

​

So it seems to literally be a pickle on a street. Doesn't mean it can't be a pun, but it's also probably literal.
