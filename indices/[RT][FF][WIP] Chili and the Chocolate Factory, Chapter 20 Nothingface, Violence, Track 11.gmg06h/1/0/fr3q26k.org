It could be a Rick and Morty episode beginning with Morty(Charley) escaping and meeting up with Rick(Wonka) and then Rick pulls the plug on the GAG, extinguishing an entire realm of thinking beings for personal convenience, again. Though considering the average cosmos in this story and the show that might usually be the ethical option. After that it's a normal fan made Rick and Morty episode. Next in rapid succession the author posts a literal transcription of seasons two and three. After the last episode there's Morty on a blank stage, screaming invectives against various real and hypothetical powers, gradually homing in on our society, the authors of the show, this author and us the reader and finally the particular reader reading the chapter at that moment, the end of the chapter is open ended and the beginning is ambiguous. This allows it to cleanly loop when the author posts an identical chapter the next week. A bot is set up to post another every week for eternity.
