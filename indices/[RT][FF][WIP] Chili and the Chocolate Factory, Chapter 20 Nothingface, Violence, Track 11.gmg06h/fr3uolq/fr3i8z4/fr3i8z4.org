Sweet Moses. The worldbuilding and and characters and meta commentary keep evolving. This is a trip and a half.

I keep saying that I have no idea what is going to happen next, /but I have no idea what is going to happen next/. Every update is something the completely re-contextualizes everything that came before, while at the same time never making any of the twists meaningless.

The next chapter could have Mahuika ignite her vape pen like a lightsaber and l would nod along. It could be 8000 copies of the letter 'q', with the capitalization encoding the real chapter. It could be Charlie talking directly to the reader, asking to be made real. A time travelling Willy Wonka might show up to reveal how everything was a part of his plan, and give a 100 page lecture on the subtle programming intricacies of GAG.

I don't have any clue, and I'm loving it.

As an aside, is the pickle on the street referencing something? I /think/ its a Rick and Morty reference, but my reference pool has proven to be far too shallow to keep up with all the details this story keeps slipping in.
