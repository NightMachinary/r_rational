Christ, the depth of the Dahl lore is unceasing. I loved all the titles, but /AN ADVAN/ the most.

Teavee. Of course it's him.

Also, I'm usually the guy rolling up my sleeves for the "teleportation isn't murder" side of the argument, but knowing Wonkatech... there's probably a good bit of murder.

I love the metacommentary. I love the simulation theory. All of this is for a GAG. A pickle runs everything. (Wonka didn't turn himself into a pickle.)

Bucket wants to leave by way of the formula. The god of candy longs only for death?

Minusland and the Gnoolies are canon from Great Glass Elevator, but I just wanna say I get Evangelion vibes from the idea of descending below Minusland to meet the avatar of the GAG.

Gazemaize, I just wanna say this whole story has been stylish as fuck. Dark, fresh, and imaginative. I'm on the edge of my seat.
