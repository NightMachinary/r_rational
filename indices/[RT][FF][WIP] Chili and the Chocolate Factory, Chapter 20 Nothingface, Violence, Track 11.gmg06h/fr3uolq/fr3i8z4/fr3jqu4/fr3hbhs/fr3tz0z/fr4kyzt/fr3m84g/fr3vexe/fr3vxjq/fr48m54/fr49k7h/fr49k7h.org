I wonder if Charlie Bucket is a character with more or less facts than the children. He at first seemed like a flat character when the children were driving the story in the earlier chapters, but with every death he showed more facets and appeared to be more complex. Almost as if he is a vampire-like character that feeds off the complexity of the other characters.

A potential clue about the pickle might be found in Roald Dahl's /Revolting Recipes/ book and its sequel, /Even More Revolting Recipes/. They are two books with recipes on how to prepare any of the foods found in his books, but I've never read them and have no idea if there's any mention of pickles in them. Anyone own a copy and care to help?
