I think that 'focusing on actions over characters' is a potential failure mode of any genre, rational or not. (By 'failure mode', I just mean that any fic can have this problem if it's written badly, not that it is an inherent problem of the genre.) Just as, uh, 'non-rational' fic can have characters running around with idiot balls for the sake of the plot that the author wants, lots of self-proclaimed 'rational' fic too can have paper-thin robot characters acting optimally all the time without any insight into their values, thinking process, or how their actions affect their psyche.
