Oh, the agony of seeing "SALT, NOT SWEET: WHY I POLITELY TURNED WILLY WONKA DOWN ON HIS OFFER TO INHERIT HIS BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY, EVEN AFTER HE BEGGED ME" and then Marama picking up and reading an unrelated book after it. What the fuck does that mean. An heir that wasn't Charlie? Charlie wrote it but got sucked back in? Mentions salt, the thing that abstracts you closer to the admin level?

This story is so fucking good.
