I'm 95% sure that this is a reference to the glowing green crystals that kicked off the events of James and the Giant Peach. That said, I don't have a single clue what it means. What would Mike want with the crystal? Why is it sitting in a fishbowl? Does it have anything to do with the pickle? So many questions...
