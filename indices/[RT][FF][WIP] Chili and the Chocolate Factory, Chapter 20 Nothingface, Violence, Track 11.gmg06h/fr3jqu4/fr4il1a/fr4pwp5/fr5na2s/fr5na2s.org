for sure? I wasn't saying that "stuff happens" is solely the domain of quote-unquote nonrationalfic, just that one of rational fiction's stated goals is to specifically avoid it (whether or not it generally succeeds is a different matter, you describe a common failure mode), though that's veering a little close to Sidebar Description Discussion. Michael makes the observation about robotic characters too ("machines that caused actions"), and really he's talking about /good stories/ in general, it just so happens that he's framing it in a way that it resembles discussions about /rational stories/

which, come to think of it, is a really common device in Remy's writing: a generalised theme or a point that makes sense in-universe is communicated using terms that really resemble a specific out-of-universe thing, while also plausibly just being what's happening on a story level. So a given beat could simultaneously be in-universe text about what's happening, plus subtext about a general point, plus metatext about the story
