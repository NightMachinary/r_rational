That's not really mindbending, that's the problem with breaking the 4th wall.

Like, Deadpool and Rick & Morty get away with doing it because they're supposed to be funny and to break expected genre conventions, but these genre conventions exist for a reason. If you have no fourth wall at all, then the story is less interesting because /of course/ the story is fictional and anything in it can happen and there's no stakes and emotional impact and character growth because it's all just words on paper.
