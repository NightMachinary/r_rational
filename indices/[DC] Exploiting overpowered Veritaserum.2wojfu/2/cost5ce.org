Well if 'subconscious knowledge' is revealed by Veritaserum, and if Veritaserum usage is harmless enough, I'm guessing that scientists/engineers/people working on all sorts of problems would use it to see if their unconscious minds has figured out a solution that their conscious minds hasn't grasped.

Usage in psychology also looks highly likely, letting a patient hear himself speak obvious truths that they nonetheless don't acknowledge to themselves.
