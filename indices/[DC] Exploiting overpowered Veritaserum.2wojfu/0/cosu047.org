So uhh.. pretty much every bit of information a person's brain has been in causal contact with should count as "subconsciously absorbed" information. Veritaserum would then turn them into the equivalent of a perfect Bayesian agent. Or at least a close approximation, since presumably someone must still ask the right questions. So at minimum, a really good Oracle.
