The aesthetic reminds me a lot of [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/231160/][The Swapper]], which is a really fun puzzle game that brings up issues and thoughts about human identity and copies of people but doesn't really present a concrete thesis (just raises a bunch of fairly interesting questions).

Note that The Swapper's been on the Humble Bundle multiple times and also has been quite heavily discounted in various steam sales at various times, so paying full price is probably not a wise investment of your money. edit: humble bundle has it for $10.49 USD currently, but it's been in bundles for like $7-8 for it and like 6+ other games too, so...
