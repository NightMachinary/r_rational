I enjoyed the game, but the experience is not significantly better than it would be if I were just watching someone playing the game. The gameplay itself is moderately interesting, lots of thinking and fetching items and putting them in places, and the fight system is pretty good, but the controls can be finnicky at times and the puzzles themselves are not interesting to solve.

I recommend watching a good let's play of this game, and not purchasing it. The ideas and the plot are good, but it's not engaging enough to keep me gripped.
