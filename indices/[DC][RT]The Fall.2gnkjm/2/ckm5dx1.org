I'm not that much impressed by the game so far, it does a lot of "you need to use this specific item on this other specific item, to get the effect that in real life you could have achieved a bazillion different ways". Getting wires, breaking stuff, etc, etc.

Plus, I think the game may have bugged out on me since I can't seem to do what happens in the 2:38 point of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_H-x41lqDs]] , and the game may be unfinishable for me now. I watched the video exactly just because I couldn't seem to progress any further past a point and was wondering what I could have missed.

So, not recommending this.
