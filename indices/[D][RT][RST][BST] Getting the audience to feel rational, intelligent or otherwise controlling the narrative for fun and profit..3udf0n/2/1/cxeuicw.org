I've read his articles on intelligent characters, I useally aim for level 1 most of the time, but level 2 occasionally come up. I rarely do level 3 because I've never seen that kind of character sustainably being 'explained' by the reader that clearly for longer then a few scenes without turning into an authorial soap box.

And yes I am saying HPMOR falls into that. It is a nice story but it gets pretty transparent eliezer is lecturing on topics via harry on more then one ocassion. it's eliezer's 'voice' .
