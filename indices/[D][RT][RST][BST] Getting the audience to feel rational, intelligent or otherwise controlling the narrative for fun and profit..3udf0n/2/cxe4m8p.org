For me at least, I feel like a character is rational and highly intelligent when the character is intelligent enough to make me feel stupid. A perfect example of this was Hermione's strategy in HPMOR where she defeated Draco and Harry by having her team feign an easy defeat, thereby leaving Draco and Harry's teams to fight it out and severely weaken themselves before Hermione's team came back in full force to defeat both of them. It was a brilliant move, and I feel stupid because I didn't think of that possibility when her forces seemed to be defeated easily. It's not often that a writer makes me feel stupid, but it's incredibly enjoyable when it happens.

Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote a segment on how to build brilliant characters which he described as [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent][level 2 intelligent]]. ([[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 intelligence]] is at least as smart as an ordinary person in the same situation, while [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][level 3]] characters use thought processes explained well enough that readers could follow them and achieve similar results.) He also has a [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][collection of articles]] on writing intelligent characters.

My recommendation would be to go through Yudkowsky's guide on the subject and come back if you still have questions. I would specifically recommend not trying to increase the irrationality of the rest of the cast/world. Try to make all of your characters at least level 1 intelligent, and then try to make your protagonist at least level 2 intelligent, or preferably level 3 intelligent so that your readers can follow the thought processes and draw your protagonist's conclusions with brilliance of their own.
