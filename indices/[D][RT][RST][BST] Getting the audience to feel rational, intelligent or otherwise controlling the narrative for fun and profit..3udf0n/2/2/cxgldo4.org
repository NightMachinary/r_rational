Honestly, I remember thinking of the "pretend to be asleep" plan, being miffed that Harry didn't apply it, and then /completely blindsided/ when Hermione's army used it. I expected it from Harry, but not from Hermione and co.

Which I think was the point, but I don't feel that what I read as the intended message there was brought home as well as it could have been.
