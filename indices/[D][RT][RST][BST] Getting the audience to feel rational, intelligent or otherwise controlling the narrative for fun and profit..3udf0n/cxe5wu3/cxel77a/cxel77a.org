  "why didn't they just do x? It would solve everything and be very easy", that right there is a perfect example that you are not reading about a rational character. Rational characters do the things they do because those are things that makes sense for them to do, not because of plot reasons or because you the author want those things to happen.

This, all of this, so much of THIS. And to add on to that, its okay if they try and fail an obvious plan or discuss that obvious plan and point out in world problems as to why that specific plan would not work, but so long as the obvious methods are tried.
