What I've always wanted to see is a scene where they explain the plan in voice over while on screen it goes completely awry.

But yeah, you can avoid UPG if the explanation and execution happen simultaneously. The big thing you want to avoid is explaining the plan and then just repeating the same thing as its enacted, because that's boring. You can explain the plan and then have it succeed completely offscreen (good option if it's not the focus of the plot).
