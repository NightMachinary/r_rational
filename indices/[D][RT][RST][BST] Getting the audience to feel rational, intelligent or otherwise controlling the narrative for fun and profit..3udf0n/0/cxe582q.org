If you want to make the reader feel dumb, leave them in a position of ignorance while the smart character does their plotting. When the plot comes to fruition, the reader gets everything explained to them after the fact.

If you want to make the reader feel smart, explain all the plotting and thinking as it's done. That puts the reader in a position of empathy with the intelligent, which makes them feel intelligent in turn (so long as they can follow the thinking).
