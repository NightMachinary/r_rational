If your goal is merely to make the /reader/ feel smart, use dramatic irony and foreshadowing to let the reader predict plot twists before the characters. It's part of what makes Shakespeare so compelling to so many, even when (though, perhaps, largely because) the characters are idiots.

As this applies to Rational fiction and UPG, just use the other side of the UnspokenPlanGuarantee: Explain the plan as it's being made, and then have it /not/ work due to something the characters did not know about, so the plan must be adapted. That way, you can get /at least/ two plans' worth of exposition from the original and adapted plans.

Alternately, have only part of the plan be unspoken. Delegate a specific objective to some side characters, and make their contribution during execution interesting and exciting, even functionally surprising through a shift in tone when they arrive, but not /completely/ unexpected from what the reader knows about those characters. (In HPMoR, for example, look at most things Neville pulls off)

This can also act as the complication above; failure and betrayal are often interesting and exciting.
