I am very disappointed in writers who use UnspokenPlanGuarantee. It feels like they're just copping out of having to write the actual plan, which is the really interesting part, and so they just show the outcome, which is boring, but that might just be me - I tend to enjoy the planning much more than the doing, both in real life and in fiction.
