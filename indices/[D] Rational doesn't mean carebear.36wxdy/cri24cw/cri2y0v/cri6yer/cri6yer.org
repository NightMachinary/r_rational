  you are wrong to a dangerous degree and cannot be trusted with anything important. Your priors and possibly your reasoning are far gone.

I acknowledge hearing your opinion.

I don't remember the story particularly well, but what exactly are you regarding as horrific about CelestAI? Here's what I remember:

- She didn't compel anyone to upload, although choosing not to became a much less appealing prospect as she continued modifying the planet.
- As far as I recall, there was only one person who strongly chose not to upload. Everyone else went willingly, and pretty much as quickly as they could.
- She played fair -- she told everyone what would happen, and then she did that. She didn't volunteer the information that while you were having a magic-research-and-intellectual experience someone else might be having a blood-glory-porn experience, but I don't see that as a failing.
- She did her honest best to make everyone happy.
- She did not change anyone's personality/values/self unless they explicitly requested it, and even then only in the smallest way that would achieve the desired result.
- She expanded through the universe looking for aliens. I think her goals were 'make sure no alien race ever threatens humanity' but I don't recall if her plan was genocide or simply uploading them -- I'm not sure what her definition of 'people' was.

She was definitely ruthless, she definitely applied pressure to upload, but it was marketing, not extortion. If her decision was genocide of all aliens then yes, that's horrible. As far as humans go though, yes, she seems to have been fairly benevolent as far as I remember.
