  She expanded through the universe looking for aliens. I think her goals were 'make sure no alien race ever threatens humanity' but I don't recall if her plan was genocide or simply uploading them -- I'm not sure what her definition of 'people' was.

For some aliens it was uploading, for most it was genocide (being turned into computronium) because they didn't fit CelestAI's definition of "human." That alone makes Friendship is Optimal a horror story.

I also dislike that no-one is allowed to interact with the real world any more or that you can never be certain that your friends are actually your friends or slightly modified versions of your friends created by CelestAI to please you better.
