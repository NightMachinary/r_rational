I dunno about "meta ethical" meaning, but Moral relatavists might say "Oh, it's wrong to us, but it's right to them and we can't impose our standards..."

And moral absolutists might say "It's Good because the Universe/God/etc says so. We can impose Good on the world and this is right and well (provided we're humble about figuring out what really is Good)"

These are both different from "I, as an individual, determine what is most preferable to me morally and otherwise...and I /can and will and should and must/ impose my preferences upon the world. (Provided I'm humble about figuring out what I really do prefer as well as what actions lead to it, recognizing that I'm often wrong.) I'm not sure what the name for this view is, but it's the one I think rationalists pretty much all hold.
