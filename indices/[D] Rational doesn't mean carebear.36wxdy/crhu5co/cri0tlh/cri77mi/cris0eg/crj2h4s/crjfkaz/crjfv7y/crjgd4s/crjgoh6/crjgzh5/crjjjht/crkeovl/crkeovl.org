Hmm... you are right that all the Timeless/Updateless game-theoretic thinking I'm invoking here is extremely fuzzy and difficult to naturalize. But my point wasn't to be /nice/ to anyone, merely that "buzz off and keep each moral system among its own species" works out to a convenient social contract for a galaxy where you don't know what end of the power scale you're actually on relative to every other species you've run into or not run into. Throwing in something like star detonation or another weapon capable of Mutually Assured Destruction/Separation makes it surer.
