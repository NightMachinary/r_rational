Oh. I don't think there's any game-theoretic justification for being nice to people with less power, on the off-chance that there are more powerful beings who are mean to people who are mean to people with less power...if that's what you were thinking. That's just pascal's wager made fancy. There could just as easily be more powerful beings who are mean to people who are nice to people with less power.

If that's not what you're referencing, then how does being reflexively self consistent make any difference?
