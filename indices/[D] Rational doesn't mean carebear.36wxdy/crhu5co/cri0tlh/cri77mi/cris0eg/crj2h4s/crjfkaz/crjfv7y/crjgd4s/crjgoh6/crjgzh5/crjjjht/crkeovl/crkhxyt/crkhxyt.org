That's just it though, it's only a social contract if everyone's roughly at the same power levels. There's no reason for the higher-power species to mind the preferences of the lower-power species, nor is there a reason to care for even-higher-power species to care what the higher-power species do.

The thing about power is that it's uni-directional, you don't get that reciprocating consequences thing that informs most of the rest of game theory. (But I think this is a recognized open problem)
