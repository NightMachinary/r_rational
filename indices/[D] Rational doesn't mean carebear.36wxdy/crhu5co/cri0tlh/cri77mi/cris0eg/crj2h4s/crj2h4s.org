  The same empathy that compels you to act makes you realize you are the superhappy scenario to the baby-eaters and therefore shouldn't act.

But, do you respect the alien preferences /intrinsically/ or do you just feel that respecting the preferences of powerful entities is good game theory? Keep in mind, we have, in the form of other animals, plenty of babyeaters and superhappies here on Earth. We just ignore their preferences because they have no power. And with the babyeaters, we might go via the baby-eater baby preferences too. Are you gonna intrinsically respect a paperclipper's preferences?

The good ending in the story /is/ that we leave each other alone and hide...but we do so because it's good game theory, not because we respect alien morality.
