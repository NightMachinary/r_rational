  I'm not sure why you think the future!humans are "babies". Because they feel empathy?

Presumably because the average human living today doesn't feel much revulsion at, for example, the concept of animals eating other animals alive.

Future humans would have to feel /way more/ empathy than we currently do for /everyone/ to have an impulse toward finding some sort of cooperative solution in prisoner's dilemmas with aliens.
