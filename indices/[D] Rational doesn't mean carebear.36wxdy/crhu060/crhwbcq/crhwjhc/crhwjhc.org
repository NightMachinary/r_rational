"Aliens" and "animals" occupy different moral categories in most people's minds, as any science-fiction fan knows. Learning about another tribe that is under a curse forcing them to eat their children each year would be more accurate.

You're right about the Prisoner's Dilemma thing, but I think it's pretty clear in the story that most of the humans /don't/ instinctively try to cooperate in the Prisoner's Dilemma with the aliens; only Akon does, because he's been trained as an Administrator and it's his job not to make stupid decisions. (And he's /right/, since the Superhappies would probably have shown up and doomed humanity if he'd defected.)
