I'm not sure why you think the future!humans are "babies". Because they feel empathy?

Rationality is used to pursue your goals. In most humans, those goals are morality, so yeah, it's rational to try and build a reasonably utopian society.

The Superhappies live in a Superhappy utopia, and the Babyeaters live in a Babyeater utopia. That neither of these bear anything but the vaguest resemblance to /human/ utopias is /kind of the point of the story./

Similarly, Professor Quirrell is rational - indeed [[#s][HPMOR]]. But he doesn't strike me as a "carebear" by any stretch of the imagination. (Of course, to be fair, he's not really a society all by himself no matter how hard he tries.)

In Eliezer's Brennan stories, the protagonists are all basically selfish, and their main goal is to gain power (albeit in a post-Singularity world of some kind.) /Signifiant Digits/ is set in a post-HPMOR world where the protagonists rule most of the world, and it doesn't seem to be a utopia by any stretch. [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html][The Girl Who Poked God With A Stick]] is pretty much exactly what you're asking for.

In fact, looking, the /only/ examples that seem to fit are /Three Worlds Collide/, AlexanderWales' HPMOR epilogue, and MLP:FiO (which I haven't read, but going by descriptions.)
