Because they feel wildly misplaced empathy.

My point is that I thought I'd seen a pattern among far-future human rationalist societies where every sophont is considered precious, and this belief is held to like a religion (in the sense that when they meet a competing religion, the baby eaters, /who are stated to be just as rational as the humans/, they declare them evil and wrong.) I don't really see how this came to be the case, and I don't think it should be a constant.

  The Superhappies live in a Superhappy utopia, and the Babyeaters live in a Babyeater utopia. That neither of these bear anything but the vaguest resemblance to human utopias is kind of the point of the story.

That's also my point, the baby eaters have made their choice and the humans should respect that, as they have no moral high ground. I don't see why rational!humanity thinks it has some superior morality to rational!aliens.
