Why, though? What reason do you have to let orcs in? What do you get out of it? Do you get more out of it than you lose in letting a bunch of big green brutes in? Where will they live? Where will they work? What are you going to tell the people who have to live next to them? How is your crime situation, will it grow when you provide a steady supply of goons?

Orcs aren't humans, and you need a good reason to treat them like humans.
