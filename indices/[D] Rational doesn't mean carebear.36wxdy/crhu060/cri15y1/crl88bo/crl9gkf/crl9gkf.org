Speciesism doesn't really carry any issue. Consider a more readily imaginable case. If this were standard fantasy, and you ran a city, why let orcs live in it? They're not humans. They are a liability. However, you also aren't going to go conquer their desert and stop them from performing their arcane manhood rituals where half of them get eaten by dragons, for the same reason you aren't offended that the elves don't let anyone into their crystal cities.
