  the baby eaters have made their choice
#+end_quote

The baby-eater babies haven't. And to decide that they have to suffer their parents choices just because they belong to the same species is specieist. After all we wouldn't let a person in our own society eat his children just because he thinks that that would be the right and proper thing to do. We would take away his children and lock him up.

  and the humans should respect that

The humans have also made their choice. Respecting the choices of baby-eaters when there are other options available are not part of that choice.
