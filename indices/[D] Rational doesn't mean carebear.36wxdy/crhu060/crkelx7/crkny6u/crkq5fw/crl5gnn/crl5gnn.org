I think that'd be unfair to Lovecraft, though. (I haven't read much King.)

He tended to lean on his own phobias, like seafood, but he was generally writing about reasonably horrible (if abstract) fears. It can be hard to show the horror inherent in a universe (or a being) that genuinely /does not care/ about humanity, or a world where human values have been permanently lost, but I do think it's worth it.

Admittedly, I'm not sure about the miscegenation vibes - there's a certain body-horror thing going on there, and Lovecraft was /in/ a mixed-race marriage iirc, but it's still basically Not That Bad. Blame his phobias, I guess.
