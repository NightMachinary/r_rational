  Pretending that what we have is good isn't better. If the universe is a terrible place, I desire to believe the universe is a terrible place.

I guess I just don't see it as all that terrible, /compared to the alternatives/. The Lone Power invented /entropy/, so to speak, not just /Death/, and this means Its "gift" includes the arrow of time and the fundamental nature of optimization and choice. We didn't get any Choice, in real life, but all the same, the "gift" of Entropy includes not just Death but the means for shoving Death down the Lone One's throat and making It choke!

The universe as it actually is made us the way we actually are, and lays at our feet massive opportunities to really enjoy ourselves and have great lives, /if we play our cards right/. This is, to me, better than having never been given cards in the first place, or never existing in the first place, which is what we'd get if the universe weren't a "terrible" place.

  But yeah, as I say, it's hard to get across stuff like "the AI does not hate you or love you, but you are made of atoms it can use for something else" or "you and everyone you know and your entire species will die" in a way that really appeals viscerally to our emotions. I like it when it works, though.

I would have to say that these statements really only look on the negative side. You get a choice about which AIs you build, after all: you /can/ choose to do the hard work of making it "love" you, so to speak (note: the emotion love, whether or not we can program it, does not solve the FAI problem -- please don't take this as a statement of such). And then you get to pierce the heavens and enjoy your eternity instead of going extinct.

  Incidentally, have you actually read much Lovecraft?
#+end_quote

I read a book of his short fiction that included /The Call of Cthulhu/, /The Shadow Over Innsmouth/ (which actually creeped me out), and /The Color Out of Space/, just to my memory. There were a few other things in there.
