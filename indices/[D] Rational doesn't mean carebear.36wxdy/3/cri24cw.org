Other people have addressed the empathy/rationality part of the discussion, so I'll take the AI part. If this subreddit is seeing a confluence of rationality-means-nice among aliens and/or AIs, then it's probably because that's the unbroken ground.

Until very recently, every depiction of aliens or AIs was negative -- Frankenstein, War of the Worlds, Dracula, Morlocks/Eloi, Berserkers, etc etc. Part of the reason that Asimov's 'Robot' stories were (and are) so amazingly popular is that aside from being well written and enjoyable they were /different./ They showed a world where robots could be allies instead of antagonists, and it was a new thought.

Even today, the majority of AI stories give them antagonist roles. Eagle Eye, Her (in the end), Transcendence (I think? Didn't see it), the Terminator movies, the Matrix movies -- they all show AI as figures of fear. MLP:FiO can be taken as uplifting or horror depending on your values.

The worst of all, of course, is Jack Williamson's /With Folded Hands./ That is the only book I've ever read where I physically shuddered after reading it; when I wrote [[http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Blues-David-K-Storrs-ebook/dp/B00V52XRIE][Baby Blues]] [paid link; just read the blurb] I used that as my model for how to achieve real horror.

Again, if we're seeing a higher proportion of AI's / aliens as rational and at least somewhat friendly, it's because the other side has already been done to death.
