A rational society does not need to be utopian, I certainly agree with that.

However, as long as you use the term egalitarian correctly, I have to disagree - for humans anyway!

With exceptions made for children, the ill, injured or congenitally damaged, or the aged/infirm, who need help which might also include restricting some of their rights, everyone should have equal rights and opportunities. Without this, you have a society that may devolve into a caste society, or slavery society.

While a surface argument might be made for a rational society based on enforced social standing, I think it's fairly clear from the last few thousand years that such social arrangements are highly irrational, because the ones on the bottom tend to get upset and kill the ones at the top every now and then. Courting that sort of social instability is just not rational, IMHO.
