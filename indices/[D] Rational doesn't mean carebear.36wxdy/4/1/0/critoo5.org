In my opinion, in a rational society, positions of power would only be held by people who are competent to hold them.

From our experience in the last couple thousand years of recorded history, this typically means that most people who actually want positions of political power for the sole purpose of having power won't be capable of earning them.

For those few individuals who are both highly competent and power hungry, a rational government will have effective systems of checks and balances. Those systems will be administered by competent individuals.

When imagining a rational society, you have to consider that rationality does not only extend to thought experiments, it extends to practical application.

A meritocracy is eminently rational. Is everyone the same? No. Is everyone allowed to try to improve themselves? Yes.
