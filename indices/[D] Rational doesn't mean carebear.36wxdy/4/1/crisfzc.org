I will argue against your position.

Suppose it either becomes possible to predict personality traits with some accuracy from a human's DNA, or becomes possible to determine them from a brain scan. In this scenario it could be /known/ at a high belief level that someone craves power (which I distinguish from ambition). At present, this doesn't fall under "congenitally damaged" but I do not believe such people should have power in society -- they should not have the right to hold elected office / work as managers. I base this belief on my priors which also include a belief that this is not an uncommon belief. Perhaps we would expand the definition of congenitally damaged, which would quickly lead to eugenics programs. They'd probably be successful quickly if we have genetics/neurology at that level. Alternatively we would have a rational society with at least one social caste.

  I think it's fairly clear from the last few thousand years that such social arrangements are highly irrational, because the ones on the bottom tend to get upset and kill the ones at the top every now and then.

This is just evidence that historical societies are unstable, not that no such societies can ever exist. Given that historical societies have not been engineered (depending on how you feel about conspiracies, this will be more or less controversial) the fact that most such societies have had revolutions is not evidence that an engineered rational society would experience revolutions. The society I propose above will absolutely have an "underclass" and because that underclass is defined by it's cravings for power a revolution is inevitable. For this reason, any society which implements the ban on power-hungry leaders is also going to need some form of control of these power-hungry individuals, which can take one of a number of forms.

Of course the countermeasures may fail, but I consider the risk rational because the potential benefits are immense. A major source of corruption will have been removed.
