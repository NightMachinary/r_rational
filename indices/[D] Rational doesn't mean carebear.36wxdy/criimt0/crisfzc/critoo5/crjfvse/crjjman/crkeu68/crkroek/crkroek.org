That is a problem, yes. It is not 'the' problem. Before we can even begin to approach a rational meritocracy that isn't prone to uprisings due to caste enforcements, we have to have the capacity to do the following things with little to no human labor:

1) Grow food that people are willing to eat. 2) Educate people to an acceptable degree. 3) Provide law enforcement. 4) Provide power. 5) Maintain power, communications, transportation, shelter, education, law enforcement, government, and entertainment infrastructure. 6) Support the material needs to perform 1-5.

We also must: A) Establish a world government stable enough to prevent wars B) Establish population controls that aren't ghastly. C) Avoid a situation where the AI that we have developed to do 1-6 for us become sentient enough to want to be free of the labors we have assigned them.

Once we can do all these things (and we're nowhere even close to most of the critical ones) then we might seriously consider how to deal with the social aspects of hereditary wealth in a meritocracy.

I'm fairly certain that by the time we get to a point where we have the capacity to begin seriously considering a rational meritocracy, we would be close to a post-need society anyway.
