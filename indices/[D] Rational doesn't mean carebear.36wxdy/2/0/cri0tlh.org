I'm thinking of adults in this context as people who are aware that sometimes sacrifices need to be made in some areas because total perfection may not be possible. In defense of my classification of the captain as a "baby" and the confessor as an "adult", the captain has the option to: (spoilers for TWC of course)

  "Well. Anyway. If remaining whole is that important to us - we have the option. It's just a question of whether we're willing to pay the price. Sacrifice the Babyeater children -"

  They're a lot like human children, really.

He doesn't take this, because his loss function is that of a child. Oh no, the little aliens (who are quite happy with their own priors and loss functions, by the way). His stated reasoning is that the Superhappies /thought/ they were cooperating, so he had to cooperate. He had the option of detonating the star and protecting mankind, and he didn't take it. The confessor is around to make the hard (here meaning obvious but emotionally costly) decision, which I think may be the reason there are confessors everywhere: in case stupid mistakes like this happen.

I think the baby-eaters are probably closer to an adult society, given that they are defined by the shared experience that there are situations where a regrettable decision must be made. Humans are pretty bad, but the presence of a confessor keeps things under control. The superhappies, to take a phrase from an old SF short story, are idiot children playing with machine guns.

I'm 22. I'm aware of the prevalence of empathy in our society.
