Indeed. Now, we humans tend to possess a fairly strong moralizing intuition that we "ought" to do the power-neutral thing, because we genuinely cannot count on being Singleton-level powerful. Even political autocrats, among our species, still have to worry about someone killing or overthrowing them.

The question is whether the set of interstellar species is that well-populated with that high a variance to the power levels, such that any given species has reason to think someone might out-gun them, or whether a kind of Mutually Assured Destruction can exist where even a relatively weak species can threaten serious damage if they're not left to their own devices.
