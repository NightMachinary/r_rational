  preferences (including moral) are decided on an individual basis, and you only take other being's preferences into account to the extent that you prefer to do so.

I believe this. However, I reason that even if you for whatever reason feel that baby eater society must end so that you can feel better, you still shouldn't take that action because of the possibility of a superhappy scenario. The same empathy that compels you to act makes you realize you are the superhappy scenario to the baby-eaters and therefore shouldn't act.

This is why, even though the superhappies are making a rational decision based on their beliefs, they've still got to go (if humanity were able to do it) -- they're evil by humanity's morals (as stated in TWC, at least). To answer a possible question, even if they aren't against humanity's morals, they're against my morals, which require that anyone who doesn't oppose an X-risk is an X-risk. I consider this a consistency requirement.

I believe that the rational choice for humanity after TWC is to go Orion's Arm Hider.
