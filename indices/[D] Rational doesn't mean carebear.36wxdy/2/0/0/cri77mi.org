  Oh no, the little aliens (who are quite happy with their own priors and loss functions, by the way).

I think the crux of this is that you are a moral relativist, and most rationalists aren't. The popular belief among rationalists is that preferences (including moral) are decided on an individual basis, and you only take other being's preferences into account to the extent that you prefer to do so.

(As in, the superhappies /don't care/ that the adult babyeaters are okay with it, in the same sense that a paperclipper cares not about our preferences. And the superhappies, like the paperclipper, are perfectly rational in not caring because orthogonality thesis.)
