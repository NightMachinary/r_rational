To quote [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism][Wikipedia]]:

#+begin_quote
  Moral relativism may be any of several philosophical positions concerned with the differences in moral judgments across different people and cultures. Descriptive moral relativism holds only that some people do in fact disagree about what is moral; meta-ethical moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong; and normative moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it.

I see now that you were refering to normative Moral Relativism.

And I think there is more to the viewpoint you're describing than Just Meta-Ethical Moral Relativism, but I'm not sure what to call the rest of it either. Guess I need to browse more philosophy terms.
