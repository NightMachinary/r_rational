  I'm thinking of adults in this context as people who are aware that sometimes sacrifices need to be made in some areas because total perfection may not be possible.

[[http://pictures.mastermarf.com/blog/2011/110226-laugh.jpg][My face when]] "sacrifices" (ie: the weak) need to be "made" (ie: offered up to be eaten) for "the greater good" (ie: in the desperate hope of appeasing the Dragon Tyrant), and of course it's "childish" (ie: demands that we make like a child and actually think) to demand that the "adults" (ie: the powerful) consider alternative courses of action (ie: at least not killing the weak and low-status /first/). [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo][It's basically the exact same post-hoc rationalization used to justify every single evil decision someone couldn't straight-facedly call good, even to a mirror.]]

/Real/ adulthood consists /precisely/ in finding better options than pretending you can appease unwanted and terrible facts of life by killing the weak first, /precisely/ in rejecting false dichotomies forced upon you by ignorance and prejudice, and /finding the better options/. That is what adults are /for/.

  Humans are pretty bad, but the presence of a confessor keeps things under control. The superhappies, to take a phrase from an old SF short story, are idiot children playing with machine guns.

Certainly the superhappies are evil and stupid. They're going to be eaten by the next thing to happen on /them/ and dislike /their/ religion, after all.

  I'm 22. I'm aware of the prevalence of empathy in our society.

You mean the lack thereof?
