  So you're saying that every dichotomy is false, and "real" adults will always discover this?

Not every, just most.

  Seems pretty "childish" to me, one true dichotomy is between using an imperfect solution now or waiting for your hypothetical perfect solution to appear.

And the way to bypass it is to actually put consistent work into coming up with additional technologies and sciences so as to make fewer choices dichotomous between unpleasant alternatives.

  Ha, no. Consider the situations in the UK (specifically the immigrant muslim rape gangs), Sweden, Zimbabwe, the Congo, and South Africa. I could go on, but I'd start going into controversial (the facts are clear, the narrative does not agree) situations.

Honestly, letting some people grow up useless and alienated and then letting those already-damaged people prey on others in a massive spiral of abuse and pain just doesn't seem very compassionate to me.
