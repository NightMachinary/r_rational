Of course. Here's an article with extensive documentation on the general post-colonial changes: [[https://radishmag.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/come-back-colonialism/][link]]. It covers the crime in the congo in detail. A discrete dividing line is difficult. I'm not saying this to wriggle out of giving one: I claim that the line is the government change in each country, after which things started to spiral out of control (I conjecture due to the fact that there were usually multiple militant groups aiming for control, and the losers didn't fade away. If I'm right and this was a major cause, things might have been better if the transition took place over a longer period but that's another conjecture) until they eventually reached crisis levels.
