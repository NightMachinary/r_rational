So you're saying that every dichotomy is false, and "real" adults will always discover this? Seems pretty "childish" to me, one true dichotomy is between using an imperfect solution now or waiting for your hypothetical perfect solution to appear.

I would love to see the reasoning that leads to killing someone other than the weak first if a situation where killing part of the group is necessary arises. Remember that women and children do not count as weak, and tool-making skills (i.e. reasoning) in the absence physical strength of don't either.
