Well, people are largely writing about what they consider rational /for human agents/, in fact, human agents who usually share a lot of acculturation with the author, so of course the author's views slip into the story.

Of course, if you're asking what happens when the Affront /gets bloody clever/, the answer is that whole leaves of galactic space have to be sterilized to put a goddamn stop to what humans call "really terrible torture porn".

Now, I wasn't really analyzing the sociology when I read /Three Worlds Collide/ as much as I was admiring the trolling, but let me ask: what do you think "grown-ups" look like? What would a civilization full of not-babies look like?

Also, how old are you? Just asking, because those of us actually in the "adult" age-group tend to find that, yes, 50% of the adult world around us, sometimes more, are total and utter babies. It's one of those unpleasant awakenings to the facts of life.
