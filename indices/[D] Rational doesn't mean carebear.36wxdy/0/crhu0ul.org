What do you mean by "rational"? Also, what do you mean by "care bear" and "little babies"? The two parts that you quoted don't seem to be related to each other than the fact that they're talking about the baby-eaters. Although if by "little babies" you mean emotionally immature and overly sensitive, then what do you think of people who cry at funerals? Are they little babies too? Because what happened to the baby-eater children in TWC is worse than the holocaust, probably by at least an order of magnitude. In the story they commit genocide /against their own children/ every year for the entire history of their species.

If you meant something else by "rational", "little babies", and "Care Bears", you might want to elaborate what your arguments are more specifically and explain your reasoning. Just saying that the characters are little babies doesn't really tell us anything in particular about the characters, except that you think lowly of them.
