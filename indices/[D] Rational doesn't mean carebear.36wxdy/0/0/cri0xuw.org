That all the humans in the story except for the confessor appear unable to deal with the revelation that some aliens do things in alien ways. Crying at a funeral is completely different from mourning the baby-eater children. The baby-eaters are fine with things the way they are, it's not a big deal. They're certainly not committing genocide.
