Well, ok, /really/ hedonistic hipsters.

But the thing is, I generally think that "horror", as a genre, seems to rest more in tone than content. You can try to make a story about space-aliens /horrifying/, but I think you might have better luck making it /scary/ if you want people to be scared /on reflection when they think of the alternatives/.

Whereas lots of horror seems designed to play with our moral taboos and go /tut-tut/ without actually /examining the possible alternatives/.

"Oh noes, our essential humanity has been robbed from us by this unwanted change that leaves us completely alive, comparatively happy (even by our old definition), and with our individuality preserved! This is /horrifying/, unlike the eternal sadistic torture of /I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream/, which would actually have /hurt/."

(Please note that this does not apply to horror scenarios that genuinely include enforced pain-experience, such as being possessed by a demon, or that include, let us point out, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust][Implied Holocausts]].)

But the point is, Lovecraft can be read as the ravings of a really racist guy worried about non-white humans and totally not-white-human /aliens/ sharing the same universe as him, in which case the basic problem is that he collapses into an irrational puddle of goo instead of thinking clearly about Horrifying Evils whose invasion can be prevented by, say, burying certain books of lore where nobody will ever find them. Likewise to much of Stephen King.
