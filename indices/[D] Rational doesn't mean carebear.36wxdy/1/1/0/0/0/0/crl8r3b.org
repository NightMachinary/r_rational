  It can be hard to show the horror inherent in a universe (or a being) that genuinely does not care about humanity

Ok, look, I /know/ that True Horror seems to be the Universal Human Experience I'm totally missing (Lovecraft et al tends to make me break out laughing and I will regularly swear in the form of "$ADJECTIVE CTHULHU!"), but [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin][this is the universe we already had in the first place]]. Teaching and signalling that owning up to what was already true is /horrifying/ does not exactly /help/ anything.
