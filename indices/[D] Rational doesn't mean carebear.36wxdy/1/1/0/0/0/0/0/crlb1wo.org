Pretending that what we have is /good/ isn't /better/. If the universe is a terrible place, I desire to believe the universe is a terrible place.

But yeah, as I say, it's hard to get across stuff like "the AI does not hate you or love you, but you are made of atoms it can use for something else" or "you and everyone you know and your entire species will die" in a way that really appeals viscerally to our emotions. I like it when it works, though.

Incidentally, have you actually /read/ much Lovecraft? Because Cthulhu is pretty much a minor character, and it's not all squid-monsters-deal-SAN-damage in the original stuff. Most things that reference Lovecraft aren't /cosmic horror/, it's just a reference.
