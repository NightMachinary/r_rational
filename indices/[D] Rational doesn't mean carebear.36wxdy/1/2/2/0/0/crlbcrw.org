None of that would be true if I am the lord commander of said human city. Orcs would be let in the city insofar I can feasibly counteract racism. Once we are prosperous enough humanoiditarian aid would be lent to orc tribes that accept it. And if manhood rituals are performed on young orclings against their will the next step would be introducing education, economic alternatives and maybe a dragon hunting campaign, if dragons are just oversized flying dinosaurs with firebreath instead of sentient beings. If the orcs are tribal and my city-state growing all of this should be relatively doable in the long term.
