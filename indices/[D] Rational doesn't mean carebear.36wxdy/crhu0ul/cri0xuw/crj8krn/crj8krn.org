  The baby-eaters are fine with things the way they are, it's not a big deal. They're certainly not committing genocide.

Were the Maya correct in their human sacrifice? They didn't consider it a big deal and where fine with the ways things are. If you had the ability, wouldn't you try to stop them?

There are plenty of examples where horrible atrocities happened and everyone (at the time) was okay with that. I don't particularly feel like that makes those things okay.
