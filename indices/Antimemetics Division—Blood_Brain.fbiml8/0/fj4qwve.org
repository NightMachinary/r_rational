  Inevitably, like an uncounted number of newcomer Foundationers before him, Wheeler loses a significant number of hours browsing the entries. The Foundation has a specific and recognisable house style, which is to describe even the most mind-bogglingly weird anomalies in absolutely mundane, factual terms. [...] it makes for bizarrely compelling reading.

I like that, in-universe, actual Foundationers read the SCP entries for fun. Bizarrely compelling indeed.
