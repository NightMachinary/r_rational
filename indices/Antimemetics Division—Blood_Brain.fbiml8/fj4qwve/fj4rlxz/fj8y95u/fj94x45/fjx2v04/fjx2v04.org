That likely means it's restricted to O-level directors and employees of other sites than 19. However, you're right - some info is redacted because the words are anomalous and shouldn't even be written down and/or read. For example, in the file numbered [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo][4000]], there are several times they reference somebody repeatedly referring to The Unnamable Gateway In The Chimney by a certain name, but they cannot write that name down, so they redact part of it. I think it's likely that O-level people wouldn't even see that, because it wasn't even written down originally.
