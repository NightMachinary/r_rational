(spoilers for this chapter)

Wheeler is just the best. I love that he kills 3125's avatar using the same weapon George Barsin refused to use because he wanted to spare the kid. Without any training, Wheeler is doing better than most SCP agents before him.

This story is amazing. It nails that SCP ambiance in a way few other stories do.

Also, I guess this confirms satellites still exist.
