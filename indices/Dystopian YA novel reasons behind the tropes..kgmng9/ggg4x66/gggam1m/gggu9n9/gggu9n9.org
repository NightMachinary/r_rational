What makes the YAs unrealistic isn't "teenager saves the day." It's "person totally outside the power structure suddenly gets in charge."

Alexander the Great was a teenager when he defeated and claimed the Persian Empire; Octavian Augustus was a teenager when he challenged Mark Anthony for Rome.

But neither of them were outsiders; they were inheritors, born to power.

Nobodies do sometimes take over. Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang began as a literal beggar. But that was a rise over decades of civil war chaos in China.

TBF, you do get "teen celebrity issue speaker." But I think nobody is going to confuse Greta Thunberg with Katniss Everdeen.
