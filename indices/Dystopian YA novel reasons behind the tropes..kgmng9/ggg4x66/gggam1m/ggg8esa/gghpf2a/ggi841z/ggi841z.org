I do understand the majority of these claims, but why oh why do they all suck at the romantic subplot. Seriously, they can't write teenage romance to save their lives. Perhaps it's because in these sorts of plots, teenage romance would not rationally happen, or at the very least not love triangles. Also every teenager wants to feel loved and appreciated without having to work for it. Having two guys attracted to you because you are special and not having to work for their affections is at least from many of these writer's perspectives a teenage girl's dream. Also many of these issues with characterization come from the fact of trying to make the character relatable to too large of an audience which has the nasty side effect of not having enough of a defined personality. So that way any teenage girl can identify with the character. I seriously read a ya dystopian novel and didn't realize that the protagonist was a guy halfway through the book, I forget the title.
