Reading this reminded me why I think The Hunger Games series, despite its obvious flaws, remains the best example of popular YA fiction.

The entire point of the last book is how it isn't really Katniss that brings down the Capitol - she's just a figure-head the leadership of District 13 uses to rally the other Districts in their own war against the Capitol. The books manages to deconstruct the 'Teenage Saviour' trope and play it straight, at the same time - Katniss is just a piece of propaganda in a wider war machine. District 13 uses her to promote the war effort in almost the exact same way the marketing campaign used posters of Jennifer Lawrence to promote the movies. She really is, in the end, just a souped up, more effective version of Greta Thunberg.

The books even manage to deconstruct the classic 'love triangle' plot as well - all of the 'forced' romance is actually 'forced' in-universe, a ploy used to make the main characters more interesting to the Capitol in the exact same way it was meant to make the books more interesting to the target demographic.

Sometimes it really does feel like The Hunger Games managed to take all of the classic tropes of the YA Dystopia genre and take them to another, deeper, more introspective level... and then all the copy-cats that followed just played them straight and slowly ran the genre into the ground.
