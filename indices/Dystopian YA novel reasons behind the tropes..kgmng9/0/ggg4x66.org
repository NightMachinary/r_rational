Many of them are in service to appealing to teenagers and providing drama that would be appropriate. From an entirely Doylist approach:

1. The protagonist needs to be roughly their age so they can best identify with them. Thus, there needs to be no sensible adults to handle the conflicts that drive the plot.\\
2. The protagonist should be special in a way that the reader can relate to, and equally "misunderstood" by others. This is why loners or people more complex than the boxes that society tries to force them into are common.\\
3. Dystopias are about fundamentally unhappy societies with inequitable power structures, and teens can really relate to that, because of middle/high school. Not being treated with respect by tyrants especially.\\
4. The story should be action packed, and there should be someone for the protagonist to fight.\\
5. The initial powerlessness of the protagonist exists to give them a chance to "fight back," and a touch of nihilism helps, which is why often their antagonists are people just like them, equally unfairly thrust into the situation, but making it worse. Kind of like their classmates at school.\\

And so this is why most dystopian youth fiction has some sort of element of pitting young people against one another at the behest of an oppressive authority.

That and also the fact that everyone is shamelessly ripping off Battle Royale, because it's awesome.
