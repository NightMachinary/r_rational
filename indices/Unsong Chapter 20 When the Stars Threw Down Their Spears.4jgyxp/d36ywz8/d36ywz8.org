Scott said [[http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/144421318151/how-much-of-the-roles-and-characters-of-archangels][here]] that he switched Uriel with Sandalphon for a bunch of complicated reasons he didn't want to say. I was bored and looked it up, even though I probably won't get it.

Scott uses 10 archangels, the jewish version (kabbalah and stuff he uses in the story), but in Eastern Orthodox, there are 7 archangels, one of which is Uriel. He's an archangel throughout Christianity, but not in Judaism. His name also means "Light of God". (I've used [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archangel][this]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_angelic_hierarchy][this]] so far.)

Of the ten [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephirot][Sephirot]], Sandalphon is Malchuth. In that link, Scott uses that first set, but with different spellings. Malchuth is "Kingship". It is the one sephirot on the bottom of the diagram. Unlike the other Sephirot, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malkuth][Malchuth]] is an attribute of God that does not emanate from Him directly. It rather emanates from God's creation. It is the furthest from the Divine Light.

It's not the physical world though. There are the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Worlds][four worlds of Adam Kadmon]] that Uriel mentions. The lowest world is Assiah, whose dominant sephirot is Malchuth. Assiah is the concealment of God. The lower part of that is Assiah Gashmi, physical existence.

So I guess whatever Archangel corresponds with Malchuth must be the one to cut off the divine light. Sandalphon doesn't seem to do much, but Uriel's name is "Light of God" and he does a bunch of stuff. So it makes sense to put him there to control how the Divine Light enters Assiah Gashmi, the physical world, and thus all the other stuff.

That probably isn't it, but it's still some very interesting kabbalistic correspondences about Uriel and his role in Adam Kadmon.

Note: I know nearly nothing about religion, especially judaism/kabbalah. All this was taken from Unsong and Wikipedia.

edit: Thamiel means Duality in God according the Qliphoth/Kelipot. It's neat because Scott's split Lucifer/Satan/Sataniel from Thamiel. Interesting...
