This chapter made me feel the same way I did when I was reading Fine Structure, which makes me nervous. Most people seem to like FS, but while it started out interesting to me I kind of hated it by the end. Not that it's badly written, I've actually liked some of qntm's other work, the story just went in directions I didn't like and I cared less and less about the characters as it went on. I don't want to repeat that experience with this story.
