  “GO AWAY,” Uriel repeated. “OR I WILL TURN YOU INTO NUMBERS.”

This is obviously the best part.

Also, someone in the comments mentioned how Uriel spoke lowercase until he flared. There was also talk about Raziel looking in the opposite direction of Sataniel, for the Right Hand of God. In the direction of Heaven (Neil Armstrong).

So I thought, well, in the RHOG interlude, Kesey spoke in uppercase. Is Uriel the RHOG or channeling him? Maybe there wasn't a physical RHOG, considering what happened to Armstrong, and by channeling the Divine Light, Uriel became him. I don't know, but it's an interesting idea.

I'm gonna reread the chapter that Uriel fought Thamiel in.

Edit: It seems that they're equals in that. It was not all out war, just some battling, which Uriel was not good at. It was interesting that they both used words (I can't remember what they're called) to fight, completely unlike in this chapter. It really does seem like Uriel is the RHOG now.

Also, I'm probably gonna want to learn the Hebrew alphabet, to understand this better. Then reread it. Then, after Summer Break, when I take a Myth & Bible class, I'll reread it again, understanding that lore better.

Damn this chapter was good.

Edit 2: Forgot to add this: Comet West came from above. Maybe he has something to do with that Heavenly Power.
