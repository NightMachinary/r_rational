From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel][wikipedia]]:

#+begin_quote
  1 Enoch portrays Azazel as responsible for teaching people to make weapons and cosmetics, for which he was cast out of heaven. 1 Enoch 8:1--3a reads:

  #+begin_quote
    And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates; and made known to them the metals [of the earth] and the art of working them; and bracelets and ornaments; and the use of antimony and the beautifying of the eyelids; and all kinds of costly stones and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray and became corrupt in all their ways.

However, I wouldn't be surprised if there are multiple angels/demons/whatever in scripture who have taught overlapping things to humans - I am pretty sure there's lots of overlapping magisteria. I was mostly joking. It really doesn't matter.

I was only fixated on Azazel because another piece of fiction I read some time ago had a reference to him teaching use of cosmetics...
