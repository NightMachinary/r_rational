I for one expect things to speed up again in the next chapter or two. With Milo and his party meeting Bellatrix, He-who-shall-not-be-named using Milo's body and powers (which already look like they will make Imperius look like a toy). With Snape as headmaster playing both sides; Hannah's inevitable clash with Hermione, Harry, and Ron over whether Milo is good or bad (complicated by the evil twin); and the entire thing degenerating to all out war where Hannah and co. are chased from safehouse to safehouse waiting for Milo's return to save the day; there is a lot of potential in the next few chapters.

That said, this chapter was particularly slow. I think it tried to tell too many different (too-short) stories. If the author feels like revising, I think all of these stories should be placed closer to their respective context. With two entirely different worlds, I not sure it makes sense dramatically to interleave their events to this degree. I spent most of each just trying to place it into the right context. Just pick a world and write a chapter just on what's happening there.

Also I'm a bit confused on how Harry & co. started thinking of Milo as a bad guy. Also, what happened to the rest of the year? Was there no interaction between them and Hannah (and why does Hermione have the rat instead of Hannah)? It feels like there is some missing exposition there.
