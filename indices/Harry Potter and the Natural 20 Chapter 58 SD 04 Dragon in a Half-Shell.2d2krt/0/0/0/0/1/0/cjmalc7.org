I was thinking he did some stuff before then. He was obviously affected by it in several instances, even to the point of making defect magical items. I'm thinking he did stuff that was seemingly inconspicuous at the time but seems obviously stupid or evil in hindsight, thus leading to Hermiones conclusion and the debate about him. If he did overtly evil stuff they would have called him on it, but this way it would only be apparent in hindsight, and maybe somewhat shaky.
