I sort of assumed that the rat thing is supposed to be a sign that Hermione also sort of hangs on to the Milo they knew in some way, but you're right that it makes little sense.

As for why they suddenly think that Milo is a bad guy, it might have something to do with behind the scenes stuff Voldemort has done in Milos body, which wouldn't count as missing exposition.
