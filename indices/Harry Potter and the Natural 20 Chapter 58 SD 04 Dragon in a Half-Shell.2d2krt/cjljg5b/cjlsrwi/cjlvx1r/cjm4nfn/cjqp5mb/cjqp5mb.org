I'm confused by

#+begin_quote
  stuff Voldemort has done in Milos body
#+end_quote

My reading was that Voldemort was already back in corporeal form (as his young self) when he tortured and then murdered Milo. So Milo's body isn't doing anything apart from decaying in the Chamber of Secrets.

Did I miss something? Do I need to go and re-read it?
