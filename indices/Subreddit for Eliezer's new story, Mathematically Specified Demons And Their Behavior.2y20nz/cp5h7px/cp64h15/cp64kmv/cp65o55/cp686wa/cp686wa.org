I actually haven't read it, but here's what a MathFiction profile about it says:

  The mathematical references are frequent and explicit. For instance:

  Quote from the Laundry Files: The theorem is a hack on discrete number theory that simultaneously disproves the Church-Turing hypothesis (Wave if you understood that) and worse, permits NP-complete problems to be converted in to P-complete ones. This has several consequences, starting with screwing over most cryptography algorithms -- translation: all your bank account [sic] belong to us -- and ending with the ability to computationally generate a Dho-Nha geometry curve in real time. This latter item is just slightly less dangerous than allowing nerds with laptops to wave a magic wand and turn them into hydrogen bombs at will.

  It is these "Dho-Nha geometry curves" which allow beings to be summoned forth. Later, the mathematics is "explained" a bit more as we are witnessing a controlled summoning during a class for staff at the Laundry:

  Quote from the Laundry Files: That's not to say that it's safe, though -- you can kill yourself quite easily by treating the equipment with disrespect. Just in case you've forgotten, this current is carrying fifteen amps at six hundred volts, and the baseboard is insulated and oriented correctly along a north-south magnetic axis. The geometry we're using for this run is a modified Minkowski space that we can derive by setting pi to four; there's no fractal dimension involved, but things are complicated slightly because the space to which we're mapping this diagram has a luminiferous aether.

  More than half of the published book focuses on this very mathematical plotline, and then it switches at the end to a different story (on the quantum mechanics of gorgonism!)
