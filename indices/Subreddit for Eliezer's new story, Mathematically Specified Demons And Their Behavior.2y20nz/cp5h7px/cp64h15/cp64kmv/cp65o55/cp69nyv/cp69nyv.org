There's not a huge amount of math. It's partly there for flavor, and partly there as a worldbuilding dynamic (computers are dangerous, and sometimes software engineers think up some math that was better left unthought). I really, really like the series, for whatever that's worth to you. Mostly it plays with the spy genre, rather than being overly mathy, or teaching much new math.

I think that in concept it's what EY would like, except that he doesn't hold a high opinion of Stross's work.
