  I think that in concept it's what EY would like, except that he doesn't hold a high opinion of Stross's work.

Well, Stross basically spends his singularity-focused works holding an unfavorable mirror up to Silicon Valley culture -- or at least, that's what I remember Stross saying. Practically anyone who was a part of high-tech culture over the past 20 years (I was on Slashdot when it was still cool!) is going to feel a little /targeted/ by Stross. But, well, /why not?/ Techno-nerd culture deserves an outsider's comedic eye as much as anything else -- we just don't deserve to be [[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-cover-story-how-silicon-valley-shapes-our-future-a-1021557.html][uniformly tarred and feathered as a malign conspiracy to take over the world]].

I really enjoyed /Rapture of the Nerds/, but in the same way that I enjoyed /Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/. It was funny, and meant to be funny, and plainly not meant to inspire the reader to actually /believe in/ the ideas being presented. Whereas I think, if I remember a link from an [[/r/rational]] thread properly, that EY likes his futurist fiction to pass on the "secret" to how one casts the True Patronus Charm.

So anyway... HOLY SHIT THERE'S A SITE CALLING ITSELF MathFiction!?

  There's not a huge amount of math. It's partly there for flavor, and partly there as a worldbuilding dynamic (computers are dangerous, and sometimes software engineers think up some math that was better left unthought). I really, really like the series, for whatever that's worth to you. Mostly it plays with the spy genre, rather than being overly mathy, or teaching much new math.

Maybe-read, then. Because I really do anticipate hugely enjoying the /Slayers/ light-novel series.
