  Maybe the most critical task over the next 5 years is causing this to happen to the Friendly AI problem, and maybe one way to try that would be for my next work to be titled Mathematically Specified Demons And Their Behavior.

  It's making me want my next story to be called Mathematically Lawful Demons and Their Behaviors. Because if I could harness like 10% of the effort that goes into scrutinizing every single line of an HPMOR chapter and suggesting wiser character moves, into scrutinizing and inventing AI designs, the world would be a safer place than it is now.

Even though EY said that mostly as a joke, I think it's actually a pretty cool idea and maybe we should make it a reality even if Eliezer doesn't write it. Combining math and fiction sounds pretty cool and I envision it would be something similar to Fine Structure, especially to the fights between four-dimensional creatures in Fine Structure.
