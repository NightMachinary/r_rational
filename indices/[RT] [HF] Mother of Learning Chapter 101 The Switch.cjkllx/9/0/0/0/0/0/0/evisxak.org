One of the exercises Xvim taught him was how to meditate to refine ambient mana into his personal mana reserves faster than a passive regen. This speeds up regeneration, but the amount isn't that exaggerated.

As for why he doesn't make a bunch of simulacrums to cheat the system, I would guess that's because the soul has limits. It makes sense. There's only so much ambient mana his soul can process at one time, regardless of the amount of bodies.
