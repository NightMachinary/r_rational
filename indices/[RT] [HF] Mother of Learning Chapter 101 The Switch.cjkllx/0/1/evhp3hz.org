I'll be "that guy" and disagree; this chapter was really boring. Nothing pivotal happened. Nothing surprising happened. No character development. There didn't feel like there was any real challenge or loss. It was just tracing the plot from point A to point B.

/shrugs/ I'm sure things will get better soon. But I would not be suprised if, once all is said and done, this chapter is effectively able to be summarized in 3 paragraphs.
