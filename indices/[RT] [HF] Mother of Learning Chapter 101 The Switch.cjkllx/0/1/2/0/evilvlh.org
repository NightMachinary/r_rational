Those combat capabilities were by and large all things we've seen before, and nothing shown had any impact. The heroes faced no setbacks and suffered no losses. It was all superficial.

I don't see any characterization in the fiance or her family we didn't really know before, either. They weren't particularly interesting before, they're not particularly interesting now? What exactly do you see as new here?
