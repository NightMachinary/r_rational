I think it's more like stretching out the soul to encompass the simulacrum at creation, through the connection that constantly feeding them mana to maintain their form provides. As long as you keep feeding them mana, the connection is maintained and they're still a part of your soul, so soul attacks would work and technically your soul is in all of them. Your mind, however, is always in your original body.

Unless you're Zorian.
