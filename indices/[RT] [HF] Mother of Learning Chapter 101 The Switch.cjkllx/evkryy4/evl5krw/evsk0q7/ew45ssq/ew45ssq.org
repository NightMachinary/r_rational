Only issue there is that if the crown can be used without the soul marker, why wouldn't QI add himself into the loop? Even if he had no intention of trying to escape, with six restarts he could definitely find a way to cause Zach problems, and if he was added permanently his success would be guaranteed.

The spell that added Zorian did significant damage to Zach's soul, and based on QI's suicide attack the loop doesn't take him out to heal, he was just being hidden by his gaurdian. Just repeating the soul merge spell six restarts in a row would cripple Zach for years, and with time to prepare he could probably do something stronger. The voidsoul deer permanent enhancement worked on Zach, so clearly the marker's protection doesn't prevent permanent changes.

I think if QI could use the crown himself, Zach would have ended up in a coma until the time loop ran out of power.
