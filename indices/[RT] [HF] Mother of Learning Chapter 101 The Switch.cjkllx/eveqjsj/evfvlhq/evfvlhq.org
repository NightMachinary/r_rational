The Zorian replicas are using golem bodies, both because it's more mana-efficient and more durable than using ectoplasmic bodies. Presumably all those human volunteers are seeing is a blank golem face, not Zorian's?

On the other hand, I wonder if the reason Red Robe is staying cloaked is that he's hoping to keep his identity secret from the authorities. He didn't replace his non-time-loop form, he's in a fresh body. Whether he succeeds or fails, that second form that's just a down-on-his-luck lawyer is still out there, and RR might prefer his alternate staying free of government persecution. If RR loses, Zorian and Zach would probably show mercy and not report him, since, you know, he hasn't technically done anything wrong.

On the other hand, we also know that the red robe itself is covered in high-level wards and stuff. Maybe my speculation is wrong and he's just taking advantage of that so he didn't have to spend time the month making new ones.
