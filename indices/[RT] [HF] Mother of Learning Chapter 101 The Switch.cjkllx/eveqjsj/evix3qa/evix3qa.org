Red Robe spent much longer in the time loop than Zorian, and he had help from Quatach-ichl, who is, in addition to being really skilled, is also an actually good teacher. He should be a really good mage, but he still isn't a match for Zach or Zorian.

We never see him go toe-to-toe with Zach, but we're told Zach has beaten him before.

We do see Zorian and Red Robe fight (several times), and Zorian wins. Zorian is clearly an archmage at this point, but direct combat is one of his weakest skills. He definitely shouldn't be able to dominate Red Robe, the fact that he's winning at all implies that he was much more effective at taking advantage of the time loop.

Zorian was also doing other things besides self-improvement. He spent a lot of time investigating the invasion and finding the imperial artifacts (each of which people have spent years searching for).
