I assumed that was either a personal ward or the robes (which we know are pretty impressive defensive magic items), hadn't considered that it might be connected to his strength later.

I was thinking that a regular permanent enhancement was unlikely because exiting the loop would break it (like how Zorian's unraveled) and he attacked Zach and the aranea immediately, but maybe Panaxeth could prevent that issue.
