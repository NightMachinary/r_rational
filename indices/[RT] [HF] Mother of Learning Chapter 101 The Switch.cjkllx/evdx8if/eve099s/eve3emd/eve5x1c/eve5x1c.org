Can I get a reference for that? The original bio said something to the effect of "The first arc was 26 chapters and the second arc was 28; the third arc is planned to be about the same length," and the author's [[https://www.fictionpress.com/u/804592/nobody103][current FictionPress bio]] still (incorrectly) states: "As of chapter 91, there should be 8-10 more chapters before the end of the story."
