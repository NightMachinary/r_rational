The rule of magic in this universe is loose enough so that when I read RR simulacrum is not easily dismissible I just thought, "Of course a soul construct can be reinforced." I think the effort building magic system over 100 available chapters really paid off in this final battle.

And head on clash between Zorian and RR that result in their surrounding melted, warped, and shattered? Ooooh boy, what a show of powAH! (Did Zorian really afford the mana cost?)
