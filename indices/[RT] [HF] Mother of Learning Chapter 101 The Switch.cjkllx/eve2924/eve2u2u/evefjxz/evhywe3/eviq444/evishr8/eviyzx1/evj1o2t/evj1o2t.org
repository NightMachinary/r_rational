Even if linked, the soul is just one. Simulacrum has no soul. The pool a simulacrum can use, and consequently a regen a simulacrum can enjoy, came from that one soul. If mana regen is tied to mental capability, it's possible for simulacrum to improve regen. Simulacrum spell has a thinking construct in it after all. But it's not. Hence, simulacrum does not improve mana regen.
