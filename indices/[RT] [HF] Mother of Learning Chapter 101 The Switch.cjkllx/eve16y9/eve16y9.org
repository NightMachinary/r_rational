Really? Really? That title for this chapter? Goddamn it.

Still, unless this battle goes on a lot longer then they've pretty much won.

Aside from the free mana though, I wonder why they transported the mansion there. I mean, they had a portal in the basement they could use to get back to Cyoria, so unless they're worried they can't teleport their sacrifices out of their own underground Cyorian base for some reason, then I don't see why they teleported the entire mansion there. I mean, I get why Sudomir would want to preserve his housewife (geddit), but why would moving to Cyoria help anything?

And finally the million dollar question: Where is RR and QI?
