well since this fight needs to last at least a day, it likely needs to be linked to ibasa or so they can keep getting reinforcement. theres also still the one in koth, but each one has shown some ability to hold one steady by itself. it also should help to have all areas in need of defense in one area to keep from spreading too thin.

what they don't know is they're all now in Zorian's web. mwahahaha
