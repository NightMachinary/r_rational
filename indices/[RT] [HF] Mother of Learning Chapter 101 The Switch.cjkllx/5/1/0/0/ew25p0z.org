QI's bodies are black skeletons that are incredibly hard to damage, regenerate themselves (Zach cuts his arm off and all QI does is touch it to his shoulder and it heals), and he has several of them. I think that is a function of the bodies themselves and a result of the necromancy QI used to construct them. I think it's most similar to Zorian's simulacrums having the strength of their golem bodies.

That wouldn't work for RR. My best for his physical strength is that it's because his body was created by Panaxeth. The cultists originally wanted to summon him to reform their bodies, and he remade Silverlake as a young woman. There's no reason he couldn't give RR a body that is perfected beyond what's humanly possible. (And he has the incentive to do so, since it would make his escape more likely)

It could also be that he doesn't have enhanced strength, he just has a way to make his simulacrum stronger than his real body. He is a soul mage, and we've seen Damien create a giant body around himself, so making a physically enhanced simulacrum should be possible.
