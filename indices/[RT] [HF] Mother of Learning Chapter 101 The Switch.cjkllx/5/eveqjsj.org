What I don't understand is how could Red Robe get so powerful? Our duo has done nothing but improve their magic over the time loop while Red Robe was trying to get politically savvy and stuff on top of amassing personal magic. But he goes toe to toe with Zorian / Zach? I guess being tutored by our favourite Lich helps a lot?

A lot happened this chapter but no real progress was made on Zach/Zorian's end. Nobody really died except for goons. I guess we're in for a long battle sequence which is good.

Zorian going ultra hive mind with multiple bodies was cool. But yeah he is becoming less human each day. Dr Manhattan style. He will be in a lot of 3somes with himselves and his future wife lol. Just hope he doesn't use a golem body when that time comes.

It is not mentioned that Zorian is using a disguise. Now a looot of people saw his face and there is no way as hell he will be able to protect his identity from interested parties. Secret is out amigos. Just set up the Avengers and be done with it.

Where is the aranea?
