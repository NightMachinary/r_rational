I don't think so. Zach had the upperhand when they fought 1 on 1 in the time loop. I remember Zach lost some loops while in soul damage coma but not after Red Robe mind raped him. I might be misremembering this but I'm sure even if Zach lost some loops after the mind rape it was a few months at most not years. And Red Robe spent some of that time experimenting with political situations and getting intel on world governments.

Red Robe left timeloop not long after that and Zach and Zorian spent years (including time chamber and army of experts) furthering their magic. And when they leave the timeloop he is still their equal. I think he should still be powerful but not like this.
