Nope. Current best guess is that either Quatach-ichl or Panaxeth modified the temporary marker.

Zach could have used the crown on RR, who then went to Quatach-ichl, who modified it. Jornak had connections to the cult, so if Zach stole the crown (likely by brute-forcing strategies over many restarts like he did vs Oganj), the RR could have gotten in contact with Quatach and offered the crown back if he would adjust the marker.

The MOST likely possibility would be that Zach and RR originally found the Sovereign Gate and entered it together. They might not have even needed the keys to do so (the gate was barred because RR left, if might have been unbarred originally). If Panaxeth made the offer to RR to release him in exchange for modifying the marker and a way out, RR would have taken it. The reason we dont see Panaxeth make the offer to modify anyone's marker later is that there was no reason to. RR had already optimized the invasion, leaving Silverlake inside the loop would just create the risk of Zach preventing her from ever leaving or of Zorian mind wiping her. Modifying Zorian's marker (when Panaxeth makes the second offer) would be even worse, since they're so close to being able to leave on their own. Giving Zorian extra time would just take away the only leverage Panaxeth had.

Speaking of, that offer to let Zorian with no strings attached in exchange for mind wiping Zach was a terrible deal. Panaxeth would be much better off with only Zach escaping than only Zorian escaping.
