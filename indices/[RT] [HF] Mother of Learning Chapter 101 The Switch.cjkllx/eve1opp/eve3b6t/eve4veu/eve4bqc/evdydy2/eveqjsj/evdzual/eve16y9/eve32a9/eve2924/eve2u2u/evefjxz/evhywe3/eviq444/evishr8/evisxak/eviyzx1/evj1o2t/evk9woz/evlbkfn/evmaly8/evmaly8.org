This has been discussed before and firmly resolved including word of author. The simulacrums /can/ use his meditation techniques to maximize ambient mana assimilation rate, and that boost is greater than the cost of a single simulacrum. However, the bottleneck is the soul's ability to accept it, so putting multiple simulacrums on the job gives no additional benefit; one is enough. And it's boring, so even one simulacrum might not be keen (though he has mental focus techniques now).
