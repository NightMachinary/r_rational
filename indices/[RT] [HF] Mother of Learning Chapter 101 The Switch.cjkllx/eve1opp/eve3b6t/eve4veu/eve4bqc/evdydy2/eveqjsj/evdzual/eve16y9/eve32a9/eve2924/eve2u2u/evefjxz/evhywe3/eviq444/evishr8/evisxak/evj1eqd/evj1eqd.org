No no no. The meditation Xvim taught him is the limit of four times I talked about. The number four, BTW, is not checked. Just me has faint memory about it. You can check on Worldbuilding site (wordpress one) about mana well. It's not on the chapter.

And the soul has no limit as to how many simulacrum one can cast. The limit is mana maintenance. Cast too many of them, their cost will soon overwhelm your mana regeneration. Cast even more, your mana pool get exhausted. If the caster has no more mana to maintain a simulacrum, then the simulacrum will fizzle out of existence.

I wonder where you read about soul-limit and simulacrum refining mana. Well, I can suspect you derive mana refining from chapter, um, 94? When Zorian enchantment get unraveled. But it's not improving mana regen, it's calming down his mana pool due to soul damage.
