The author has mentioned that Simulacrums can be hit by soul attacks, and that they can do regeneration stuff, but there's a cap that can't be exceeded by making them.

Suppose the max he could absorb is 4 units of mana, converted for use in his body, if he had one body dedicated to absorbing that mana he could absorb 4, or if he had 4 simalcrums which each had 1 mana absorption focus he could absorb 4, but 4 is the max.
