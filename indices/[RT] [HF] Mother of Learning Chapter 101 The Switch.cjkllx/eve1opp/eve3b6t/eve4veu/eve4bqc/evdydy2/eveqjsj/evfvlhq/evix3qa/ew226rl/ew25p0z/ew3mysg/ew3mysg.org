Whatever Red Robe's enhancements are, he had them in the loop. Remember when Zorian shot him soon after he booted Cyoria's aranea out of the loop? He barely reacted outside of shock. This shouldn't come as a surprise.

It could be just a thing with his simulacrums, but I would not be surprised if his real body was just as strong. There are plenty of ways to get inhuman physical power if you are willing. Just look at the mayor and his shifter patchwork. Though that was a bit of a failure, Red Robe could have easily stolen the idea and perfected it.
