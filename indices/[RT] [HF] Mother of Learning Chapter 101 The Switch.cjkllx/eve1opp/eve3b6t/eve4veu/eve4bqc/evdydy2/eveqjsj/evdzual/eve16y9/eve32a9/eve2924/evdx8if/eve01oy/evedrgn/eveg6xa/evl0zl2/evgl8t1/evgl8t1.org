I don't think there's that large a hole. He believed he could cover the whole city with his mind sense putting the sigils up physically, even accounting for graffiti and city authorities ruining some of them. That puts the range of each sigil at maybe a radius of 500 metres, at least? Assuming he put up 200 of them and the city's area is roughly 50 km^{2.} (Not sure if that's a reasonable estimation though, I'm not too certain how to extrapolate a good number for the city's size and I might be underselling it by putting the number of sigils at 200.)
