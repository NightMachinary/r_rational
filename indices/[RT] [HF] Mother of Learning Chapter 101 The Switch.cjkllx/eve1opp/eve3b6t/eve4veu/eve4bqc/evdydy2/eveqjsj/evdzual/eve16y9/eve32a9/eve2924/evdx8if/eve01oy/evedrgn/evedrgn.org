Erm. So Zorian spent a long time putting runes all over the city, the leading theory being that they would help fool Zach into believing everyone died and thus fulfilled the contract. But now there's a large hole in his network due to the mansion teleport. I wonder how that will play out.

Dragon battles yay! I wonder why there was so much focus on the bee attack, chances are it will be important later. Ironbeaks are super unreliable. I figure the mansion got teleported near the rift and the summoning ritual is already set up and ready to be cast as soon as it can. Having all the prep work and defenses done beforehand is the only guess I have as to why they teleported it. I wonder if the dragon mage will care that one of his students died, or if it will piss him off. I was expecting him to be more offended by the skeletal dragon but I guess they aren't very social creatures.

Fun stuff, thanks nobody103!
