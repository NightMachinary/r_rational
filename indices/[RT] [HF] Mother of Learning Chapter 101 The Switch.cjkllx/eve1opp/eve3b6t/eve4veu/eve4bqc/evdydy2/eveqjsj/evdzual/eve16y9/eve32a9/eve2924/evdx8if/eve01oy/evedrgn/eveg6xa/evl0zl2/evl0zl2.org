There really wasn't much focus on the Taramatala estate battle. It got some discussion, but that section was shorter than any of the other things Zorian had simulacrums doing. I think the point of that section was basically to help show the "Zorian is fighting a war on multiple battlefronts at once".

Zorian cares because that's where his family is, but its overall irrelevant to the Panaxeth summoning, which is why it's a short section. The mention that they are trying to capture the gate is relevant though, and could solve Damien's issues. If the Taramatala capture it and use it to branch into intercontinental trade, that solves his Mother's concern.
