A scene I particularly enjoyed was when he reached Sudomir's mind through his bone dragon and succeeded in bringing the latter down, to the utter surprise of all the military personnel surrounding him. It was also the first time that they heard his actual voice in that restart. (Or at least, I'm assuming the latter part, since the author mentioned nothing about the thought-to-voice translator during the battle.)
