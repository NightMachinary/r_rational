...Why on Earth did Sudomir move Iasku Mansion to the place he's trying to obliterate with a primordial? Only makes sense if he left his wife's soul behind, but you'd think there'd be an easier way to do that.

Also, it's pretty much confirmed that Zorian has an angel or something living in his head, and it wasn't just a coincidence that he was included in the time loop. Maybe they put one in the time loop with Zach as a contingency, and Zorian was just in the right place with Quatach Ichl's soul meld.

  He nervously fingered the cube given to him by the angel he summoned, wondering if he should--

  No. No, this wasn't the right time. Using it now would be a mistake. Something in the back of his mind insisted that this was true.

It's been pretty heavily implied, but now it's pretty much guaranteed.

Also, where are Red Robe and Quatach Ichl? They're absence is pretty glaring. Maybe they teleported the children away to the ritual site. But you'd think Z&Z would have someone there just in case, so probably not.
