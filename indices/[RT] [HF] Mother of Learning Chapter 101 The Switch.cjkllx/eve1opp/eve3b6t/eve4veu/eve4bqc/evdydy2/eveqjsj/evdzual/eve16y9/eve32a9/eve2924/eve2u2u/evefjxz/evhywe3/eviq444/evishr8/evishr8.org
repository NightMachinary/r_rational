Simulacrum refining mana? Where did that come from? In-universe, mana regeneration tied to the soul. Without soul, no mana regen. Soul can regen more mana if the ambient mana is rich, up to four times as fast compared to poor environment. Think of it this way, if Simulacrum heighten mana regen, why not Zorian cast 100 Simulacrum and place 90 of them in Cyoria, dedicating themselves to mana regen.
