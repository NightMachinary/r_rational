The space they warped to would have been connected with the mansion ahead of time. Wards, spell formula circle, all the works. It would have been a very involved process, to make sure that it would warp smoothly without damaging the mansion and its contents. So I find it unlikely that it would have switched with Noveda mansion or something. It's probably a random spot outside of the city.
