They are almost certainly in Cyoria, though I wouldn't be surprised if RR showed up at Both personally, he seems like the kind of sadistic asshole that would take hostages /personally/. The reason they teleported To Cyoria was for support from the rest of the troops, QI included, likely also to benefit from the better battle conditions, something makes me think dragons are much better at casting with Ambient Mana than humans so Cyoria is kinda a great spot for them, not to mention Sudomir's wards also draw from ambient mana.

This also begs the question as to what was teleported /out/.
