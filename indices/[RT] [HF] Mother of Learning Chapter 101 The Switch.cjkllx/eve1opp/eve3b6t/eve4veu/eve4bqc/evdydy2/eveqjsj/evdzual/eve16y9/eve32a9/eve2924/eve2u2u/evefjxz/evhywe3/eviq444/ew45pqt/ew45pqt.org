Mana is produced by a soul. But there is also environmental mana welling up from the dungeons. (And from what we learned recently, may be produced by the World Core artifact in the center of the world.)

One of the first things beginning mages learn is how to filter ambient mana into personal mana in their mana pool. This effectively increases their pools mana regeneration, but the increase is dependent on the concentration of ambient mana in their immediate area. (Higher level mana well = better regeneration, but there is a cap. A Level 3 Mana Well can let you use the techniques at full efficiency, and stronger wells just let more mage refill at once.)

And seems to be passive most of the time, and could be done while walking around and doing other things. But Xvim also taught Zorian an active version that is more like meditation and takes concentration and effort but is even more effective.

Simulacrums have a link to the original soul, so they can feed ambient mana at their location into the souls mana storage. One Simulacrum concentrating on filtering mana into the pool would give all the other simulacrums (and original) more mana to work with.

But multiple simulacrums (past the first one) doing the same thing wouldn't help because the soul can only filter so much ambien mana at a time, and they are all sharing the same soul.
