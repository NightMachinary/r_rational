  I'd wager the introduction of rifle corps pisses off mage houses, who previously probably held noble status thanks to being walking artillery barrages/ rifle + fireball volleys.

I think this much is just canon. Mage families used to be the top of the pyramid thanks to the extreme preference of quality over quantity, but firearms upset that balance enormously when suddenly a militia of average Joes with ten hours of training could rival the effectiveness of someone who's spent their life and a mountain of gold in honing their skills.
