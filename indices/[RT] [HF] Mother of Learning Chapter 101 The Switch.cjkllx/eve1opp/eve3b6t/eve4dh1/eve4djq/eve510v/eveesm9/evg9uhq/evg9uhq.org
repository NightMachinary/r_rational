In addition to what others have said, I think he probably sees using guns as cheating. Previously, when two mages fought, the one with more magical power and skill won (excepting prep time, environmental factors, etc.). But guns level that playing field; 10 normal soldiers with guns can beat even a strong mage. It's the equivalent of using an aimbot in a FPS tournament or PEDs in the Olympics.
