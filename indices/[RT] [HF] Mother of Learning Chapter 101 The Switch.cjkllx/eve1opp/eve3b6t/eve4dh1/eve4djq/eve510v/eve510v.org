Oh yeah, I understand his social dislike of them, I'm wondering as to why that wording? Why Honorless? It is just such a specific early to word it, Zorian is honestly a rather honourable fellow, he isn't one to betray his friends and he has a pretty strict code of ethics that he has yet to properly break. Its more of a nitpick than a question or a discussion point.
