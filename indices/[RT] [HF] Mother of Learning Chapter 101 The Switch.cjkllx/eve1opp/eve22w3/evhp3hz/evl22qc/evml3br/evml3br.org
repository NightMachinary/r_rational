Eh, to everything there is a season. There's a time and place to have your main character get thoroughly pranked by a version of themselves from a few hours in the future, when the earlier self doesn't yet know Time Turners exist. There's a time and place to have your characters face the terrible choice of whether or not to go into a burning, structurally unsound building in an effort to save people trapped inside. And there's a time and place for the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny.
