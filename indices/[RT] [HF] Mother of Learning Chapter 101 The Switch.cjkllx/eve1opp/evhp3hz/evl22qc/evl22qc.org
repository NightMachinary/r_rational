I also didn't feel very invested in the chapter, and reading your comment made me realize why. Yeah, I feel the same way. There has been an incredible amount of build-up to get to this point, and yet so far it hasn't felt too different compared to most of the latest time-loop battles. I know there should be a sense of finality coming from the lack of time loop, but I'm just so used to Zorian stomping through all opposition without any real set-backs by now that I'm not really feeling it.
