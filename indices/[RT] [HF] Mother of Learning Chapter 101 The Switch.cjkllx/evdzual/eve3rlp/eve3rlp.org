I'm most excited when reading Quatach Ichl ambushed the duo at a tavern in broad daylight. But I don't think it would make a very exciting illustration, unless the artist is REALLY good. Their escape from Royal Armory on top of skeletal crocodile would make very exciting illustration, but it has little relevance to the whole story. Hmmm, how about when the duo try to initiate a negotiation with Quatach Ichl while flaunting his snatched crown? A wheat field scarred and burned, a Hydra much too big than it has right to be, bodies strewn, and eagle mounted troops can only watch in frustration from afar. Epic scene that I can't begin to understand how to pour it into a 2D scape.
