Remember that Zorian seems well on his way to capture the Ibasan base, which would mean that the invasion force would lose their connection between Cyoria and Iasku Mansion. They still need to take the shifter children from the mansion to the ritual site, so they need a way to get there. If they can't use the warp gate anymore, then the solution is to bring the children directly closer to the city. but I agree that it's a huge gamble on Sudomir's part, considering that his wife and his life's work reside inside those walls and he wants those to remain intact.
