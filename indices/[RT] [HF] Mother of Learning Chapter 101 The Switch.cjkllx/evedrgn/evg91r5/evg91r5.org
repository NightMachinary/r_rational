I seem to recall that Sudomir's undead dragon wasn't literally a dragon corpse, but rather a recreation made in their likeness with various bones. I could easily be wrong, mind you. I've read a lot of different stories and might be confusing a few and misremembering the chapters where the dragon was actually introduced.
