The kind of magic Zorian does is usually very subtle, although this chapter makes me rethink that.

Like, mental magic, invisible magic missiles, and a bunch of prep work don't make for a cool action scene.

However, him with his golems, or throwing an invention or potion, or just riding Princess would be interesting.
