An interesting conclusion, that wasn't what I felt was the case, I feel like an angel would have made itself known if it really did exist, such as when RR mind raped zach and erased himself from his mind. I think it is either Zorian's own latent precognitive abilities working much better outside the time loop than inside, and possibly the angels putting a finger on the scales in that regard. I don't think an angel of any particular strength could be present on the mortal plane for an amount of time that would be needed for this endeavour.
