Probably the general disdain for ranged weapons seen throughout history. Sure on paper firing a gun isn't any different then throwing a firebolt at someone, except the firebolt is something you did yourself. While the gun is using help to fight for you. Anyone can pick up a gun and fight not anyone can put in the effort to throw fire bolts.

Or it could be that he just sees guns as beneath wizards, a peasant weapon that true mages to wouldn't dare use.
