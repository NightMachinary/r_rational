Since the last chapter had ended with cliff about family/siblings, I was expecting that this one will be calm-before-storm chapter. Search for shifter brother would also include revelations about Zorian's own brother ( and stuff like why Fortov kept pushing the girl into creeper bush).

Now it seems it will be a part of after-glow. Hopefully most of the loose ends from school arc will be tied up in them.
