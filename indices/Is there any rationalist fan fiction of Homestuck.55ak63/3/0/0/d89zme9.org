  I don't think there's any one problem that can't be overcome. I think it's more that it just has everything wrong for a rational fanfiction. The main villain isn't smart. The setting is overly silly. Things happen because the universe needs them to. Time travel is abundant, limited only by plot.

As someone who has written Homestuck fanfiction, I agree. There's simply too much nonsensoleum.
