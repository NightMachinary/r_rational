I think Doc Scratch implies any Cue Ball is equally damaging. I don't think it has to be that specifc one.

Otherwise you're right, but it's like saying Voldemort is unbeatable because he has seven horcruxes and is magically more powerful than anyone in Harry Potter after book 6. HPMOR still rebalanced both Harry and Voldemort so the fight was still hard as fuck but viable.
