Lord English makes this impossible.

If Lord English is rational, he is unbeatable. He gained his unconditional immortality from breaking the clock that sets the conditions for his immortality--and in the process, absorbing the Clockwork Majyyks that power it. Due to this, his only weaknesses are weapons made using the weight on said clock, a Magic Cue Ball, which grants omniscience.

The main problem is that he has that /on top/ of having more control over time than anyone else in all reality (being the Lord of Time), clockwork majyyk lasers that can kill the already-dead and break reality, the brains of Dirk's Autoresponder, the brawn of Equius and whatever the hell half of Gamzee's got going for him.

There is no foreseeable situation where Lord English can lose without the kind of bullshit that Homestuck presents in order to make the situation possible.

Of course, if you simply write out Lord English (which I wouldn't see as a bad idea), it might be possible. But Sburb is a boring game, and playing it as a munchkin would likely not be that exciting.
