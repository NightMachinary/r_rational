The alchemiter is too broken in a different way; it's simultaneously too deterministic and too chaotic. It's basically based on whether or not... I guess whether or not the item was to be alchemized in the first place?

There's lots of other broken things, like prototyping your own dead dream self in a sprite with some other overpowered thing, but... Lord English did that, too, with ARquiusprite. Plus, Jade's own OPness from that particular game mechanic was replicated somewhat by Lord English due to the way he emerged from Doc Scratch (I'm pretty sure). I forgot to mention that, in fact.

What I mean is: Sburb is hella munchkinable, but Lord English seems to already have done that about as far as it's possible to.

EDIT: Actually, now that I think it, there's some small amount of evidence that English just sort of freezes up upon being confronted with a cue ball weapon (he's noticeably unmoving in both cases where his eyes are stuck at 8s), so that could probably be used, but then you have the opposite problem of it being too easy...
