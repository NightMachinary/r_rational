Lord English is stupid, but he's an extremely persistent and powerful time traveller. He's basically Skynet as portrayed in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], and that's a rationalist fanfiction.

I don't think there's any one problem that can't be overcome. I think it's more that it just has everything wrong for a rational fanfiction. The main villain isn't smart. The setting is overly silly. Things happen because the universe needs them to. Time travel is abundant, limited only by plot.
