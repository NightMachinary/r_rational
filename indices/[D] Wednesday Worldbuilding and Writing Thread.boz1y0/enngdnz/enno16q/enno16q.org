The To Aru Majutsu No Index setting might not be that far off from what you have in mind. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam][In Memoriam]] is a more rational rewrite of the first arc or so, and you might find details to lift from the original such as headsets that allow for dreams to be saved and shared, or the space elevator having magical significance much like a wizard's tower.

I'm not sure how Dresden Files magic would get along with the kind of surveillance state I'm assuming the charter city looks like, but maybe enough people carry around jammers that the mages don't stand out, or the interference mechanism only affects obsolete electronic systems that have since been replaced with optical circuits.

I like the idea of drug-enhanced magic, it's a shame the magical interference would stop them using transcranial magnetic stimulation headsets or brain implants.

With regards to rebranding as superheroes, that seems like it would lead to all sorts of fun conflict. Will the PMCs be out for blood when their Patreon subscribers leave them for the more charismatic capes? Will the other supernatural groups join in with this twist on the masquerade? What are the advantages of presenting oneself as a superhero rather than just being openly magical?

EDIT: Also, the Shadowrun setting might be close enough to give you ideas. The main difference is that magic is publicly known, but after 5 editions there's a lot of material about daily life in an ancap cyberpunk dystopia.
