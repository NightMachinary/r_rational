I often find it really helpful to search in [[/r/AskHistorians]] for relevant keywords in cases like this (though I'm writing about the WW2 era), as you'll often find really detailed answers AND lots of information about sources. Asking questions on there is also helpful, but the more general they are the more likely they are to be answered (i.e. ask "What are the marriage and courtship customs in 1200s Western Europe" rather than "I'm a young Italian man in the 1200s. How do I find a wife?" and waaaay rather than "How would a 30 year old Sicilian farmer who is a widower in 1250 woo the daughter of a blacksmith?")
