The Shadiversity channel on YouTube has several videos that address misconceptions about Medieval Europe. I can't promise that Shad answers all your questions, but I have observed that he has several videos covering castles (including, but not limited to, the effectiveness of castles against magic and dragons).

As an aside, my favorite work of his is the Fantasy Re-armed series, where he postulates on the best medieval weapons for use by/against various fantasy races/creatures.
