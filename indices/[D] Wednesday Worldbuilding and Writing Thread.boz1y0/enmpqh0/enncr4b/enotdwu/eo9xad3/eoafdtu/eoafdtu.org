I don't think Matt's chances are as screwed as you make them out to be. Just to clarify, it's only 6-7 years that they spent in CV, since one of them mentions being 23. Given how messed up the other two that came back ended up being, I personally would think it's pretty understandable that someone I only just started dating didn't want to bring up a massively traumatic event that would make him seem insane.

As for Carl, it's true that he was ultimately the architect of his own downfall, and his obsession with returning to CV alienated the people who might have actually returned him there. *However,* and this is getting just a bit speculatory since the author was pretty vague on the details of their return from CV, but it's implied from Jen's surprise upon being returned, that Matt unilaterally decided they were all going back to CV without any warning or input from the other two.

Hence, Matt is directly responsible for creating a massively traumatic event by deliberately ripping away Carl's support structure, friends, and future in full knowledge of how bad it was for them the first time. I say that Matt's actions directly caused the damage to Carl's mental state that lead to his (essentially) psychotic break, and Matt's inaction by refusing to disclose that he knew there was a way to at least /help/ Carl's trauma by returning them to CV only worsened it, and further exacerbating it by treating their shared experience as a delusion is just icing on the asshole cake.

I do agree Jen was in no position to help Carl while dealing with the PTSD expressing from that same trauma. She absolutely does get a happy ending, which I can't really begrudge like you said, she had plenty on her plate. However, I hesitate to call her a powerful character within the context of the story on Earth, since much of her "happy ending" was created entirely by plot fiat. If not for her happening to come across the mysterious trail (made by who??? never explained) leading to the spellstone, her return to CV would have been entirely at the whims of Matt. Her greatest moment of agency is essentially being triggered by her PTSD and thankfully pointed in the correct direction. Beyond that, she is just coping with her trauma or being manipulated by Matt.
