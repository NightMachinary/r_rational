A Dresden Files RPG, but the city it's set in is a near-future anarchocapitalist charter city with a Pateron-funded military and heroin vending machines in all the for-profit charter schools.

The wizards use the overflowing pharmacopeia to bring about the states of mind they need to best use their magic (e.g. ketamine to use ritual magic). They've figured out ways to allow spirits of intellect to inhabit electronics, making them slow-takeoff AGI.

A considerable plurality of the White Council are trying to rebrand themselves as superheroes. Their leader is the caped alter-ego of the investor who started the charter city.
