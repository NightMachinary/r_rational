I'm running a side plot in a Dungeons and Dragons story where a dragon has begun introducing the gold standard to replace carrying actual gold weights around. The dragon has secretly started creating money without the gold to back it up but is so far keeping inflation low.

In my campaign, the rules as written are the laws that govern the universe rather than an abstraction. So when a resurrection spell says it costs X gold pieces worth of diamonds to cast, that means that whatever quantity of diamonds can currently be purchased with that amount of currency is the quantity required to cast the spell. If the dragon causes steady economic growth while still offering the gold exchange then the value of gold pieces will drop and thus cause spells that are pegged to the gold coin to drop in cost and dramatically alter the value of a life.

In a context where the raw materials to bring somebody back from the dead drops below the cost of feeding somebody for a month, what are some cultural changes that are rationally likely to happen in a mostly agricultural level society?
