Glyph of Warding can only store harmful spells. Try, like, any other magic item, those are also pegged to the gold coin. Simulacrum does mass-produce 10th-level slaves if you have the cooperation of a 13th-level wizard and knowledge of a 20th-level template. By default, these cost 5000 a pop, plus 910 for the spellcasting service. The 12-hours casting time might increase the latter number. They cannot learn or grow, so I would guess a wizard can only ever prepare spells that the original ever prepared (if you have a spellbook for him), and perhaps they have the memory of an HPMOR portrait, barring the creator's commands?
