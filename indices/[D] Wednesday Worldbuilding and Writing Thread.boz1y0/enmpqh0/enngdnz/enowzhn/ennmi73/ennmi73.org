What are some good resources for writing a semi-realistic fantasy setting that is based on medieval Europe? I specifically want to avoid a lot of stuff that fantasy settings tend to get wrong, especially about geographic stuff (how many settlements are there of what size, how common are castles & how large are they usually, how expensive are goods in relation to each other, etc.)

I can't seem to find anything directly answering my questions - a link to a site or the name of a good non-fiction book would be very appreciated. 'Medieval Europe' is a very large topic, both in terms of time and space, but details of any sub-area (such as Italy in the 1200s) would be an excellent starting point.
