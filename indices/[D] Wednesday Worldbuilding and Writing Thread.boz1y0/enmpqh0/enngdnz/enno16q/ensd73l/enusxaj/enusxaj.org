Short version of how spirits of intellect work: when they're in the mortal world, they have to be housed in some sort of container during the daytime or they'll be destroyed. This usually has to be symbolically connected to intellect, so they prefer living animals or human skulls, but electronics also work. To make it consistent with the setting, I headcanoned that they can't inhabit anything with mundane electricity in it (so they need to be unplugged and the batteries removed) and in order to usefully interface with the actual electronics instead of just sheltering inside them, they need to have a custom-written operating system installed. They can connect to the internet via wi-fi, but they can't transmit /themselves/ (since it would require going through the mundane-powered router). In theory, they could use their interface with the computers to rewrite themselves, but the notion of self-improvement is pretty foreign to spirits of intellect. Even if they've read and understood /Superintelligence,/ they wouldn't necessarily (and, in my setting, haven't... yet) made the connection that that could be /them/.
