  I'm not sure why you assume that there'll be a surveillance state. By assumption, there isn't since there isn't any state, surveillance or otherwise.

Profit and security. Personal data is the most valuable commodity to companies right now, and it's value will only increase as our ability to predict people's behavior gets better. The addition of magically enhanced AGI would make personal data almost invaluable to any company that has a consumer base. Imagine a for-profit surveillance company that sets up cameras in crowded areas all over the city that can recognize where you are, what you're doing, and identify your current emotional state. That info is then sold to advertisers who use it to decide when you're most susceptible to their advertising.

Then there's the simple matter of every physical building being invested in it's own security, making surveillance necessary. If an ancap society has very loose laws, individuals might try to rely on the guarantee of retribution rather than deterrence in regards to crime. Sure, we might not be able to afford high level security, but after we identify you on camera we'll hire someone to come for you.

There are plenty of market driven reasons to surveil people, especially if AI exists in the world.
