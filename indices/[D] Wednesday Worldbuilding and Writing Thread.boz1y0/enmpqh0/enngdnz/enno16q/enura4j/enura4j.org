I really dig the space elevator=wizard's tower idea, thanks!

I'm not sure why you assume that there'll be a surveillance state. By assumption, there isn't since there isn't any /state,/ surveillance or otherwise. Sure, there'll be insurance companies who offer lower rates in exchange for allowing monitoring, but nothing like what /I/ usually associate to the phrase "surveillance state". But, since the landholder of the charter city is a White Councilmember's alter ego... lets just say that the developers who were willing to play ball with their construction so their buildings complemented magical flows got fast tracked while the developers who were less tolerant of her "eccentricities" got bogged down in bureaucracy.

Yeah, I anticipate a lot of fun wizard vs superhero vs mortal dramabombs (one of the players is being an Objectivist True Believer. If the joke doesn't wear thin, it should be fun). There's no particular /advantage/ to being a superhero versus being a wizard, it's more of a color politics thing. Both sides /claim/ amazing and obvious benefits, but it basically comes down to a difference of aesthetic.

The backstory is the leader of the capes learned quite a bit of magic on her own, but didn't think it was magic, she thought it was superpowers (this is an old character of mine whose high concept was "budding supervillain" [it was a hard time in her life, but {spoilers for Worm} she didn't do any worse then the pre-Levithan Undersiders. She came to the Council's attention when she robbed a "bank" which was actually a front for the Venatori. She didn't break any Laws of Magic, though she did break a few laws of the US Government] until she joined the Council and did a Skitter->Weaver-esqueheel-face turn). By the time she encountered the White Council, she'd already made a bunch of distinctly superheroish magical items (an enchanted mask, a warded bodysuit with a logo, etc) and by that time she just kinda kept up the shtick for fun. Fast-forward a few years and she's prominent in a more progressive clique of the Council and adopting superhero garb became a way of showing party loyalty. (Also, I imagined the White Council chambers with half of the Wizards in black robes and the other half looking like a comic book panel and I found that image too charming to not crowbar in somehow.)
