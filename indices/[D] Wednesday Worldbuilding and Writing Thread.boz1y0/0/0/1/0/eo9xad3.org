Spoilers, because I'm not sure how to tag on mobile.

No, I don't think Matt "got the girl". Sure, she liked him originally, but it was her best friend who realized what was going on and helped her. Also, I imaging finding out the guy you kinda liked has like 20+ years of experience on you and had absolutely no intention of ever telling you would be a pretty major turn-off, particularly given her circumstances.

Matt had to return despite his wishes to clean up the mess he created, and even his sister blames him for it, so he has no sympathy from anyone. I agree that he got off too easy, but life isn't always fair.

Carl ruined his own life, and pays the price. It doesn't fall to the girl he loves to correct his mental health, and they placed the good of an entire world over someone that used to be their friend. Thats the epitime of rational utilitarianism. In any case, she felt remorse and guilt, but believed that she made the right decision. I agree.

And the sister (dont remember names) was not at fault apart from perhaps failing Carl, but it was a very human and understandable failing- Carl's problems were impossible for her to solve, and she had enough on her plate. She makes a return and brings her friend. I'd say she got a happy ending but really she is hurt enough that it will only be as happy as she can make it from the end of the story. But at least she is home. She is a survivor, not a victim, and that is pretty powerful.
