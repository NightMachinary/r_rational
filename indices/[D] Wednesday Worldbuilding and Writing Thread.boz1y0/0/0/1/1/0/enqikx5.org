I mean... that's debatable IMO. If anyone, Carl appeared to be the one who wanted to go back to to CV the most, he just had no means to do so. Matt had a witch straight up tell him, Jen got lucky and found the stone anyway, but Carl put way more effort than either of them into the only avenue he had, given what he knew. It's honestly a bit annoying that the "mysterious person who puts the stone in the forest" is never revealed, since I was sure it would be Malcolm or whatever his name was. Instead it turns out that was just a red herring and Carl was fucked no matter what he did.
