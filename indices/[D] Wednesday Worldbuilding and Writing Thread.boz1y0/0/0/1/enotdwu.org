That was a pretty great read! But from a narrative view it was kind of frustrating to see Matt essentially manipulate and lie to everyone for the entire story and get off scot free in the end. Carl's life is ruined and has to live with his friends' ultimate betrayal despite trying to live up to his obligations, and Matt gets no consequences for trying to dodge his responsibilities and even “gets the girl” in the end.

Definitely a fun short read but damn if that didn't feel like a karmic blueball lol
