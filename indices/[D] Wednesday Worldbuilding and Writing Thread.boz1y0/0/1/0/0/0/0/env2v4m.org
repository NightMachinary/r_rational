Me messing around with the idea; take what you like, at least one of these sounds like a writing exercise I should do; started writing this before I noticed you weren't /Gaboncio/.

After thinking on it, I've concluded that one of the parents should believe they've come back from Narnia*, the other thinks it was a trip to the future, one of their siblings thinks it's another world** and their friend is wondering how to get them counseling for PTSD, and they're looking into occult methods to get back to the other world.

*Or they've been replaced by a changeling. (Easy to combine with a family history.)

**And wants to know what independent technological/etc. methods they've developed. (Or magic.) The world's not going to conquer itself. (Or the multiverse, for that matter.) Alternate: thinks they went back in time (hence the trauma), and wants to know what it was like back then.

This sounds like a lot of work though, and that much drama probably needs comedy, so in addition to figuring out how to write a decent story (or crackfic? Is it a crackfic when it's an original story?), worldbuild*, and be funny (in writing).

*Or build off of someone else's world. Decisions, decisions.

Murder, Bribe, Tell Stories, Heal, Fix. That's not 7, so 7 sins is out... Though making "everybody right/wrong about what happened" is almost possible. (With magic another world could be like the future and the past; divination (before going back?) could enable foreknowledge, etc. Alternatively, it could be based on general predictions - knowledge collected from people from other worlds.)
