High-level clerics become extremely wealthy and powerful. Whether they're getting paid in a fee-for-service approach, or a weekly 'tithe' that might consist of money, goods, services and 'favors', they're rapidly going to become a dominating force in society. One way or another, most people will make sure that they are in the good graces of a cleric who can revive them.

This is exacerbated by how cheap human life becomes. Crusades may quickly become rampant, as the cost of war falls close to zero, and everyone becomes eager to prove their loyalty and faithfulness to their clerics. Theocracy quickly becomes commonplace, as the keys to social, financial, and military power all end up consolidated in the hands of a handful of high-level clerics. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle - as war becomes more common, it becomes more important than ever to prove your loyalty to a cleric who would revive you if needed, furthering the power of an ever-growing multitude of theocracies.

As the Great Crusades burn across the land, strategy quickly turns towards locating and seizing the enemy clerics, possibly converting them to your side by blackmail, bribery, or coercion. The warfare is particularly brutal, as mere sieges against holy cities can be held off nearly indefinitely by consumption of the flesh of those who die of starvation, followed by resurrection, in a perpetual cycle. Instead of trying in futility to wait out the defenders, attacking armies sacrifice lives carelessly in the pursuit of quick victory, scaling walls with ladders and engaging in bloody and direct assaults with overwhelming numbers.

As the crusaders close in upon the great temples that now form the seats of political power in most societies, they might feign a retreat or call to negotiate, or turn to plundering houses and burning homes. A simple ruse. You see, anyone slain in battle can be revived anywhere else in the world with a true resurrection spell. You can't truly kill a cleric. They would simply emerge again somewhere else. While the ruse is ongoing, the smoke still thick in the air and the sounds of battle and screaming maintain a cacophony of noise, special forces teams consisting of wizards, rogues, and high-level fighters move in invisibly and capture the clerics by surprise. They cannot be allowed to kill themselves. With the clerics secured, a horn is sounded and the rest of the city is wiped clean of defenders.

Captured clerics now have a difficult choice. Be held alive against their will indefinitely until old age takes them, or recant their heretical beliefs and pledge their loyalty to the gods of the invaders. Most are strong-willed, but some convert. Gradually the most powerful religions grow stronger and stronger as the weaker religions are purged from the world. In time, one dominating religion conquers the world. Peace ensues. One world, one religion, one True God.

Tell your dragon to stop before it's too late.
