I've actually been thinking about a similar setting that takes place in modern times but with the recent emergence of magic leading to people playing hero/villain. Patreon or something similar seems like it would be a plausible explanation for how heroism could become lucrative (so it doesn't just appeal to a very small subset of magic users) without getting the government involved. I think a lot of youtube culture would create some interesting dynamics in such a world, where things like collaborations, faked rivalries, scheduled fights (or the horrific dis-tracts that have become common on youtube), and reaction/response/apology videos are used to help boost subscriptions. Apology videos might become commonplace whenever a hero crosses a line or says something that isn't particularly PC. I think it would be interesting to see how some heroes deal with the uniquely vitriolic nature of internet comments too, being told to kill yourself hundreds or thousands of times a day might be more mentally strenuous than the sort of criticism a newspaper/magazine might publish. Youtubers also wield a fair amount of power in the form of their viewers, singling someone or something out in a public video can easily lead to an outraged mob of twitter trolls calling for boycotts, harassment, and, often times, the hacking and release of personal information. User's of this system would probably have to jump through some serious hoops to avoid being doxxed and the creator of the Patreon/Youtube website would probably be targeted by the government almost immediately. Agencies that manage heroes/villains would similarly be targeted.

On the emergent AGI topic, I wonder if the fact that they are created using magic might make them more or less manageable (magical off switch?). I'm not familiar with spirits of intellect, but depending on how they work it could imply what sort of utility functions the AGI will have. Love the drug enhanced magic idea, btw.
