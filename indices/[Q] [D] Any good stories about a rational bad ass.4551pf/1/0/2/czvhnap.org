Also downvoting, pending (as requested by others) a description of this change without using "feminine" or any other similar word, as well explain why this change is a bad thing.

(Not trying to imply that you're hungry for upvotes, but to make clear that I'm not blindly disapproving of things, and am willing to change my position)
