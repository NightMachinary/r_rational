Precommitting to spending billions to save one person makes things better for lots of people. The knowledge that if you are in trouble, billions will be spent to save you, makes it easier to get good people for dangerous jobs in the first place. Of course, this only works if the precommitment is credible, and it's only going to be credible if it's actually going to happen.

Yes, a utilitarian calculation shows that at the moment the billions are being spent, it is wasteful, but it is often true that if you have to do the thing you precommitted yourself to, you may be worse off in the immediate situation even though you are better off averaged over all possible worlds.

We sometimes refer to such precommitments as "morals" or "willingness to sacrifice".
