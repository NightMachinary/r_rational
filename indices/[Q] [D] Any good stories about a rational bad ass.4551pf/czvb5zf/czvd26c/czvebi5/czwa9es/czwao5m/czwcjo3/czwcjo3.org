The problem is that characters in fiction often don't articulate their goals precisely. Should we feel comfortable saying "This work of fiction is rational fiction because each character's behavior is consistent with a (possibly unusual) utility function I can come up with?"

In the case of The Martian, such a utility function for each member of the crew of the Hermes would place his/her own moral discomfort above the lives of four or so crewmates.

It seems to me more natural to say that the crew of the Hermes is acting out of a reflexive sense of guilt over leaving Watney on Mars.
