An issue with this argument is that it proves too much: any decision X can be justified by saying that the decision-maker(s) would feel morally dissatisfied with themselves if they chose not-X. If this argument can be deployed to justify the label of something as "rational fiction," we could use it to conclude that most of the fiction out there featuring what appear to be irrational decisions is in fact rational.
