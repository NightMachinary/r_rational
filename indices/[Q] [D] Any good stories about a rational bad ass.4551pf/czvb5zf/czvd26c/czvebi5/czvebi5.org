I only watched the movie, and didn't read the book, so take this with a grain of salt, but my understanding was that the crew chose to take the risky plan to save Watney because they came to the collective decision that they would be morally dissatisfied with themselves if they didn't risk their lives to attempt to save their colleague. Therefore, (disregarding the use of government resources and focusing only on the risks to human lives) they made the correct decision from a preference utilitarian perspective.
