The best argument I've heard for this is that we learned more on Apollo 13 than on every other Lunar mission combined. When things go perfectly, all we learn is that we made good things that worked. When everything falls apart, however, you learn the real limits of the technology you have designed, learn what new functionality you should include next time, and you learn what not to do in the future.

Watney benefited directly from Apollo 13 because it was then that NASA learned to /always/ have standard, interchangeable parts for every part of a mission. Watney benefited directly from Apollo 1, because it was then that NASA learned to never enclose humans in a pure oxygen atmosphere. Watney benefited from every diver who has ever experienced the bends, because that's how we learned that decompression is bad.

In this case, NASA has learned that hab canvas is capable of surviving a year-long mission. They learned that they need to redesign the connection between the hab and the airlocks, and also that they need to require rotating airlock use. They now know that a MAV can be used to achieve low Martian orbit under great duress, and also that they need to redesign the MAV to do so better if needed. They learned that their oxygenator design is perfect, and that their water reclaimer needs some way of internally scrubbing minerals. They learned that, while far from ideal, using a nuclear generator as a heat source isn't the worst possible thing to do. They learned that 45 year old hardware left on barren planets can be resurrected. They learned that their communication system was woefully inadequate. They learned that remote piloting a manned launch is possible and perhaps even a good idea.

Though this flies in the face of real Mars (perchlorate salts are a bitch), they learned that Martian soil could be used to grow food.

Is learning all of that, with the cost of several billion dollars and potentially 6 human lives, worth it?

If we ever plan to actually live on Mars, yes. Absolutely.
