Having only seen the movie, Jeff Daniels' character, the Director of NASA, makes the point that a picture of a dead astronaut will kill their ability to get government funding.

Saving an astronaut in a daring rescue mission with assistance from China, on the other hand, would be a spectacular global event and the most important event in the history of space exploration up to that point. US-Sino relations, which are already a trade positive, would be supercharged on all levels, from general government cooperation (as is shown at the end with the two countries launching a rocket together) right down to the citizen level where at least American affinity for China would be enormous.

If the Blue Team is right, and about a decade ago I thought they were (though not anymore,) then such an event would almosy certainly put permanently to rest any chance of war, in which case a few billion would be pocket change to the damages that would incur in such a conflict. And that's just one benefit, a cooperating US and China on the level of how friendly we are with Canada or England would be a massive boon to global geopolitical stability and generally getting shit done.

And of course millions of children now want to be astronauts, money pours into space in the public and private sector, the US and China are now launching rockets together... I'd have to think humanity gets off the rock a whole lot quicker. That's worth /everything/.
