This is a good counterpoint, and I don't explicitly disagree with you, but for the sake of continuing this thought I will propose possible explanations for the difference:

Challenger occurred in 1986, with it being the Reagan Administration and Cold War, that would be one reasonable explanation for why funding would not decrease.

Columbia, however, did affect the space program. It caused the space shuttle program to be suspended and was likely the long-preceding death knell of the program as well. That said, what could have helped mitigate a negative aftermath are these things: it was February 2003, a month prior to the invasion of Iraq. A combination of President W. Bush having a boosted approval rating and the news shifting to focusing on the war would have strongly deterred initial media and political criticism of the program and thus prevented knee-jerk reactions. Additionally, President W. Bush's Vision for Space Exploration may have also helped, though it was nearly a year following the disaster.

Another possible reason is that because the Challenger and Columbia disasters were explosions, the death of the astronauts was for most people, congress included, closer to an extrapolated abstraction rather than palpable reality. It is implicit to see the rocket and shuttle explode and understand the crews have died, but there is no explicit death. The preserved corpse of an astronaut on the surface of another planet is real, apparent, and visceral. Death there is immediately appreciable, and so if such a picture were on the front page of major newspapers, then yes I think it is possible that it would have a more negative effect on funding than the Challenger and Columbia disasters.
