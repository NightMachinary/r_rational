Continuing spoilers:

I think that in the story NASA doesn't actually want to redirect the return flight, the astronauts violated orders did that themselves. The directors at NASA already had a mission back to Mars planned, and wanted to send Mark Watney some food so that he'd survive until that mission arrived. Mark Watney acted rationally and so did NASA.

In any case, I'd like to note that in general if we are talking about spending billions of dollars to save astronaut lives... well, the Apollo missions cost like 100 billion dollars in modern money, right? I bet we could have saved a LOT of cash if we didn't include return trips for the astronauts. This would likely be even more true for a Mars mission since Mars isn't in the Earth's gravity well and has a very deep well itself. Sending enough fuel and the right equipment for return is probably more than half of the cost thanks to the rocket equation.

Basically, NASA in this story already has spent a huge amount of money to bring the astronauts back, when it could have just made it a one-way mission from the start and left them to die horribly and alone on Mars. Now, that would be terrible, and people wouldn't do that; I think whatever calculus led them to include a MAV and a spacecraft that could return, I'm sure also applies to getting Mark Watney back by sending him food.

Your second point is pretty spot-on though. Watney's crew isn't rational. That being said... I could see them trying something like that. This is something real people could do! And lots of things do go wrong, including Watney's use of the MAV. At the end, yeah, there's a part where something happens "just for the plot", which is that Watney survives and makes it to the ship. I don't think fic needs to have everyone in it act rationally for it to be a rational fic, and for there to be a stretch of what's likely right at the end, at the climax? That's okay with me too. Given a choice between being more rational or better written, this story chose "better written" and I'm okay with that.

Maybe it's not the most rational a story could be, but I don't begrudge The Gunslinger its guns and portal to a modern world, claiming it's no longer a fantasy fic, and if Jennifer Government doesn't seem to have taken the sci-fi direction in every element of its worldbuilding, I don't think that disqualifies it either. Lots of works in any genre will be on the boundary, and The Martian is... well, it's legitimate. It's a published book. It's even a movie, now. I'll claim the heck out of it for rational fiction.
