I greatly enjoyed the Martian but I wonder if it's fair to label it as rational fiction. After all:

(Spoilers below)

-- The main plot line is that NASA spends billions (or more?) dollars to rescue one person. Implicitly the book cheers this on.

I understand the emotional appeal here as well as any other human being, but putting that aside and thinking rationally for a moment: that amount of money could likely save many, many more lives if spent differently.

-- There is a common anti-rational trope which pervades a lot of Hollywood movies: instead of a safe plan which involves suffering some losses, the protagonist bets everything on a plan which has extremely low chances of success but works perfectly if everything goes right. Then everything goes right, and the lesson we are supposed to draw is that courage and bravery always prevail.

The Martian suffers from this as well: I'm referring to the final plan where the crew is redirected back to Mars and later part of the ship is blown up to change course. It seems extremely unlikely that this plan can pass a rational sanity check (after all, what should the probability of success be if you want to risk six lives to save one?)
