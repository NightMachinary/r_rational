Taking the most charitable possible view of this request, I'd say you're looking for action-packed tightly-written rationalfic without philosophizing or author tract. Ideally, you're looking for something focused on problem-solving and the "will to mastery", so to speak.

Given that that's the case, I highly recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553418025][The Martian]] by Andy Weir. It sounds right up your alley, and is one of my favorite examples of rational fiction (though some may dismiss it as "competence porn") in published literature. A publisher's synopsis:

#+begin_quote
  Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.

  Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.

  After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive---and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.

  Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old "human error" are much more likely to kill him first.

  But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills---and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit---he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?

I found it humorous, gripping, and intellectually stimulating. It's "manly" and "masculine" in the ways you'd almost certainly like.

Also, Mark Watney is definitely badass.

And... a word of advice: You phrased this request poorly if your goal was to get recommendations. People aren't here to discuss masculinity or femininity in books, or whatever it is you gripe about. We're here to find rational works. Most people, including me, will view your post as some kind of long-winded complaint. A post like this will most likely get downvoted by most people, again including me. That's no reason not to give a good reply, though.
