Well if we're going to be talking about rational BAMFs, then I must mention Kellhus from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing][Prince of Nothing]] by R. Scott Bakker. He doesn't have goals which I believe a normal human would ever have, but he is absolutely terrifying and is exceptionally gifted mentally in a way which convinces the reader of his genius.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga][The Vorkosigan Saga]] is another good one, but I don't consider the protagonist to be as rational, but he is equally intelligent.
