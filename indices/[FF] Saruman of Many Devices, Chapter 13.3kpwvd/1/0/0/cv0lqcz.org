That's a bit of a harsh interpretation. Mostly true, though.

The story itself /claims/ that the AI, Palantir, is effectively only capable of projecting and simulating possible futures given certain changes that might be made. In this way, it's an expy of Center from S.M. Stirling's /General/ series[1]---though with a lot less personality.

Saruman is /supposedly/ doing all the original invention, though you don't see him actually act to invent anything. You just see Palantir show Saruman one future, and then start showing him alternate futures with /useful, high-level/ changes seemingly coming from nowhere.

I think this is perfectly plausible, though (and the parent design, Center, is likewise kind of inefficient), because, if a device both:

- can simulate possible futures, with full respect of physics; and

- has a knowledge base of potentially-useful, non-trivial ways that people and things could be altered;

then all you need to get a full /optimization process/ out of that is the third leg: a preference function.

Saruman's brain---or specifically, his immediate subconscious reactions to seeing each projection Palantir provides---seems to serve as that preference function. Palantir does all the constraint-solving of deciding what alternate futures to show Saruman; Saruman implicitly "chooses" between those futures to impose new constraints. The suggestion in the story is that Saruman is actually doing the invention himself, through this choosing process.

It would be okay if the story just went that far, showing the process in slow, grudging detail a few times, and then abstracted it, presuming Saruman is just constantly fiddling around exploring invention-space. He is a wizard and a genius, after all; that's the sort of thing he is /for/. But the story kind of screws this cool idea up, by /also/ having Palantir feed him imagery from modern Earth as part of its visuals, visuals of events with no relevance to the setting that he can draw inspiration from, visuals that make no sense unless Palantir is actively trying to guide Saruman using a preference function of its own in the way Center guides Raj.

Basically, it's this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPLiaYD1lUo]]

[1] Do read the /The General/ books, though. Probably a bit irrational in that the AI Center, though driven to win a war, only suggests a technology once---the gatling gun, if I recall. It's mostly just an aid with military tactics, like having an old general (with perfect memory, who can use your sensory input to construct 3D terrain models) on consult.
