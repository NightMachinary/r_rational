I remember reading this. I got through... I forget, somewhere in chapter 10 I think. Then I just hit this "y'know what, I've had my fill of Saruman!Orcs curbstomping everything they come across, no matter how awesome it may be" threshold. I was devouring it before that.

What I remember certainly /sounds/ like the sidebar description of rational fiction, though. There is One Big Rulebreaking Lie, but that One Big Lie is what makes it Saruman of Many Devices and not Lord of the Rings.
