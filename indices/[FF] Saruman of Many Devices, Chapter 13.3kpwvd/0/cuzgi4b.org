After [~ a year?] break in updates, a new chapter is out!

Note that this is not my work, but only the first chapter has been posted to [[/r/rational]] before and this is good tech-munchikining and Enlightenment culture stuff in what is arguably /the/ definitive Romanticism!Fantasy 'verse, which I think the subreddit might like.
