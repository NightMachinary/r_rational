Hmm, an odd and inefficient AI constraint (Saruman may have preferences for what would best solve current problem X, but they're shaped and guided by Palantir because only Palantir knows/understands what the long-term consequences may be, and even minor details like presentation order of options can affect Saruman's decisions.

The invention thing gets undermined a bit, in my opinion, simply by the fact that he's really only doing engineering, not inventing- like in the beginning, for instance, he's thinking about the gun that he just saw and how far it can shoot, and Palantir shows him a rifled gun, and he likes the longer range. So, he has to figure out how to actually contruct a rifled gun, but he doesn't need to invent it- he knows what it is, that it works, and what it looks like, so it's just the manufacturing process that needs to be created, with some experimentation as to materials/tolerances. It's certainly a lot of work, even work that takes a lot of brainpower, but it's not the same thing as actually inventing the end result, especially when he knows for a fact that it can be done at his current capabilities, he just needs to work out how.

Really though, what annoyed me about the fic wasn't the tech rampup (that was fun, so I just ignore details that I don't like) but the orcs- by the last chapter, they're running around acting exactly like semi-modern mil-fic characters, one ooh-rah away from being mid-90s US army special forces fiction characters. Giving guns to orcs, or to <1-year-old Uruk-hai, does not confer upon them an entirely alien culture that matches nothing in Middle Earth at all, but looks suspiciously like a real-world analogue.
