I've been rping in a play by post subreddit on and off over the years in my time in reddit. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/YouEnterADungeon][r/YouEnterADungeon]] Not all of the gaming runs were great; inexperienced gms can be prone to things like railroading for example. But there were some really creative writers in some of the games I had played - I saved up all those threads. There was for instance a Dark Wizard of Donkerk inspired game I played, exploring the mentalist setting. Never thought I'd be able to contribute to actually writing a story.

I noticed the activity had receded from when the subreddit was at it's prime so I thought I would introduce it to you guys. Anyone up for a rational themed game? :P

Edit:

Also if anyone is a fan of beautifully hand drawn platformers check out [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/683320/GRIS/][Gris]]. I've started playing it and I love, love the idea behind it. It delves in the mindscape of depressed girl, the symbolic elements in her journey letting you feel the unspoken narrative.
