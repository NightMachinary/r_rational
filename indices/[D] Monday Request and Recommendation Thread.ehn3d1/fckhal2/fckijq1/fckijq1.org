Nothing overly rational, but I just finished Legend of the Galactic Heroes and am now legally obligated to recommend it whenever possible.

It's an ancient (1988) anime about an ongoing galactic war between the autocratic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. The two "main" protagonists (There are dozens of named characters, and most of them are developed heavily) are Reinhard von Lohengramm, an Admiral whose sister is concubine to the Kaiser, and Yang Wen-li, a Commodore in the Alliance's fleet. The story follows the two men on opposite sides of the war as they rise through the ranks in pursuit of their goals.

As far as being rational, it's pretty solid. Everything that happens has a cause and effect relationship with the rest of the plot. Almost all characters have agency and use it to try to achieve their goals. Some characters in the first season and early second hold the Idiot Ball, but it's acknowledged and justified, and the morons are weeded out of the story by the end of the first quarter (it's 110 25-minute episodes).

Its only flaw is its length. 110 episodes aren't enough.
