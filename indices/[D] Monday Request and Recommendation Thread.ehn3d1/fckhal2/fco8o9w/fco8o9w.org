HBOs Watchmen is a piece of art, and just completed.

Knives Out is in theaters, and stellar exemplar of the murder mystery genre, that plays fair. (Also stacked to heck and gone cast).

Person of Interest, if you have not already seen it. Strong cast. Strong arc. S1 is pretending to be a procedural so CBS will fund them, but it is so much more, and better than that. Complete.

I will add a "Plus one" to basically all of MagicWeasels list, excepting that I must warn that I have so far been unable to complete my watch of the handmaids tale on grounds of "too damn depressing".

If depressing is your bag, Unbelievable on netflix is a dramatization of a true story, and this is my review: "Kaitlyn Denver? I am here with the truckload of your awards. Now please dont do that again, my heart cant take it"
