... what do you like?

- Jane the Virgin: hilarious comedy, four seasons, planned (and satisfying) ending - characters all act rationally. The premise is that a woman who is saving herself for marriage accidentally gets artificially inseminated during a pap smear. So yeah... It is a parody of telenovela tropes, though, so everyone does have a twin brother and science works... differently, but within the scope of that, the characters are real, sympathetic, and, again, rational. I also like it because the family is catholic but nothing in the show comes across as cringy/preachy/etc (and I say that as a former president of a campus atheist society).

- Brooklyn 99: Another hilarious comedy about a New York police precinct

- The Handmaid's Tale: not especially rational, but critically acclaimed and with good reason. Distopian near-future sci-fi

- The Good Place: everyone here loves it, and with good reason. It's a comedy about the afterlife, but it's also about philosophy.

- Crazy Ex-Girlfriend: a musical comedy. It's hilarious, but also deals with some big topics

- Sense8: A netflix series that got two seasons, was cancelled, and then the fan outrage made them finance a movie. It's by the guy from Babylon 5 and the Wachowskis. Premise is 8 people from different walks of life suddenly become a sort of hivemind, and use each other's talents to improve their own lives and of course to fight the Evil that is Taking Them Down. Wonderful ensemble cast who you really care about and some really cool munchkining of their respective powers
