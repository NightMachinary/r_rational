[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/972666][Tao of the Force]] is a Star Wars fanfiction for the latest movies, where we get to see what it would be like if Rey and Ren had decided to unite forces to end the war and bring actual good change to the galaxy. Rey decides to start a religion that takes all the good pieces of both the light and the dark, creating the grey-scale Magi; Ren decides to create a government that genuinly works for the people.

I had found this one last year, and though it's really smutty (like a *lot* of fan-service scenes, especially in the first part) I think it gets really rational in the second bit. (One of the tags is "porn with philosophy", to give you an idea.) It's been a while since I read the first part, but I think the author generally lets you know when you're about to read a chapter that's nsfw.

There are a few places where it's not entirely rational, but I really liked how it had a better plot for the new movies and actually did something about that whole Ren teleporting thing, and then showing some actual leadership skills. I haven't seen the latest movie, so I don't know for sure, but based on reviews I think Tao of the Force gives a more satisfying, rationalist storyline.
