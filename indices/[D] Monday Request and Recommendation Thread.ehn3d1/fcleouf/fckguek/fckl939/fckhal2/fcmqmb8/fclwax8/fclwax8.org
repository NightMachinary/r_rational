Anything good out there while I keep waiting for the last few chapters of mother of learning? Last couple of months I've re-read all of MoL, worth the candle, wandering inn, first three books of the stormlight archives, mistborn, first 2 of king kingkiller chronicle, some book about climbing divine towers, and probably some other things I'm forgetting.
