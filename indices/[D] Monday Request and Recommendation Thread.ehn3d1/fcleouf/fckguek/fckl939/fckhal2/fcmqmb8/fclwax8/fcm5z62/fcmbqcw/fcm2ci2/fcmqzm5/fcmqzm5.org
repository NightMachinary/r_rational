Tagging along to the Warbreaker rec, I'd give Arcanum Unbounded a shot, specifically The Emperor's Soul. I found it to be quite rational (within the bounds of the magic system) in that all the characters are well motivated and also all actions have reasons, which may not be wholly apparent until the end. The other stories are pretty entertaining as well, and if you've ([[/u/theblackcrayon2][u/theblackcrayon2]]) read mistborn, there's no spoilers.
