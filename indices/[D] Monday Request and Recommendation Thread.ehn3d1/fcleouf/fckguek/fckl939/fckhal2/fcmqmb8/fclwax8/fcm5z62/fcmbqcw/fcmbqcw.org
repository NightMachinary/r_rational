Going to recommend [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] again, a English translated webnovel by a Chinese writer, with one of the more interesting and internally consistent magic systems of the series I've read thus far. Here's a basic introduction:

There are 22 pathways of power which requires the individual to drink potions made from monsters, increasing in potency as well as danger to the drinker the lower the 'sequence' (the most diluted potion and the starting point is sequence 9). Each potion modifies the drinker on a genetic level, granting them superhuman powers similar to the monsters the potion is made from. The drinker must then accept and master the superhuman powers ('digestion') or lose control, devolving into semi-monsters themselves.

After drinking a potion from a pathway, the individual generally can no longer drink potions from other pathways. Drinking the same potion again strengthens their abilities at that sequence but also increases the chance for them to lose control, while drinking potion from the next sequence (e.g. 9 -> 8) promotes them in power as they become less and less human.

There is at most one God at the end of each pathway.
