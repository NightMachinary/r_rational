Nocturne for a Dangerous Man by Marc Matz is an older book but it is surprisingly rational. It's about a guy with exceptional talents who has dedicated his life to rescuing people. The thing is, his exceptional talents were acquired by exceptional dedication rather than by chance. The book is about one mission, and the bulk of the book is about investigating and preparing for it. As a bonus, I also found it entertaining.
