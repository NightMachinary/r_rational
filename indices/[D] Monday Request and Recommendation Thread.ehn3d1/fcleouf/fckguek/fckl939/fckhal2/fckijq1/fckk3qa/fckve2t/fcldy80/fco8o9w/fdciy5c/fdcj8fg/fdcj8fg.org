Oh boy! I've been waiting for this question my entire life. None of the shows are overly rational, but characters do act consistently with their values and their implied conception of the world. All descriptions are spoiler tagged because I typically like to go into shows knowing nothing about them. Shows are ordered from most to least enjoyed.

- Dark fuck, idk how to explain this one. Time travel and you'll likely need family trees? A never ending war, it's fucking good, but not finished yet liked for complex plot, complex characters, amazing highs when something clicks and you get a certain aspect of the plot, it's good
- Hannibal A show about Will Grahm, a police detective who solves crimes by empathizing with the killers and imagining himself in their shoes, who slowly discovers that his physiologist, Hannibal Lecture is a serial killer. Liked for character development, gruesome set pieces, and non-repetitive plot
- The End of the F***ing World a teenage girl runs away with her boyfriend to escape her crappy life. The boyfriend is trying to get her alone and surprised so he can kill her, as she slowly wins him over Liked for character development, dark themes, simple and well executed plot Haven't watched the second season yet though.
- The Americans It's the 80's. The show follows deep-undercover Communist spies who look, and act just like Americans as they try to juggle blending in, with spying on behalf of Russia Liked for dark themes, simple and well executed plot, audience-winning over factor, and the indescribable
- You A terribly self-deceiving book lover becomes infatuated with a girl, and does everything he can to win her over Liked for dark themes, simple and well executed plot, audience-winning over factor (where audience roots for protagonist despite the terrible things they are doing)
