Greg Egan is master of this and I am not really aware of anyone else that does what he does. If you're including things like the erogamer, though, try [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D461PYF][Vita Nostra]] (and the sequels if you read Russian; also check out their short story [[https://www.toothycat.net/%7Esham/Access_History.html][Access History]] ); [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01MZGWCV4/][Gnomon]]; and Seanan McGuire's Wayward Children series (not too rational, but definitely profoundly weird worlds)
