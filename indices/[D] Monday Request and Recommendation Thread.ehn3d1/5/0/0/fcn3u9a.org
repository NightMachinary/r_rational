I'd temper this recommendation with a small review: Pact has a really cool magic system, but it really doesn't go into enough detail to satisfy the narrative pull it has. It's all very fuzzy, and results in a ton of combat asspulls that I felt were entirely unlikely and unjustified. For the first half I was enthralled, but the last half had me forcing myself forward.
