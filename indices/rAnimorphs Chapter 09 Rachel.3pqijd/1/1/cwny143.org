If Erek tries to stop Rachel, she basically has no chance to do anything else. Even an Andalite or bear isn't going to overpower a Chee and I don't think she could outspeed it either.

Although this would be a very convenient time for her to have kept that gun on her. A trigger pull would probably be too fast to stop.
