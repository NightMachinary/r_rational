To your last question: yes. There has been a major change to Yeerk biology and culture that hasn't yet come up in the text. It was done for reasons of sanity/internal consistency/elegance ... it covers MOST of what we know about Yeerks with one simple, powerful explanation, at the cost of changing a few canon details (like this one) that I think are minor in comparison.
