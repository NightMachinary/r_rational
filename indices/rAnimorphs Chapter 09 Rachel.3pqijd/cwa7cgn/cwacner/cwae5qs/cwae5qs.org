Whether it's minor or not depends on how much it's considered violence. Since he's able to do it to his own Yeerk, I'd imagine that it isn't, so... determine the range on memory editing, walk over to Visser Three, and make him never remember fighting in the war, killing anyone, or any aggression by Andalites/Yeerk Propaganda. Continue doing so for all other major controllers. Further, offer all of the Chee up as "voluntary hosts" to anyone who is willing to give their hosts their bodies back, edit the host memories to not remember being captives, and end the entire invasion bloodlessly.

Naturally, I assume that the Yeerk memory editing can only be done in-brain by the Chee, rather than remotely, since an invasion still exists.
