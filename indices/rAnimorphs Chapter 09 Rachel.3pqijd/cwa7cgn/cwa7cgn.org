Hiding behind a hologram, Rachel could morph now and take out Visser 3. Except Erek won't let her, and presumably he'll stop her if he even thinks she's going to try to hurt him. Would an andalite be fast/strong enough to do it anyway? She could say that she's going to demorph-remorph to escape. I'm guessing not though, canonically Erek took out like twenty Hork-Bajir when he got hold of the crystal.

If there was a loophole in his programming, he would probably (not definitely) know about it and be able to tell her. ("If you tell me that you're just going to threaten him, I can let you get your tail blade up against his neck.")

I'm guessing that if Erek held Visser 3 in that force field for two hours (assuming it can prevent morphing, which isn't clear), that would count as violence?

Hm, how about this: "I need to demorph and remorph to get away. I'd like you to close your eyes while I do. I have secrets I'm not ready to reveal to you." Then morph elephant, and hope Erek isn't powerful enough to stop it.

Why the change from "generate my own kandrona, show a hologram of my yeerk leaving/entering my ear" to "edit the yeerk's memories"? Memory editing seems more out-there to me. Do yeerks in the pool have more ability to communicate than canonically?
