Bringing in the Chee is going to be interesting. Especially since they now want to help stop the Yeerks.

Going to be cool to see where it goes though. The Chee were hyped up to be almost impossible to kill except by Howlers. Their non violence programming could either be a big problem, or not that big at all. I'm assuming they aren't going to able to kill the Yeerks by any means, but they will probably be a good font of intelligence and will probably fix whatever is up with Jake. Both of those are several degrees removed from actively hurting anything.
