Aldnoah Zero was amazing for the first three or four episodes and then went downhill quite a bit in my opinion.

Good points: The main character solves problems and overcomes enemies with super mechs using his intelligence rather than the POWER OF HIS FIGHTING SPIRIT or his MANLY TEENAGE ANGST or BERSERKER FURY. He has a weaker mech, rather than a stronger mech, than his adversaries, so you feel some amount of tension. At first, a lot of what he does involves attacking his enemy's weaknesses in organization and military discipline, and playing to the strengths of his own forces. The way the initial invasion is portrayed is great too.

Bad points: The plot goes downhill pretty quickly. The characters don't develop much. Overall the character motivations are pretty bad. A lot of what's going on doesn't make a huge amount of sense, especially during Season 2. The entire Season 2 plot loses coherency even worse than Season 1 plot post episode 4.

If you want to watch it, just watch the first 4 episodes. They are well plotted and the pacing is great. I haven't checked but I get the feeling they fired the author or deviated from the manga or something after the first 4 episodes because the tone and pacing gets much worse.

If you want to get some kind of closure, watch the first season and pretend there's no second season, since everything that happens after the end of season 1 is a mondo asspull.
