  Regarding the magic super eye, we were constantly shown the downsides of its use, and how it was a highly experimental piece of technology that was no without some huge drawbacks.
#+end_quote

The downsides of its OVERuse, is what we were shown. And the downsides were slim picking in a war where everyone without said OP item dies. What is the combat survivability of non-Inaho? I'm sure it wasn't high the amount of mechs we see get utterly destroyed before he comes in and saves the day.

There's also that time where he aims on behalf of the battleship? What? WHAT?! How can an eye have more targetting capabilities than AN ALDNOAH POWERED battleship?

  I think the reasoning behind the Nilokeras having the weakspot was that if the shield completely enclosed the mech, it would have no way to see.
#+end_quote

Yes that was the reason they said. It is incredibly illogical considering as you just mention the feet are uncovered too (so your drone signals could propagate through that). The correct place to put it if for some reason you can't send signals through the earth is on the very top of the head.

  The spot also was armoured, they cut into with a giant field knife first and then shot bullets into the hole they made.

Well you were right about being rear armour, however it is still on a large missile target (and if you exploded it before impact which many explosions do then you would destroy it) and the knife cuts through regular armoured kataphracts which suggests to me that it isn't extra armoured (also it's a good thing that guy stood absolutely still during the entire murder scene).

But the fact that you can see the mech instead of a black spot means that photons do go in and out of the thing so he could see fine out of it.

  Its less that they're dumb, because they're certainly not dumb, its more that they're blindsided by their own hubris.
#+end_quote

They are pretty dumb. Their use of the technology requires an absurd consistent dumbness throughout their own fairly competitive society. The knights are all about appearing better than each other so many if the guy with the fucking INFINITE MASS REPLICATOR put it to any reasonable use?!

  After they carve a path of destruction across the Earth as easily as buttering toast, they got complacent and assumed nothing could threaten them.
#+end_quote

Except they (for whatever reason) didn't win the first war? Why didn't they win the first war? It wasn't explained (there's only one season right? That's all I've seen) as I remember. But anyway they shouldn't be complacent for that whole reason. Not only that if we allow someone to be complacent at the start then they should snap out of it after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 have been killed by someone. Even in general complacent people don't tend to be so, uh, peaked? I'm not sure what the word is. They show and act capable at some points, then completely incapable at other and it's totally inconsistent when it is.

All the rest of the stuff is so right, but I don't think you can pawn it all off on designed moral superiority (which never made any sense anyway considering how young the population on Mars is)

  Feel free to rant on, that's generally the idea of having a discussion.

I ranted at the time but you're stirring up my repressed memories ^^

For reference those are my two stream of consciousness posts, but because I tend to watch anime while on the go I don't usually write stuff because typing on the phone is a disaster for writing. So I only really write stuff if I happened to finish it when I get home or I was so angry I had to write about it.

And like I said Aldnoah Zero was a whole lot better than 99% of anime (my hair is gone from Log Horizon).
