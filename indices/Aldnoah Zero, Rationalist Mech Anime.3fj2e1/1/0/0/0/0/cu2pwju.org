Really? I don't think I am educated enough to write any serious analysis. At best it'd be a stream of consciousness with mistakes galore ala the above stuff.

I finished the first season of Log Horizon and the best place if you want a ramble rant is probably to check my anime list comment history.

I haven't started the second season yet but if there's interest I could make an effort to type up my thoughts on it.
