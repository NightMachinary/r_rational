I have seen a fair bit of criticism for Log horizon especially in terms of pacing.

I'm unlikely to write up anything more on the first season, I covered most of my problems with it on myanimelist.net and the remaining episodes didn't bother me enough to add anything up.

I would recommend the episode 15 comment as unusually for me I offered some constructive advice (including completely changing the first five episodes) however a problem reading any of those rants is I assume recent familiarity with the source material but it's less so in that one.

If I watch the second season then I'll write up criticisms for that. I am not a computer at the moment but if you point me to someone making a strance on it I find it a lot easier to criticise a position (example in this thread) then I might tear into it.
