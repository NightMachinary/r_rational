Regarding the magic super eye, we were constantly shown the downsides of its use, and how it was a highly experimental piece of technology that was no without some huge drawbacks.

I think the reasoning behind the Nilokeras having the weakspot was that if the shield completely enclosed the mech, it would have no way to see. It couldn't cover its feet with the shield or it would fall through the ground. It wasn't in the front though, it was in the back, under its armpit, in a really non-obvious spot. The spot also was armoured, they cut into with a giant field knife first and then shot bullets into the hole they made.

Regarding the martians though, they do tend to hold the idiot ball pretty often it seems like. Its less that they're dumb, because they're certainly not dumb, its more that they're blindsided by their own hubris. After they carve a path of destruction across the Earth as easily as buttering toast, they got complacent and assumed nothing could threaten them. The other thing they do is put a ton of specialisation into their mechs. There's no guns or missiles or anything on the Nilokeras, they didn't utilize combined arms nearly effectively enough, and they mostly assumed they would be so incredibly badass that no one could so much as touch them. Their own sense of moral and intellectual superiority blinded them to the dangers coming their way.

Feel free to rant on, that's generally the idea of having a discussion.
