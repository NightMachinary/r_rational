I wouldn't think it would qualify. There is a ton of deus ex which isn't part and parcel of rational fiction. It's better than most anime for sure in terms of component sensible characters but I imagine most people here would be annoyed at the [[#s][spoiler]], and obviously mech's themselves are usually inherently irrational and there's no logic given for the usage of them.

Most of the bad guys (especially the knights) make little sense in terms of power level which leads to a number of scenes that completely lack tension. It might make more sense if the people piloting the mechs weren't human but some of the stuff is just utterly ridiculous and has to be idiot ball, the biggest of which I can think of is [[#s][spoiler]].

I definitely expect a higher standard than that out of rational fiction, but perhaps it is just me.

The only animes that tend to qualify in terms of not having people holding the idiot balls are slice of life stuff, and those often don't tick off any of the other boxes.

Edit: I could write longer comments on the anime since I watched it recently if anyone is interested, I posted some stream of consciousness stuff on the discussion threads on myanimelist when I was watching it just to vent.
