My bias: I really liked S1. I really^{really^{really}} hated S2.\\
Aldnoah's first season manages to be driven by fairly rational characters, and the technology (provided you get over the silliness that is "tanks with legs and jetpacks") does as well. The fights tend to hinge on some aspect of applied physics, with a decent high school-level explanation given in-world.\\
It's not without its problems; my beef with the show is that the protagonist is an emotionless deus-ex with perfect piloting skills and little depth of character. The side characters show development... but are largely ignored later.

The second season is far from rational. I strongly recommend pretending it did not happen; the ending of S1 is better without it. [[#s][Brain dump of Spoilers]]
