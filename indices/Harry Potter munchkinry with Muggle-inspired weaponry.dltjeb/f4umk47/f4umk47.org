It feels strange to see someone deep dive on munchkinizing weapons in the HP setting. Like, it's been a while since I watched the show, but from what I remember of the setting the need just isn't there.

The bad guys are like a few dozen terrorists, right? Like, 'if only we had better guns' feels like a really weird problem for the cops to have. The thing that needs to get munchkinned away is whatever is stopping the cops from just sending in ten times as many wizards as their enemy has.
