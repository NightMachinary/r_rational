I recently read a dead death note fanfiction titled [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431989/1/If-It-s-Not-Me-It-s-You][If It's Not Me It's You]]. The premise was that instead of Light attempting to reduce suspicion on himself by (mild Death Note spoilers) Continuing Kira's murder's while he was imprisoned he decided to engineer a scenario where L would be forced to recognise that they were equally likely to be Kira. The way the plan was executed and the deductions were handled felt intelligent and was definitely fun to follow.
