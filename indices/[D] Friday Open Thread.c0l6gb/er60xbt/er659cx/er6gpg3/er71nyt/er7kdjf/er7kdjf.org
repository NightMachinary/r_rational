An idea: consider the symbol zero (0). The number is something we take for granted, but it is more important conceptually than most people realize. It is something you discover in a basic sense by counting (eventually you'll need a placeholder). The more complicated 'zero as a number' is discovered through involved reasoning about mathematics. For example: by wondering at what value two different equations will be equal. It's complicated enough that it wasn't used as a number until the 7th century AD.

Whether that means anything to you depends on your interpretation, I guess.
