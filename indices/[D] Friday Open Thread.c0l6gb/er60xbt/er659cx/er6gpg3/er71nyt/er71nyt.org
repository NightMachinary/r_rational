I'm contemplating getting a tattoo. Right now, I'm bouncing between three different ideas and slowly iterating towards a version that incorporates aspects from all three.

I'm curious if anyone here has come up with a symbol that symbolizes rationality or this subreddit for themselves.

Even if you don't associate rationality with any sort of symbol, feel free to share your tattoo stories anyway!
