I have a new job! It will be more intellectually stimulating (and by that I mean difficult) and pay better than my current job. The work is closer to my personal interests, and the workplace is relatively near to my relatives.

In addition to bragging, I was hoping to ask [[/r/rational][r/rational]] for general advice regarding new jobs. I don't need advice about anything in particular, but good ideas are appreciated.

Does anyone have some 'common sense' suggestions for transitioning into a new job?
