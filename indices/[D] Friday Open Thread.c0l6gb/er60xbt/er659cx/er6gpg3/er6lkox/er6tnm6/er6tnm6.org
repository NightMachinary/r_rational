Possibly not relevant depending on the specific type of job, but...

A great many people show up to work and only put in 80% effort, so maybe start off at like 82% effort so when you push up to 85% effort the higher-ups think it's impressive. If you start out putting in 100% effort from the outset, the higher-ups will see that as "the norm" that they can just /expect/ on a day to day basis, and they'll eventually start asking you for 110% effort, which it isn't physically possible to give, and if you ever start to burn out and can only put in 95% effort then you might be reprimanded for not putting in as much effort as they're used to from you even though you're still working 15% harder than most other people.

TL;DR: Don't be a tall poppy, because if your coworkers don't try to cut you down for it then your higher-ups will berate you for not being taller. Take stock of how other people seem to be going about their business and try to match the average level at the beginning while you take stock of the work environment.
