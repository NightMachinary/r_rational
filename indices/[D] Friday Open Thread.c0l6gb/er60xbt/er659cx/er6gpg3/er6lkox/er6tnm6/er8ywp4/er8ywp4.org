I disagree with this, especially at the start, you should definitely show more effort than your already established/trained peers. I'd say a energetic 90% effort, not a unsustainable effort but one that takes an effort to maintain. Bright eyed and learning driven is the goal, and offer to help out coworkers where you can for learning and team building.

That being said establish your boundaries from the start, don't allow work/"coordination" outside of the workplace initially and expect to roll that back later. Anything you tolerate initially is harder to change later.
