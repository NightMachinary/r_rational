In this case it probably doesn't apply. It is nevertheless wise to consider how your efforts will be interpreted.

I don't think I can subdivide my expended effort by 2% without expending 2% or more effort on characterizing my efforts.

My plan is to go 100% from the get-go, and as I become familiar with the job and gain efficiency I'll expend less effort to make the same or better progress. I'll settle somewhere sustainable.

Thank you for the advice!
