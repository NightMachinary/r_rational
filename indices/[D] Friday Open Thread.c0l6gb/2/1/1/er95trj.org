I'd dissent here too; at least in software your first couple months is where people establish their judgement of you, and you get much more return for effort spent because of that. If you can work at 90% for a couple months and then start coasting at 70%, you'll have a very good opinion and people will interpret anything you do positively, assuming that the tasks you were given were harder than they thought, and thus the drop in output.

Of course it's best to be at a place where you can sustainably work at 90% for most of the time, because it's interesting :P
