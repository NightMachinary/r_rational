One of the most useful pieces of advice I've ever received: first impressions matter.

Obviously in the long term your performance and fit with the new team will matter more, but the way people perceive you within the first second (and then the first minute) of seeing you has an outsized impact on the way they will think of you going forward. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect][halo effect]] hits hard too, so use both of these to your advantage. Stand straight, dress well, firm handshake, make eye contact, use their name. Donuts couldn't hurt, but might seem a bit pandery on day one.

More generally, people will love you if you remember small things about them. Your deskmate likes spicy food? Bring a nice bottle of hot sauce for the break room fridge during week 2. Your boss has a kid who plays baseball? Ask how the season's going a few weeks down the line.
