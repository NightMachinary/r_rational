I suspect a good portion of this subreddit has at least a passing interest in space, so I'm happy to notify everyone that [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/314650/SpaceEngine/][/SpaceEngine/]] has been released on Steam. It's a highly realistic space simulator which uses massive amounts of astronomical data (and procedural generation) to create what they call an "interactive planetarium." You can visit almost any astronomical object you can think of, look up close and read reports about its physical properties; also, there's a spaceship simulator mode and VR support.

[[http://spaceengine.org][There's an older free version available on its website.]] However, SE has been in development for seven years by pretty much a single person who lived on donations, and now that it's released on Steam, its creator plans to use earned money to hire a team to help him with updates. So if you like either SE itself or at least an idea behind it, please consider buying it to support the developer.
