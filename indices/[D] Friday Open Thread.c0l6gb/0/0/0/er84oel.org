/Kerbal Space Program/: They are very different as KSP is a realistic rocket builder first and foremost. Their spaceship mode is rather similar, though, as both use a physics-based approach. You also can land on planets and explore them on foot like in KSP.

/Space Engineers/: I've never played it, but a quick googling shows that it's a sandbox game. SpaceEngine doesn't have any gameplay (except maybe spaceship mode, but even then it's barely gameified). There's no resource management or building.
