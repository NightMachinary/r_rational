I was mainly wondering if there was any sort of symbol that people here already had in mind, but it seems like there's a lot of variety and very little in common. I did some research into various symbols for truth and enlightenment, but there isn't really any common defined symbol out there other than stuff to do with eyes.

WARNING: Huge info dump on my musings and thoughts about designing a tattoo.

I iterated through three different ideas for the tattoo.

The first one was going to be the image of a brain, but with a simplified design where instead of having so many wrinkles and folds that usually appear in anatomical texts, the folds and wrinkles will form molecules used in the brain such as dopamine, adrenaline, endorphin, serotonin, and so on.

After making a practice drawing, I decided that while I liked the idea of it, I didn't like the ascetic of it so much. Brains don't naturally look pretty. So I might commission a drawing of it to be made into a refrigerator magnet, but I won't get a tattoo of it. But I decided to keep the idea of hiding smaller symbols in a larger image.

The second idea was to ditch images and to go for symbols since symbols are a really neat and easy way to convey personal meaning. I really like how [[https://library.kissclipart.com/20181002/zle/kissclipart-elven-star-clipart-heptagram-elf-symbol-e74db4597f637d3a.jpg][fairy stars]] look and wanted to put seven different icons or symbols at each point that each have some sort of significant meaning.

The seven symbols, starting at the top, were: [[https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/universal-signs-symbols/128/buddhism-dharma-512.png][Samsara Wheel]] (what goes around comes around), [[http://www.penninetaichi.co.uk/index_files/image8421.jpg][Labyrinth]] (the path to see the right answer isn't always obvious), [[https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/51/71/symbol-of-yin-yang-vector-1735171.jpg][Yin Yang]] (two opposing, irreconcilable sides can turn out to be two parts of a greater whole), [[https://cdn5.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/27/04/triskelion-or-triskele-symbol-sign-icon-black-vector-23362704.jpg][Triskelion]] (breaking the black-and-white view of duality to look for a third side), [[https://ui-ex.com/images/compassing-clipart-plain-5.gif][compass]] (the pursuit of truth is an ever ongoing journey), [[https://as2.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/17/29/79/500_F_217297989_FychE5I3p7dGrdx2Deywnjg7jyBgJAWO.jpg][Jain Symbol of Ahimsa]] (the absence of desire to harm any life forms), and the [[https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/40/66/the-star-of-david-or-the-shield-of-david-vector-19164066.jpg][Star of David]] (the symbol of Judaism which is important for remembering where I came from before adopting a skeptical view of the world and my beliefs).

While researching all of these symbols was really cool, I felt the resulting image was way too chaotic and had too much stuff crammed in. Each symbol conveyed either an important lesson I learned, a guiding principle, or a virtue I desired to live up to. However, while each one had its own significant meaning, there was no unifying overall /theme/ which was the role that the fairy star was supposed to play. I tried something like this by having the symbols follow a numerical progression from 0 (Samsara wheel) all the way to 6 (Star of David), but it wasn't enough to bring it into one cohesive whole.

So for my third and final idea, I decided to simplify things by only focusing on one symbol from before which ended up being the triskelion. In my mind, out of the eight symbols from before, the triskelion came the closest to representing the ideal of pursuing truth (compasses are overdone!). It represents the breaking of duality by looking for an unknown third side in an argument and the flowing pattern of spirals represents the ongoing process overcoming our biases.

While researching the triskelion, I needed to pick what trio of concepts it represented. Common ones are life-death-rebirth, spirit-mind-body, mother-father-child, past-present-future, power-intellect-love and creation-preservation-destruction. I considered spirit-mind-body, but they didn't come close enough to the truth concept I wanted to evoke. I briefly flirted with the trios sun-moon-earth or sun-moon-star, but then I ran across the most perfect saying:

#+begin_quote
  Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, the truth.
#+end_quote

So I decided to have a triskelion tattooed with the above trio in the spirals. Two of the spirals will have the sun and the moon, and the last spiral will have the triskelion repeated again in it because of how it represents truth for me and I just love having some form of recursion in the tattoo itself. Furthermore, the large triskelion will not look like a normal triskelion. It will have the [[https://s.pngkit.com/png/small/5-51085_vector-curve-ribbon-spiral-fibonacci-spiral-clip-art.png][Fibonacci spiral]] as the arms (who doesn't like hidden math references?). The small triskelion will simply look like a normal one.

I still don't know if I want to include the saying itself looping around the entire tattoo image as a circle. Probably not, since fine details in a tattoo can be lost over time and words are likely to be blurred out in a short period of time.

TL;DR - If I ever wanted to try to make a pithy symbol to represent rationality as a tattoo, then I'd go with a triskelion with Fibonacci spirals as the arms.
