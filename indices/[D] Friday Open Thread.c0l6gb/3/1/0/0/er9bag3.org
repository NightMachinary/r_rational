I got the serotonin one because one of my friends at the time was getting into tattoos and needed to practice, so he offered to give some of us free tattoos. I decided to get something un-eff-up-able, just straight lines because it's hard to eff up just straight lines, and it ended up looking exactly like it's supposed to look.

For a while I thought about getting dopamine on the other shoulder, but I decided that having a neurotransmitter on each shoulder would a little bit on the nose, considering all the serotonergic and dopaminergic substances I was experimenting with at the time.

Eventually I saw a necklace with a phylogenetic circle as the pendant (possibly [[https://www.ilovesciencestore.com/products/phylogenetic-tree-circle-pendant][this exact necklace]] because I followed "I F***ing Love Science" on facebook way back when I still used facebook) and I wanted it as a tattoo as soon as I saw it, and I feel like it's recontextualized the serotonin tattoo as being something more meaningful instead of being something that I picked just because I thought ecstasy was fun.

Edit in response to your edit:

If I get another one, I'd want it to be something like a stack of books with the top book open and a tree in the back left corner of the left page with a treehouse in the tree and a waterfall coming off the bottom right corner of the right page, and maybe a bridge in the middle. But that'd need to be pretty big so the smaller elements could be sufficiently detailed, and I don't know where on my body I'd put it.
