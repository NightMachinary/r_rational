I think that's a great idea, and the crux of the concern here. I had forgotten about that other example in Book 1. Along with that, maybe a more gradual decrease in details would be more comfortable for me as a reader? It felt like we went from 100% to 0% in one go; making it two didn't even register, but if it tapered off over half a dozen, that might feel more natural.
