It helps, but it definitely feels like there's a whole missing chapter's worth of events that went on there. As readers, we're now strongly disconnected from Hector's insight into the situation. Who are these four? What were their methods and motives? Did anything in Hector's Viewing of the abduction possibly expose him to scrutiny from Liberty or other parties who might doubt his cover story based on being able to gather this sort of intel?

The end of chapter introduction into a new plot regarding Hector's genetics seems to pile on a whole lot of new possibilities and questions while the ones regarding Whisper's abduction have just been opened without even a hint of closure or pointing in the direction of closure.
