I'm confused. End of last chapter, Whisper was in custody pending a debrief about the bank robbery, yeah? Is the implication that there was a coordinated conspiracy which somehow abducted her out of custody, drugged her and kept her in a private hospital for undiscussed reasons? Who are the other four targets the other teams went to take into custody?
