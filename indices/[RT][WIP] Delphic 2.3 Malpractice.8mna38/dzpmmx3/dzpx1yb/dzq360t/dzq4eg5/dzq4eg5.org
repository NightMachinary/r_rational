That's a fair concern.

I'll have to think about this. I don't intend to always give full details of the crimes. I provided a similar summary for the second murder that Hector solved for Paris in Book 1, and my intent was to do the same... start cutting out details for stuff that didn't involve much out of the ordinary.

But this is exactly the sort of feedback I'm looking for. If readers enjoy the detailed Views and the deep dives into Hector's investigations, I certainly find them fun and easy for me to write.

I'll keep tweaking things, so reader feedback is very valuable.
