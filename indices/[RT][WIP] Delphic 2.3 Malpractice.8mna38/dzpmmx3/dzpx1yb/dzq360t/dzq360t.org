They help some, but I am still missing a lot of info that the previous chapters have taught me to expect. Every previous time Hector viewed a crime to track down suspects, we got all the details in realtime. Now it's all being skipped over.

I suspect that if the next chapter was to provide a lot of info about the crime and the perpetrators, that would retroactively fill in the gaps, but it feels weird to not have that info in this serial format given the way the story has been told up til now.
