Just using heuristics I have developed from my exposure to relativity: areas with slower speeds for light would change/evolve slower relative to areas with faster speeds of light, massless particles (such as photons) would travel at the local speed of light for all observers, areas with a constant speed of light would behave normally but areas where c is changing with respect to space (or time) would be... confusing, you would still get c=1 (or whatever it is in the units you are using) if you tried to measure it no matter the relative difference between c 'here' and 'there', if a massive (having mass) particle went into an area with a different speed of light it would slow down / speed up so that it is now traveling at the same fraction of c as it was before but would not feel any acceleration, the value of c would be dependent on some object/particle/process and would move/change with the position/state of the thing that is changing/causing the value of c, causality might get weird. Example: you have built a tube of altered c between two galaxies with a higher value of c than usual space. There is a physical thing that is causing the change in c that either projects the change where you want it to be or just causes the change around itself and you have a line of it going between the destinations. Each end has an entrance/exit where the change in c over space is as gradual as possible so you minimize the strangeness for anything you want to travel through the tube. Say you're in a ship that is going to enter the tube, the ship mundanely accelerates to lets say .5c in normal space then begins to enter the tube, as you go deeper into it you notice that everything outside the tube seems to be happening slower, orbits of planets, turbulence of plasma in stars, other ships. Once fully inside, nothing seems any different inside the tube, but if you look outside the tube there would be distortions in the images reaching you due to the tube of altered c. From outside the tube it looks like you are traveling much faster, possibly faster than local c, also with distortions. You eventually reach your destination and come out of the tube of altered c sooner than light could travel between the two spots, so you are able not only to look back and watch your ship when it first entered the tube, but as you look at the tube nearer to you, you can see your ship which appears to be traveling backwards through the tunnel as the light nearer you reaches you first. The point at which these two images meet would be the point at which you began moving at local, unaltered c, and the time you would observe this would be the time it takes local light to get from that point to where you are now.
