I think we would get the most potent explosive in the universe. The area with changed /c/ would have different energies for subatomic particles, which would probably force an array of exotic decays, freeing tons of energy. Also we would get that energy (photons) in wavelengths normally not achievable. As [[/u/eaglejarl]] wrote, that would trigger cascades of new reactions at the border of the zone.

In most of bigger atoms, electron configuration is shaped by relativistic effects, so most of our chemistry would fall apart.

I doubt we would get time signalling, tho, that space would most probably behave like compressed space, distorting the light cone, but not stepping out of it, so yeah, as long as you could get any coherent signal trough the violently exploding zone, it would be FTL signalling.
