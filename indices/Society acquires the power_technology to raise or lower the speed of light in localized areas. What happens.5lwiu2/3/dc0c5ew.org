Avoiding the question: We already can, at least in one direction. Glass has a higher index of refraction than vacuum. The speed of light in a medium is =c/n=, where =n= is the index of refraction. Therefore, the speed of light in glass is slower. Tada! I'm guessing that this isn't what you meant, and will assume that you mean changing the speed of light in a vacuum.

Short answer: Either everything breaks, or you live like gods.

Long answer: Light is an electromagnetic wave. This was first shown by noticing that the speed of light can be calculated from the strength of the electric and magnetic forces. =c = 1/sqrt(epsilon_0 * mu_0)= The bigger the value of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity][epsilon_0]], the weaker the electric force. The bigger the value of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability][mu_0]], the stronger the magnetic force. In order to change the speed of light, you need to change one of these values.

So, what happens if you change the electric force? Well, electrons around a nucleus are primarily held together by electric attraction. Change the strength of that attraction, and chemistry breaks down. Carbon now bonds much more strongly to itself, or much less strongly. Your body is mostly carbon. This is deadly.

Let's change the magnetic force instead. This ends up being even worse. Nuclei are held together by the strong nuclear force, with an additional spin-orbit magnetic coupling. This magnetic coupling helps to determine which nuclei are stable, and which are not. By changing it, ordinary nuclei might become radioactive.

So far, it would be extremely dangerous to make one of these fields, but safe so long as nothing ever goes into it. However, it gets even worse.

Much of modern physics is based on symmetries. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem][Noether's theorem]] is a really cool application of this. Any time you have a symmetry, it makes there be some conservation law associated with it. The universe is translationally symmetric, which causes conservation of momentum. The universe is rotationally symmetric, which causes conservation of angular momentum. The universe is time-invariant, which causes conservation of energy.

Since the speed-of-light bubbles can be created and destroyed, there is no time-symmetry, and so conservation of energy is gone. Since the speed-of-light bubbles exist in only a limited region, conservation of momentum is gone. This breakage can be exploited to freely create and destroy energy and momentum, as desired. Imagine cars that require no fuel. Imagine spaceships that fly forever, continually accelerating by exploiting the bubbles to gain momentum.

Note that I have yet to say anything about special relativity, which is where the speed of light plays the biggest role. That is because I'm not sure how to keep special relativity at all without these symmetries. Special relativity assumes that the speed of light is the only constant, and works from there.

If special relativity does still exist in some form, then causality is completely broken. Temporarily changing the speed of light, travelling through that region, then turning the speed of light down, is equivalent to faster-than-light travel. Any form of FTL is equivalent to time travel. [[http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/54242][This stack exchange post]] gives a bit of the math behind it, along with an example.

So, in short, such a change would fundamentally alter our role in the universe. Either we would change the universe so much that we would no longer be able to survive in it, or we would exploit it in order to live like gods, with truly unlimited energy and time travel.
