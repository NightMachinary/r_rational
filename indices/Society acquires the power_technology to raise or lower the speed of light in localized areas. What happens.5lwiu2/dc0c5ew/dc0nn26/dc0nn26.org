  So, in short, such a change would fundamentally alter our role in the universe. Either we would change the universe so much that we would no longer be able to survive in it, or we would exploit it in order to live like gods, with truly unlimited energy and time travel.

I'm pretty sure you win best answer. I see that due to the interconnections of the laws of physics, being able to change the value of c in a defined area would be similar to being able to change the value of pi in a defined area. All hail the many angled ones!

Some time it would be cool to see a story with superpowers in it, but the theme of the story not so much about the powers as about the fact that every single one of those powers, if present in a world actually similar to the "real" world, would represent a flaw or change in the laws of physics which could be exploited by humanity to relatively easily munchkin our technology to godlike power.
