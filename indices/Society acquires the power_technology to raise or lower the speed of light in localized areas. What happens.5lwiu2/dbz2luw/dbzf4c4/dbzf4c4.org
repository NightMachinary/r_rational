One way to explain why the universe has so uniform temperature is that billions of years ago, /c/ was substantially higher. As far as I understand it's not a terribly popular (i.e. well-supported) theory, but it does exist nonetheless so varying /c/ doesn't necessarily break literally everything.

There is an [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-536][SCP entry]] which outlines some of the stranger possible outcomes of locally altered /c/.
