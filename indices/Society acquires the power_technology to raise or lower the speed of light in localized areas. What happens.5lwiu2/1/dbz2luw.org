I asked this on [[/r/AskPhysics]] back when I was writing Induction. The answers I got varied from "physics doesn't work like that" to "don't be ridiculous." The most useful response -- which still wasn't that useful -- was "physics is an interdependent edifice. You can't change one part without throwing everything out of whack."

Whatever the answer, weird things are going to happen at the interface. Also, you can send signals "faster than light" by sending them through / around the affected zone (depending on whether the zone is sped up or slowed down). You could use that to get limited FTL communication, which means sending messages back in time within one of the zones.
