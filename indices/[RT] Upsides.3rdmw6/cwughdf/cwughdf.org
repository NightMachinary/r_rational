Nice. I expect people to make heavy suits that let them walk around with their hands outside and farming/utilities to be a big deal. Also, immediate research on tools and techniques for living in an upside down world.

Properly weighed heavy suits should allow very fast manual travel. (Massive hand leaps are easy now)
