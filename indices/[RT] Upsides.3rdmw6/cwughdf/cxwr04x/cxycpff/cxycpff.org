It's an upside down suit. You walk with your hands by pushing the ceiling/floor. You're still face up from your perspective. The suit would need to have a "high" center of gravity for this, and boots/gloves that weigh 70+ kg total are hard to find. You need a distributed set of weight you're pushing down or sitting on in order for your muscles to not be overstrained in one area and to be stable enough not to "fall over" upwards. Ideally the suit makes you "weigh" effectively a total of ~20 lbs so you can move fast outside with your hands. (like moon jumping but with your hands)
