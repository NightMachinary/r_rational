One bug:

#+begin_quote
  In the first second, they'd gone one meter. In the second second, they'd gone three meters. That meant acceleration approximated one meter per second per second, which was almost exactly equal to the force of gravity, only working in reverse.
#+end_quote

Earth's gravity is 9.8 m/s^{2} ... 1m/s^{2} would be about a tenth of a gee. That would actually be more survivable, but still fatal for anyone outside.

Could simply be a thinko by the narrator, in a stressful situation.

Edit: also, at 1 m/s^{2} in the first second they'd go 1/2 a meter, in the second second 2 meters. s = 1/2 a t^{2} ...
