If I were going for more, I would probably do it with multiple viewpoints, so you would see the reactions of a variety of different people as they respond to the change. Stephen King did that with "The Stand", which I think is a good way to do a disaster. This will be a more "cozy" type of story.

The other concern is that a survival story like this naturally lends itself to a reversal of the typical dramatic flow. Traditionally, a novel/movie/whatever starts slow and ramps up to a big crescendo as the end. But if you're talking about something like /this/, the natural tendency will be for the big dramatic thing to happen at the /beginning/ and then things gradually get better and less dramatic as food, water, and shelter are taken care of. You can mix things up with an author who throws in lots of curve balls, but I'm sort of on the fence about that. So to make sure that I'm not petering out (because the world is moving from chaos to order with every success on the part of the main characters) I want to keep the story pretty tight. This story mostly exists because I read "The Martian" and started thinking about how people structure Man vs. Nature.
