I love this story, precisely because of the power interactions in it. To be more exact, I like how Hector, who seemingly has such an unbelievably unbeatable investigative power, is effectively countered by something as seemingly basic as invisibility.

It's wonderful. It reminds me of some of the video games I like to play, where sometimes it doesn't matter how powerful you are if your opponent completely invalidates your play style.

I do wish the chapters had a bit more action, and (I know you probably get this a lot considering how big of a success Worm was but I still feel like I ought to ask) would you be willing to consider Interludes? I know asking for interludes after I just asked for the story to advance faster is unfair, but you're hinting at such a wonderfully wide world it would be nice to see it from more perspectives.

I also like how you mentioned how powers can affect a super's mind as much as their body. I like how there is a mental trade off for Hector's clairvoyance (the bad sleep), and it makes me wonder about the invisible assassin. In a show I used to watch called Alphas, that also had an invisible assassin in it, the assassin's power had been 'always on' since she received it and, as such, she found actually being seen very uncomfortable. It's that kind of thing, where having powers leads to a true qualitative difference in experience, that I would love to see more of in this story.
