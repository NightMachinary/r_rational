Disappointment noted.

I'm currently managing a chapter about every 5 days; I just finished my draft for chapter 13 and started on chapter 14 yesterday.

I'm considering building up to about a two-week buffer, then "spending" some of it on an interlude chapter. That way it doesn't interrupt the weekly schedule.
