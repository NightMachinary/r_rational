I'm pretty sure my dungeon world dm ran this for us. Idk how much of it was stolen from lamentations of the flame princess, but at the top of the sky chain we found the obelisk. It allowed us to access any time or place outside the sky chain. We discussed the scope of this at the table and decided that the characters in the rpg could visit our table irl if they wanted to. Of course, they did not because they had no idea they were characters in a game. We ended up time traveling to allow the creation of immortality.
