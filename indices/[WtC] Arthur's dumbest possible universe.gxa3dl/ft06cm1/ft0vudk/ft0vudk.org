I think it would also explain a bit better why Arthur was just so sick of Aerb.

from his mirror speech:

"The coincidences, the improbabilities, the way that things seem to fit just right, character arcs that are completed in the final seconds of the last battle. I don't know how much of my biography you'll have read, or how much you'll have learned about me, but if you don't see the patterns in your own life, I'm sure you'll see them in mine. Looking back, it all seems so trite. So many NPCs with their sob stories, so many love interests, paraded around in front of me before their inevitable deaths. I'll admit to being affected, at first."

It seems to me that Arthurs problem isn't just the lack of perceived stakes and the often discussed problems of narrative but that one of his major problems was that he lacked immersion which he had a bit in the beginning but which faded over time if it hadn't been thrown in his face every other day (game notifications, the horrible quest text puns etc.) that he was in some form of game his time on Aerb would likely have been a lot different . With that situation him realizing some time along the way that he actually came up with this world would be even more soul crushing for him. A hell of his own creation.

Do we have any info on when in the Aerb time line Arthur fought a Mome Rath? Might pin together nicely his descend into an ever more grim character.

I really hope that we'll get a lot more information of Arthurs relationship with the DM/Vervain

Anyway OPs theory is now definitely my head canon
