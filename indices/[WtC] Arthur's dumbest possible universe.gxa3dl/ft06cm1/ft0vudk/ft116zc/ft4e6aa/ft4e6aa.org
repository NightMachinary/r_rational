'Mome Rath' is on the list of names that Uther gave Masters.

It's not clear if this is because he fought one, or because he remembered the name from the conversation on earth.

However, the antimemetic effect seemed to keep Joon from being able to remember the name Mome Rath until he fought and killed one, so if Arthur could remember, that suggests he might have fought one.

(Unless Juniper actually just forgot what Mome Rath was because he was forgetful, or something.)
