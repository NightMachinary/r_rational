Rain with a skill swapping friend is going to be fun.

The other thing besides non-synergistic skills is the secrecy about classes and skills. The Guard at least seems to have their standard builds that do useful things, but the guild really should too. Even just having level 5 class picks well known does a big bump for most adventurers.

His ideas on builds may also chance when he finally bumps into the damage cap or see more of the higher level people in action, and learning about their skill mixes.

Also, we have only just started seeing crafting. We've seen stat boosting, and we've seen basic enchantment, but what kinds of things do higher tier crafting skills do? Can you boost skills? Skill Categories? Classes? Class Bonuses or Effects? How far will rain's tech development go, and how much will crafting support that?
