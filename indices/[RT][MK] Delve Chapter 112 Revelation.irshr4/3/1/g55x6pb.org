Guild members tend to follow published skill progressions.

That said, I'm actually of the opinion that the "bad" progressions are only bad if they don't have properly built teammates, or decided to switch focus midway, like Staavo did after losing his foot. Though if Tallheart can make a good enough prosthetic he may be able to recover and turn his build into a decent hybrid build with some hidden skills.
