  She also has the benefit of perfectly balanced stats, which means much more points into the regen stats than most people (she has a 1:1 ratio instead of the 3:1 or 4:1 of most mages)

Well, it won't really help because she is MAD between six stats instead of two. If a Normal Mage is 3:1 then he might run 40 Int 20 Clarity per 60 points. She's going to be running 10/10/10/10/10/10 instead. So relative to their size, her pools recover thrice as fast, but at an absolute rate, they recover half speed.
