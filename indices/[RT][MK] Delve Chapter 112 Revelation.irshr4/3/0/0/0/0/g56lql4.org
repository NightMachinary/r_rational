She also has the benefit of perfectly balanced stats, which means much more points into the regen stats than most people (she has a 1:1 ratio instead of the 3:1 or 4:1 of most mages), plus the ability to power level using metamagic/regen skills that would otherwise be suboptimal. For example, she can do physical training while her mana regens, then magic training while she recovers stamina, while having skills that boost both (Intrinsic Clarity and its equivalents). She can also switch to passive skills when she's not training, maybe even abusing whatever that skill was that gives a huge regen boost but prevents casting. Her class perk offers a lot of ways to game the leveling system; even if she can't level as easily as Rain she's been doing it much longer.
