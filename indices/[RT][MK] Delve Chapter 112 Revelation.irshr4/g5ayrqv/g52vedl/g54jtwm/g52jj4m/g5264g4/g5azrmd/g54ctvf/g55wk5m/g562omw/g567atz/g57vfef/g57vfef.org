How much of that could be done better by other builds though? Tallheart is, I think, the highest level charachter in Rains circle of friends by far so just on raw stats alone he's a formidable fighter.

But for example, making walls and barriers: Ameliah's earth magic seems to have done that better and faster despite her being at a lower level and not having class the way an actual Earth mage would.
