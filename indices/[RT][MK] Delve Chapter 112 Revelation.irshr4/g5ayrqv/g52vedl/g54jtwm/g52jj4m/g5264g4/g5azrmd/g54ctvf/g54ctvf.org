Tbh I do not think crafters belong to the party. They should be doing the crafting. They are a force multiplier when they are not in a dungeon. In the dungeon there should be someone else with actual dungeoneering skills. And occasionally get leveled up with the party's assistance when possible. I don't think the world would be balanced so that every 8th awakened would be a crafter.

Personally I think the story is not going to the direction where Rain gets a big blue again. He has newbies, so they would be trying to get them some levels first. Then they could help him get some levels.
