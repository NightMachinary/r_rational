I'm of course talking about an equal leveled 8 man party going in a raid. Not the company. And not Tallheart specifically, just a crafter.

He only needs to go when they are trying to level him up. Of course he needs to be with them when he is being leveled. But that is imo the only time.

At the moment Tallheart should definitely be in and carry the noobs to level them.
