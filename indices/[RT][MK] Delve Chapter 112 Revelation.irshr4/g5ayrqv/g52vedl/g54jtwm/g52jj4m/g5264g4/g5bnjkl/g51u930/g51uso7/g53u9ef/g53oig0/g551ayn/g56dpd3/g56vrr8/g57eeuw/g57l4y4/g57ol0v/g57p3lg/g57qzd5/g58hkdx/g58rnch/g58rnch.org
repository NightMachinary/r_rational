I don't. I similarly won't assume there to be an interesting follow-on if he went Warrior (if he got it as an option) instead, or at least one that synergizes with Rain's aura build. Sure, going Worker might mean that there will be a better version of it that brings more bonuses to auras, but to be honest, for Rain to choose Worker when he didn't know if it will go well with his build in future but then there just happens to be advancement that did feels a bit iffy for me. It reminds me of stories where the MC just stumbles upon rewards rather than working for it.

Sure, just by looking at the bonuses that Worker gives would allow him to postulate that such a class exists but I don't believe Rain's the kind of guy to take on those chances. And early on in the story, he went for Clarity mostly because of his mana problem, with aura effectiveness being a lower priority. So it doesn't make sense for him to go Worker imo just because it /might/ lead to a better class, while ignoring his current problems (at that time). If he went for Dynamo as he did, he'd be achieving both his current goals and a probable suitable future class.
