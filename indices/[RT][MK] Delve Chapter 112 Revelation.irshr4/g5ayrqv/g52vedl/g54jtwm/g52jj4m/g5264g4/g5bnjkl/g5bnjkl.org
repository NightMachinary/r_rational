Man I wonder what [[https://www.royalroad.com/profile/122908][SenescentSoul]] is gonna do from here. I'm getting super excited about the potential kingdom(in this case guild)-building coming up, and political power is my favorite kind of OP MC power to read about.

With that said everyone seems to be complaining about the interpersonal parts of the story, which would be necessary to explore rain's growing political power... I guess I hope Sense ignores them and goes that root anyway? Personally I don't care much for the numbers-go-up. I love the direction it is going now with a more large-scale political approach.
