Nice to see that ass Rankin get his justice for embezzling all that Tel.

And we get some hard confirmation on Rain's plans for his group. He explicitly states the problem with Awakened and why they can't deal with monsters at higher levels, as both get exponential amounts of strength, which is negligible at lower levels and is apparent at high levels, with most of the humans' strength coming from a synergized party. Crafters, tanks, magical dps, physical dps, ranged and physical attackers, healers, and supports in one party can increase a group's total strength far more than a party of jack of all trades dps, an issue that can't be resolved normally in that world due to its medieval level, exemplified when Rain brings up Tallheart and how Awakened don't have easy access to such a valuable and important power boost, akin to fighting without equipment in normal games. We've already known all this earlier, but it's nice for Rain to explicitly say all that and confirm it.

Now I just wish we'd get on with the action, I want to get back to the theorycrafting and min-maxing in combat. How many more months until we get back to the good part? We've already spent an entire month with Rain stuck in a hole and another month with Rain stuck in a coma, please give us some action.
