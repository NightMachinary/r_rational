I think you're wrong here. The system is all about stacking multiplies and exponential growth so I think that if you go for a balanced approach you're going to reach a point where your defence isn't high enough to stop a one hit kill from an offensive specced monster, and your offence isn't high enough to hurt a tanky monster.

You'd be much better off going for a DPS/Tank combo and squeezing out every drop of exponential growth.
