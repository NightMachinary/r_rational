True, but I mean we've seen the system reveal hidden skills to rescue people who make those kinds of decisions, or even reward them.

Whatever the optimal build and optimal set if builds for a party are, they may well include a lot of that sort of hyper specialization.

^{And yes, even though there's probably not an outright "bad" build as long as it's coherent, there's almost certainly an optimal build since the system relies on the illusion of depth through limiting information rather than actual depth through incomparable choices.}
