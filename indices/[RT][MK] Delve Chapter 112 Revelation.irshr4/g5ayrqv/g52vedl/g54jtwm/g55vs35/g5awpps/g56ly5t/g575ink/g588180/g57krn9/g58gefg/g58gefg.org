This is not at all true. He's progressed in quite a few ways. He's trained his stats up, as well as figured out how to raise them further, he got a macro hack, he's got better use of his powers for damage, and he even now leads a group, with quite a haul of money, and the authority that comes from a Custodian plate from the Watch. He's been working on his meditation skills, with obvious future payoff, with additional payoff from the tons of accolades he collected, and he hacked his way into getting Dozer. And that's not even counting the tech progress.
