If you look at the reviews, many complain about his characters. I suppose that's why he's focusing on it.

Personally, I would prefer he focused more on the system and I've been strategizing my Patreon subscription whenever the story does that. For example, when he got stuck in the town crystal thing. Interface/system customization is the primary reason I'm reading this story and it's hard to find anything similar. It's also why I don't really mind if he can't level up because he is still growing regardless.
