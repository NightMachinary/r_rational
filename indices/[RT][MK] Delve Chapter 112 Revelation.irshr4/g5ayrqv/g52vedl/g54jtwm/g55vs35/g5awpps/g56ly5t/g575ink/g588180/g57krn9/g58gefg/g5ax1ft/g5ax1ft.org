As I see it the appeal in a ratfic sense is about finding ways to be at the top of the heap without having it granted by the metaphysical forces that rule it all. Rain is doing that. He's being slow and has to earn every baby step, but he's doing it.

As for having a bigger stick he'll never beat any of the big players in a 1 on 1 fight (or a 1 vs hivemind fight in the case of the Citizens). He's a support class while they're all soloists or some variation of soloists. Blues won't help with that. At least until he has a party together, which, he's working on that. Some blue ex machina that sneaks up on him just to die in his face, again, would be pretty lame.
