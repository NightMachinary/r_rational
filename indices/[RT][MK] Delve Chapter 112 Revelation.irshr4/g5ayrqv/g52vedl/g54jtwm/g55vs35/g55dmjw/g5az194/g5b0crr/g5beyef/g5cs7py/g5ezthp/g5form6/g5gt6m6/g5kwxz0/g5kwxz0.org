I mean, historically, when the roman empire collapsed people lost the knowledge/ability to build their large buildings (stone arches, viaducts, bath-houses etc), but the buildings themselves remained for centuries. The majistraal are the collapsed empire, and I think it's mentioned that the bath-house was a majistraal building (as were quite a few others). You could even handwave some of the 'maintaining old structures' problems by saying that they were magically reinforced.
