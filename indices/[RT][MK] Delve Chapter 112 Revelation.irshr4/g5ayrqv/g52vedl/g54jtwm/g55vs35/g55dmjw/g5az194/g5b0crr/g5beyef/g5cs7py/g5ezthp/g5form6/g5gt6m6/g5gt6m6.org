Not necessarily zero but they'd need more advanced mathematics than they have to build 5 stories tall towers like the one stavo has.

Or castles, forts, bridges, multistory buildings, bathhouses, city walls etc.

The level of math they display doesn't match their architecture at all. At their level they should have huts made of straw and dirt like most europeans did until 2500 to 1500 years ago depending on the region.
