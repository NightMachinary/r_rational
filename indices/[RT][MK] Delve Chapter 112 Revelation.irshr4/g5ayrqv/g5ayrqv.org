So, finally caught up with this story.

I do like it, but ... 112 chapters, but it's been what, 2 months since he arrived? And only now is starting to work towards the delving part?

Don't get me wrong. I definitely appreciate the lack of EDGE this story has, the time it takes to world build, as well a slow and steady progression in abilities, but man is this slow!

Not to mention he's taking a very lackadaisical approach to not dying... I get he's support based and personal power would be a long time coming, but you'd think he'd prioritize not dying/getting injured by your abilities first. It's only recent chapters it seems like this is becoming a thing he's working on.

Another thing. There's being naive and nice, but there's another when making the stupidest decisions possible, and then going 'Oh well, what can you do?" How about applying that reasoning before the decision?? The fact that he isn't chained up in a basement or dead is kind of a miracle in itself.

Sorry for the rant. Again, I do like the story really, but it was tough at times to get though, not counting the micromanaging of stats... Also it's kind of shitty how he's kind of guilt tripping Ameliah to join, but I understand she's needed.
