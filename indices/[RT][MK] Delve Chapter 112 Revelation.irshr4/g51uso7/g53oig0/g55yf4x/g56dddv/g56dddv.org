I'm pretty sure he'll just go Legendary Dynamo. It will basically turn him into Aura-Master 2.0. The ability to take aura skills above level 10 AND increase his own regeneration massively via the even higher Clarity rate buff will allow him to maintain multiple high-cost auras at once, he will be able to double or triple the power of everyone around him within hundreds of metres. Legendary indeed. It will also go a long way to convincing people they don't need to take passive skills that he can provide the replacement for, allowing them to specialise much further down DPS/etc paths.
