I'm aware. But honestly a non-dynamo Aura mage is pathetic and will take far too long to even get feasible. A Dynamo non-aura mage only becomes truely useful at Gold Tier, at which point a Dynamo Aura mage is still always better (unless you are alone). The two dovetail together so nicely, there is almost never any reasonable reason to spec into only one unless you were the last man alive on earth.
