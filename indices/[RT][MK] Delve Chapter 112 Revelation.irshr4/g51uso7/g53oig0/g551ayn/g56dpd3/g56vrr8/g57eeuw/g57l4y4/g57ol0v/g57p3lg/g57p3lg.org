He has two choices:

- 200% bonus to mana regen

- 50% bonus to Winter, Channel Mastery, Amplify Aura, Compression, Extend Aura, Intrinsic Clarity, Intrinsic Focus, Magical Synergy, Aura Focus, Aura Synergy, and some other skills.

The second one is much better, even before you consider that he could switch to using an offensive skill and still get the full benefit of the boosted passives and metamagic.
