That's only true if you have a specific generous interpretation of how Worker works and allow it to boost all those skills in synergy. With how the rest of the system works I'm going to need a lot more than the description text in an early chapter for a class that Rain was never going to take to believe that that is the intended result. Instead I will read the class with the obviously intended interpretation that it only boosts skills that are intentionally meant for non combat use. The idea that instead it boosts any skill that isn't an obvious combat skill is ludicrous. If that was the case then worker would be obviously brokenly overpowered for almost all builds.
