She's probably pretty mediocre as a Bronze actually, at least compared to other rare classes. Her ability to change skills is amazing but doesn't unlock until Silver. We don't actually know what her original build was, but in addition to perfectly even stats she probably had skills in several minimally-related trees, which means missing out on the ability to stack metamagic.

The build might work well with Rain, since she would be a frontline fighter who can actually benefit from him providing mana, but as a solo warrior it's probably weaker than a well-planned traditional warrior build.
