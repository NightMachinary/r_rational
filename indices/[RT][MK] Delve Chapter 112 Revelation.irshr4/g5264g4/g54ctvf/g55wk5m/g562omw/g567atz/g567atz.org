A crafter has the ability to make tools on the fly, so the party doesn't have to carry a bunch of special and situational equipment around. For example, Tallheart's skills would lend themselves wonderfully toward making walls and barriers to CC enemies. Or custom shaped keys for locks, collars for creatures the party may wish to capture. His presence adds a lot of utility that's just not available without a crafter, since bags of infinite carry space are unavailable. He also lets the party use resources immediately instead of having to go back, allowing for longer delves and less time wasted travelling back and forth.

The off-dps and off-tank roles are to cover for when the mains could use some help. They give the party much-needed flexibility because a more specialized dps can't damage sponge and a more specialized tank can't CC or deal rapid damage.
