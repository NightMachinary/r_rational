Loved Rain's rant in this chapter. I also sympathized with the adventurers' confusion when Rain was trying to explain Rankin's scam. I understood it, but it took a few rereads to fully get it.

The part that wasn't immediately obvious is that adventurers are completely unaffected by this scam, their quest rewards are the exact same. Rankin was just siphoning away some of the Guild's share/tax.

But I think Rain made the right choice to "bribe" the adventurers so they don't try to claim the rest of his money and to get some necessary goodwill from them and the Guild.
