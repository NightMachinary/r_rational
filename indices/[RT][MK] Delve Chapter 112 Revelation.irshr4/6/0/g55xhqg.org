This was my opinion too. But there's another layer. By his speech and then bribing them to pay them "back" he's convinced a lot of them that Rankin did in fact steal from them directly.

He's secured their goodwill but also their help in getting Rankin turned over to the guild to face his penalties, for some goodwill from the Guild, when normally most of them wouldn't care if they weren't the ones being stolen from.
