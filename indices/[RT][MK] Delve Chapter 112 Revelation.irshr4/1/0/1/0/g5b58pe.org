Maybe, though considering her father told her how to get her rare bronze class and she did tell Rain that Legendary Silver requires 5 points each in 5 specialization trees, I think it's likely she did do that. Since that's not widely known, I doubt she would imply that its THE way to do it if she had done it a different way. I'd guess that when her dad helped her get her bronze class he also told her to keep putting points in the same five trees (though probably not a full build).

The only "suboptimal" skill we know she took as a Bronze is Purify, and you do get one freebie (5 trees with 5 points each, but you get 26 points to do it).
