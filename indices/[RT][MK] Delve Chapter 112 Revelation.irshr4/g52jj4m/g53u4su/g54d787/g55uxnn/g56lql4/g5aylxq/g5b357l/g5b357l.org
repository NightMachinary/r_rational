Right, but the mage has basically zero stamina/health regen and probably no skills that depend on them. If she's really grinding skills/xp, Ameliah can insure she never has full stamina or mana, and (if she's smart/dedicated enough) probably use low-teir blood magic to take advantage of her health regen. When a mage runs out of mana, they're done training for the day, when Ameliah runs out she can train physical skills.
