I mean, let's be real, a non-insignificant portion of both litRPG fans and ratfic fans really like numbers-go-up. I personally like numbers-go-up. Numbers-go-up is useful for conveying growth and plot progression (though obviously you need to actually /do stuff/ with said larger numbers).

Rain has been capped for a long time. And sure, he's still figuring stuff out and plot is happening, but he's not getting any stronger. And in a world as explicitly who's-got-the-bigger-stick as a litRPG world, well, that matters.
