That will be the main challenge. Convincing people this is worth the risk. Won't be as big of a deal once they have a few Aura Dynamo's up and running, that way people aren't screwed even if Rain dies, so people will be more trusting. Once they've had some early success, the momentum will be there. Though not without its share of challenges, public confidence is the only obstacle remaining (and not letting major powers figure out how much of a sleeping game changer there is waking up in his little group)
