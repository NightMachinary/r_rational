I imagine it will change depending on the specific creatures of dungeons.\\
It will probably make sense to think of smaller sets of 2-3 class clusters. Smaller groupings of highly specalised class synergies that together can fufill 'High DPS', 'Group Shielding', 'Group Battery' roles.\\
Although, group battery basically means you just need to have a Dynamo in every party above level 10 (when their aura synergies start getting potent). After level 25, a Dynamo is mandatory as their auras essentially become high speed regen Health/Stamina/Mana all at once.\\
For other classes, they can forgo the passives that normally increase their regeneration and instead double down on true class potentials
