  But that's exactly what happened with Dynamo.

That's true. Didn't think of that tbh.

Probably because I feel that he got Dynamo as an option naturally without any notion that SenescentSoul was pushing the story in that direction at all, at least to me. If he planned to go Worker in the first place, he probably would've still gone full Clarity and found Dynamo as an option regardless imo. Whether Dynamo or Worker is better is another discussion entirely and one that I don't actually understand fully.
