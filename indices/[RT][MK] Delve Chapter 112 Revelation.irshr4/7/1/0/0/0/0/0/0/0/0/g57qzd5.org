I believe Dynamo has more future potential. First of all, we don't know if Worker would give bonuses to future auras that Rain will gain access to in the future. Also, there's also the Legendary Dynamo when he reaches Silverplate as he goes on being a Clarity monolith. Sure, Worker would bring greater immediate benefits but Rain's the type to focus more on long term plans IMO.
