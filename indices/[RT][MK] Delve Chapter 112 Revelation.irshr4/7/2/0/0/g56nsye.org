  One that had caught his fancy recently was something that he'd dubbed the â€˜passivist'. It was a shame that the pun really only worked in English. It was all about picking up as many passive skills as possible, with only a few actives for utility as well as some pre-combat self-buffs. He had no idea how viable it would be in practice, but on paper it was putting out some impressive numbers at level eighteen. It was a lot more rounded than his own build, with good offense and defense, just a bit lacking in utility.

  Mana Striking was an odd passive that used mana to boost damage on any physical attack, armed or not. Combined with the multiplier from Strength of Arm and a few other things, basic attacks ended up doing a few thousand damage, which was insane. He wasn't that sure of the numbers, just going by the damage of punching practice with Carten as the punching bag.

  Additionally, the build had great staying power. That was thanks to Mute, a skill which tripled all regeneration, health, stamina, and mana. It did this at the cost of temporarily sealing other active skills. He'd heard about Mute a while ago, but as nice as getting another regen multiplier would be, it wasn't compatible with auras. Winter was better after all the boosts he had, but it wasn't surprising that most people went with Mute for recovery between fights. It was a great skill, assuming they were willing to spend the points to unlock the prerequisites. The so-called Passivist would be able to keep it going constantly as it didn't affect passive skills. They'd only need to lower it to recast buffs.

  /Rain shivered again as he looked at the build he'd outlined in his mind. This would trash me in a one-on-one, even with my armor. I wouldn't have a chance, but...imagine if I had one on my team. Velocity alone would be massive, but if I also had Prismatic Intent with Precision, Acuity, and the Imperial Auras... Woof. Crazy./
