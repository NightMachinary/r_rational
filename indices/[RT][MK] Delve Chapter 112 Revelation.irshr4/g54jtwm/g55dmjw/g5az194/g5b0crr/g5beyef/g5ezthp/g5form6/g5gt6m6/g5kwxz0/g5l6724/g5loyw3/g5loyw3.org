The only underground majistraal building I've heard of is the dome control chamber, and I don't recall anyone saying it was buried by time. It seems more likely it was built underground in the first place.

I wasn't assuming most buildings, just the bath-house, maybe the foundations of the walls, and any large roads (although the majistraal might just have been able to teleport most goods and people).

For a counterpoint to the idea that majistraal buildings have been buried over time, I think it was stated that the teleportation platforms (majistraal artefacts) are immobile, and the one in Fel Sadanis is above-ground.
