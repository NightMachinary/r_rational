The only majistraal building I know of that's underground is the barrier crystal chamber, and I think that's a case of being deliberately built underground in the first place rather than solid rock forming up over it.

I think it's explicitly stated that the teleportation platform is a majistraal artifact, and I don't think those are mobile.
