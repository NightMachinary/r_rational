Except it's only really OP because the world is conveniently set up in a way for that to be the case.. An ancient super advanced civilization existed before, but somehow everyone, even the educated elite forgot about the concept of zero. Sure..

​

Also the world is very badly optimized. No crafters because slavery, but he has a crafter friend to make him OP items. Nobody understands basic math even though they can build castles, forts and large cities with lights everywhere. Hmmm...

​

People living in huts and without writing on the americas understood math and invented the concept of zero, but in delve that's up to the MC to fix.

​

The annoying part is, we know what's going to happen and it isn't that interesting. He'll optimize the world by creating systems to protect crafters, elevate commoners and teach people basic math.
