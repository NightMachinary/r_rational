I mean, reading his comments it sounds like his problem is mostly that the writing for the dialogues and interpersonal stuff is pretty weak, which...it kinda is, not gonna lie, but I agree the power progression part of the story is really well done, keeping it way more interesting than just numbers-go-up while conserving the feeling of the MC constantly progressing. It's good enough that I can easily overlook the weaker parts of the writing at least.
