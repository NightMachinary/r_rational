I'm surprised anyone on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is this unhappy with the mc not getting more powerup handouts. He's still finding new ways to exploit the ones he's got.

Even if he was getting more skill handouts, his build is complete garbage for delving without a party to benefit from his skills, and any extra skills won't change that, they'll just kill opportunities for future story moments.
