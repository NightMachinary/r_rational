Likewise! I enjoy seeing the contents of the system given how much thought went into it (such as when it's mentioned in other people's chapters), but I'd also be perfectly happy if he never levelled again.

To me at least, the interpersonal parts /are/ the strength of the story:

- As you say, there's political intrigue to spare;

- The sociological aspects are extremely well thought out, and contrast with his beliefs in interesting ways;

- Rain's individual relationships show a lot about him, but importantly the other characters have their own relationships and plans rather than /just/ following his ideas (at worst, most could be their own cliche fantasy protagonists);

- Rain has a strong sense of morality and emotionally intelligent ways of expressing it (to me, both great things in a protagonist).

It's a shame to see some people don't value these in this fiction as much as its power progression, if only because I see a slow pace as a tool to explore these rather than as a flaw of writing.
