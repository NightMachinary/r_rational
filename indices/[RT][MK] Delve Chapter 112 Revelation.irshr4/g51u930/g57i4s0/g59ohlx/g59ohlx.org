Using Rain's example in story:

If the quest is posted with a reward of 100 tel, then the payers pay 110 tel, adventurers get the reward of 100 tel, and the Guild gets the tax of 10% at 10 tel. That's what happens as normal.

But with Rankin's interference, the quest is still posted with a reward of 100 tel, the payers pay 110 tel, adventurers get 100 tel, and the guild is told that the quest was worth only 90 tel, and therefore get only 9 tel. That leaves 100 reward tel + 9 tax tel + 1 tel for Rankin which is 110 tel for payers to pay.

In both cases, adventurers and payers all see everything as normal. The only one who is affected, is the Guild. Which makes sense, because adventurers probably also post quests from time to time and would have been suspicious if things were off when they were paying versus earning.
