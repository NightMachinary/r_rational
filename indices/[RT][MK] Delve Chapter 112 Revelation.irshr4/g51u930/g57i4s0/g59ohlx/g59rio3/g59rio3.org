No. The guild is an institution. They tend to have guidelines on stuff like how much they are selling stuff for. Here it would be what the quests are worth.

I don't think they would not notice if their gains from the city dropped by 10% just like that when Rankin started.

Instead he would keep the price the guild sees the same, and raise the price of setting up a quest by that 10%. That way the guild would not notice anything wrong and come check.

That said, getting tens of thousands by siphoning just a percent is a bit weird. He was probably embezzling in other ways too, like Rain thought.
