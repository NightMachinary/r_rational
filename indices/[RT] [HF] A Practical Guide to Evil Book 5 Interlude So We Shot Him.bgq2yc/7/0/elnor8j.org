We've seen into Arcadia 3x recently: 1) Cat dive-bombing its Fae denizens on her way to block the cavalry charge into the Army of Callow remnants led by Juniper, 2) Cat attempting to open a gate to have the Army of Callow retreat through and being brimstone'd, and 3) Adjutant travelling through the empty space to deliver Cat's message to the Tyrant.

So the brimstone problem seems to be localized to an area randomly aligned with Creation. Is that logical? Who knows. But it is what's happened.
