Reminder that Prince Arnaud acts as a loud mouthed buffoon but when the Pilgrim put on his choir glasses and looked at Prince Arnaud he saw naught but cold emptiness and when Catherine was using her Winter senses she noted the man as a perfect actor who's heartbeat remained steady while he was outwardly raving and ranting. (I would find citations but afaik there is no easy way to search the entire work of PGtE).

There's clearly more to the man than you would guess (it's been suggested that he is the Assassin though i'm not sure you could justify him remaining in the role of Prince Arnaud for so long) and this seems like a moment when such a reveal may occur.
