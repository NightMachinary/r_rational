Depends how you want to count it I think. Could be 3 heroes (Pilgrim, Saint and Sorcerer) against 3 villains (Tyrant, Cat and Hakram). Or could be 5 heroes (the heroes, Cat and Hakram) against the Tyrant. Or could be the expected 1 vs 2 vs 3.

I reckon who is against who will be a malleable thing that Cat uses to her advantage. And I look forwards to seeing that play out.
