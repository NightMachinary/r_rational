Well, Tyrant mentions that it's more than just her 'old friend' there.

I bet good odds that Archer is there already. Her last 'mission' via Cat was to go find Masego and bring him back. If Tyrant isn't referring to her (instead, maybe the Hierarch), then she could show up at the wrong moment to ruin his plan.
