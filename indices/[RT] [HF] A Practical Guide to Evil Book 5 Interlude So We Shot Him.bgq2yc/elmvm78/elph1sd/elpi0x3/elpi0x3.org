Invading a villains personal slice of a universe where he's ensconced in a presumably functioning superweapon without a heroic band of 5? That seems smart, especially when you've got three possibly 4 villains trying to stop you and no narrative weight to back you up. Pilgrim is smarter about these things, we already saw him talking about how the Dead King will require a band of 5 where he or saint dies to be put down back at the battle of the camps. He's not going to take a risk on Hierophant when a solution with narrative weight is presented to him. Plus that star took a hell of a lot out of Pilgrim.
