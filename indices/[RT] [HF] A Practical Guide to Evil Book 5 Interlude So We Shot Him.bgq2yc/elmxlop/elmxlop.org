We've got three heroes facing off against the Tyrant, and that's two short of the customary five. You'd expect Pilgrim to be more prepared than that.

It's a shame that Cat is going to turn this whole encounter sideways, but I'd be interested in how a villain of the old type like Tyrant would deal with heroes on the level of Pilgrim and Saint (how strong is the Rogue Sorcerer?). Cat has been concocting literal plot armor in order to deal with these two, but that's not a route that's available to Tyrant.

Anyway, all the crowns have been gathered, seven Proceran Princes and the Queen of Callow, so the stage is set for the Prince's Graveyard. The question now is whether or not that "graveyard" part is meant literally, and which of the powers (Cat most likely) will collect them and for what purpose. Actually, all seven Proceran are currently being hanged (by their feet), so in a sense most of the work is already done.
