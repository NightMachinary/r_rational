Ah, that could make sense of that's the case. I was unaware of that limitation, because the editing for the non altered parts sound relatively normal (ie not monotone) to me.

Some of the time, the inflections feel very right (like going deep and/or tinny to indicate that something is an aside or subthought, or even just an unpleasant topic).

Without reading any spoilers, having completed episode 6, I'm now curious if all other residents hear SAYER in the same manner, assuming the listener in all episodes thus far are the same, as I suspect.
