I've gotten through the first 5 episodes and can't really say that I see it. Maybe I'm missing something, but so far it mostly just sounds like the AI is trying to creep you out, with no obvious goal.

I'm not sure if this is revealed later, but thus far, I don't especially feel like anything is happening with purpose, since there's been no indication that the listener is someone who should be expected to be able to help the AI in any manner.

If this is later revealed to have more, is there an estimated depth you have to go before it starts to make sense? I'd like to give it a fair shot, but I also don't want to continue listening if it doesn't become any more coherent than it currently seems to be.
