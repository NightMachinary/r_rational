Alright, since I'm on 6 now, I'll give it another 2-3 episodes to see if it starts improving for me. It's also possible that this style just isn't for me - it feels like someone tried to take GLaDOS and put it into something like Saw, but didn't transplant the humor.

The voice inflection changes also feel arbitrary, seemingly purely in am effort to unnerve rather than serving a storytelling purpose.
