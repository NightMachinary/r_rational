For actual numbers for the stuff I've posted to ff.net:

There are 535 stories under [[https://www.fanfiction.net/movie/Terminator/]["Terminator"]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree]] of Time is 6th in Reviews, 2nd in Favorites, and 2nd in Follows.

There are 545 stories under [[https://www.fanfiction.net/comic/Superman/]["Superman"]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]] is 2nd in Reviews, 1st in Favorites, and 1st in Follows.

There are 4.2K stories under [[https://www.fanfiction.net/misc/Mythology/]["Mythology"]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][The Last Christmas]] is somewhere I couldn't find in Reviews, 8th in Favorites, and 18th in Follows.

There are 9.4K stories under [[https://www.fanfiction.net/movie/Terminator/]["Frozen"]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][A Bluer Shade of White]] is 24th page for Reviews (~600), 8th page for Favorites (~200), and 26th page for Follows (~650).

(But those are just my numbers and it's probable that you can't extrapolate from those to rational fiction generally.)

Generally speaking, the biggest thing that determines how many reviews a fic gets seems to be how many chapters it has, mostly because you can leave a review for each chapter. Works get followed if they need following, so things which are complete don't tend to get followed. Other than that, I'm sure there's a marketing and/or word of mouth aspect to it that explains a lot of the numbers, popularity and quality aside.
