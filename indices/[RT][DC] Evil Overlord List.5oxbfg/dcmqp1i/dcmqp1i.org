Often mentioned, but never posted, The Evil Overlord List. A deconstruction of mistakes that many evil overlords make, and rules to prevent them. The original [[http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html][here]] dates back to 1996.

This page goes on to deconstruct the mistakes of evil empresses, rampaging monsters, henchmen, heroes, sidekicks, true loves, innocent bystanders, space captains, and teenaged mech pilots. Followed by preventative measures.
