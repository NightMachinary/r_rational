You really want a list of which rules aren't rational in a non-narrative world and why?

Okay! <cracks knuckles>:

#+begin_quote
  \19. I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but one look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd betray her own father.
#+end_quote

- Intelligent daughters don't usually fall for that one person who wants to ruin their family.

#+begin_quote
  \29. I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies into confusion.
#+end_quote

- Some dictators and warlords already do this to an extent. I don't have data but at the very least it didn't help Gaddafi much.

#+begin_quote
  \30. All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be pre-emptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.
#+end_quote

- Real rebel leaders don't need specific types of comic relief.

#+begin_quote
  \31. All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly, world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcement and/or romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick.
#+end_quote

- I don't even know where to start with this one. Cost vs expected results are just so abysmal.

#+begin_quote
  \39. If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite number among his army.
#+end_quote

- Usually good advice but it isn't if your Legions of Terror are an undisciplined horde that only follow you because they think you're awesome.

#+begin_quote
  \62. I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural supports which intruders could use for cover in a firefight.
#+end_quote

- Those are really useful to preserve your well-trained Legions of Terror against enemy cannon fodder though. After all they should know how to use local terrain to their advantage better than any invaders.

#+begin_quote
  \85. I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, e.g. "Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse." Instead it will be more along the lines of "Push the button."
#+end_quote

- You don't get to chose the ritual needed to activate the all-powerful magical McGuffin. You have to work with what you've got.

#+begin_quote
  \98. If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I wil0l carefully monitor their activities. If I find they are happy and affectionate, I will ignore them. However if circumstance have forced them together against their will and they spend all their time bickering and criticizing each other except during the intermittent occasions when they are saving each others' lives at which point there are hints of sexual tension, I will immediately order their execution.
#+end_quote

- Harmonious couples are no more or less likely to overthrow you than feuding ones.

#+begin_quote
  \100. Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I will provide each of them with free unlimited Internet access.
#+end_quote

There very few things more dumb than giving your rebel prisoners unlimited internet access.

And these are only the most blatant ones. I'd go into the next 131 but this already took long enough.
