I think that 1) a good half of the list has more to do with genre savviness than with actual rationality. Unless you have a good reason to believe that your world has some form of narrative causality, you can disregard them and 2) following this list to the t would be incredibly stressful. Don't underestimate how relieving can something like evil laugh in front of your (fallen) adversary be. Villain banter before battle can soothe tension, etc.
