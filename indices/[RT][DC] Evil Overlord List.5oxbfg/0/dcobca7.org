I love the Evil Overlord List, although I think it glosses over opportunity costs. There are a lot of items along the lines of "I'll fully investigate every noise/malfunction/etc no matter how innocuous it seems, I'll have a full medical staff and cantina for the dungeons, I'll invest heavily in R&D for the following specific things." But that's only practical if you have unlimited money and personnel. If you're going to put the HQ on total lockdown every time a security camera goes on the fritz, that costs money that's going to have to come out of, for example, the dungeon medical staff budget.
