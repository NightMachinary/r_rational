I think it's not so much about fully investigating every malfunction, it's about having basic precautions. Because one of the first things an intruder is going to do is disable the security cameras, you need to have some sort of way to catch intruders doing that. Yes, the list is exaggerating when it says the only proper response is to put the base on lockdown, but the main point isn't to recommend a specific course of action, the main point is that they should do something other than just "ignore it".
