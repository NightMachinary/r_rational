He's very good at it. Even when I strongly disagree with him, it's difficult not to like him at times. He's got a certain charm. He does ridiculous things like responding to "You promised during an interview on my radio show that you would show us your taxes" with "Almost no one listens to your radio show," as if that is in any way a satisfying answer, yet the audience loves it. I am not at all certain that a majority of the voters would vote against him.
