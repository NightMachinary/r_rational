The president has significantly less power as head of state than it frequently appears.

There is power, as Commander-in-Chief of the military, to carry out military actions, but theoretically the congress could stop that at any time by refusing to pay for it. The president also appoints many major civil servants, again subject to congressional approval. In return, the president can veto their legislation (subject to a two-thirds majority override), and with appointments to the Justice Department the president has a good degree of control over how (and, functionally, whether) congressional laws are enforced.

If the president is only interested in sustaining the status quo, or is supported by a compliant congress, it can appear that the executive branch has a lot of power. The president makes proposals and those proposals are executed.

When a president acts in opposition to congress (not merely, as with the last few presidents, opposition to half of it) presidential power can evaporate very quickly indeed.

Additionally, there is a great deal of political capital to be gained by fighting for significant change specifically when it /can't/ be implemented. Both parties are braver about proposing and voting for legislation that would please their base but offend independents when they know the other party's president will veto it.

All the benefit of having fought the good fight, with none of the requirement to deal with legislative consequences.

President Bernie Sanders would say more things that please non-Americans than President Hillary Clinton would... and a /lot/ more such things than President Donald Trump would. Whether any of those things would lead to significant change is almost entirely in the hands of congress.
