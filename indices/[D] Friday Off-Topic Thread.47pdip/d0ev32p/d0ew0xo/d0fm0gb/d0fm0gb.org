This particular election cycle, there will likely be replacement /but probably more than one/ of the Supreme Court, due to the present court's demographics. The Supreme Court's influence and effects are extremely large and long-lasting. Once Justices are raised to the bench, they have little check on their power, and it's quite likely that due to the ages of the present Supreme Court constituents and the ability to retire voluntarily, whoever wins election will likely win the court for the next several decades - with things like the constitutionality of laws requiring photo ID for voting and voter suppression laws, privacy as a right, etc. all up for grabs.
