It is of course 100% the case that even with a 51% Democratic Congress and Senate (60% seems unlikely), Sanders stands no chance of pushing through every piece of legislation he has campaigned on. However, one of Sanders' main strengths is that he draws crowds and volunteers to a higher degree than most politicians, even than Clinton, who is still leading in the polls. If there were no Super PACs, he would be outraising her to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. A president who is good at getting normal citizens to care enough to get involved is able to apply a lot of soft pressure on individual congressmen and senators, especially when they have public opinion on their side. Plus, for all that he was Independent, he has been in congress and the senate for a long time. He and Clinton both know that game.

Ultimately, for me it boils down to: Sanders wants to make systemic changes to improve the lives of the vast majority of Americans (There is an economic argument to be had here, but it works in Europe, and I really don't like trickle down economics), and is the candidate least likely to help multinational corporations bully governments around the world. Plus, it's almost unthinkable that the Senate would refuse to confirm a Supreme Court Justice for 5/9 years, and Sanders would definitely hold out on putting forward Justices he liked. He won't get everything he wants, maybe not even the majority of what he wants, but I'd rather have a president who tried, and who made perfectly certain that the issues were at least discussed.

Now, I realize [[/r/rational]] is very unlikely to all favour Sanders, and I will certainly confine the political discussion to this comment tree, but it's Offtopic Friday, so if anyone wants to keep discussing the election or Sanders, I'd love to hear the input of people here.
