I see you haven't actually claimed to have read the article, but you sound like you are commenting on the content, while in reality Wolfram didn't actually say what you "think [he] wrote". In the future I would warmly recommend actually reading an article, before passing judgement on what its author is saying. If the article is too long or not interesting enough for you just say so.

Not to say there nothing to criticize the post for, but over-blowing the relevancy of wormholes and exotic matter, is definitely not one of them.

Out of almost 10k words these are the only parts(around 3%) I could find,and that I can remember, touching on exotic matter and\or wormholes:

  In General Relativity, the only way to effectively go faster than light is to modify the structure of spacetime. For example, one can imagine a “wormhole” or tube that directly connects different places in space. In General Relativity there's no way to form such a wormhole if it doesn't already exist---but there's nothing to say such wormholes couldn't already have existed at the beginning of the universe. There is a problem, though, in maintaining an “open wormhole”: the curvature of spacetime at the end would tend to create gravity that would make it collapse.

  I don't know if it can be proved that there's no configuration of, say, orbiting black holes that would keep the wormhole open. One known way to keep it open is to introduce matter with special properties like negative energy density---which sounds implausible until you consider vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory, inflationary-universe scenarios or dark-energy ideas. Introducing exotic matter makes all sorts of new solutions possible for the Einstein equations. A notable example is the Alcubierre solution, which in some sense provides a different way to traverse space at any speed, effectively by warping the space. Could there be a solution to the Einstein equations that allows something similar, without exotic matter? It hasn't been proved that it's impossible. And I suppose one could imagine some configuration of judiciously placed black holes that would make it possible.

  And even with spinning black holes and the like, I don't know of any way to achieve the analog of gravitational shielding---though this changes if one introduces exotic matter that effectively has negative mass, or if, for example, every black hole has electric charge.
