I assumed you didn't read the article, and technically you just admited to skipping essentially 80% of the article, because the alternative was that you were intentionally misrepresenting the article.

Had you mentioned in your original post that the title is misleading and that you found the "BH technologies" to not be too interesting I probably wouldn't have responded to you in the first place. But your original comment suggested the article was something it most definitely isn't.

On a side note, even in the limited context of "BH technologies" wormholes and exotic matter are less then quarter of the content, and as my quote shows are not presented as a "lets use wormholes and exotic matter to go faster than light!!", but as a "the only ways to do X that I am aware of are with Y, which may be possible given theorem Z" hardly something I would describe as an attempt to hype or overuse buzzwords.
