And I did indeed skip mostly to the explorative engineering proposals OP advertised as the main content, when in reality that was a very small part of the article.

My criticism is that titling Wolframs post as "possible technological uses" for BHs is very much overblowing the importance of that specific part of the article. *Its a fine primer on BHs with really far off speculation tackled on at the end.*

In the future, I would warmly recommend to you to be a bit more careful assuming people have not read articles- though I certainly understand, the reddit prior is very in favour of your assumption.
