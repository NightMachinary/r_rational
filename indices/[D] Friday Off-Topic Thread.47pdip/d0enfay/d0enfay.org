It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a platformer as much as [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/208750/][Apotheon]] and I can't recommend it enough.

It's got accurately depicted gods (from my limited knowledge of Greek mythology), a beautiful score, great voice acting and a large range of weapons that feel good to use. And at this price it's a steal.
