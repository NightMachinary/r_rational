Imo it was a bit short though, for the price it's asking. To be fair, there's some form of replayability in the challenge modes, though the ones I've tried haven't really held my attention yet. I guess it was as long as it needed to be, but I definitely wanted more.

And of course, it's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.
