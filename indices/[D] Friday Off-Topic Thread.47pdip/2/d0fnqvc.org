I just got done playing SUPERHOT and have to say that it's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.

The gimmick (and I mean that in the best possible way) is that time only moves when you move, so you're spending the vast majority of your time plotting out your moves instead of doing fast twitch actions. In many ways it's a puzzler, not a shooter.

My wife was watching me fail repeatedly at a level and said, "Why don't you cut the bullet in half with your katana?" which I then proceeded to do, and it was awesome.
