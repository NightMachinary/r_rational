I agree with everything you said, but I feel like I should point out that although it is theoretically possible for congress to refuse to pay for war and stop it that has never happened. The three main reasons being the President doesn't need the approval of congress to fight if it isn't a war, so he just doesn't call it such(if memory serves the US has only technically served in 6 wars). Second being that Republicans are almost always pro war anyways allowing the president to go to anyone that does anything they don't like on any pretext they can think of. Third of course is that us Americans really like spending money on our military, so the idea that republicans (hell even a democratic supermajority) seems so unlikely that it almost seems impossible.
