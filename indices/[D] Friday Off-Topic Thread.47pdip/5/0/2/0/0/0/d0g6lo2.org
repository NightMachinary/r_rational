Good point. Even here in Sweden, the most convenient way of getting a photo ID involves two trips to the nearest police station. It could certainly be made /more/ convenient though, if government /wanted/ people to have a proper ID. If you wanted to find a way to give everyone a photo ID (which you might want to do for other reasons than voting, like building sinister citizen DNA/fingerprint/photo registers or whatever), you could set it up as part of the process of registering for food stamps/graduation from high school, etc. Or just offer a $100 tax rebate for getting it done.

Of course, if you just want fewer likely Democrats to vote, understaffed DMVs with hour long lines and no national voting holiday is probably the way to go.
