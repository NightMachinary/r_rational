  Why not make it so photo ID is required but also give everyone a hassle free photo ID paid for by the government/taxes? It sounds like the Republicans are only pushing the Voter Fraud angle, so couldn't the Democrats push for a 'compromise' that defeats the voter suppression implications?

Eliminating the $20 or so that it takes to get a state ID card is a start, but it seems virtually impossible to eliminate the hassle even if you did your best to streamline the process more than it already is. It would almost certainly require people to go to their local DMV, which disproportionately hurts poor people because they're far less likely to own a car. It also takes some non-zero amount of time, which disproportionately hurts poor people because they're more likely to work multiple jobs.

There's not really a good way to do photo ID "hassle free", at least not if you want to make it secure. And that hassle is almost always going to affect poor people, which is what Republicans want (if I'm being charitable, I would say that this is more of a lack of empathy for the poor than it is an attempt at suppression, but I don't know whether charity is warranted here).

We don't even have a national voting holiday in the United States.
