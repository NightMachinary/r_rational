As a non-American, regarding these voter ID laws... Why not make it so photo ID is required but also give everyone a hassle free photo ID paid for by the government/taxes? It sounds like the Republicans are only pushing the Voter Fraud angle, so couldn't the Democrats push for a 'compromise' that defeats the voter suppression implications? I realize voter fraud is a non-issue, but it doesn't seem like there is any other plausible case to be made for photo ID requirements.
