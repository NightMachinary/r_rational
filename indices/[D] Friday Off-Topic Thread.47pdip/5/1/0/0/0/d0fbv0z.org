I think it's more because people tend to vote for people they like, especially when said person isn't impacting their day-to-day living. In smaller communities, where that person has clear, decisive impact on how we live each day (think any show with a small group of 'survivors' such as Lost or The Walking Dead), people are much more concerned with that person being capable, as well as likable.

In a situation where they feel free from worrying about how capable the person is (due to the overarching distance between the POTUS and your average citizen), they're going to stray towards the person they like more. Especially when they're not very learned, or inclined to research. Modern politics is, more often than not, a popularity contest, as far as who gets the popular vote anyway. And charismatic, well spoken and most of all /well liked/ individuals always win those.

TL;DR: When a person has little real stake in who wins a competition and/or isn't well versed on the technicalities of said competition, they're just going to vote for the guy they like.
