I'm not American, but I've been following the debates and townhalls in the US primary. Like the overwhelming majority of Europeans, I favour the Democratic party, so that's also what I've talked most about and followed most closely. I used to think "If Bernie doesn't get the nomination, the Democratic party won't fight for any significant changes, so maybe Trump as the last Outsider would be better," but in the last week or so I've started to think that Trump would be /worse/ than the average Republican president.
