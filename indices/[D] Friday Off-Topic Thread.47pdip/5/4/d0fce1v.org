  so maybe Trump as the last Outsider would be better," but in the last week or so I've started to think that Trump would be worse than the average Republican president.

I'm reserving judgement on that. I have a hard time accepting that Trump actually doubts Obama's birth certificate or believes vaccines cause autism. It appears to be appears to have been done to establish a particularly radical fan base. But how many of his current opinions are genuine, meaning do they represent what he would actually try to accomplish in office? I don't see how any other Republican would stand a chance against Sanders or Clinton. If it's Trump vs Clinton then I'll have to try to figure out what Trump would actually do.
