Yes, that's why if I were to support him I hope I could determine what he really believes (for example by taking a closer look at what he did before getting involved in politics). There's also the point that even if he does a complete 180 on all his policies, where much of his support came from is scary in itself.

I wonder if he's planning to be an ink blot test. Convince the conservatives that he's pretending to be more liberal to win the general election, while convincing the moderates/liberals that he only acted conservative to win the primaries.
