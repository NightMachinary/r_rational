The problem is that [[/r/rational]] likes to solve whodunnit mysteries, social manipulations, or munchkining problems, but your fanfiction was the first story that I have ever seen posted here with any codes involved whatsoever. If you still want to have readers who like that sort of stuff while having rational stuff, put the codes as aside-attraction and share your story with [[/r/codes]].

TL;DR - The codes can include hints, but make the story solvable (albeit harder) without codes.
