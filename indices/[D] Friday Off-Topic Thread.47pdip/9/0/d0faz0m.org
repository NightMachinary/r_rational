The trouble with ciphers is that it's hard to use the power of collective intelligence to work together, because there's really no incremental progress. If you try exactly the right thing, the message shifts from gibberish to perfect English all at once; if you try almost-but-not-quite the right thing, the result still looks like gibberish and there's no signal that you're on the right track. There's no ability to post, "This thought seems like a promising lead, what do other people make of it?" and have others take up the baton.

For the long cipher passage from chapter 2, I got as far as to note that the passage uses all 26 characters, has a letter frequency distribution inconsistent with English but consistent with random text, and has no strong periodic index of coincidence for any period 1--20. So that ruled out a whole bunch of common cipher types, but I didn't have any idea how to proceed from there.

The only in-text hints were Dipper's description of a right isosceles triangle and Mabel's admonishment to hold off on proposing solutions. Since I was unable to make much of the former, I instead listened to the latter.

/Edit:/ I think if I saw one or two of these things get solved in the text, that would give me a sense of where in the enormous solution space you as the author had your attention focused, and I'd have a lot more success with future ciphers.
