  it's hard to use the power of collective intelligence to work together

I would just like to add on the fact that people also don't tend to see crossing out possibilities as progress. For example in a perfect collective intelligence, what you just outlined would be used as incremental progress to know what doesn't need to be repeated and to focus attention on different types of codes.

Unfortunately people see failures as wastes of time instead of progress, when in research, any experimental result is information to be used to narrow down the hypothesis space.
