It's from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darker_than_Black][/Darker than Black,/]] which is a pretty fun two season long show. It also has some similarities with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter][/Hunter × Hunter./]]

In both of these the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery][superpower lottery]] gives to some people (to [[http://darkerthanblack.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Abilities][“contractors”]] in one, to [[http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Nen_Abilities][“Nen users”]] in another) some unique abilities, as well as counterbalancing handicaps. In both the characters often have to try and quickly find out the nature of their opponents' power and come up with a strategy that will save them from getting killed.
