Sort of. It's certainly why heavy body armor includes ballistic plates. It's also why armor piercing rounds contain non-lead cores: steel alloys, tungsten carbide, depleted uranium.

Most of the time it's better for the knight (or, for that matter, the modern soldier) to be able to move unencumbered and quickly get out of the line of fire than to be wearing armor that is thick enough, dense enough, and layered enough to stop bullets.
