Theoretically, study wizard magic. In every edition of the game it's the most powerful and versatile thing you can do.

But in this world, I'm very bad at making myself do the reasonable and fun things rather than slumping into akrasia/depression, and I don't see why that would change. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/][(Yudkowsky on that topic)]]

More plausibly, I would try to find some rich patron that would be satisfied by the standard time-traveller wares: gunpowder, the printing press, basic sanitation, accounting etc. D&D magic may be superior to a lot of that tech, but (except in Eberron) it's prohibitively expensive to non-spellcasters and doesn't scale well.
