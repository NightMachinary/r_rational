It depends on which settings and how the rules are implemented (if they are at all). I think my strengths are probably in intellectual areas, especially in comparison with other intellectuals within the average D&D setting. So I think that I probably go to the most powerful person I can find and ingratiate myself by giving away some of the secrets that I know. At the same time, I try to find out whether there are any cracks in the world that I can exploit.
