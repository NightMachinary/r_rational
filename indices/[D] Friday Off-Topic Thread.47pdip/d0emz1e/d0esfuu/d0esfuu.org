</fun> It's hard to tell how fast he's moving, but I'm going to assume he's sub-sonic since he doesn't seem to be bruising himself against the air.

When hitting an armor plate, friction and the energy of collision can cause lead bullets to reach their relatively low melting point and go molten, turning kinetic energy into heat and splattering rather than cutting.

In addition to being less than 1/11th as dense as lead (and thus imparting less than 1/11th the kinetic energy), water is /already/ molten, and it vaporizes at a significantly lower temperature than lead melts.

Being pelted by vaporizing beads of water at somewhere less than 300 meters per second is going to be painful, but far from deadly. <fun>
