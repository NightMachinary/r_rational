In this clip, a Flash-type superhero is fighting a weather manipulator. Except that in this setting, powers don't necessarily come with all the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers][required secondaries]]: this Flash can't just instantly shed momentum, nor can he phase through obstacles.

(Also, he must eat a hamburger as payment for every use of his power. [[/r/evenwithcontext]])
