The outcome of the Iranian Elections is [[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/reformists-and-moderates-lead-race-in-early-election-results][looking up]]. If the reformists and moderates continue to do well, we should see big improvements. I don't have high hopes for the Assembly of Experts, but should the moderates manage to get control of that, we should see big changes in the next 20 years. Regardless, these elections vindicate Rouhani. His opponents claim that his conciliatory attitude towards the west and willingness to negotiate makes Iran weak and is unpopular with the people. It seems they have been proven wrong. With renewed support we should expect the pro-liberalization factions in Iran to have a stronger mandate going forward, and the Ayatollah will have even less grounds to restrict them.

The Assembly of Experts is the elected body that has the power to kick out the Ayatollah (leader of the theocratic branch of the Iranian government) and is in charge of selecting a new one when the current one dies or retires. Ali Khamenei, the current Ayatollah, is 76 and has cancer, which means this Assembly of Experts is probably the one that will select the next Ayatollah. A win for the non-conservative parties here could give them control of the theocratic branch of government, potentially for decades. This is important because one of the things that has slowed down the wave of liberalization going through Iran is the theocratic branch.
