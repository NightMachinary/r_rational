Are those explanations still applicable? I saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/][this post]] that explains why the upvote/downvote totals have been moved to this new, percentage based system.

Anyway, based on that, I'm just gonna chalk it up to reddit's new submission vote fuzzing. I don't begrudge them this at all, I'm mostly just happy that I now have enough evidence to validate my assumption.
