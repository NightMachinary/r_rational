A reddit relation question: [[http://i.imgur.com/8wIuwmx.png][this]] thing, the percentage-upvote and points indicator. Does it work as intended?

I ask because I'll often see the points fluctuate, even on posts with only maybe 8-9 voters. As an example, try hitting refresh right now and watch the numbers fluctuate. You can even try this on an old post with a low sub count

Does anyone have any insight on why this happens?
