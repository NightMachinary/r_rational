No problem. Here's two more I've read that are similar.

- Going Native by Ideasguy, DBZ and DC crossover. Human reincarnated as saiyan, has to do lots of catching up with saiyan power levels.

- Apocalypse: Generic System. Mentioned here several times before. Not as much hard work as gaming the system, but still applies imo.
