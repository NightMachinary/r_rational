  I've been reading Maybe I'm a Lion, a Kara no Kyoukai/Prototype crossover, per a recommendation on one of the previous weekly threads. I can safely say that this is an excellent fusion between the insanely anime-spiritual-powers lore of the Nasuverse with the insanely western-military-chic elements of Prototype.

Fair warning, from someone who devoured this a few years ago - at least at the time, it was unfinished and seemed to have been dropped. It's a great ride but the abrupt end in the middle of a good arc ruined it for me.

No idea if it's been picked back up; if it has, hopefully someone will comment, because I'd totally be up for re-reading it!
