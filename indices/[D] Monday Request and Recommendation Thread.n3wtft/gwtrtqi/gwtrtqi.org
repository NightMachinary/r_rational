I've been reading [[https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29][Maybe I'm a Lion]], a Kara no Kyoukai/Prototype crossover, per a recommendation on one of the previous weekly threads. I can safely say that this is an excellent fusion between the insanely anime-spiritual-powers lore of the Nasuverse with the insanely western-military-chic elements of Prototype.

I've enjoyed it much as I've enjoyed most of other batshit crazy crossovers such as [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ShinjiAndWarhammer40K][Shinji and Warhammer 40k]] (Evangelion + 40k, I don't even know how this is possible) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements][Postnuptial Disagreements]] (Sekirei and Fate, which share much more in the way of aesthetic but still have wildly incompatible premises and characters). It's not that I don't enjoy more reasonable crossovers, but the absurdity of some of these combinations leads to some sort of emergent plotting that's so compelling.

Anyone have more obviously impossible crossovers that are better than they have any right to be?
