Although it's a quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/esquestria-the-house-of-the-sun-a-pony-cultist-experience.71721/#post-16913694][Equestria: House of the Sun]] is an amazing crossover of two seemingly incompatible universes of MLP and Cultist Stimulator. It manages to somehow read like both, it has all the purple prose and lovecraftian themes of Cultists Stimulator but the actual characterization is pure MLP where the characters are recognizably the good aligned populace depicted in the show. Probably the best crossover quest I've ever read.
