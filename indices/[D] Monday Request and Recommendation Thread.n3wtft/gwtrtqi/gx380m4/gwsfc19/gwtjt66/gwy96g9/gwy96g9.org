Thanks for the rec. I loved the story a lot---the beginning and middle didn't feel very well-written, but they /really/ ticked by boxes. It's hard to describe, but it was following /all/ my expectations, even unreasonable ones that were detrimental to the story. It felt amazing, like, I dunno, prompting GPT-3 with something and getting /exactly/ what you asked for, except that went for â…”rds of the book.

And then Anna and Leviathan didn't get together. It's perfectly reasonable, it's a realistic, rational resolution to the plot, it's in-character, but I was so used to this particular story bending to my whims even when it made it worse, such a twist felt like a punch in a gut. I'm incredibly mad. I literally had a meltdown over that, and I'm not even autistic. I normally wouldn't have reacted so strongly, but I've been starving for monster/human romance with intelligent characters, I even made a request in this thread a few weeks ago, and here /everything/ was leading to it. There was an in-universe discussion, FFS! I understand that it's a sequel hook, but I have a suspicion that the sequel might blueball me as well, and there's no sequel atm anyway, so I'm in my bed seething for the third hour straight.

Still, great story, thank you for the rec. Not sarcasm.
