Have you read [[https://banter-latte.com/series/interviewing-leather-revised/][Interviewing Leather]]? It's a look into the world of B-list supervillains, their operations, and their henchmen. I remember enjoying it.

[[http://narbonic.com/][Narbonic]] sounds more like Hench in premise, but with a certain early-2000s-webcomic energy. Depending on how you feel about that you may enjoy it. I read a decent chunk and thought it was pretty well-made, though it didn't have enough of a longer arc going to really keep me interested.
