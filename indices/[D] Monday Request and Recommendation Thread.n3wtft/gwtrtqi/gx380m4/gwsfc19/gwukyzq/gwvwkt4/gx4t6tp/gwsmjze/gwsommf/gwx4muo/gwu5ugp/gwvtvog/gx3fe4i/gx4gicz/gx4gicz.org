There was this story I read a few years ago, on AO3 possibly; it was about a guy, an avid reader, who was contacted by another guy over the internet(?) and provided the MC with some books. I don't distinctly remember if they were forbidden books or not. The end of the story took place in some library. It had these horror/SCP vibes to it. Does anybody know of it?

Edit: Oh and it wasn't all that long, ~10 chapters, bit more or bit less.
