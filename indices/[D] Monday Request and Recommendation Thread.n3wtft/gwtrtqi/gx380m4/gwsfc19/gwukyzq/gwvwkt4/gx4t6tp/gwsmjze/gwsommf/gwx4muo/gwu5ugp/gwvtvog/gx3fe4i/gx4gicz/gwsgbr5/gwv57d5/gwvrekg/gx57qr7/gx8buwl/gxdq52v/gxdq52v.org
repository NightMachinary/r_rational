The Dark Tower; if you also listen to [[https://www.doofmedia.com/kingslingers/][Kingslingers]] (the companion podcast from the people who did We've Got Worm/Ward), they really bring out the addiction aspect which Stephen King probably more or less deliberately put into the story.

I wouldn't call it rational, though; King's worldbuilding is as always pretty random and shoddy in parts. One of the two podcast hosts keeps asking himself questions like "now how does this fit with what we already know of the world..." and I have to keep myself from groaning in annoyed pity, because that's not how King's writing /works/.
