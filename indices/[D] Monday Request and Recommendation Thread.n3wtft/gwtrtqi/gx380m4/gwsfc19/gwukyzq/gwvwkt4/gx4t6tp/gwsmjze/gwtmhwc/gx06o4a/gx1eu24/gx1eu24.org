I'd say r!Animorphs is readable without experience of the original, as it is well constructed. There are a lot of canon nods and hpmor-style, "oh, that's what would have to be true to make XYZ stupid canon thing possible" moments, but the plotting and worldbuilding should stand up well on its own.

On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend reading the originals in the absence of significant nostalgia. They're not too dated, but they were always written en masse for teenagers, so I don't think they are that great on their own.
