I might have recommended this before, but if I did, it was ages and ages ago. Also, I advise caution when googling the story, a cursory check I just did already revealed a major spoiler for the first volume. The story is Robert J. Sawyer's */Quintaglio Ascension/* trilogy. The first novel, /Far-Seer/, basically tells the story of the copernican revolution for a theropod-like alien species. Beyond that already interesting premise the author spent some time in coming up with means by which an obligate carnivore and starkly (and at times violently) territorial species could still develop civilisation and society to such a degree that they actually managed to reach the point of a copernican revolution. The following books deal with the fallout and societal developments that the worldview shift kicked off.

The second volume contains a point of view with which I have some trouble, in my opinion it undermines some of the worldbuilding, and I suspect Sawyer got criticised for including these chapters, since the third volume contains no such parts. I advise ignoring these chapters, or delegating them to a dream sequence.
