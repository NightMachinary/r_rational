For a fic where very little happens over a lot of chapters (it's mostly just ponies interacting with humans while waiting to go home), it has some weird background things creep in. Young female ponies being sexually attracted to human men upon first sight and no one on either side thinks it's at all strange. A preponderance of guns and tanks being cool and ponies of all ages and backgrounds being interested in them and not at all scared/worried about unfamiliar weapons. A general sense that lower level "military" people/ponies are great, salt of the earth people that handle events like unexpected aliens with aplomb, while higher-ranked people, especially anyone who is close to government, are dumb, self-interested, and untrustworthy. Also, somehow every other person was once in the marines, and never as an officer.

Like, the author did do a lot of research on details like what the emergency management plans for the area are and what real-life people might have been in Kansas in 2015, but the level of military wankery takes over the fic instead of something more interesting like actual cultural differences.
