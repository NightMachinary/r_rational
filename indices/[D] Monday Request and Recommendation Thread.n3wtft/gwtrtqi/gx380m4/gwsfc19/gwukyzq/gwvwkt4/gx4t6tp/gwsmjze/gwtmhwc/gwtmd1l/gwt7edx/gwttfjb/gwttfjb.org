I'm currently on chp 66 of worth the candle. I'm just not getting the excitement with it that I got with other ratficts. Though the MC, Joon is rational, I find his rationalization more of a speculative nature rather than actively strategic. Don't get me wrong, I do still like the story and some of the thought provoking concepts the characters come up with. I particularly like the training arch with Joon and the druid solace and how he tries to rationalize her "unclear" system of magic. I do understand that Joon isn't a cheat the system type of guy
