As a previous detractor of the story, I know better than anyone that it is not for everyone. The stupid name, the gimped, illogical, and shallow(frontend, anyway) litrpg magic system, Erick's personality and plot armor, and the CIA thing at the beginning^{^{1}} all kept me from getting into it for a long time. Even after reading 1.5 million words I have trouble articulating just why I like it.

I think a big point in its favor for me is that it is original in unexpected ways, which as a person who reads a lot I value highly. That Erick's arc has been interesting and well done and there's more to come is another one. Above all I like the story because the author actually appears to have something to say about the world and the human condition, and isn't just trying to transcribe a skinner box into a narrative like most litrpgs/webserials.

--------------

^{^{1}} Tangential rant: Erick has been depicted as a politically engaged bleeding heart liberal with the empathy and self-abnegation of a saint or bodhisattva. The idea that someone like that--who also presumably grew up in the 80's and 90's and would be intimately familiar with the effects of the (state sponsored) crack epidemic on the inner city poor--would be OK with his only child joining what is objectively speaking the evilest organization in the world by scope and scale(since the SS and the NKVD got shut down, anyway) put me off the story for a long time just by itself. It is still a surprise to me that this heuristic ultimately failed and the author isn't a complete dumbass.

PS. That Jane-the-CIA-inductee is later depicted as being literally a psychopath with good coping mechanisms is hilarious, I'll admit. Maybe she's the reason they got booted out of their original reality, to prevent another holocaust or something.

PPS. Also hilarious: the very first comment the story received (on RR of all places!) is a complaint about lionizing the CIA. Warms my heart.
