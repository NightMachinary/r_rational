I'm partial to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/387047/farmer-bruener-has-some-ponies][Farmer Bruener Has Some Ponies]]. It's about the entire population of a Pony town accidentally being teleported to a farm in rural Kansas, and the initial chapters are about the locals dealing with the situation.

It seems the author went to some lengths to do his research, too. From the author's note on the second chapter:

  By the way, if you really want to see somebody looking confused, go to your local emergency management agency and ask just what their process would be for a few hundred aliens dropped into a field just outside of town. Make sure you tell them you're an author, though. They'll still think you're crazy, but won't lock you up. (You know, there has been a police car parked outside for the last few weeks. Naaa, probably a coincidence.)
