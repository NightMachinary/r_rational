Any litrpgs/system stories where there are multiple systems that people pick between? Ideally, the systems are amenable to human intervention. I'm hoping for something like characters in a 5e D&D setting rationally evaluate heading to a new nation, where the rules of the universe are Pathfinder standard, as dictated by their local government.
