Ar'Kendrithyst has a stupid fucking name but it's pretty good. Not so much magitech like you're asking, but the story explains the ins and outs of magic to an unbelievable degree--as in I'd estimate around 20% of the 1.5 million words are dedicated to the MC understanding and experimenting with magic. Which is crazy.

Fair warning: it's very slice of life and the pacing is veeery relaxed.
