Warning: Second Person Perspective.

The main reason why I recommend it is because I wrote the story out of a quest I'd run some years back. Overall, the format tended to be for the players to have the cards and knowing them before they made their choices, so I think it fits with what you asked.

Protagonist is a normal human that very slowly but surely adapts to the new world he's been thrown in. The first few chapters are the weakest, but once he reaches civilization things start to roll.
