Looking for crack deconstructionist fics on pieces of media.

Short funny stories that noticed one or two jokes about a movie or TV show or game and play with that joke for a few chapters.

More like omakes than stories.

Doesn't have to be super rational or serious, just like some Screen Rants or CinemaSins with a silly thing/plothole and take it to the extreme.

An example would maybe be Harry Potter and the Natural 20, or some of the other Harry Potter crack fics where someone just uses obliviate to resolve everything. I enjoy it when they skip to the major plot beats or moments of the media even if it makes no sense that everything would be the same.

Another example would be [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion]]
