Just read [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/49867430-hench][Hench]] which is a story about a woman who's employed as a data scientist by supervillains.

I had some disagreements with the themes of the work and how the author chose which roles to assign which characters, but given that I read this in one continuous four hour marathon, concede that it's well written and extremely engaging, which gets it my recommendation.
