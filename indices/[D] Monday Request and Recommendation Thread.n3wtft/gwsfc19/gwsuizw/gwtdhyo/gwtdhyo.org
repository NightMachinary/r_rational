Objectively speaking, I sort of agree with [[/u/nakor28]] that the ending/denouement was kind of underwhelming. A sequel might fix this, though, and I know one is under way.

Subjectively speaking, I had the oddest sense that the author was uncritically inverting the traditional gender stereotypes of SF works. Essentially all of the characters with agency are women, the main characters objectify men, and the male leads are the emotional, irrational ones while the female leads are the cool, collected ones.

I'm not saying the main character is a mary sue-- she has believable flaws and failures. It made it seem like it had been written forty years past, critically regarded (and for good reason) but clearly a product of its time (but in an alternate universe where many of our gender stereotypes were flipped).

Note that this complaint doesn't dominate the majority of the work; gender is hardly the focus of the novel. I just, personally, found it inescapable, but YMMV.
