I also read this in the past week or two and enjoyed it. The basic premise is that "henches" are generally treated as low-level employees - at the beginning, the protagonist and a friend go to the local hench temp agency to apply for postings in their respective specialties.

The latter part of the book felt rushed and the denouement was not particularly satisfying, but it was worthwhile. I'll say 3.5/5, but I am a fairly harsh grader.
