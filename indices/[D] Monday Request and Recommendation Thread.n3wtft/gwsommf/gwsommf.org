[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42560/conquest-of-avalon][Conquest of Avalon]] is on Royal Road now. Something I recced a few weeks back, and I'll copy a good review I saw on there to shill it:

  How does one deal with the conquest of their homeland?

  The protagonists Fernan, Florette and Camille have to deal with this very question. Whether it be a fitting within the system and finding pockets of happiness; seeking the best of freedom away from a people who have seemingly accepted their existence; or attempts at reclaiming what was lost. Each of them have their own ways of looking forward and finding their way, and can we really say which one is the ultimate right?

  Conquest of Avalon is a story that does an amazing task of feeling both personal and broad. It has a revolving set of characters who are distinct from each other, yet each of them has a way of getting to your heart because you quickly understand who they are and why the do what they do; and a world that you can feel has a long history, given out in chunks that leave you wanting more instead of being too heavy. It brings with it a fleshed out magical world and system, while not forgetting that even a world of magic, people are still people and they have a way of interacting through politics.

  One of the best parts of the story is how the characters interact with said politics and how they interact with them in turn, reflecting their birth and thier outlooks on life.

  Conquest of Avalon is well worth the read.
