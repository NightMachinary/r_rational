Huh, funny, it's written by the guy who wrote [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-countess-complete-worm-the-count-of-monte-cristo-fusion-1815-au.813386/][that Worm/Count of Monte Cristo fusion]], with Taylor as the Count, Emma as De Villefort. Sounds insane but really works, probably because the themes of betrayal and becoming a badass from early Worm map to the Count so well.
