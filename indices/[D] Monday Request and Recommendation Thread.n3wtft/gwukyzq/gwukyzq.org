I've been interested in seeing an Overlord fanfiction that has him try to compensate for the emotion suppressor, which seems to make him far more willing to do actions that he'd likely find immoral otherwise; or just a story where he doesn't have that.\\
Not sure how that would progress, especially if you have him still valuing all the other residents of Nazarick quite highly, but could be interesting.

Only somewhat related (as in, Overlord) would be me reccing: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11985087/1/Godsfall][Godsfall]]. It has been a while since I read it, but essentially the residents of Nazarick went to the other world without any of their 'supreme beings'. I remembered enjoying it, but unsure how rational it is.
