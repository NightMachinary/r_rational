As a second set of eyes on this, I've gone back and forth on Ar'Kendrithyst several times. My most recent stance is that I recommend it, but it can definitely seem to drag. It spends dozens of chapters going through a cycle of "Erick goes to a new place, someone approaches Erick with a problem, Erick discovers a new magic and gets a power up, the group moves on and the new magic is (usually) not mentioned again and the new characters (usually) step back into the background to only be mentioned in passing thereafter." In between these cycles, it's very slice of life with a fantasy world bent. I actually like the slice of life breathers because it gives the characters a chance to interact again - as the previous comment mentions, the author dedicates an absurd amount of time to the magics involved, so it's a nice breather when the slice of life takes over.

To be fair, after 100+ chapters, a lot of these little sidequests start to come back into play again - but it takes a looooong time for that payoff.

The story does a good job going through it's litRPG setting and analysis of its magic system. There are some really cool moments, and a lot of civilization uplifting across a wide spectrum of subjects. But the relationships between the characters stagnate compared to these aspects, and as said, there's a lot of repetition in tropes/cycles. Erick himself can be interesting, but far too often feels like a plot device to move onto whatever subject catches the attention of the author. He. just. can't. say. NO. to anyone who requests his help, and I really felt like the manner of help being asked was a chance for the author to show off whatever new idea of world-building he wanted to showcase.

Again, it /does/ come together a bit eventually, but it can feel like a bit of a slog to get there. I give it a thumbs up, but a hesitant one. I like learning about the gears running a fantasy world behind the scenes, but this one was a bit too much for me at times.

Edit: A criticism I've seen a few times is that the dialogue between Erick and Jane is "cringey." I personally never felt that way. I don't like Jane's personality much, but I felt like the dialogue came off as genuine, if a bit uncomfortably intrusive. I like that Jane is a flawed character, even if her flaws make me not /like/ her character. Erick is much more of a Gary Stu, and while I like his ideas, his personality is just kinda generic do-gooder (though backed up backstory to explain it). Jane at least feels like a person. Kiri and Teresa are more interesting than either of them, but don't get enough focus, IMO.
