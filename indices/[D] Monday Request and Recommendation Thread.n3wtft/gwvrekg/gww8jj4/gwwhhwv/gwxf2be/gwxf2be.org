If it was possible in the real world way to have superheroes and supervillains, we already would. (Actually, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_superhero][we kind of do]], but it's a lot less glamorous than you'd think. They range from morally upright people doing charity work in a funny costume to actual loons.)

A superhero story requires at least one gimme-- one supernatural or fantastic point of divergence to justify a world in which superheroes (as we would recognize them) exist, even if we /do/ exclude the presence of magic and 'superpowers'.
