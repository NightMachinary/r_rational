It “does in the wizard”, so to speak, and offers an explanation for stuff discovered during the first and second volume. It feels to me as if Sawyer either addressed a plot hole that's been pointed out to him (similarly how one of the sequels to /Ringworld/ dealt with the long term instability of the same after it had been pointed out to its author Larry Niven), or laid some groundwork he intended to pick up in later novels, but Sawyer didn't get a contract for works beyond the trilogy.
