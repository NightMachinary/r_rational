I broke my personal rule against reading Worm fics to pick up "Just a Phase", and it was worth it. It's very wish-fulfilment-y, in that it has adults actually caring about the well-being of the children they're responsible for, but it's very (IMO) realistic in the extent to which the traumatized AU!Taylor is, well, shaped by her traumas.
