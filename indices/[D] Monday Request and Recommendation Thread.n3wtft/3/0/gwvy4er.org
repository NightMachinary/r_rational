Oh neat, I've been meaning to look into Overlord fic for yonks now.

Always thought a rational take on Overlord would be interesting given how much Momonga/Ainz tries to fit himself into his role, and thus completely glosses over the whole "the former npcs apparently have memories of conversations overheard while they were npcs" and how could they possibly reconcile their past memories with their current capacity for agency?
