I'm looking for a story were the MC is overly critical of situations beforehand, sort of like the character L from death note or even harry potter. I find that a lot of stories lately the MC is rational on an as needed basis or employs cleverness only when in a tough situation. Like for an example, how a MC who is transported to a fantasy world and barely knows the world, would decide to go on a dungeon quest without knowing anything about dungeons and then run into some tough enemy. I figure someone like L would do a series of experiments beforehand and collect as much knowledge to make deductions about the situations and not just charge in because he's in love with some heroine only to run into some obstacle where in he would resort to a clever plan. I'm pretty new to the rational fic community so I haven't read much. I really liked time braid, metropolitan man, hpmor, and the terminator fan fic.
