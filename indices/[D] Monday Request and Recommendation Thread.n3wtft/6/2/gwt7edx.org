Usually people skip Worth The Candle recs since everyone's already read it, but...

Worth The Candle drops the protagonist into a fantasy world, and the first thing he does is ignore an obvious call to adventure because he knows nothing and it looks too dangerous. Later on, he increasingly has time to talk through situations before diving in, though he also frequently gets shoved into situations he isn't prepared for. Also it's very good; fantastic prose, worldbuilding, and characterization, and actually has thematic layers that are explored.

(Worth noting: to preserve dramatic tension, WTC isn't structured as "[Detailed plan.] [Run through of actual event that's repetitive except where it diverges from the plan.]" but rather "We came up with a plan. [Action begins.] [Describe relevant part of plan.] [It works or doesn't.] [Continue.]")
