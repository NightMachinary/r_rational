You'll likely enjoy a couple other community favorites, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: the Reckoning]] and [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon/][On the Origin of Species]]. Both have their characters explicitly stopping to think and /try and make the best decisions./ How successful they are at this depends on the level to which the deck was stacked against them...

The writing and worldbuilding in both are excellent, and I can think of several examples off the top of my head of characters going "let's think of all the ways this could go wrong, oh that one's pretty serious, screw this we aren't playing those odds."
