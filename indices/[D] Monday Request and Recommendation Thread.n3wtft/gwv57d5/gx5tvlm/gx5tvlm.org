Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends has three different power systems that work very differently. There's cultivation, class, and skill. Cultivation is like normal xianxia cultivation. Class has people picking classes that they level through spending essence (xp/currency), and then there's skill which is about taking one skill, like "Cut" or "Punch" to its utmost limit, at which point you can punch through mountains and cut through the plane of reality and make rifts, etc.

Not really rational characters, but imo it's a pretty rational world. And the characters are surprisingly competent.
