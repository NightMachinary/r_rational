In /Worm/, characters act the way comic book characters act (masked vigilantes, mad scientists, etc) as opposed to the way RL people act. However, it's also realistic because of the way the Worm universe is set up behind the scenes -- there is a complex "secret history" which explains their comic book-like behavior. Much of the serial is about slowly peeling off layers of deception and putting together scattered pieces of the puzzle.

I didn't find it 100% convincing, but it was a valiant effort to create a universe in which the inherently unrealistic "comic book logic", which was originally aimed at children, made sense.
