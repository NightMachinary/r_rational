Fullparagon has some completely insane multicrosses I enjoyed; I think [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-clash-of-neets-asoiaf-x-konosuba.870913/][A Clash of Neets]] (ASoIaF+Konosuba Primary) is the best of them, but I did enjoy This Goddess must be Crazy (Konosuba+MHA) and The Melancholy of Kazuma Sato (Haruhi+Konosuba) as well.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/maria-campbell-of-the-astral-clocktower-hamefura-bloodborne-post-dark-souls-crossover-yes-really.870472/][Maria Campbell of the Astral Clocktower]] (HameFura+Bloodborne) is also far better than its premise has any right to be.There are some arcs of it I enjoyed more than others but it's overall been a very positive experience to read it.

In the spirit of weird 40k Crossovers, there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/40-000-years-of-exalted-glory-40k-exalted-fusion.930787/][40,000 Years of Exalted Glory]] (40k/Exalted) which is just starting out but seems to fit in this category.

Two more bizzarre premises I've also enjoyed reading are [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-countess-complete-worm-the-count-of-monte-cristo-fusion-1815-au.813386/][The Countess]] (Worm/The Count of Monte Cristo) and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hp-hamefura-katarina-claes-and-the-goblin-on-fire.914040/][Katarina Claes and the Goblin on Fire]] (HameFura + HP).

There are some other weird crossovers that nonetheless work out well, but most of them are dead, short, or a step down in weirdness so I'm not listing them with these, but if you enjoy them I can link more.
