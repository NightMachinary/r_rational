There is a rational edition. It's the Great Crusade. 40K is the universe 10,000 years after a rational civilization collapsed. The tech priests spend all their time worshipping (i.e. placating) the machines because in the Dark Age of Technology people decided putting AIs in everything was a good idea -- and it was, until it turned out that hell is real and doesn't care about reason. The can't figure out why it works because much of it actively fights them. They had technology worked out to the point they had machines that spit out blueprints perfect for the situation -- and it turned out those machines could be possessed by demons, so they had to destroy them. Blind zealotry triumphs because there are very real dangers to "just reverse engineer it", like everyone in the building getting skinned or Ork spores infecting the entire planet.
