Shameless self plug:

I've been working on a rational fic called "Earthlings: People of the Dawn". The protagonists of parts 2 and 3 are both men who end up in a relationship by the end of part 3. They're not pretty boys, but if you're looking for rational gay romance, you're not going to find many other options. There simply aren't enough people writing rational fiction.

If you want a taste of how this plays out here's an excerpt for you (*WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD*):

  When they reached the prison, they were told there wasn't enough room to hold them there, so they had to be transferred to a different prison in San Francisco. Once they arrived they were quickly moved to a cell. It had two beds and nothing else.

  Bertie gulped. “Well, since we're going to die soon and I've never...um....would it be okay with you if we...?”

  Fred turned to look at Bertie, a blank, dead, hollow feeling in his heart.

  /I've failed/, he thought. Judging by the look on Bertie's face, he surely felt the same way. Fred sat down heavily on one of the hard, uncomfortable beds. It creaked loudly in protest.

  He waited as Bertie just stared at him with regret and hesitation.

  Finally, Fred lost his patience and snapped, “/Come on,/ it's not like there's anything else left to do.”

  Bertie flinched. Fred felt like an asshole.

  “I'm sorry,” he said wearily. “This isn't your fault. None of this is. I'm just angry at everything because our conspiracy was discovered and we're about to die. I'll try not to snap at you, but if I do, please don't take it personally.”

  “You didn't say yes,” Bertie blurted. “And I didn't really finish asking the question.”

  Fred sighed. “Yes, obviously.”

  Bertie opened his mouth, then closed it. Then opened it again...

  “Spit it out,” said Fred, “Sorry, just --”

  “It's okay,” said Bertie. “What do you want to do? Specifically, I mean.”

  Fred sighed. “This isn't a legal contract, Bertie. We're both about to die, and the longer we wait the less time we'll have left. Let's just figure things out as we go, okay?”

  Bertie nodded and slowly approached him. Fred reached out to gently pull the other man closer...

  The cell door opened. Bertie and Fred hastily sprang apart.
