It's not really a rational story, but [[http://sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=1][Stand Still Stay Silent]] is a great read that prominently features /what can be interpreted as/ a developing romance between a very blond boy with longish hair and an ash-blond boy, also with longish hair. Nothing explicitly romantic on the page as of yet (which I know is a bummer when you're looking for representation), and I don't read it that way myself, but they share a lot of sweet/intimate moments and a romantic interpretation of their dynamic is both wholly plausible and very popular among the readership. I'll try to think of something that more closely fits your specifications, but that's the closest that comes to mind right now.
