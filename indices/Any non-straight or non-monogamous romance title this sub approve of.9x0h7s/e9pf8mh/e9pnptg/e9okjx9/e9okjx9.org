[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps]] has an "interesting" romance...

It is certainly not the central theme but it plays a novel role in the story

[[/u/Swimmer963]] was doing a rationalfic interpretation of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13579596/chapters/31168950][Valdemar Series]] from Mercedes Lackey's works, and might be able to point you in the direction of other similar non-straight romance stories.
