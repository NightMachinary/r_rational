Um, have you seen a romantic comedy where there's hilarious misunderstandings that cause breakups because people won't talk? That's what's getting fixed. In my RL normal love life it's actually pretty rational. People can act sensibly or not in love and media is full of people acting non-sensibly.

(I was writing a rational gay supernatural romance story but that's on hiatus as my coauthor has backed out and i'm trying to work out if i have the heart to continue with it. Unfortunately we didn't get to "finish"/edit the parts of the story that contain the 'rational romance', but if anyone wants to PM me I'll give you access to the google docs and you can see it in all its half-finished glory)
