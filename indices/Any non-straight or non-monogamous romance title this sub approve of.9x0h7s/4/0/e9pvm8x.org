There is a rational fic of Magic's Pawn.

Hang on while I go find the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13579596][link]]. It's been +slow on updates+ going nine months (~360K words so far) but it's good. Would recommend for rational romance, in general, not just homosexual rational romance.

I don't know if it reads well without familiarity with Lackey's original (which was brilliant when I was a teen/tween but recently caused me to be super annoyed because of oblivious and very poor decision making on the MC's part), mostly because I read Last Herald Mage so early that I can't imagine not knowing that story.

Edit: added link and explanation of why YMMV with/without familiarity with the original. Edit 2: corrected and quantified update assertion + formatting because dyac.
