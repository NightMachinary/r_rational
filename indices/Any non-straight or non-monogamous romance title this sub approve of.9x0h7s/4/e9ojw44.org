If not for the gay specification, I would have said Kyon: Big Damn Hero for polyamory. With that specification added, you're asking the wrong person, but even I have heard of and read into the Toasterverse.

If you don't mind small doses of gay pretty-boy romance mixed with larger doses of grimdark, there is Magicâ€˜s Pawn and Magic's Price, the first and last books of the Vanyel Ashkevron trilogy.

None are especially rationalfic, but I'd consider their writing a notch above the rest. Kyon isn't ambitious enough to be acting sanely in his position, but he is reflective in a way that makes him feel a little more real.
