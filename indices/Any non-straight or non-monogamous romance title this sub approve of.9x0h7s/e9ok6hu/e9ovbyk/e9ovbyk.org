Love doesn't necessarily mean irrationality; it could just be choosing a different set of priorities. For instance, consider the friendship between our protagonists in /Animorphs: The Reckoning/ (or just about any other fic, but /Reckoning/ is a ratfic that does it really well from multiple perspectives).

Or, for a different angle, /[[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]]/ is a ratfic of the infamous /Twilight/ where our protagonist recognizes that magically-enforced love is irrational - but she still rationally chooses to get into it to pursue her broader goals, and rationally plans around it.
