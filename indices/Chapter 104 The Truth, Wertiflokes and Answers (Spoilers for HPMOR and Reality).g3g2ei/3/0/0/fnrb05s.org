That's the one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740793/1/A-Voice-Across-the-Void][It's also on ff dot net]]. I don't /think/ familiarity with the Star War is a prerequisite for being able to follow that fic's plot, but Disney+ is cheap (and you can probably get a free trial), you could always just watch the Original Trilogy.
