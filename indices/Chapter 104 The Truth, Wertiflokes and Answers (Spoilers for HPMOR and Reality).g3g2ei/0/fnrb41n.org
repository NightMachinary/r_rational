Congratulations! This writing is simultaneously funny yet pretentious and insightful yet obtuse. I therefore assign a probability of 15% that your are Eliezer Yudkowsky, a 15% probability that you are Scott Alexander, and a 10% probability that you are Wertifloke. I have discovered a truly marvelous bayesian proof of these odds, which this comment is too narrow to contain.
