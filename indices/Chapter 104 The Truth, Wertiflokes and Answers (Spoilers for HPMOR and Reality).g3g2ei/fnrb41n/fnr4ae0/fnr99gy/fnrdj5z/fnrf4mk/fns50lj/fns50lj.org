I like this theory. My own at the time was the Slug Sage was just greeting Naruto (Hello, Do you read me? You do? /sarcastic/ Great! get over here.) Then commenting on what Naruto was (A witch! A karate witch!). It seemed to me it was limited in its means of communication to recordings it was carrying so was forced to improvise.

I think there were some strong references to the anime From the New World, A post-apoc world set in an idyllic village where everyone has psychic powers. There are slug-like simple AI that hide out in the wilds and carry vast libraries of human knowledge which they try and share So I believe the Slug Sage may have been based on one of these.

Edit: Checking again, the brand of the slug-record found in the story was a "Panasonic Automotive Archive" which meshes with what we already know from the story: Panasonic is built to last.

DOUBLE Edit: I almost forgot to upvote and tell you I enjoyed this!
