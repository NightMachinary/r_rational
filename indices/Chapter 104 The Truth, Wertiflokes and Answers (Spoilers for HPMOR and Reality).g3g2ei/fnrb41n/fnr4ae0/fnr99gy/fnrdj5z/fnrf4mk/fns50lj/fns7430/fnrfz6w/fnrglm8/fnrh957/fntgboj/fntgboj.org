I once advanced the theory that the MCU Asgardians were descended from a pack of Luddites left over after a massive Singularity event scrambled their world into the Nine Realms. People without physical upgrades all died when the world became weird, leading to a world where even an average Asgardian peasant is casually superhuman. And that was just Asgard, in the other worlds, life took on much stranger forms to adapt to harsh conditions: frost giants to handle cold, dwarves to handle high gravity, etc.

The nobility is basically descended from the early survivors who established a stranglehold on all the clarketech they could find, and set themselves up as divine rulers. They view it as magical because they can't actually make any sense of how it all works, but the interfaces are intuitive enough that they can simplistically use them like 'superpowers' basically, and they sell that line to the public at large. Over a few generations, maybe they end up buying into the BS themselves. It may even be inadvertent if the clarketech mods start getting passed down genetically.

Cleverer people (e.g., Loki and Odin) can do something along the lines of memorizing incantations to program ambient clarketech that can warp reality, i.e., magic. They can't actually program, but they can memorize fragments of code or voice commands and make simple modifications, so basically they're script kiddies.

Since they don't really know what the actual cause-and-effect patterns are, they do it in a ritualistic fashion, rather like tech-priests in WH40K muttering prayers at technology while doing maintenance. The stylish posing and gestures are passed down by the original users, who were consciously trying to scam scared survivors into thinking they were doing magic. Over a few generations the scam was forgotten, and magic users just kept passing on the showmanship as part of it all.

The highest-level secrets are probably only passed from each king to his successor, which is why Odin can do things like put conditions on who can use Mjolnir, and so on.
