I assumed chakra was some sort of interface with advanced (clarketech bs level advanced) technology. (Similar to Ra maybe?). That doesn't explain why the interface is the way it is (with hand signs and chakra coils and weird eyeball powers). Maybe a lot of the technology that interacted with the clarketech got destroyed and chakra coils and eyeball powers are a hacked together backup interface that managed to persist because it was biologically based and it because it was inheritable.

So post scarcity/post singularity civilization -> something disrupts it -> in the course of disrupting it someone spams a make water command to the clarketech maybe as a DDOS, maybe as a way of destroying the world, maybe on accident -> Survivors congregate on the only landmass above water. -> most of the survivors have lost access/user permissions to the clarketech and more moderate (non clarketech) technologies can't be maintained -> a small number (perhaps as few as one) of hobbyists/survivalist/hackers retain a biologically based and biologically inheritable interface with the clarketech -> descendants retain this interface and become ninja, ruling over the unempowered survivors and brutally fighting among themselves.
