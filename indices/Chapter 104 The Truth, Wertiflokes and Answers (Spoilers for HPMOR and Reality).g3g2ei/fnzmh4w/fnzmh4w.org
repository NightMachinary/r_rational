Okay but like...not sure about Wertifloke, but EY probably has at least one other account where he shitposts stories and writing advice he doesn't want associated with him.

Three reasons:

1) Writing HPMOR is fun and he likes it.

2) He wants to write HPMOR without people bugging him about "where's the epilogue?" and "Is this canon?"

3) He likes to see who likes his writing when not associated with his name, plus sometimes he wants to write literary criticism about his own work but not have anybody think he's a narcissist.

All this to say I think PM_Me_Rational_Fics is EY and maybe Timecubefanfiction.
