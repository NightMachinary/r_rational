The waves arisen is very good.

It's very different from Naruto, the differences are felt imo more sharply than hpmor, because there is more of a genre "distance" between shonen (boys anime) and rational fiction, compared to YA fantasy and RTfic.

Full enjoyment of the fic would be had by naruto readers/watchers, I think knowing a bit about naruto would go a long way, but it might be worth a try anyways. It pushes different ideas and values than hpmor (while still rational), and seems to me to be somewhat educational in a similar way, if not quite as pedagogical as hpmor.
