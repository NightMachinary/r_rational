When I read that passage I assumed the Slug Sage was a weird AI, or upload of a person that was badly disoriented. It makes sense with the story being set in a future where the entire world has flooded (the map of the nation fits a elevation map for an area of high elevation) and stuff like Pansonic being lost artifacts that future AIs/upload might be left lying around.
