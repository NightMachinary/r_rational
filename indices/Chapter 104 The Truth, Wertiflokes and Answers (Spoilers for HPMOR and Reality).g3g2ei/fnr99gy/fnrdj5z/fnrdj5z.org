Re: Sai's Poison

In [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/the-waves-arisen-chapter-11/][the chapter following the Chunin Exam]], we see certain characters executed for crimes which they may or may not have committed:

  The knowledge and its implications came all at once, like a memory he'd briefly forgotten. One of the guards had delivered a meal of soup to Kakashi's cell, like any other, and within minutes he was dead. Guy too.
#+end_quote

Naruto (and therefore the reader) also sees that:

#+begin_quote
  The guards all had some weird seal technique imprinted on their tongues, too. He'd seen it on the Hokage's guards as well---some new ANBU policy, probably.
#+end_quote

A reader familiar with the Naruto-verse will understand these ANBU to be a part of ROOT, a military force directed exclusively by>! the new Hokage, Danzo!<.

Further along in the chapter, Naruto reasons out that it's pretty likely the mission that Team 7 had been sent on with Sai was meant end in their assassination. Naruto also sees that Sai has the same tongue tattoo as the guards who assassinated the aformentioned characters..

In [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/the-waves-arisen-chapter-12/][the next chapter]], after Naruto and Sasuke have their bout, we see that Sai is in charge of cooking the soup. Before anyone can eat any of it; Sai is assassinated by Sasuke, spilling the pot of soup in his death throes.

To me, it seems that all of these observations are explained by the hypothesis that all ROOT are trained in poisoning food as a means of assassination. And if that's true, then Team 7 just /barely/ escaped a death from a direction they didn't see coming from.

That being said, I'm realizing that can't explain /exactly/ what my brain is doing to go from Point A to Point B, and so I'm open to being wrong here
