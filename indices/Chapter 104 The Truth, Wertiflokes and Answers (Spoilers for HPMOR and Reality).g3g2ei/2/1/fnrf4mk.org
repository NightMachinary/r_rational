Re: Aliens

Okay, just to clarify: When I say 'something alien,' I don't mean to evoke images of little green men in space suits with plasma pistols. I just mean /something/ which did not originate from Earth.

​

The hypothesis comes from a conversation that Naruto has with the Slug Sage [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/the-waves-arisen-chapter-16/][later in the book]]. We know that this entity has strict rules as to /how/ exactly it can communicate, and we see that Naruto /eventually/ pieces together some semblance of meaning from the message, but if you're a reader and can scroll back up to experience the first part of the conversation again, this is what you read:

#+begin_quote
  Hello. Is anybody there? Anybody at all?

  The cause in which they died will continue.

  Do you read me, Hal? Hello, Hal, do you read me?

  One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

  What's this? What's this! ...Wow, what a totally amazing, excellent discovery---not!

  ...Stop that astronaut! Bring him to me...

  A witch! A witch! We have found a witch---may we burn her?

  I found him, I found that karate motherfucker!

  We have found a witch! That karate motherfucker...

  That karate... witch! That karate... witch!

  Here he is. Here's who? The man from the moon...

  Surprise motherfucker... I'm the king of the wooorld!

  ...Randy, is that water down there?”
#+end_quote

And then Naruto figures out what it's saying from there on.

I'm down to do a line by line analysis, but before I just do that and spoil the fun; I'm /very/ interested in whether you come to the same conclusion that I do, or if you read the text as saying something else that I've missed.

Because again, my brain isn't /quite/ giving me the answer of how I got from A to B, so if someone can show me where I've accidentally made a cognitive /uh-oh,/ I'd /greatly/ appreciate it :)
