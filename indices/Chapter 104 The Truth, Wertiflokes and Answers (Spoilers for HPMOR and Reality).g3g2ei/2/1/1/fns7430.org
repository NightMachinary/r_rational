I mean the obvious interpretation is that the Slug is replaying movie and TV quotes, quite a few of which are space related.

It also seems to be trying to synthesize the quotes into something appropriate to the current discussion, but isn't able to do so perfectly.

My conclusion at the time was that the setting is after some sort of bio-punk apocalypse that happened in our future, and the slug is a semi-autonomous biological data store that had been set free somehow.

For reference:

1.  From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After][The Day After]], though I initially thought it was from Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb (it's not)
2.  From the Presidential Address after the Colombia disaster
3.  2001 A Space Odyssey
4.  First words said on the moon
5.  Wayne's World (specifically about the Flobee I think)
6.  You Only Live Twice
7.  Monty Python's Holy Grail
8.  This one I dunno - googling for it just brings up a Tenacious D song and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-_Ee6E3vDU][this weirdly cursed YouTube clip]]
9.  Seems synthesized from 7 & 8, and is particularly relevant to Naruto
10. Seems synthesized from the same sources as #9 but mostly I think the author just wanted to write "karate witch"
11. Also dunno, and The Man in the Moon makes this particularly hard to search for.
12. Synthesized, but from two previously unseen sources - Dexter and then Titanic. Seems to be attempting to indicate its unexpected importance.
13. Seems to be from an incredibly bad movie called [[https://uncyclopedia.ca/wiki/The_Beast_of_Yucca_Flats][The Beast of Yucca Flats]], but is also weirdly relevant to The Waves Arisen.
