This isn't actually universally correct - quite a few places have more than enough primary biological productivity to support very high population densities, but also a disease burden too high to allow urban centers to form in the pre-modern era. So magics that countered that burden would alter the pattern of global urbanization in the pre-modern age very dramatically. Far more great cities in the tropics.
