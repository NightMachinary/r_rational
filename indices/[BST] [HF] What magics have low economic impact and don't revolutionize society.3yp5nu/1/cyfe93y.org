What about something like "turn rocks into gold" as a non-trivial answer? I'd you've got a society that uses a literal gold standard, a naive reader might think this is instant wealth, etc. But my understanding is that gold's value was a combination of rarity, prettiness, malleability and, hence, desirability by true wealthy types. (Or is that a "just so" story?)

So while valuable if the spell is unknown to most people (and not overused, so that wizards are still price takers), once widely available, you'd see inflationary effects and/or a move to a different metal for money, and things wouldn't change much. Gold jewellery would become as common as plastic earrings are to us, although it would still take work to produce, houses might have more guiding (but, again, work requirements would limit it, etc.)

No doubt it's even more complicated (how many wizards are there?) but I can't see it transforming the world. Thoughts?
