Another one I thought of driving home. You would use the spell for mining and tunneling and road construction. It's easier to dig into gold than rocks, so you'd turn the rock into gold and dig it out with picks or melt it out with fire. If you could control it well enough you could cast the spell into a plane /behind/ a rock face and peel off a layer of marble veneer that would be more valuable than gold.
