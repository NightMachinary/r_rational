Even if you don't allow magics that trigger technological revolutions, technological revolutions happen anyway. Society is never stable. OK, we've just invented magical teleport gates. For a while they're going to be rare, so you can put your story in the transition period. Or you can nerf the gates:

- They're permanent but still require maintenance. That maintenance costs a lot of time and money. If you don't maintain the gate, it starts randomizing things that go through.
- They're permanent but decay. Everything that goes through the gate shrinks it, just a little. Old gates are no more than a few centimeters wide, and are telegraphs or mail slots.
- They're permanent and stable, but the first gate in a region makes it harder to set up more gates. After a while you can't set up any more gates. Some places are gateless because saboteurs set up a bunch of short hop gates that are just as much of a problem as longjump ones. Other places are stuck with gates to places that are no longer worth traveling to.
- They're permanent and stable, but they interfere with each other. After a while you have too many gates in an area, and you can't rely on them, you come out the wrong place, or don't come out at all. You end up with expanding "dead patches" that you can't gate into surrounded by newer still-reliable gates outside the interference limit.

But "small magics"?

- Magic that enhances the flavor of food. Other mild sensory enhancements and euphorics.
- Magic that glues things together, not too strongly. It does make cloth stronger, and it's useful for putting up notices. You can't use it to climb walls... it's a permanent attraction between two objects, not a "sticky pad".
- Magic that pushes things apart, not too strongly. You can use it to improve bearings, but it's not strong enough to make a hoverboard.
- Magic that sets the state of an object and lets you reset it to that state. Then you have to cast it again. There's limits to how much change it can reset, and how often it can be done, and it doesn't work on living things... but you cast it on new clothes and take them to a magical laundry to make it "like new" again. Also great for secret messages.
