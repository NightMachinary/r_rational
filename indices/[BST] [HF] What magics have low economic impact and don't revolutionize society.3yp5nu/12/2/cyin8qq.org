Resetting the state of an object could work on food. Eat the potato, wait for it to go through your digestive tract and reset it. Could perhaps result in horrible internal bleeding if potato parts have become human parts, but if it only works on non-living things I guess you could get back the parts of the potato that didn't become human bits.
