It's also game slang for spells that give you back the resources they consume. E.g. in card games, spell cards that make you draw a card (in addition to some effect). Originally from MtG, inspired by D&D.

Fortunately, for balance reasons, those spells typically have minor effects, so the two definitions usually converge.
