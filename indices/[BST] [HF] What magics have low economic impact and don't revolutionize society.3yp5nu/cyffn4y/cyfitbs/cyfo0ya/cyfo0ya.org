Water breathing in Skyrim requires level 50 Alteration, so it would only be usable by people with substantial training (halfway to perfection). Probably useful for fishermen, but it only lasts 60 seconds so it probably wouldn't help with transportation, unless it was just a small team of amphibious troops crossing rivers or whatever.

Probably some battles go differently, perhaps a few fewer people die of starvation in rural fishing communities, but I don't think it would be a huge shift if it were very difficult.
