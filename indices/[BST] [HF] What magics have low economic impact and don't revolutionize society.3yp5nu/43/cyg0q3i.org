Another idea: magic that's got to be literally wound up, like a spring.

You have some kind of mechanism that converts mechanical energy into "mana" to power talismans. So let's say you create a permanent gateway between two places by physically placing "portal stones" at each end, but you have to have an ox in a treadmill walking in circles for six hours to charge the stone up up enough to send the same ox six miles... about half an ox's walking speed.

This would still be useful, but it wouldn't replace muscle-powered transportation except to bypass natural barriers, and it would be more useful to bypass rivers than mountain ranges. Not only is the distance shorter, but you could power the portal with a millwheel.

It would be a great communication tool, especially if light and sound could go through the portal... but even if it couldn't, you'd still be able to transfer paper cheaply in energy cost.

One huge difference would be defensive structures. Castles would have pairs of portal stones instead of gateways. If portals transmitted light, you'd eliminate windows as well.

Let's say instead of a portal you have a kinetic energy spell. You don't bother with bows and arrows, you carry an aiming stick and a bag of mana-charged sticks or rocks, and some kind of windlass to charge them up again between battles. Or maybe the magic is in the stick, like a magical railgun that works like a cross between a crossbow and a rifle. Bombs are bags of rocks with randomly directed impact-triggered kinetic spells on them. Shaped charges are /easy/.

Warfare is driven by windmills and waterwheels holding open portals to the front that charged weapons are delivered through. Rivers are a major strategic asset. Since one limit to portals is mass, there's a tendency to overcharge the goods. Sometimes there are terrible accidents...
