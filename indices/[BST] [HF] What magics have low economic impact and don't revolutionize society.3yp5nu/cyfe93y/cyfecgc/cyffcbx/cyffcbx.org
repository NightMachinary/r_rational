Gold's got a bunch of useful characteristics.

OK, what could you do with gold in medieval societies if it were actually cheaper than rocks.

Gold is non-tarnishing and easy to make watertight. You'd cover roofs with it. You'd cover outside walls with it. It's malleable, so it'll wear off, but it's also easy to repair.

Gold is heavy. It makes great ballast for boats. It makes great ballistic weapons - bullets, cannonballs. It's not really strong enough for arrowheads.

Gold is watertight and malleable. Gold piping would be used everywhere, canals and tanks would be lined with the stuff. Poor farmers would use it to line and cover their irrigation ditches.

You can beat gold thin enough it's transparent. Gold foil isn't all that strong, but it's durable. It would be used instead of paper for long term record keeping.
