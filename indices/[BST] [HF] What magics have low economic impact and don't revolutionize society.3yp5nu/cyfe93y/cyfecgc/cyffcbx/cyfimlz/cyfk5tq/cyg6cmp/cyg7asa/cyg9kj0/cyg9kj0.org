I think that most magics that don't have firm bounds on them can become Endbringer class by just amping them up. If you start with "turning things into gold" then the impact it has depends on the range, control, etc. A spell that you can cast three times a day to turn a touched piece of rock not greater than a cubic foot into gold is pretty minor if everyone can do it. Being able to freely turn /anything/ within line-of-sight into gold at the speed of thought destroys civilizations. Same goes if you're limited to stone but stone includes things that are in the human body. If rock includes "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralized_tissues][mineralized tissues]]" and the spell requires no line-of-sight and can be done at great range, then you could seriously injure a person.

Mostly I think it's difficult to find an effect that's not revolutionary once you start lifting some of the explicit or implicit restrictions. "Create light" is implied (or explicitly) something like torchlight, limited to line-of-sight or close by, not stackable, difficult to make images with, only in the visible spectrum, etc. But once you start lifting those, you get revolutions in dozens of different directions.
