Actually indestructible stuff would be pretty cool, the latest chapters of Dungeon Keeper Ami have small plates of adamantium which hold up massive flywheels (with adamantium bases) that can keep spinning to produce huge mechanical force, for a railway in the story, so you never know what making something indestructible can actually do till you give it a good long think.
