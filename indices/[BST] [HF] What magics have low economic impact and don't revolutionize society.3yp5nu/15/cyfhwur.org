Water purification (a standard Cleric spell) would impact the alcohol industry (beer and wine), but relatively little else.

Some kind of personal invulnerability shield would probably do OK, as long as it's rare enough to be limited to a few specific individuals.

A spell to summon diseases or plagues.

Any spell that creates a human, or a humanlike creature, to order - or with specific properties, like a demonic self-serving adviser -could /probably/ be tailored so as to be similar to simply hiring someone from the existing labour pool. (Requires expensive materials, can't produce people who are too exceptional/impressive, random component etc.)

An "evil genie" mind control/reading spell, as an analogy for torture. You'd need to make it costly enough, obviously, but torture is already a thing. (We can say with reasonable confidence, looking at history, that it would be implemented in an incredibly slapdash and irrational manner by almost everyone, so that's nice.)

Healing spells /would/ have huge effects, honestly. You've got the ability to cure STDs; you've got reliable medical care for the rich (where before they had only quacks and charlatans, pretty much); you've got unknown and as-yet unmeasured effects on intelligence, political views, and God only knows what else from growing up with lower parasite load ... actually, that might explain the usual tendency for pseudo-medieval worlds to be populated by pseudo-modern /people/, with sexual equality and such.

The standard D&D /raise dead/, where it can't raise those killed by old age and requires 5,000gp worth of diamonds or whatever, is probably fine.

I'm not certain, but I think a /Perpetual Light/ AKA lightbulb spell wouldn't break anything important.

Any kind of "illusion" spell with purely entertainment/data visualization applications, like a spell that shapes smoke or fire into particular forms.

Magical refrigeration.

Indestructible artifacts, one-ring style. A sword forged from Adamantium or a Mithril jacket isn't going to have much economic impact.
