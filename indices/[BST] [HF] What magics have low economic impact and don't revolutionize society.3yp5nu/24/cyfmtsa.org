Some weak mind magic that has the same effects as psychoactive substances (i.e. there is a spell with alcohol effect, one with SSRI effect, one with Modafinil effect) and requires the consent of the target and can't be cast on oneself. New spells have to be developed by tedious experimentation on a lot of test subjects.

The war on drugs would become an effort to contain the knowledge of the spells. Other effects would depend on how easy it is to learn a spell.

The requirement of consent seems necessary but maybe makes for a boring story. However, as I imagine it, you could still pretend to cast a different spell than you're actually doing.
