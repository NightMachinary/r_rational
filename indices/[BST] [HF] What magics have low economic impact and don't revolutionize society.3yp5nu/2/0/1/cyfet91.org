How closely correlated are the answers? And how smart is the spell-engine? ("Was the answer to my previous query accurate?")

If it wasn't a deal breaker, it would lead to some interesting effects, at the very least, with level 1 intelligent characters. Information theory would be developed much earlier than otherwise, at least. OTOH, this is how a fair amount of nonrational!fic, and possibly historical humanity, treats divination and similar methods, and no-one thought of this, so maybe not.

More seriously, it would probably eliminate (high stakes) games of chance; there is too much people can do to break them. Or at least, it would change them in interesting ways. Hmmm...
