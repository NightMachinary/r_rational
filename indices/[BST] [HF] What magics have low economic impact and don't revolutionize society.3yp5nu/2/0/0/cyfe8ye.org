Another way of looking at this is that the oracle only provides evidence with 0.6:0.4 likelihood ratios. You ask "Is my spouse cheating on me?" and the answer is yes, but you were only 1.5 times as likely to get that question in cheating scenarios than in non-cheating scenarios, so if your prior was lower than 40% it should still be under 50% after hearing the new evidence. It seems like society could survive that, especially since people would know many many cases of divinations being wrong - they might even have started to grasp the concept of prior odds.
