Assuming that the AI can see into the future, asking for one bit splits the tree of future timelines along the arbitrary seam of the answer I receive. The AI, by choosing the answer it sends, prunes 40% of one half and 60% of the other. Depending on how quantum physics work in that universe, this is equivalent to having a guy with Coil's power sitting around that you can call to drop one of the timelines he's been keeping since you asked the AI for a bit (except that he pretty often drops the wrong timeline by accident). If splitting along arbitrary seams doesn't make the future timeline trees look different from each other, we can take our sequence of ones and zeroes and start letting things depend on them: As said above with that grainy picture line, we can fill the bits into the squares of a page of checkered paper, and squint at it from far away; a 40% error rate shouldn't make a black-and-white image unrecognizable, right? At least if we make the squares small enough. If that doesn't work (presumably because of how the errors correlate), we can refer to the next bit of the answers we received whenever we make a decision. Whenever we happen upon an important one (where the future timeline trees finally differ), we get a fraction of a bit of the world optimized. The point is, as soon as one of these schemes has a chance to work (or even before that), the AI does all it can to steer me (or others) towards following it, and exploits it to hell. Getting out of a lossy transmission box can't be that hard for a literal omniscience.
