The usual causal loop outcome pump tricks would still be potentially useful. It wouldn't be as strong an effect, but would still at least allow nontrivial tweaking of probabilities. Wouldn't be /as/ powerful, but depending on specifics of how it worked, could still potentially let someone clever tell thermodynamics to go jump in a lake, among other things.

Security/espionage/etc would have to adapt to that possibility. The usual "code words"/challenge-response protocols would be risky for any higher security thing if this trick could be abused to have at least a reasonable chance of successful infiltration.

These are just some possibilities off the top of my head.

A possible countermeasure for the infiltration thing would be for the security people to do the divination themselves. Depending on how correlated the errors tend to be, you could predict a vulnerability in advance.

Actually, investigating ways to abuse the fact of correlation of errors between related queries seems like a general thing to consider.
