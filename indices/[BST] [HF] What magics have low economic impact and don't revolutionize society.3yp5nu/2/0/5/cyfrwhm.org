As others here pointed out, it really depends on exactly what "correlated errors" means.

It makes perfect sense to interpret this as meaning that identical questions get identical answers. But what if X and Y are events and I ask "will at least one of X and Y happen?" How should that correlate with asking whether X happens, whether Y happens, whether both X and Y happen?
