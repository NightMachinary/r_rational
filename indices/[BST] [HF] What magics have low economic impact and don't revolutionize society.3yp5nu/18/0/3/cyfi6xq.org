About Narutoverse: for change to happen, there had to be enough advancements in different fields for big reshaping to happen. It's just that it was already done by the time of the story. Clans studying their bloodlines, mages improving techniques, attempts to figure out history...basically, all that standing on shoulders of giants thing holds true.
