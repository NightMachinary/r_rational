Presumably, "radical change" means the carefully-crafted story setting falling apart and turning into something else too quickly to tell the story, or to leave open the possibility for telling further stories in that canon.

Naruto's world definitely has one of those "settings that would fall apart", as demonstrated in /The Waves Arisen/: someone sufficiently motivated to "just put together what's in front of them"---without any novel research or large-scale engineering!---could completely reshape the Naruto world into something that's worthless for telling stories about ancient clans having Ninjutsu battles.

Any setting that /has/ an "eschaton" event in the story is one where eschatons are already really quite easy to trigger, in the same sense that memorized spells in D&D are quite easy to trigger---almost all the work of "casting" the spell has already been done. /Neon Genesis Evangelion/ in all of its incarnations demonstrates this quite well: the story is basically about the protagonists trying to /avoid/ an eschaton that really, really wants to happen. Through the various media, the heroes repeatedly start it up /accidentally/ in /different/ ways, and then have to clean up the mess.

I'm not as sure about eschaton events that aren't exactly due to power 'harnessable' by any mere human. /Chrono Trigger/'s apocalypse-event is pretty easy for various parties (Queen Zeal; Magus) to trigger, but it's more the kind of "trigger" that involves prodding a paperclip-maximizer to get on with its paperclip-maximizing already. It's really only the paperclip-maximizer itself that has enough power to destabilize the setting, and it gets to "decide" the rules for what will or won't set it off, based on its own goal-tree. Unlike /Evangelion/'s Instrumentality, you can't really /predict/ Lavos as if it were a law of physics, which means you can't really /harness/ Lavos to your own ends (as Queen Zeal found out.) It's less "nuclear bomb" and more "evil god."

And, to emphasize the point of the linked article: /reality/ is a really good example of something that /won't/ fall apart very easily. If it was easy enough to create e.g. grey goo that can unilaterally outcompete all other life, nature would have already happened onto the formula and we wouldn't be here. Every low-level phenomenon we study in labs is already happening (or has already happened) somewhere in the universe by pure chance; every particle we produce in particle accelerators has likely already been produced. We're not going to blow up the world just by making a new one. We might blow up the world by a /concentrated effort to apply those principles/---plutonium decays in the Earth's crust all the time, but never in concentrations enough for supercriticality---but it's infinitesimally unlikely that there's anything laying around our universe that we might accidentally "activate" to our doom.

(Unless, that is, it was built by some other sentient race, who "cast the spell" for us. I feel increasingly wary of the idea of life being possible in a universe that /doesn't/ necessitate the Fermi paradox; imagine if, ala /2001/, there really /were/ precursor-race artifacts left laying around for cavemen to find.)
