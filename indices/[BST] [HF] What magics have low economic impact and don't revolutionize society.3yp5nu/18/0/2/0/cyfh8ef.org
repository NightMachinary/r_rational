That's not entirely true, first Proteins are held together with covalent bonds, ionic interactions, van der Waals forces and even steric effects (their shape prevents them from unfolding in certain ways). Secondly the idea that proteins are less strong than steel because they are made with covalent bonds suggests you haven't been looking at spiders and their silk very closely. Thirdly I don't know on what scale you think Nanotech is but anything smaller than a protein seemingly can't be specific enough to do anything to other molecules in a controlled way, not to say it's impossible but it's also not magic. Finally why was your entire comment in parenthesis?
