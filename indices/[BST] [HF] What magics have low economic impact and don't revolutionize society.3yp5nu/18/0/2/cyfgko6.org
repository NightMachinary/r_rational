  If it was easy enough to create e.g. grey goo that can unilaterally outcompete all other life, nature would have already happened onto the formula and we wouldn't be here.

(The reason why molecular-nanotech grey goo doesn't happen accidentally is that proteins, which must be evolvable out of other proteins by mistake, are held together by weak van der Waals forces rather than covalent bonds. This is why steel and diamond are so much stronger than bone, but don't get used in the body. Nanotech grey goo is to bacteria what diamond is to flesh. But your logic holds for grey goo that was made from amino-acid-chain folding proteins.)
