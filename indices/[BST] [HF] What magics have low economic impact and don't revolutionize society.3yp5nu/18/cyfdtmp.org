  What kinds of magic can you introduce into a setting without completely upsetting everything?

  can have been in the hands of thousands of people for hundreds of years without implying an industrial or post-industrial society.

Do you mean by "upsetting everything" radical change or specifically radical change in a good direction?

And is means of getting/inheriting etc part of this question?

I can think of a few magics which would prevent the enlightenment or even undo it.

For example hereditary super speed/reflexes like in Naruto (even without ninjutsu) would render guns worthless as equalizer.

Supernatural things in general would make the clergy more of a problem.

And a Interdict of Merlin amped up to 11 would blur ALL written things.
