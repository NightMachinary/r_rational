How about enchantments that only slightly improve the durability of materials? Cheap enough to use widely and a small advantage against those who don't have or use it, but it doesn't do much besides a constant factor for each material found. I think it would have a depressing effect long-term, as the constant factor would make the marginal gain in material progress smaller.
