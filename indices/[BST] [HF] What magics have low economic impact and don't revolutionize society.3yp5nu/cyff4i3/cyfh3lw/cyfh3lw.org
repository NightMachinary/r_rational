I like it. In old russian tales werewolves were actualy wizards that knew how to turn into an animal.

I believe even a transformation that retains knowledge will change little in a society. (IMO the way you made your spell is just a more fancy way to torture/kill someone, totaly worthless, I don't see its long time effects on a society)

This ability would be helpful while obtaining food from a forest so only useful in small villages, not impacting the develpment of the setting. Other then that it can be a powerful weapon in time of war, It would make melee more deadly so giving lot of possibilities on how warfare changed to fight agaisnt such beasts, without revolutionazing the same way gusn did. In the form of a bird it can be used to spy, which will lead to paranoia towards animals (religious fanatics that want to kill ALL Vertebrates, vegans on steroids)
