Retaining human cognition effectively gives you a way to very simply super-domesticate anything. This gives us:

- Warfare changes drastically as you can use elephants as combat engineers. Castles are no longer viable. Riderless horses can trek across vast steppes, making logistics much simpler. The Mongol-equivalents find it even easier to steamroll civilizations than in OTL.
- Access to the seas and oceans allows for entirely new forms of infrastructure and warfare. Aquaculture is entirely feasible, gives access to rich fertilizers, and encourages further marine exploitation. Whales with pikes are left as an exercise to the reader.
- Turn your most of your serf population into ground squirrels and have them hibernate for the winter! (This one is actually possible even without retaining human intelligence, but making them easier to corral might make the difference in terms of utility.)

...off the top of my head.
