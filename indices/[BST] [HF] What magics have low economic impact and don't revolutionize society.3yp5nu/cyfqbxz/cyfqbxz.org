Simple, small-scale utility spells. The ability to create fire in small doses (a single flame, right by your index finger) shouldn't be more of a revolution than matches or lighters are to us. Matches were invented in China at least by the year 950 CE. Very practical for everyday use, but not society-breaking. Prisons and such would have to be made from stone and other non-flammable materials, but I think they already are.
