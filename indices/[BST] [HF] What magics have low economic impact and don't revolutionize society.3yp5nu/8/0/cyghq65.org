The Cold War studies were mostly focused on looking for out-of-body experiences and psychic powers, too, not ghosts. Stuff you can use for intelligence-gathering.

Theoretically there's no reason you couldn't call up an enemy soldier who's been recently killed, I suppose. But it's probably easier to interrogate flesh-and-blood prisoners.
