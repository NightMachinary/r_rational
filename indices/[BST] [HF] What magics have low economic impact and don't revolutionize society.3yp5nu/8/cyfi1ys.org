The kind of ghosts you get with fraudster psychics. Think about it. A real human mind able to move without its body could upset world politics and economics, but if these ghosts lost their ability to plan, learn or even reason, and only went around telling loved ones everything will be well and that they are loved, that... wouldn't change much. A lot of people already believe in this, and yet there haven't exactly been a lot big projects trying to revolutionize 'parapsychology'. Although I guess there were a few during the Cold War... Still, that's most of history after the industrial revolution passing by without ghost studies.
