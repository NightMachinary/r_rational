Turning humans into other animals, assuming:

- Vertebrates only. Cell cultures do not count.
- The process is somewhat difficult, and to do so requires sympathetic items of the target, several minutes of preparation, direct visual contact and/or ingestion of a substance, and the sacrifice of a healthy individual of the chosen species.
- The target does not retain any of the knowledge, goals, or personality of their original form.
- The transformed target starts out proportionately satiated and aged to the original human form.
- The process can be reversed. This requires equivalent preparation to the initial transformation. The target retains the experiential memories of being transformed, but through the perspective of the target species. Interpreting this is a hard process which takes several years of training, and is roughly like learning to control a limb after moderate brain damage. Difficulty is proportional to genetic distance from humans.
- There is a significant "recovery time" which is equivalent to suffering mild trauma.
- You can only choose a species, and have no control over the exact appearance of the chosen form. The appearance varies with each transformation.
- While transformed, the target has the metabolism, vitality, and lifespan of the chosen species. Injuries and aging sustained while transformed carry across proportionately and to developmentally analogous anatomy.

This is not too distant from examples encountered in literature and folklore.
