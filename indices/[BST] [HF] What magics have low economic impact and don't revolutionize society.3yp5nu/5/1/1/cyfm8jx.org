I think "Candlelight" actually fits the requirements if the result is really only as bright as a candle and one person can only cast one such spell. Sure, people wouldn't buy (as much) candles anymore but I don't think candles were that expensive to begin with (they can be made from animal fat).

Another necessary restriction might be that the spell can't be cast in quick succession otherwise it could be used for Morse code.
