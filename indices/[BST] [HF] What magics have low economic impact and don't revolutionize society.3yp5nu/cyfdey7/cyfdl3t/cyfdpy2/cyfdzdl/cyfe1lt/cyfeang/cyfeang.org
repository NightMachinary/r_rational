You could also have your slave pilot around a furry drone body, ala FF7's Cait Sith. That drone body could then pair with your phone and thus give the person at the console quite a lot of "empathic" info through the phone's Health/Fitness-tracking APIs---and that's ignoring how much they'd know just from having access to your Facebook and e-mail (they'd basically be doing the [[https://getmagicnow.com/][Magic]] version of Google Now.)

...this seems like a good story all on its own, now that I think about it.
