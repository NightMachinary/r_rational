They always creeped me out. They're generally small, fragile animals, and if they get killed you die. Unless you get something like a bear as your familiar, it's equivalent to having your heart or another major organ wandering around the landscape.

Did the books ever say what happens if a familiar is physically forced a long distance away from its bonded partner? Does it cause pain? Death? Something else?
