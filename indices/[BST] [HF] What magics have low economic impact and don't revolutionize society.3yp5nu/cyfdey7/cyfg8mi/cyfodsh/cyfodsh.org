The daemons depicted in /His Dark Materials/ were as physically powerful as the animal they took the form of, but there was an extreme, pan-cultural taboo against a human touching the daemon of another person. Daemons can touch daemons (indeed it's part of courting rituals), but pretty much only married couples touch each others daemons, and even then it's salacious.

Soldiers have wolf daemons, but the wolves only fight other soldiers' daemons. The dog daemons belonging to cops do doglike things, but they're not going to bite a human. They might trap the human's daemon, though.
