Which is a huge cultural weakness. Anyone wanting to conquer them would simply attack/capture the daemons. They might even bring trained non-daemon animals of their own, effectively allowing them to field two armies that looked to the enemy like one.

I mean, hell. Send in your trained wolves / wardogs / whatever as a rush. The opponents' social conditioning means that their human soldiers, and thus the bulk of their weapons, don't get deployed. Their daemons are smarter, yes, but they're also constrained with the distance they can wander from their humans, making them slower to cover ground. Even if your entire wardog division is destroyed, they might lose 30% of their daemons /and thus 30% of their humans/. Meanwhile, your human army has zero casualties, isn't needing to take care of wounded or deal with piled-up corpses, and hasn't just come out of a pitched battle.

(Come to think of it, given that your wardogs would be that much faster over terrain than your opponents' armies, why not send them into your opponent's camp equipped with timed-release poisons and biological agents (or explosives, if you have them)? Or infect them with something nasty before the charge?)

Then, of course, once you send in your humans, their daemons might be conditioned not to attack you (if they're OK with attacking daemonless humans, you can release a bunch of dumb wildlife onto the battlefield to take up their attention) - but you have no such restriction.
