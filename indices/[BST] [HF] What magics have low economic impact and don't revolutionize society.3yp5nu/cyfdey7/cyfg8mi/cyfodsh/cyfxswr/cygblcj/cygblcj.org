  trained non-daemon animals of their own

  you can release a bunch of dumb wildlife onto the battlefield to take up their attention

The problem with this idea is that, canonically, animals and daemons recognize each other as /other/. Animals know that daemons aren't animals, even if you have a sparrow daemon sitting next to a sparrow. The sparrow is going to fly off. This is (headcanonically) the result of thirty-three years of evolutionary pressure caused by daemonically-assisted hunting and also (maybe canonically) because daemons dissolve into gold sparkles when their human dies. I think that humans are also able to differentiate daemons from animals, but i'm not certain if that's covered in the books. Generally a daemon without its human would be more willing to speak.

But aside from that, the wardog approach to warfare is the equivalent of near-future dorne/robot warfare. Send in the non-humans, because they'll kill the humans. If it's a feasible technique, then any up-to-date military will have a nonhuman assets program, just like any up-to-date military will have machine guns and training in enfilade fire.
