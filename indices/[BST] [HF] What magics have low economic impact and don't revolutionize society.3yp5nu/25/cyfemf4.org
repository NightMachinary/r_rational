Generally speaking, any magic with adequate costs. A properly gated magic system isn't going to revolutionize the world. Slowly evolve, yes, revolutionize: no.

The permanent virgin-powered Portal spell is not properly balanced because virgins are a dime a dozen. Ethics, of course, never comes into the equation. Likewise, typical Mana isn't a proper gating system because Mana is ambient and basically free.

But if you replace virgins with something worth 10xGDP of a typical nation, the gates suddenly won't be popping like mushrooms. Another common gamedesign trick is making each Portal price grow exponentially. When 10th Portal costs you 10^{10} virgins, suddenly, you can't afford it until industrial cloning kicks in and at that point you can have maglev on every tile.
