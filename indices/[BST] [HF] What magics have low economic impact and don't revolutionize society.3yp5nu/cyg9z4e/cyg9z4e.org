The magic from discworld, it obeys a law called "conservation of effort" which states that you can only get from magic what you could have gotten without it using the same effort, so you can get money by using alchemy but only as much as you could have gotten working the same amount of time. It makes magic pretty versatile, since you can use it instead of a whole bunch of other skills, but it isn't a significant difference.
