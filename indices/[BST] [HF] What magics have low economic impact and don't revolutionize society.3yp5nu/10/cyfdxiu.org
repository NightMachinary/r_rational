  Health/medical magic that doesn't work for indefinite life extension.
#+end_quote

Eh, I'm pretty sure that any medical magic, even if it just gave this medieval society access to the equivalent of current day medical technology, would be pretty damn revolutionary, it doesn't have to be indefinite life extension. If the child mortality gets reduced family size can be reduced allowing parents to invest more into each child which ends up effecting pretty much everything in society.

Anyway regarding non revolutionary magic. I'm not sure if such a thing can exists, the mere existence of magic ought to revolutionize our understanding of the world. Even if the magic only allows us to do things we are already capable of through mundane means but at a far greater cost, it would still be a worthwhile field of study with who known what kind of ramifications.

Though the first thing that comes to mind, if I recall correctly, is early Discworld books magic which by magical law can never be any more efficient or cost effective than a mundane approach, kinda cheating.

Second thing is the fey magic in Tad William's War of the Flowers, where the magical fey society somehow only manages to become a slightly outdated equivalent of human society. Though I don't remember if this was just due to some kind of societal inertia, or creative sterility on part of the fey, or some cosmic/magical law that states that the mundane human and magical fey worlds need to be reflections of one another.
