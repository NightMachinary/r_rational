Like I said, I've been looking around trying to get some actual numbers and they're hard to find. If someone would just say "In 1660 a pound of cinnamon cost the equivalent of £10 and sold in London for the equivalent of £110, with transportation making up 91% of the increased cost" then we'd know for sure, but so far I haven't found anything that goes into that much detail.

African slaves were more profitable than spices for a long period of time, but the closest that I can get is finding the price of a slave in South Carolina and comparing it against the price of a slave sold in Zanzibar (both places with relatively good record keeping). If I had a few weeks to work on it I might be able to make a chart of the difference in price, but that would mean trying to figure out the exchange rate of Maria Theresa thalers (used in Zanzibar) with the three varieties of currency used in South Carolina. My best guess is that there were a few decades where you could buy a slave for one money unit and sell a slave for ten money units, but that this was by no means constant.

And ten to one doesn't actually cover it, because a few of the sources of increased cost remain, including the cost of transporting payment or personnel over that distance, export tax, import tax, etc. Which would be more weeks of work to figure out and would depend on some of the particulars of the portal.

Anyway, that's all sort of moot because the big difference between historic trade routes and the annihilation portal is that they value different things. If you're moving goods by caravan or by sea, what you most care about is profit per pound, because it costs you £X to get 100 tonnes from Sri Lanka to London. With the portal, the thing you care most about is relative price, because it costs you price of goods in Sri Lanka times nine to get any number of tonnes from Sri Lanka to London. If a thousand tonnes of some material is £1 in Sri Lanka and £100 in London, then it's completely unprofitable to ship (the average 17th century sailing ship would gain £99 from the trip, which wouldn't be enough to cover crew/supplies/repairs) but wildly profitable to portal.
