I was thinking about this in the shower last night. For a 90% loss to be economical, transportation needs to make up more than 90% of the cost of the trade good at its destination. My mind went to the Silk Road, meaning spices and textiles, and the triangular trade across the Atlantic, meaning slaves and tobacco. I didn't remember to look it up until now, but it's really hard to find prices for things before steam power, let alone /relative/ prices for things that are quite far from each other and using different currencies.

(I believe slaves were the more valuable commodity to go across the oceans, mostly due to excess supply caused by ethnic wars. There are great numbers available about the cost of slaves at their destination, but a paucity of numbers about the cost of slaves at their source. I don't have too much trouble believing that transport costs were 90% of total cost though, but owing to fluctuating currency conversions it's tough to say, and I'd have to subtract profit margins as well, and we can't assume the portal is a perfectly frictionless mechanism for trade with none of its own costs.)

At any rate it's not clear to me which trade goods would have been worth it. That aside, /useful/ is very different than /revolutionary/. A portal that reduces the cost of transport by some fraction (even by half) would change the shape of history but not actually make a society undergo something equivalent to the Industrial Revolution.
