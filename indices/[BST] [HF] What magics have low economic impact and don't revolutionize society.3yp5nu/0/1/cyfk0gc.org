So ,basically, impact of spell, as well as some piece of engineering IRL, depends on its cost and logistics associated.

Can't rules of thinking about mundane technology impact be applied to magic as well? Is there even a /categorical/ and not /numerical/ difference between how we should think about impact of wheel on our history and Gate on some fictional setting, for example? Yes, Gate may be faster etc, but they are both tools for enhancing mobility and bring nothing new in principle, only in (important, but still) details such as speed.

So question boils down to "What costs/limitations should be assigned to spells to avoid breaking setting down?", doesn't it?
