Dragon Ball style resurrection, i.e. anyone can be brought back to life, but only once per person, and it takes a significant effort to bring someone back. It may be possible to revert to a younger age, but this is also a one-time deal, and old age still eventually gets you.

Because this is effortful, it will largely be used on high-value individuals (e.g. beloved leaders) or by individuals with lots of resources to expend on acquiring the necessary materials (e.g. oligarchs). Because it can happen only once per person, you don't get immortal god-kings (although you probably get a lower net rate of social change, since the most powerful members of the old generation take longer to die off).
