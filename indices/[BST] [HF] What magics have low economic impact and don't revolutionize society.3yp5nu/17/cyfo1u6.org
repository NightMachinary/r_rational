Any magic with a co-introduction of sufficient counterbalancing. While this could be an intrinsic limiter to the magic itself (e.g. costs years of your lifespan), it could also be a second magic. This would circumvent your limitation clause, though add a conditional one.

The nature of the interaction between a proactive magic and its counterbalance is interesting. The counterbalance needs to be intrinsically more powerful than the proactive magic unless that magic is not that powerful (such as Yudkowsky's destructive magic example). The reason for this is that an option introduced, no matter how weak, is strictly a buff. Even if a counterbalance works 100% of the time you've still given people an option they didn't have before given isolation from counter-mechanism. If I cast bull's strength and any person who sees it can purge it at will, I'm still a more effective laborer in my own time, or among cooperative people. There's no drawback to bull's strength, even if it's ineffective in combat. Conversely, invisibility vs. an AoE negation gives the potential for punishment, which, depending on the method of delivery, could limit the practical application of invisibility to honest work (hunting for instance), a non-impact.

Generalising from here, I think that any magic that produces value without pissing someone off is difficult to counterbalance using the introduction of a second magic.
