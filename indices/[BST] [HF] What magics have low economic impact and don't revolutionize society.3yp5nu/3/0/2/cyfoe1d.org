I think the overall impact vis-a-vis Progress or Quality of Life would still be pretty low, since there aren't a /lot/ of tasks a human population needs done that what basically amounts to a random distribution of frolicking woodland creatures can do significantly better, and historically, humans /have/ domesticated animals for exactly those reasons.

Maybe it turns out that tiny monkeys with human-level intelligence are good at building tiny computers, or something, but I'm not convinced a society containing tiny monkeys with human-level intelligence will think of /inventing/ tiny computers significantly earlier.
