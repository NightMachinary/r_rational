"Suppose that there is an AIXI told to maximize my CEV as of when I asked the first of these questions behind a cartesian barrier with infinite computational ressources, omniscience of the universe and the laws of science and magic. What is the first bit of its output?" Repeat for second, etcetera. If there is an exploit, this finds it. Depending on how chaos theory works, I expect a Simurgh song optimizing the world a fraction of a bit at a time, or a grainy black and white picture of the perfect plan (because I happened to fill the output into squared paper).
