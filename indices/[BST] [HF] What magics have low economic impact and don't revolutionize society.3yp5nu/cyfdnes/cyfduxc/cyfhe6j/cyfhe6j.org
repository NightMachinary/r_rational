It depends on how correlated. You could test it with questions like "Will a mathematician from [city name here] prove that 2+2=3?" and "Will my [body part name here] be on the moon tomorrow?" to see whether the answer ratio is 60%/40%, 100%/0% or something in between. After finding the conditions for correlation, prophets could start process akin to crystallization: starting from a question with an obviously true (false) answer, they'd ask slightly modified questions which get similarly true (false) answers, thus expanding the truth-crystal (bullshit-crystal) throughout the answerspace.
