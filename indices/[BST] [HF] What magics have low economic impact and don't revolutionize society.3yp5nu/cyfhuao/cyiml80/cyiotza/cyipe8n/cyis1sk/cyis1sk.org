True, if the plants don't need magic to maintain then it could lead to a more widespread shift. Maybe there's a faction of citizens and noblemen who are against any MMOs (magically modified organisms), the former for religious reasons and the latter for control.

  After all,we already have it and it broke nothing. We call it "speaking".

Being able to speak to anyone in private in any circumstance is fairly useful. The addition of being able to speak to people of any language, or even animals depending on how we define "projection," could make a psychic a very prized individual to have.

  This is true, but not that interesting. I would rather think of types of magic that would not shatter the plot even if not nerfed at all.

For this particular "prompt" that's the ideal, but overall I think the limitations of magic are just as fun to think up, and just as important to creative design and application, for stories.
