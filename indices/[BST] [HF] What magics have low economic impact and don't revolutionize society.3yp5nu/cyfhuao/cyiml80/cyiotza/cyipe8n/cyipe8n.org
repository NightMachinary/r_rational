Botany: we didn't end world hunger, but some of our crops give 10x yield compared to 19-th century crops. That's really big, actually. Also, the thing with botany that's broken is seeds. Most spells must be recast to give effect, potentially limiting them. Once you successfully make super-wheat with botany powers, you are done. It will spread by seeds. No need to put continuous magical effort. I would be careful when writing about innovative druids, they can easily shatter a story.

I agree with your points regarding the illusions and telepathy. Also, telepathy based on projection principle is guaranteed to be safe. After all,we already have it and it broke nothing. We call it "speaking".

However, I think your answer with regard to telepathy and illusions boils down to "any magic can be sufficiently nerfed to prevent it from shattering the plot". THis is true, but not that interesting. I would rather think of types of magic that would not shatter the plot even if not nerfed at all.
