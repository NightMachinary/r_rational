As [[/u/argentstonecutter]] said, I think the OP is asking a very different question: what magics wouldn't utterly change or distort a society's tapestry, not if introduced "in canon," but introduced from our understanding of it without the magic. By simply being present and accounted for.

Basically there is a bad-writing-trope where writers will imagine a world, stick some magic or powerful tech into it, then utterly fail to take into account how intelligent applications of those things would break that society or completely change it from what's expected. I believe [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]] is basically asking "what are magics that can be present in a given society/setting, like a medieval Europe expy, without making them unrecognizable when intelligently written?"
