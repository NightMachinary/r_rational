Well, yes, things which are already well-known and integrated into society are in general not terribly likely to change society. If you have a society which has already integrated magics that we ourselves would consider gamebreaking and worldchanging, it's not going to be changed by re-introducing a thing which, for them, already exists.

The original question presumes by its own existence that whatever magic you choose as your example is not already known in the society you're choosing to theoretically introduce it to. Otherwise you get the equivalent of "What if our modern society was suddenly introduced to... Electricity!!!"
