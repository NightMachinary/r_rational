Perfectly concealed assassins, disguised as part of a wall or ceiling. False results from any kind of test or check that involves looking at or listening to something. Food-tasters can now be foiled, as can checking whether something is rotten or unfit to eat by smelling it. Bureaucratic and multiperson systems which operate based on one person seeing the results of another person's work (not so much in terms of a dense stack of text, but more along the lines of "I see that the mail-sorting team has placed no items in Master Importantdude's pigeonhole this morning, so I don't need to carry anything to his desk." Or "I have to check the tally board each morning and report if there are more than ten marks." Or "I checked the outgoing table for the last extreme-importance diplomatic run of the season, and couldn't see anything on it." Or "What emergency whistle?"
