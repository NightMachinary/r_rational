Right, I more meant to imply that none of the chemistry that goes on on Earth---organic or inorganic---has any simple route to building a parallel evolutionary process for molecular nanotechnology. So you'll never "stumble onto" grey goo by throwing chemicals together in a lab. It'd take /extensive R&D/ to develop grey goo.

I don't mean to imply that it would take /Manhattan Project/ levels of R&D, though. It's possible that grey goo is something that someone living in 2050 could solve the engineering challenges for in their basement over the course of a few years---somewhat like the most scary hypotheticals for uFAI. But it's not just sitting there as a corner-case in chemistry, the way an [[http://qntm.org/nine][energy virus]] would be a corner-case in quantum physics. There's no single misstep we could make that would result in grey goo. It'd have to be a /large number/ of missteps. (Or a single misstep at the very end of the path to some useful technology that happens to be 99% similar to grey goo.)
