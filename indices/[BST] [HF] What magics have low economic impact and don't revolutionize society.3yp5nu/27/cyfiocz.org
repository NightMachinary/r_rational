Magical effects from the World of Darkness series of games and books etc. are protected from the most of society through a series of taboos mostly but also an incredibly powerful effect called The Veil which may or may not be maintained by Satan, it's a long and interesting story.

Those mages who have access to magic that is controllable in a very useful fashion, as opposed to Vampires and Werewolves whose magic is more inbuilt and generally very inflexible, have the common problem of spells that only work when you believe in them. The overarching plot of Mage:the Ascension is the idea that traditional Mages are being pushed into obsolescence by the Technocracy who are Mages that use super-science which is simply a different name for magic but who success allows the world to advance behind them and grow technologically.

So if you make magic harder the less plausible it is you also vastly reduce its effects on your setting by giving the setting primacy over magic rather than the other way round. World of Darkness's setting runs on the expectations of it's residents but only so far as the plot allows, I find it interesting to think about though.
