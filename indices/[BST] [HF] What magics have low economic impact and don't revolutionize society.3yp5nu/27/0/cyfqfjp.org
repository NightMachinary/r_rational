If by "plausible", you mean specifically in terms of belief... the really obvious munchkining there is any form of mind control/self mind control/whatever that would allow direct editing of what one believes.

So long as one gain access to /some/ means to do that, that pretty much gives them everything else then, no? (or did I misunderstand the model you haad in mind?)
