If by magic we mean something against laws of physics as we know it, then I have some general ideas: 1. spells which give you a power which to others seems to be something one could achieve by other means. For example a power to stop procrastinating and focus on your goals. Or a power to arrive to correct conclusion from already held information. 2. spells which create something (for an appropriate price) which is not natural, but one could imagine a world with it. Like, a cloth in a completely new color. Or a brick made of completely new material, which behaves mostly like a clay brick, but is green. Or an animal which looks like a mix of cat and dog. 3. spells with a tricky feedback loop which causes them to not influence economy, for example a spell which gives you a sausage at the same time deducing one gold coin from your pocket and giving half of it to the closest butcher, quarter of it to the nearest postman, quarter of it to the bartender, and finally making the pig one ounce lighter, and you one hour older. In a way this would be like "fast forward one hour" spell.
