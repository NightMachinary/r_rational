To be honest, most fantasy kind of requires a suspension of disbelief when it comes to a lot of what we consider mundane details of living in a pre-modern world, not to mention population and resource logistics. Cities with even a hundred thousand people, let alone multiple cities with hundreds of thousands, were practically nonexistent, and even rich kingdoms with arable climates had to devote hundreds of miles of land between cities to farming just to maintain their population. Any food more luxurious than bread or rice and stew would be almost unheard of for the vast majority of the population, and the amount of time the average person had to spend worrying about food opposed to doing "basic" other things like learning to read is almost completely ignored. Not to mention how prevalent and crippling the multitude of physical ailments and diseases were.

Magic botany would go a long way toward increasing the standard of living and population sizes from "realistic medieval" to what we might consider "standard fantasy" in any given story with that setting. Whether it accelerates things to the modern era or not I think is a different question: certainly it makes it easier to reach it, but the presence of other threats (say, roaming packs of goblins or magical creatures making life or trade difficult and requiring resources devoted to protection) would be a separate obstacle to offset the ease of acquiring food.
