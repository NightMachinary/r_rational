I agree with regard to "absolute" magic.

However, I think you severely underestimate the effects of your examples.

Botany magic means world hunger will be solved. Pretty revolutionary, if you ask me.

Illusion of you not being where you are is equivalent to invisibility. That's also a pretty big deal, I'd say.

But the greatest magic in your list is telepathy. It changes the society completely. No more secrets. Thought crimes are now detectable, provable and punishable. Betrayal is obsolete. Bluff is obsolete. /Lie/ is obsolete. Really, telepathy would undermine entire human society and turn it unrecognizable.
