I don't think Botany magic has to mean an end to world hunger if it's rare and limited enough an ability. Again, just do what we do with modern science, but magically. Have we ended world hunger? No, largely for socio-economic reasons.

Invisibility is nice, but it's not foolproof. Remember, this is not a power dumped on an unsuspecting world, but one that was there all along. Any location with info or people important enough for an invisible person to drastically change things should have countermeasures in place to protect against it.

And telepathy can work on a projection principle rather than a "pry the thoughts from your mind" one. Or maybe people can learn defenses to it. Remember that any power is only as broken as its lack of limits.
