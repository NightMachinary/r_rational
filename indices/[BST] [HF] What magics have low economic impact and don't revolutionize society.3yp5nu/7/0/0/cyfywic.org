The thing is, these are all things that can, to various degrees, be emulated in our world. Assassins don't always need to be perfectly concealed to be effective. Would it help? Sure, but it doesn't break society unless it's completely foolproof. Same with information espionage or falsification. And since the question is about magic that's well known and spread through society, knowing the existence and limitations of illusion magic would go a long way toward ensuring that people in the most serious of circumstances have the ability to test and protect against deception, the same way knowing that such a thing as forging documents exists would help against that.

In a society where illusion magic is unkown, an illusionist could walk through a city as rich as he pleases, handing people 1 dollar bills that read as 100s, or copper coins that are seen as gold. In a society where illusion magic is known to be something that can change a specific sense within X distance for Y duration under Z limitations, safeguards can be put in place for most any circumstance.
