I thought that the OP was more along the lines of "what magic would still leave you with a society that wasn't massively different from the typical medieval-ish fantasy setting".

  Let's assume the background is Standard Medievalish Fantasyland but with slight urbanization or modernization being okay, so long as the Industrial Revolution doesn't start.

So you can change the society, but you can't immediately kick off a Magicotechnical Revolution. Would Medieval France + Illusions be substantively different from Medieval France - Illusions? Having to tap a coin against an anvil or cross or whatever to see if it turns into an acorn wouldn't be any different from demanding payment in good honest Florins instead of those debased Guilders that Prince Humperdink has been putting out.
