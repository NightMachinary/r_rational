Any magic that operates on an absolute ("instant" anything, subverting the idea of relative time, "unbreakable" anything, subverting the idea of force or erosion, "anywhere" effects, subverting the idea of distance/space, etc) can and will break society-as-we-know-it once a munchkin of sufficient intelligence is born to recognize the non-obvious advantages it can be used for.

On the other hand, magic that just makes doing things more expedient/easy can be fairly low impact and not utterly upsetting the economy/society, assuming the person gaining the ability/training it is rare enough to be treated like a super-specialized professional.

Some ideas:

- Botany Magic. Basically being able to do what we do with careful breeding and genetic engineering of plants, but more "intuitively" and faster. It could create very nutritious and high yield crops, effective medicines, deadly poisons, etc, but wouldn't really "break" society unless users start making chimera creatures that cross animal kingdoms, which could be restricted by arbitrary "the magic only works on plants" type of rules, or less arbitrary reasons why doing it with less "simple" organisms is much harder and unpredictable.

- Illusion Magic of almost any kind. A team working in tandem that can create sounds, smells, sights and so on can revolutionize entertainment and alter how wars are fought (depending on how big/massively affecting the illusions can be), but in general being able to make people perceive things you can imagine doesn't usually break much in society.

- Telepathy Magic, as long as it's sufficiently distance restricted and doesn't grant sapience/intelligence to the receiver. It would make any activity dealing with animals much easier (being able to know that your dog is barking because it smells what it identifies as another dog versus a potential home invader), including domestication and using trained animals in more specialized situations, from construction to cartography to warfare.
