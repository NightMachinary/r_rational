I have a hard time imagining a scenario where it would be a big deal. Think about the number of atomic bombs that have gone off in the last century. They produced /a lot/ of heat, but even all put together did not raise average temperatures on Earth at all. The fact that their energy comes from splitting atoms rather than from nowhere doesn't really enter into it. Earth is not a closed system. Huge amounts of energy are being added from the sun all the time. No fantasy world I've seen produces energy on a scale that would hold a candle to that energy input.
