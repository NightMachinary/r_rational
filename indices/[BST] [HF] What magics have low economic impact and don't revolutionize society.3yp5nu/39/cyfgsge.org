My best immediate thought is low-level illusion magic. I'd expand though on what some other users here have posted. Most low-tier illusion spells are, as they suggest, just temporary sensory trickery. Convincing someone that X is Y (or more Y-like than X-like, or at least one attribute's deviation toward Y from X), or that X has disappeared, etc. Potency-wise, I'm thinking even below the level where you can do full human transfiguration, so you wouldn't have to worry too much about someone, say, disguising themselves as royalty or nobility, or as a close servant, for purposes of espionage or assassination (even if we admit this, I'm assuming that, once everyone knows this kind of magic is possible, smarter people will engineer tests to filter out sneaky shapeshifters). Besides, I'd argue that it's not uniquely beneficial relative to the old-fashioned way, either in kind or in (significant) degree: illusion-enchanced trickery is, at the revolutionary level, essentially isomorphic (or homeomorphic and requiring very, very few adjustments) to just having a corrupt adviser, which is not all /that/ uncommon a phenomenon for high-powered monarchs.

Beyond that, everything I imagine people would want from illusions--which arguably falls under "cosmetics"--is cripplingly temporary. So, you might be able to give the appearance of being unblemished, of having all your teeth, of being taller, etc. Except, you'd probably only get to have it for a few hours, and, given that you'd probably have to get it retail (since it is unlikely that anyone other than well-to-do merchants or nobility would have the requisite training to attempt to do it themselves), it would become prohibitively expensive very quickly to keep reupping on your beautifying spell so often, so I doubt it would amount to much beyond a luxury industry.
