Off the top of my head, magic which kills the wielder, causes terrible pain for their loved ones and/or the world at large. Demons, essentially.

Also, balance and karmatic retribution. I am thinking of Wildbow's story, Pact, where you could use magic to enhance your life, but the universe doesn't like that. You then need to balance the scales in some way or you find the universe literally conspiring against you.
