True that wouldn't make up for mental energy. I was thinking of the physical energy cost of things.

I got the idea from some fanfiction I've read but I've never seen anyone really explore the idea enough. For example, this guy used the thermal energy of a volcano to fuel a spell beyond his own arcane reserves. I'm sure it's nothing new and nobody could find where the idea first came from. However; it's never truly been fully exploited it its maximum in any media I've consumed yet.
