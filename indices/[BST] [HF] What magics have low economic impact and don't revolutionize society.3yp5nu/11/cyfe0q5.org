I see a difficulty in the presentation of the problem. Is magic merely a sufficiently advanced technology, or is it a physics breaking phenomenon? Physics breaking, in any form, is likely an economic unbalancing.

For example. A person who can cast magic missile is potentially creating energy from nothing. With enough time and ingenuity, there will be infinite energy. Infinite energy means infinite matter and the ability to create whatever you want. No economy.

The counter-argument to your 100 virgins for a gate is that a village of 50 people would never pay that price. So, cost is always the limiting factor. There must be a price for everything. Conservation must hold.

The economic breaking aspects of magic are almost entirely tied to breaking the law of conservation. There lies the question/secret. What is the cost of a super-power?
