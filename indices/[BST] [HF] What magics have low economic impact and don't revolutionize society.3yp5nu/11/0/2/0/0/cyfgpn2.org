What you're missing is that absent something like CO2, heat radiation rapidly scales with temperature, so that higher energy input creates a new equilibrium that's only very very slightly higher. It doesn't matter whether you run a thousand nuclear power plants for 10 years or 10,000,000 years, the temperature rises infinitesimally and then stays there.
