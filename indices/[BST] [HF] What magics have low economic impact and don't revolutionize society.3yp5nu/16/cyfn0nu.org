Magic that grants power to the users but has a cost measured in sanity. Someone rational can't really make much use of it, unless they think they can hit an optimal point where the sanity loss isn't too bad. Forcing other people to use it is pointless, because they become powerful and therefore can't be controlled. The only rational thing to do with it is try to stamp it out.
