So, I'm going to regret this, but hey, try to exploit this power.

You can transmute a volume of wood to an equal volume of rough-fired ceramic, and back. The object has to be lifted single-handedly, so that your arm is the only thing supporting the weight of the wood/ceramic, and the wood/ceramic has to be freefloating in air and not supported against gravity by any major forces other than your arm.

I honestly can't think of anything insanely clever to do with this. Make pots out of coconut shells??? Make neat looking wood objects by sculpting and then transmuting clay??? Some sort of... weapon that uses easily-replenished single-use ceramic blades, like obsidian-edged swords? Try to make money by transmuting wood to clay and then to really expensive wood (except that'd just crash the economy for expensive wood or expensive porcelain since lots of people can do it, and both of those things are just luxury materials for artwork anyways)???

Someone prove me wrong. There's PROBABLY something cool you can do with this but as far as I can think of, it's as innocuous a cantrip as it gets.
