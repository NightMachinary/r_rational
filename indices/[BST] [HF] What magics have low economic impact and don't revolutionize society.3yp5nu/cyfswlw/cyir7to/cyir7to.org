  transmute a volume of wood to an equal volume of rough-fired ceramic, and back
#+end_quote

Wood density: ~0.5

Ceramic density: ~3-4

I guess if there's a rope attached to a thing to be transmuted but it slacks as you support the whole weight of a thing then magic works?

Say the ceramic thing weights 15 kg, that makes wooden thing around 2-3 kg.

12 kg of difference per thing.

If there's a big wheel with those thingies hanging from it and person at the bottom transmutes clay to wood, person at the top transmutes wood to clay and the wheel is given some initial spin - it will spin and will also be able to do some work.

It can be made to work without ropes either.

You'd need to set up some cooldowns so just making a big enough wheel would be unfeasible.

Also making ships would be easier: use thin layers of wet clay, make thin layers of wood with the curve you need, glue them together with fibers in neighbour layers at a right angle to each other. Interconnect layers in brick pattern. No need to grow special ship-building wood.

In fact, if you can cheaply make wet clay from thoroughly crushed wood-transmuted clay, you can now build a fleet from scrap wood.

Also what about reinforced wood/clay? Does it work? If it does not, soaking a piece of wood in salt water and wood -> clay -> wood makes non-salty wood? (pure water could be extracted by that, also useful for the fleet).

How versatile wood is? There definitely are some edible types.

If you are able to build a fleet using scrap wood / clay / seawater (what's the least expensive with your logistics) and give them source of food and pure water and an engine then you can have /some/ maritime advancement.
