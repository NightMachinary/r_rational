It depends on what magic we're talking about, how expensive it is, how reliable it is, and who has access to it.

- Only one hundred people can do magic at any given time, each day they use magic they have a one in a thousand chance of death. Low impact on setting relative to effects.

- Everyone can learn magic but it's difficult enough that only nobility do, magic exhausts the user, and magic fails during certain astrological configurations. Medium impact on setting relative to effects.

- Everyone can use magic, they get better with skill but the benefits are minor, there's no real cost. High impact on setting relative to effects.

So if we had a dictionary of "Magical Effects and their Economic Implications" we would also have to include axes of difficulty. (You can't replace the horse with a spell if that spell has worse results than a horse.)

There are spells like D&D's /Ghost Sound/ that allow you to shout as loud as /four humans/, which does basically nothing when you can do it for ten minutes three times a day but can be harnessed for motive power if you can make that effect permanent.

I think you're largely looking at efficiency per dollar, but in some circumstances that can be hard to calculate, especially when magic is doing things that can't otherwise be accomplished like reading minds, erasing memories, creating demiplanes and extradimensional spaces, etc.

Edit: Take VirginGate, for example.

- If VirginGate lasts for ten seconds then shuts down, it doesn't revolutionize the world, because you can't put enough stuff through it.
- If VirginGate requires a million virgins, it doesn't revolutionize the world, because no one is going to be able to overcome the logistic costs associated with it.
- If VirginGate atomizes 90% of the things that pass through it, it probably doesn't revolutionize the world, because you're taking an automatic 90% loss on putting things like armies or trade goods through it. Though I suppose you could still keep resending letters, so it still allows for long-range communication.
