Tangent: there was a hilarious [[/r/dnd]] post about a guy whose party arranged for a whole team of people to scream at the main villain 24-7 with this spell.

Your restrictions can reduce the impact of almost anything. If the cost is low and risk is low but the impact is still small that would be a more interesting answer.
