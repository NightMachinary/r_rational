Use the socioeconomic effects rather than the physical/magical ones. They'll probably have the same effects as if there was a purely science-based product/device which offered the same change to process.

Also, if VirginGate lasts for ten seconds /reliably/, it still has 90% of the functionality of a permanently open gate. In ten seconds, you can put a high-speed train or other timed cargo carrier through it. You can also put people in elevators and drop them through it. You can deliver most small to medium items. You can pour sand, grain, oil, water, and all sorts of other things through it, even if you leave half a second either side for testing/checking.

It becomes a matter of how much volume you can stuff through a gate, or series of gates, or set of parallel gates, per 24 hours (or per quarter) per dollar. If the cost is high, then it's going to be used sparingly - only by governments, militaries, and very wealthy people/corporations. If the cost is low but the volume is also low, it's only going to be used to transport things which are valuable for their size or would benefit from immediate transport. It would still revolutionize communication. If the cost per gate opening is high but you can put a /lot/ of volume through it before it closes, it might be used by primary industry and for long-distance bulk transport - think international airports and ports rather than domestic ones. And so on.
