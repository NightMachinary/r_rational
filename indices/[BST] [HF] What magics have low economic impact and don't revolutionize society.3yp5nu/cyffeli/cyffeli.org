Illusion magic in a limiting aspect would simply improve entertainment. It would be easily identified as an illusion so you couldn't use it to deceive or bluff. It can't be permanent so you can't create hidden entrances, or even better a permanent repository of knowledge that can't be destroyed conventionally.

It can only be cast a short distance. It obviously would still improve communication. This could be limited for example by the magic needing to be put on something physical like a piece of paper first, so the cost of sending messages wouldn't lessen.

I'm sure it could still be used for psychological warfare or torture such as showing something grotesque but as I said before illusions would be easily identified by any layman.

It can't provide any form of lighting otherwise you could produce cheap illumination. Maybe you could eventually allow it such as coming with the same cost as flash powder or similar things, but depending on the setting it couldn't provide lighting unless someone is nearby to maintain it constantly. Something like having a light in your hand, but the effort is so much that it can't be maintained that long.

It may be okay to let it improve documentation such as conjuring an image of an animal nobody else has seen before long enough for someone to sketch it onto paper. This would allow someone that does that to send teams of illusionists into the world to document things and come back with the results, but it obviously is still coming with the cost of simply having a team of sketch artists do the same thing.

I hope I've covered enough on the magic and how to limit it properly.
