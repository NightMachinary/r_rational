Umm. . . You just had a presumably benevolent singleton put the whole US government on probation, for it's own good against existential threats like Stella and Flicker. For those of us with some bureaucratic chops as gears within the machine, or followers of how the diplomatic game is really played: that is so fucking awesome!

Lots of questions?

How does the EDU space regulations and UN treaty on space work? Does the EDU claim sovereignty over earth luna space, or are they just bullying like the Chinese did yesterday with the UUV? Did the EDU set an organizing structure to regulate parking orbits as part of their mandate to defend earth and it's orbit? Why wasn't the satellite dish returned, too much drag for Black Swan to bring down without burning it up, despite her /sf techno magic/ powers? Did we just see the limits, or even a false set of limits, of her current body demonstrated?
