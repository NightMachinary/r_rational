Not yet, the author has shown that he is reliable with his previous story, but the latest chapter had a monologue about how this isn't a business and he is just doing it for fun. That screams to me of someone who doesn't want to commit too much to something, for fear of getting burned. So we will have to wait and see, I hope he sticks with it, cause it's a great story and definitely has potential.
