I just caught up to this fiction, which hasn't been on RR for even a month yet, and it is probably one of my favourite Isekai Stories already.

It is a rational breakdown of a fantasy world in which a King somehow managed to glitch the hero summoning Ritual to work on repeat. So he naturally became the most powerful person around.

The story is from the perspective of a 'hero' summoned possibly 100's of years later. Where the summoning of heroes is now an institution, and heroes now a commodity, if a valuable one.

He is a rational character with pretty solid development so far, though the story is still rather early in its run, with less than 200 pages.

Please give it a shot, I know being a RR author is tough, and I would love to see this succeed.
