Punctuation errors and rookie errors are just something that needs to be accepted when reading most WN's and amateur stories. The Author isn't a professional writer and doesn't have the time to go over the story with a fine tooth comb to find all of the misplaced commas and incorrect capitalisations.

I feel like encouraging these authors for the work they have done is more beneficial than shouting them down for not being perfect.

And yes, chapter 41's ending is great, I just want more!
