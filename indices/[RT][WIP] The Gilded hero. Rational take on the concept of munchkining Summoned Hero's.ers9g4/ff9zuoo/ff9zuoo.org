I like it, but there's a ton of punctuation errors that are really annoying.

That said, it shows good character development and world-building, and is definitely better than 99% of the isekais "hero summoned to beat the demon lord" or "hero gets a trash skill...until they use it properly!" stories.

The ending for chapter 41 was great.
