For those who don't know their forum system: starting with the first chapter on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/33296179/][this post]] puts a "Threadmarks" tag on the top and bottom, making it easy to click forward to the next chapter without returning to the table of contents. Bookmarking the story if you stop reading partway through allows you to keep the threadmarks when you return.
