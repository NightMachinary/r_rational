This is an SI fic where the main character has meta-awareness of the series and goes around making "improvements", pulling practical jokes, and subverting the episodes where the cast make bad decisions.

Like a lot of SIs Data comes across as overly competent and isn't challenged often, and in a lot of ways the plot revolves around him already knowing the right answer, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and it has some funny scenes.
