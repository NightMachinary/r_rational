I would weakly recommend reading 'Uncommon Sense' and 'Dust Rag' first from the short stories. As far as the novels are concerned, I don't think there's any particular recommended order other than 'Mission of Gravity' before 'Starlight' (the latter is the former's sort-of sequel). I've started with 'Mission of Gravity' and 'Noise'.
