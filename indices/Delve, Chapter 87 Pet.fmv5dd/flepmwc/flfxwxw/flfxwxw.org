I think in his case the class already exised as a 'hidden' tree of light spells- you just have to pick them out from all the other trees. It seems more that his interface was geared towards identifying which skills were part of this hidden set at a glance.

In other words: the default tree layout is just one way of organising and displaying this compendium of skills. It's more conceivable that you could get the interface to reorder how it displays skills (get it to highlight the skills needed for the class you've desired you whole life, etc) than it is to just make a new class. The second seems harder (and you probably need something like mana manipulation to even get a start on it).
