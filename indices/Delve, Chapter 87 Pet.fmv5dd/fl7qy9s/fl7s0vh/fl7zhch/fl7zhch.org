I'm not sure if he needs to take spring. He needs to be useful enough for her to sponsor him; he doesn't necessarily need to do everything she says.

Velocity alone is useful to Velika. If he can end up with something like 'Empire of Speed' (with velocity as its prerequisite), she might be happier to have that than to have Spring. Velika is experienced, but Rain is outside of her experience. Velika knows about Spring for example, but /isn't/ thinking about how he could be using Essence Well to fill her up in seconds.

When she learns how much he can buff her without messing up his build, she'll probably be happy with that. Remember that the DKE is opposed to the Empire and everyone has got a strong taboo against telling people their skills, let alone actually coercing them into taking skills.
