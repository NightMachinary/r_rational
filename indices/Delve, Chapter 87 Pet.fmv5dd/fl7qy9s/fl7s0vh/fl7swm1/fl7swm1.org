They did say it had a high variance for this dungeon.

Now, between a choice of taking one suboptimal skill versus not getting to level up in the first place...

The prismatic intent can be delayed one level, provided he get a lvl 27 blue, it has no effect.

Legendary dynamo tho... Not sure will be affected or not. Maybe just the specialization.
