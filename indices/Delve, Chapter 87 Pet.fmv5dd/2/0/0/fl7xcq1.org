Huh, maybe, I thought the emperor had been ruling for hundreds of years though.

I'm referring to Magical Synergy, the skill that lets 25% of focus contribute to mana regen (and clarity to mana pool). So Animus is useless before you get it (because it takes so long to get mana) but after it you get great regen and great damage bonus and mana pool. Soul strain only applies to overmana right?
