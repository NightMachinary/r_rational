acording to conversations i had on the delve discord and authors comments an animus without actual clarity would experience soulstrain everytime they cast a spell eventually killing themselves in the process

the author used an analogy of gunpowder(focus) and a canon(clarity). If the gunpowder is stronger than the canon it can damage it. and supposedly magical synergy doesnt help as much

we know that in text, winter seems to help with headaches and so i assume magical synergy would as well, atleast a little bit but animus would still suffer debilitating effects after casting every spell. They couldnt ever use their full mana
