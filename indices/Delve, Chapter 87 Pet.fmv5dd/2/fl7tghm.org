I'm still confused that he just now thought about switching his auras to avoid mage burn. Is the author reading reader complaints?

The empire must be pretty terrifying because they make soldiers with builds meant to work in an army, whereas everyone else makes small group warriors that have to be self sufficient. Presumably the empire doesn't have people keeping class requirements a personal secret, so they are also probably all rare/legendary classes. Actually how has anyone survived this long against them?

Still don't see how no one has realized how good dynamo/animus are given synergy and prismatic intent.

Seems essence well's main use may be mana burning enemy warriors.
