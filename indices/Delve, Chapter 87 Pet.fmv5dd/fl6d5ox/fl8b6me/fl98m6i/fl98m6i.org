You're right, Uncertain Savior is absolutely insane. It might take 1 or 2 days but she can have a fully specialized build for every task, stats and skills included. She can also experiment like no one else can, testing for skill synergies and refining all of her builds over time. This is huge: refining builds takes generations for others, she can do it over weeks. This is probably the ideal power if you got dropped into the world without knowledge like Rain, he lucked into a strong build and is locked into it. He could have just as easily guessed vivicent and gotten stuck with it.

She also has great synergy with Rain: he can help her train far faster and is unlocking every skill tier. She could do his passive build for example, and generally tell her all the skills he can see.

At home? Training build. Travel to the fight? Travel/utility build. Combat? Whatever build counters your expected opponent and complements your team. Looks like she tends towards monk for combat.
