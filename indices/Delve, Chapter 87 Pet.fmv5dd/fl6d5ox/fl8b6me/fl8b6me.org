Uncertain Savior is amazing. No wonder it is legendary.

Just being able to adjust your build as you find out you use some things and not others is impressive. Go adventure as a combat monster, then come home, rest a month and be a crafter for a while. Then add in the fulfilling prerequisites, and able to fudge them, and you can possibly be very top heavy with skills. With time, it could also possibly unlock a lot of hidden skills too.

I would rather have that than a class that raised all skills to Max level 15, and the major upside of some level 25 classes seems to be doing that for specific skill tabs only.

I know the goal of all Clarity is to unlock a better Dymano class at 25, but I wonder what unlocking all skills to tier 2 will add to the class selection. If he gets stuck at a level near but under 25 for a while, and unlocks all skills to tier 3, what kinds of classes might that open too.

Very interesting finding out what more classes can do.
