In a section from Val's POV, it's shown that his interface shows him which skills are the right ones for the class (the skills are glowing runes, and the right ones 'feel' right/have the right tinge of pure light about them), so his interface is definitely giving him information other people wouldn't have. Changing your interface is very hard, yes, but different people start with drastically different looking interfaces based on what they're used to, which is why Rain started with a computer/rpg-esque interface. I'm not saying Val changed his interface, I'm saying that it started off this way because who he is/was when he awakened (presumably with a very strong urge to follow in his father's footsteps, which manifested in the form taken by the interface).
