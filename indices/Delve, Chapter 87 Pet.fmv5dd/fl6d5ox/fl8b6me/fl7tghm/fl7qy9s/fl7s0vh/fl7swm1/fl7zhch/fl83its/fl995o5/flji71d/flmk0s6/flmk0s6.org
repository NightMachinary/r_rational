Might be a trap, she could go back on her deal once she is stronger and we are relatively weaker(from taking a support aura). I don't remember Velika's level also, her skills likely cap higher than 10. I also don't remember how skill level exp requirement scales.

"I'll do it for a 27 blue and only for x time" would convince me, but we know she doesn't have access to that blue.

Also levelling people to 10 might be hard depending on their builds, don't want to mageburn them.
