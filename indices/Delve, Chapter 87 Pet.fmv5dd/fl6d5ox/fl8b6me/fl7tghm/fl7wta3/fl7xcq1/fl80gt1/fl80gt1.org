I might be wrong on the Empire timetable. I think they've expanded recently, so maybe this is a doctrine change?

Soul strain applies to the amount of mana used. Val was getting it when Rain was filling him up to level his skills.

I'm not sure if Magical Synergy actually helps against mana strain or if that's dependent just on your clarity stat. I think so, because otherwise Animus would be a much superior stat distribution for Rain using the same aura mastery build (once he hit synergy anyways).
