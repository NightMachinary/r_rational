At first thought, it's funny that Bosco has a bound weapon that he can't even charge. But thinking about it, it's not that crazy of an idea.

If you're not awakened, you shouldn't ever be in a serious fight. You won't be out adventuring and using it all the time, so it's only real use is as an emergency item or the /one/ time you go to get awakened (then you can charge it yourself). As a weapon, it can't be stolen nor used against you, which is good if you're in a society where there's a bunch of adventurers who can kill you effortlessly but are also relatively low income. Also, (I think?) bound items can be more enchanted than an equal quality unbound item.

To compare it to IRL, if people could make their self-defense firearms bound, that'd be better for the majority of use-cases.
