Y'know, i think it would make for a neat game.

I disagree about land competition/pyre layout not occurring/mattering however. If mechanically, bazuu roosts attack the area around them rather than board wide, and the war has a resolution roll that includes failure and a horde attacking a pyre, then competing for land so as to be encircled by other pyres to act as armor and ensure your own hearths are physically close for some measure of protection might be a strategy on the construction side. So yeah land is worthless for resources, but having other players surround you would be advantageous.(?) Also, if land/tiles get improved by proximity to pyrelight/turns, snatching up rival lands with your own hearths that are slightly better than the wastes before they settle their own might also occur.
