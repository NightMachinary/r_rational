If it was an actual boardgame rather than something electronic, yeah, swapping/overlaying tiles would become a chore, point.

I was just initially imagining that, as in the story, taking advantage of land improved by another pyre's light (Dul Jatu and the twin pyres improving a lot of ranchland) another player may try to muscle in on improved but out of range land.

If improvement is done only on a settlement basis, that element is removed and only the bazuu roost locations would drive a specific tactic like encirclement by others..but with river layouts, that's unlikely to work out well unless you can settle a river delta and thus be away from mountains/hills, where roosts might pop in. But being away from hills means losing out to mines, especially gold and iron/copper/tin mines, which if construction requires resource cards, makes trade a priority.

Can you trade for minerals with the tinapi? Speaking either for a theoretical game or in story. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule][These nodule things could be smelted down for metals, maybe.]]

Also, do murrush ever go into war with humanity? I would assume if the army failed they would be enlisted to help stop the horde from sweeping through the pyre and hearths, but do they ever go out into the field, or just stay at home being guards and forges?
