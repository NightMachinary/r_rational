If you haven't heard about it before, Tabletop simulator might help you playtest this with a custom board so you can actually see how things go. A few years back there was this card based wargame that used it to great extent to refine out the actual gameplay before comitting to print, iirc. I doubt you plan on doing anything so fancy, but it might prove fun for you to try out.
