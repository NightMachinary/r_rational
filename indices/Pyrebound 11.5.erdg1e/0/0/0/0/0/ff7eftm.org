Actually, that is an interesting tradeoff--mineral access versus safety. I'm on the fence about resource cards as such, because I don't know how many different collectibles I'd want players to keep track of. If players already have to keep track of various population units, all the special buildings in their pyre, gold, and prestige, do I want them to accumulate cards for ore, stone, etc.? Or do I want it so that the price of improvements varies based on how much you "have access to"?

For example, if you control X quarries, or have bartered with one or more other players for the fruits of same, all stone-based buildings are substantially cheaper to purchase. Food production is tallied every fall, and any shortfall means population and prestige loss. Varied food sources speed population growth by making a healthier populace. This is something similar to what I remember of the resource model in Civ 4.

The tinapi commonly serve as middlemen in trade. I could see them being used for trade with pyres "off the map," and for acquiring any number of useful things from various sources--but the price might be steep. In-game, I imagine a sufficiently prestigious pyre being able to attract tinap merchants. Any such trade model might be awkward or cheese-able sans resource unit tallies, though. Possibly the default cost represents having to import the goods from off-map, and if you get tinapi to build a creche in your pyre that default cost drops?

Murrush are extremely hard to kill, and quite scary, but have the twin liabilities of sluggishness and low fertility. Put a murrush up against a horde of shabti and it will reliably burn and smash any who run into it--but they could effortlessly dodge around it, and no pyre is likely to have more than about five (Misishi is an exception, due to their singular focus on mining). They also eat a lot.

Thanks for all your input--I like the way you think!
