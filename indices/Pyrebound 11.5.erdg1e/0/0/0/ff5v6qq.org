In practice, they tend to be strung out along a river for water access (with the exception of Dul Jatu, which is an oddball). However, geography could be relevant in that more rugged land would be better for quarrying or mining, whereas flatlands produce superior farms. Having distant tiles themselves improve over time would involve a lot of modifying the board manually, I think; I was imagining a system where you can overlay new improvements on the old in successive turns to sim soil improvement.

Wheat farm 2 replaces wheat farm 1, etc. Different farm types would have different outputs--wheat produces lots of food but no money, orchards produce less food and some cash, forests like Dul Karagi's are good for cash and a bit of prestige but take a big investment to make. Not sure how pasture would work. Easy investment, low total payout? Farm, Orchard, Pasture, Vineyard, or Forest, with limited land to use. A single ring of hexes per hearth, double for your pyre itself.
