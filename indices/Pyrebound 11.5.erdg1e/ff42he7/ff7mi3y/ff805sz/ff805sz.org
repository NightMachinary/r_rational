Why don't you quarterback it? Say you're in Ram's position. You have yourself, Shimrun, Shennai (knack for assassination), Mana (unusual power for age), Rinti (unexceptional tween handmaiden), and Pimna (doesn't want to be there). Busu's incapacitated, but you've got his sword. Darun's fine and willing to help. Aside from that, you have a dented skybarque and oh, what was it, six recently freed bondsmen? They are talented at handling livestock. You have reasonable freedom, but all plans must be run through the wishy-washy Shimrun. What do you do?

EDIT: This challenge is open to any and all readers, of course.
