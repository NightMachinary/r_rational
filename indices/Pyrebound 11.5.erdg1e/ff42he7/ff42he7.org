Idle question: would the world of Pyrebound make an interesting board game? The only modern board games I've played are Catan and one round of Castle Panic with my nephew, but I can see PB fitting into the general mold of a Catan-ish game.

You start with all players setting up new pyres at sites along a river. Turns progress in four stages, a season each for the bloom, harvest, war, and a spring "building" stage where you can decide to construct dropmills, housing, or other amenities. You have to gradually build up the land, start new hearths, allocate spirits every bloom to handmaidens, flamekeepers, and ens, and so on. Other players can be sabotaged with blackbands or moonchildren in various ways, and there are plenty of things to go wrong. Victory is defined by, I guess, achieving a certain status for your pyre first?

EDIT: On reflection, there's no reason it couldn't be simple pen and paper (or electronic files, whatever). The actual layout of the pyres would be irrelevant to gameplay, as they don't compete for land and all land in PB is about equally worthless until it's improved. The resources would be population (of various classes), gold, and prestige, the latter being recalculated every bloom based on performance. First player to reach a given prestige benchmark wins.

Prestige is also valuable for other things; blackbands won't hire out to pyres below a given prestige, and some amenities like a tegnembassaga or a tinap creche are likewise unavailable for little podunk settlements. The trick would be to balance the different routes to prestige--it could be earned by amassing wealth, leading the Dominion in war against bazuu, building lots of hearths, or what-have-you. Hiring blackbands risks prestige--getting caught sabotaging other pyres is shameful, though everyone does it.
