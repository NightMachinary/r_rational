I started creating a prototype ruleset ([[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/pyrebound-the-game]]), then realized I still didn't have a complete update written for next week. It's less than half-complete, not even proofread properly, and probably too complicated. But it's there.

(Will probably have to take a one-week hiatus before next update--that was due to happen anyway, though. Ambush by inspiration was just an aggravating factor.)
