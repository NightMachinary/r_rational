Von Neumann probes can be made arbitrarily resilient to error propagation. You can easily have pentuple-redundant backups and failsafes to ensure against the spread of buggy probes. You could even build 101 redundant microchips and 101 redundant flash drives and likely do that in under a kilogram. Highly redundant integrity testing prior to deployment of subsequent probes is also fairly easy.

In contrast, humans are actually a major concern once they start spreading around the galaxy. We cannot arbitrarily enhance our resistance to mutations and natural selection. Indeed, with modern abortion to prevent genetic defects and the potential for genetic engineering to prevent diseases, we may be more mutable than we've ever been as a species. What will the human race become when genetic engineering is used to make people taller, slimmer, stronger, smarter, etc?

Even without that, given a million years, you'll likely see humans change at least as much as we have since Homo habilus. In 10 million years, the change would likely be at least as much as when we shared a common ancestor with bonobos and chimpanzees. The Milky Way is 100-180 thousand light years across. I doubt we'll travel much faster than 1% of the speed of light, which means we'd probably be looking at a 10-18 million year timespan by the time we reach the other side of the galaxy. Whatever arrives at that side of the galaxy would not be the same species as the hominids that inhabit our side of the galaxy.

Add on how rapidly cultures and languages diverge (easily less than 5,000 years) and the potential for rapid and intentional genetic alteration and you're dealing with a scenario where our one species would fill the galaxy with countless worlds populated by the truly alien descendants of our species. Indeed, worlds upon worlds with ecosystems full of genetically-engineered variants of Earth flora and fauna, all dominated by the oddly similar intelligent bipeds. But what if some of those races are not peaceful?

Von Neumann probes don't worry me at all. It's humans that make me worried.
