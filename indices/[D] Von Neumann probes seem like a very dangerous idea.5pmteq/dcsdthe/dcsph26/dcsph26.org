1. If you make the bots too cautious about reproducing they may not reproduce at all, or they might die out.

2. Part of the danger of Von Neumann probes is that they essentially have a genetic line of parentage. When they reach a new planet and replicate themselves their "child" may be more likely to carry over any mutations in the code or the construction. In this scenario you have to not just insure that a few random mutations will lead to a bad scenario, you have to insure that thousands of mutation steps won't lead to a bad scenario. The more cautious you are in eliminating certain lines of reproducing Von Neumann probes the more work you create for all of the remaining lines of Von Neumann probes. In the worst case scenario you have a single "genetic" line of Von Neumann probes that might have to stay safe through a trillion 'generations'.

3. You are ultimately fighting against evolution and selection effects. Cautious probes will die out. Probes that first sustain damage to the QA part of their coding will be more likely to live on. Probes that have out of control self replication are far more likely to live on than their reproduction limited peers.
