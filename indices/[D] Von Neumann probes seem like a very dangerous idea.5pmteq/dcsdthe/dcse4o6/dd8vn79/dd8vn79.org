Undetected data corruption causing insidious changes to programming isn't really an issue. Computer science has good solutions for detecting and either fixing corruption or destroying the corrupted data if it's so badly gone that error correcting codes can't save it. You can read about things like hamming codes and checksums and RAID arrays for some different approaches to the problem.
