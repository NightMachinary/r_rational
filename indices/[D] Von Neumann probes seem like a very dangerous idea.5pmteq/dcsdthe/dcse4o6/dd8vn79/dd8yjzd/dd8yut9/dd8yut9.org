When you start looking at the odds of cosmic rays simultaneously making the exact same series of changes at the same time on two or three data storage drives I think you'd start getting in that sort of astronomical territory.

All this also assumes you can't make a data storage solution that isn't vulnerable to cosmic rays or other radiation, which is almost certainly not true. Non-rewriteable data storage can be very robust, to the point of circuits somehow needing to be rewired to change output.
