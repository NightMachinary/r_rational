...Your Von Neumann machine became a threat to life? How? Why did you give it protection against re-entry, oxygen, liquid water, its own weight, and missiles? Why did you give it the ability to track and intercept spacecraft that can manuever more than ten million times as often as the rocks in freefall it should be targeting? Why did you leave any possible optimization for evolution to exploit by breaking your rules - that is, why isn't it already at a local optimum that is far away from the dangerous global optimum? The best possible robot arm doing everything by hand is not a grey goo doomsday scenario. Why did you make it reproduce using a mechanism that /even in principle/ could ever be dangerously fast? It barely makes a difference whether a Von Neumann probe copies itself in a second or a century!

Maybe don't do any of that. Make a slow, fragile, dumb thing that can't evolve into grey goo in ten thousand generations, let alone thirty. Then use error correction systems anyway - but don't rely on them to the exclusion of sane engineering. Your problem seems to be that you made a galaxy-killer with a limiter, instead of designing a probe for the mission. Don't massively overdesign stuff.
