What if you deliberately "neuter" such probes, giving them the relevant skills to survive in uninhabited space but not the relevant skills to win a fight with your own military? In order to wipe out your species, they would not merely need to become defective in the sense of "forgetting their loyalty to you", they'd need to become defective in the sense of "undergoing an intelligence explosion", which is obviously always a problem.
