Biological replication is not a good predictor for designed systems. DNA is an imperfect information transmitter because lines of decent where it was not became static and selected against. Evolution acts via selection over variation - it is perfectly possible - and in fact sort of trivial for anyone that can build a self replicator at all to build them to just never vary at all. Mutations and variation will simply not happen to a line of decent that uses quadruple redundant information storage and defaults to sterility in the event of data corruption.
