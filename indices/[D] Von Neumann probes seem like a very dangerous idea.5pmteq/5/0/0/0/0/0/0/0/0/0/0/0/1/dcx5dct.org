  Look, I work in the software industry. I see shitty code on a regular basis. I know there are ways to be careful and guarantee your code works.

We are nowhere close to code that can self-replicate well. For an example of /good/ self-replicating code, look at the human genome. It is very complicated, but it does succeed at self-replicating. Do you think humans will eventually become the grey-goo of the universe because of genetic mutations? How unlikely is that?
