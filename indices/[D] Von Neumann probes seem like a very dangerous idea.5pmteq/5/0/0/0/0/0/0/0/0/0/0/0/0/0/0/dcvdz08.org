If the only goal we were interested in were passive information gathering and there were no way to benefit from even greater amounts of information, you might have a point. It doesn't seem realistic to me though.

Chances are we will continue to have uses for larger scale computing arrays, power collection, and more detailed information, than is possible with the local solar system's manufacturing capabilities. The cost of making a probe that works as intended, even if that is very hard, is infinitely lower than the gains from doing so.

Besides, tapping the local system's resources is probably going to involve something very much like self replicating robots to begin with. And industry on earth already grows in a recursive fashion (where one machine builds / harvests resources for the next), which is basically a de facto self replicator with humans (another type of self replicator) being a component.
