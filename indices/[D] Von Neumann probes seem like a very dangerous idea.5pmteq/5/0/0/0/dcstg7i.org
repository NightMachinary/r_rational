As I mentioned elsewhere ... if you are too cautious you end up with a failed Von Neumann probe system. They won't consistently replicate and won't explore the galaxy. I'm fine with this outcome, but I assume what happens next is that they lower the strictness for error and try again.

Its not trivial to build a perfect replicator because your replication system is subject to error just like all other systems.

Is quadruple redundancy enough to protect a system from human hackers? I wouldn't trust it with even basic identifying information if that was the only security in place. And the universe will be brute force attacking every potential vulnerability of your system. And for all we know there may even be intelligent life intercepting your probes and messing with them in a way that isn't random.

Also as I said in the original post, this seems like a terrible gamble for a very low payout. What would we think of an alien civilization that accidentally destroys all habitable planets in their galaxy in an attempt to just stick a metal probe on every planet?
