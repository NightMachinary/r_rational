Almost impossible is an unacceptably large margin of error when you only need 1 probe in a trillion for everything to blow up in your face. If you have a 1 in a trillion chance of something going wrong, and you have 1 trillion cases then you have a 64% chance of things going wrong.

To me "almost impossible" would mean something like 1 in a million chance. I'd just call 1 in a trillion chance of something happening 'impossible' with no qualifiers. You need to be able to say it would be impossible for the probes to go wrong just to even the odds.
