If you have no preference for your own form of self replication, then sure there is no reason not to create another form of self replication that will replace you.

Your indifference between grey goo vs human civilization is probably a very unique preference, and I don't think any space agency would put you anywhere near a Von Neumann probe project if they knew you had those preferences.
