Sure we have checks and balances to make the problem negligible, but at those numbers there's almost no such thing as negligible.

I guess you could design a system with an error rate so low that even given trillions of chances to go wrong it probably won't (or will at least fail-safe), but given the possible ramifications of this going wrong you'd need to have a system with an error rate of at least < 1/100 trillion or so. And I imagine it would be pretty hard to estimate the probability of random corruption causing issues, so you'd have to include a huge safety margin of error, etc....
