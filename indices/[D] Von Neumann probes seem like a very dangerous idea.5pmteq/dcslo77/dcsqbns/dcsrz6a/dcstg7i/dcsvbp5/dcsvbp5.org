No. You do not. Error in the replication process does not magically make your probes more capable, except via the evolutionary process, which is what you wish to avoid, nor is the resource expenditure on multiple memory media likely to make any difference whatsoever, given the density of memory media.

You do not have to proof it against intelligent sabotage - anyone that can mess with a replicating probe can also build their own, so this is not a vulnerability that actually adds any hazard. Any intelligence's inclined to turn your probe into something else already /have/ a probe that is that something else, and as for other conditions - natural law is universal, and everyplace should have rocks floating in vacuum at least somewhere nearby. Your probes may need to /investigate/ all kinds of exotic locales. They don't have to reproduce, let alone successfully in all of them.
