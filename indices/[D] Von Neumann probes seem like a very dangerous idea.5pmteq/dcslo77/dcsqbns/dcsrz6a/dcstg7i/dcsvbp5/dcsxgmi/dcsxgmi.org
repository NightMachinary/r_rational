  No. You do not. Error in the replication process does not magically make your probes more capable, except via the evolutionary process, which is what you wish to avoid, nor is the resource expenditure on multiple memory media likely to make any difference whatsoever, given the density of memory media.

You are creating a selection effect as soon as you have probes turning themselves off if their internal systems deem them too dangerous to replicate. Your probes will self select themselves for for anything that winds up producing more probes. I don't understand how this is even a controversial point. And it could be a large number of things that causes more probes to be produced.

  You do not have to proof it against intelligent sabotage - anyone that can mess with a replicating probe can also build their own, so this is not a vulnerability that actually adds any hazard. Any intelligence's inclined to turn your probe into something else already have a probe that is that something else, and as for other conditions - natural law is universal, and everyplace should have rocks floating in vacuum at least somewhere nearby. Your probes may need to investigate all kinds of exotic locales. They don't have to reproduce, let alone successfully in all of them.

There is an easy proof against this: our current civilization. We aren't capable of building Von Neumann probes, but I have no doubt that if we found one we could screw with it in ways that are non-random and potentially dangerous.
