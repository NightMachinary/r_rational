  Seriously, you overestimate the universality and power of evolution.

My argument relies on the fact that any self replicating entity is subject to the laws of evolution. But the real meat of my argument is that there are 1 trillion chances for this thing to go wrong. And unless you drastically improve space travel (in which case why use Von Neumann probes?) then each of those 1 trillion chances is going to have a 1000-5000 year time span from when it was created to when it reproduces. So every one of these probes is going to spend a couple thousand years being bathed in cosmic radiation which can flip random bits of memory one way or the other. Oh and if you want timelines of only a couple thousand years of travel then your probe will be going fast enough that a micron sized particle floating around in space will have enough power to punch a hole straight through your probe.

Just having a probe that still functions after that long will actually be an engineering marvel. Having it function exactly as specified? That is probably a level of precision engineering that we have never achieved as humans.

And if you are too cautious about having your Von Neumann probes reproduce then they will just die out, and the whole program will be pointless.
