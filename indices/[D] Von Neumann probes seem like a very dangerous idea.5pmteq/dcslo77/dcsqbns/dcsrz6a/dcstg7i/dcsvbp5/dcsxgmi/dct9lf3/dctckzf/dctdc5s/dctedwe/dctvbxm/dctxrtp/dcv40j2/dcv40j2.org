  Why not just build a million probes that don't self replicate and explore all your nearby stars with none of the risk and just about all the same benefits? Do you really need to send probes to every corner of the galaxy, and is settling for only a couple million solar systems to start your colonization/exploration really so terrible?

How are you planning to scale up the manufacturing of probes to that degree without self replication?
