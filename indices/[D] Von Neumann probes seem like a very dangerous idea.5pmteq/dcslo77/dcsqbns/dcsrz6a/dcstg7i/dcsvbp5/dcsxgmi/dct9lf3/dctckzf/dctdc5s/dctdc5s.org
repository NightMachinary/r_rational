A trillion is a astonishingly small number in this context. Four seperate memories checking each other means that a bit has to be flipped in all of them /at the same time/. The same bit. And since this system also does all the usual parity checks, that isn't enough, random chance has to hit the same two or three bits in 4 separate memory systems. At the same time. Because if the errors are separated in time, the standard crosschecks will restore the outlier to consensus, if necessary by fabricating a new "hard-drive" (memory diamond, whatever). This will not happen by accident before the end of time. And doing this isn't paranoid design, that will keep the probe from reproducing - it makes it many times more likely to be able to execute it's job because it means it has a correct blue-print to work with come hell or high water. Most mutations are non-viable, so this /increases/ the odds of any given probe successfully replicating.
