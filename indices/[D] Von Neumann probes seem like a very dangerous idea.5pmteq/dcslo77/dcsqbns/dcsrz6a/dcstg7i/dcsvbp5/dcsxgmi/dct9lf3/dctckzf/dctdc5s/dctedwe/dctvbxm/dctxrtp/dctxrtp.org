  Look, I'd recommend sitting down and actually working out how an error-correction system for self-replicating probes might work before making (incorrect) claims about ways in which such a system can fail. None of the concerns you raised are anywhere close to being general enough to count as legitimate issues, seeing as it took me about fifteen minutes in total to come up with either a refutation of your point or a workaround. Anyone could have come up with those--including yourself. There's a worrying trend I see online, wherein people seem more and more content to simply point out (what they think is) an object-level criticism, without immediately going one level higher and asking themselves, "Well, before I post this complaint, how can it plausibly be addressed?" This is a habit of thought that, ideally, should be the default, and it's something that is completely lacking in your comments.

Look, I work in the software industry. I see shitty code on a regular basis. I know there are ways to be careful and guarantee your code works. NASA is even one of the few coding organizations that is actually really good about producing quality code.

Even relatively simple websites can have codebases that spiral out of control in complexity and become quickly impossible for a single human or even a group of humans to understand. You are right, I don't know what the probe will look like. But I can be pretty sure it will be more complex then a website.

Because of these reasons I think building a probe that is successful (able to reproduce other probes), safe (won't somehow go out of control and produce too many probes), and effective (will do whatever we want it to do at the places it goes to) will be an engineering marvel.

It sounds like a lot of hubris to me to say "yeah we can definitely construct a probe that will never malfunction in a dangerous way, and we can do it perfectly 1 trillion times, and each probe will be able to last thousands or tens of thousands of years without any problems."

I don't think its impossible for humans or some alien species to succeed at this, but its dangerous. Because if they fuck up the consequence is basically creating a grey goo scenario for an entire galaxy.

Its a high risk, high upfront effort (developing your perfectly safe self replicating probe), and probably low payoff. Why not just build a million probes that don't self replicate and explore all your nearby stars with none of the risk and just about all the same benefits? Do you really need to send probes to every corner of the galaxy, and is settling for only a couple million solar systems to start your colonization/exploration really so terrible?
