You are creating a- strong selective pressure in a very specific and known direction: That is, only probes that are exactly like the original reproduce. Seriously, you overestimate the universality and power of evolution. An imperfect replicator will radiate into a multitude of new forms - that's correct, which is why anyone that builds such a device capable of operating on space rocks will deserve the extinction that happens to them. But a blueprint encoded in an redundantly error-checking format can be replicated without error until the final heat-death of the universe. That is -the chain may be broken, the data erased, but it will never be /corrupted/ - and thus, there is no opening here for evolution to happen at all. If the code says to make one copy per star system and then sit, selfrepair and observe until the end of the life of that star and then suicide, the probes will do so.
