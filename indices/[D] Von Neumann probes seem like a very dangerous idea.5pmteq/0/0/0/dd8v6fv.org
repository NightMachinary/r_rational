Just as easy as making a probe that uses whatever material to replicate would be making a probe that uses material selectively, you know. It would also be possible to make machines that preferentially replicate by disassembling out of control self replicators.

There is also the opportunity for safety features like parent probes checking their children for errors and repairing or destroying them if necessary.
