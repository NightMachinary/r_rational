I can't see how there isn't a selection effect.

You send out 10 Von Neumann probes. Half of them stay healthy and 'reproduce' passing on their healthy systems to their 'offspring'. The other half encounter errors. 4 of the 5 that encounter errors have an effect that makes them less fit or completely unable to reproduce. Those 4 lines disappear. The 5th one has a random error that causes its communication systems to fail, so it can now send probes to systems that have already been explored. This is a huge jump in fitness compared to the 5 healthy probes which have to send their probes to unexplored systems.

There is a selection effect against probes that can self diagnose errors and shut themselves down, and a selection effect against probes that do not re-explore the same solar systems as other probes.

The probe doesn't have to take advantage of some exotic laws of physics, it just has to have a bug or error in the part of the probe that tells it to stop reproducing when its job is done.

Remember fitness is a function of how fit an organism is to reproduce. A sterile body builder is less fit in an evolutionary sense than a a vial of reproductive fluid.
