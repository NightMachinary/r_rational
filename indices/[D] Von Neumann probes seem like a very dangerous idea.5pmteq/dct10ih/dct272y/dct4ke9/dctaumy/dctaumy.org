  but what I'm debating about is how easy such an error can occur.
#+end_quote

It sounded like you were debating whether there was a selection effect, specifically when you said this:

#+begin_quote
  Selection - The less fit offsprings will die out. Not Check! All probes will be making more of themselves, and there is very few factors to 'weed' out the unfit probes. Maybe reproduction speed will play a role, but by the time we have a theoretical probe which is better than the existing probe, we'll already have (at least) millions of the original design still spreading. While speed plays a role, there isn't anything to eliminate the 'inferior' versions if it's still capable of spreading.
#+end_quote

I'm assuming since you didn't debate me on those points you accept them.

So that means evolution requires more than you list above. In addition to *Reproduction, Heredity, Selection, and Variable Fitness* you also say there is a need for mutation.

And I should be clear on this point: evolution does not require that mutations be beneficial in general, it just requires that mutations happen. Biological evolution mostly has fitness reducing mutations. All that matters is that sometimes it has fitness enhancing mutations.

All that you are really arguing is that the mutation rate will be low enough that we won't have to worry. And my response to that is to remind you that we are talking about 1 trillion stars in the milky way galaxy, and possibly hundreds of trillions of celestial bodies that a probe might be able to visit. Those numbers you give of 1% chance with 6 separate steps. Its actually exactly a 1 in a trillion chance of all those 1% things happening. I did the math elsewhere in this thread but with 1 trillion attempts at a 1 in a trillion chance there is a 64% chance that the thing will happen. And that is playing unfavorably with my numbers. Because one of the errors that might happen is that one of those 6 separate steps starts getting skipped. And when I refer back to the danger of mutation and selection earlier this is what I'm referencing. A probe that only has to pass 5 tests is more fit to reproduce then a probe that has to pass 6 tests.

Let me ask you some separate but related questions:

1. Do you think it is possibly to build an unhackable probe. Unhackable in the sense that an intelligent agent knowing everything about the probe could not alter it in any series of steps that would cause a grey goo scenario?
2. Your banking software is launched into outer space. It must continously operate for 1000s of years in the harsh radiation environment of space, and then at the end of 1000 years it must copy itself into a new physical medium. A physical medium that your banking software created with the same code that needed to be running perfectly for 1000's of years. Do you still trust that banking software with your money? If yes, how many iterations of this process before you don't trust your banking software (100 iterations, a million iteration, a trillion iterations, a trillion trillion iterations)?
3. Do you worry about other existential risk problems like GAI?
