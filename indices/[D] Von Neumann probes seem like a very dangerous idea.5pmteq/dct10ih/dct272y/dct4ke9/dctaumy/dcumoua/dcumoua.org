Okay, I was a little tired when I made my earlier reply so I apologize if I sound like I was switching topics from whether or not there is evolution to talking about errors. Furthermore you seem to believe that I don't care or believe the Von Neumann probes are a serious threat. What I was trying to argue is a solution to the hypothetical problem, not that there isn't a problem.

I agree it's a bad idea, but I believe it's one we can cautiously work with rather than an idea which is so dangerous that we shouldn't do it at all.

Just to reiterate, the basis of my argument boils down to saying evolution requires beneficial mutation. I agree that evolution can theoretically act on the probes and cause selection pressures which result in a grey goo scenario. However, what I'm trying to say is that such an outcome can be planned for and prevented from occurring.

The idea of multiple tests was a bad one, so let me try a different tack.

I believe it's possible to design the probes to make evolution difficult to occur. I'm imagining that we can design the probes in such a way that any minor change results in failure of the probe rather than a modified version.

The way DNA is designed, it often results in a viable life form because the 'space' of life is dense aka all life has very similar DNA.

We can create the design/code of the probes that any minor change (or even major ones) results in absolute failure. With a 'fragile' design, we don't have to worry about competing strains.

  Do you think it is possibly to build an unhackable probe. Unhackable in the sense that an intelligent agent knowing everything about the probe could not alter it in any series of steps that would cause a grey goo scenario?

I'm not sure. This question is a little too vague for me. It depends on how the agent can interface with it as well as how smart it is. If it has very few options to deal with the probe, then the probe can be unhackable. But if the agent is extremely intelligent and it can put the probe on a workshop table and use any tools it desires for as long as it wishes, then I don't believe the probe is unhackable. However evolution is not intelligent, so I believe we can make the probe unhackable to evolution.

  Your banking software is launched into outer space. It must continuously operate for 1000s of years in the harsh radiation environment of space, and then at the end of 1000 years it must copy itself into a new physical medium. A physical medium that your banking software created with the same code that needed to be running perfectly for 1000's of years. Do you still trust that banking software with your money? If yes, how many iterations of this process before you don't trust your banking software (100 iterations, a million iteration, a trillion iterations, a trillion trillion iterations)?

First off, I definitely believe that such a banking system can theoretically exist. The question then boils down to how I can verify a given banking system to be as good as the theoretical version. I would want to see explanations for how it can survive the harsh radiation and what sort of precautions it would take against errors such as redundancies, prevention, and so on. It would take a lot of pre-testing and research before I would trust such a system. But if I need to store my money somewhere for a long time and I can't check on it in the meantime, then I would trust the banking system.

  Do you worry about other existential risk problems like GAI?

Yes.
