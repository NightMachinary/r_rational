Yes that's correct, but what I'm debating about is how easily such an error can occur. If we build in redundancies and self-correcting mechanisms, errors become very unlikely.

However, let's say there are so many probes that even unlikely errors do appear. The code can be structured in such a way that there needs to be multiple steps to permit the creation of more probes. If the odds of an error for each step is 1%, then just by requiring 6 separate steps to allow for unlimited replication the odds drop below 1 trillion.

Evolution doesn't rely only on errors/mutations. It needs /useful/ mutations that can appear with only a small change.
