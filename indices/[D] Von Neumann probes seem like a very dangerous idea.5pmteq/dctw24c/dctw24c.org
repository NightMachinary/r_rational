I wouldn't really worry about that. In the 100 years it takes the probe to get to Alpha Centauri, our technology will have advanced to be /far/ better so that any probes we send out later will be much better at replicating and outcompeting, and we'll be spreading a lot more of them to other worlds, and we have the much larger industry, if it comes to war we'll win. And the thing about these probes is that any planet with a global net to catch arriving probes will have no problem getting rid of them, and we'll probably have that technology before the probes ever get to another planet, much less cover the planet and get back to us.

As an analogy, worrying about these probes is like worrying that compound growth in the stock market is going to make a regular person richer than the rest of the world combined. No, the rest of the world's wealth is growing at the same pace (and often at a faster pace).
