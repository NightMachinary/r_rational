Encrypt the code. If it messes up a bit while copying, then when it tries to decrypt it it will get gibberish. And store the encrypted and decrypted code in very different ways, so there's no way it can accidentally copy the decrypted code.

I think the bigger problem is something more intentional. Say you want a way to reprogram the robots after they're built. Then they can be reprogrammed by a hacker.
