I think its a question of sufficient close sentient oversight:

1) In the solar system (target is asteroids and comets), we can relatively easily keep an eye out, even keep some non-replicating killer bots on hand if something goes wrong, alongside other contingency plans

2) Not-near-breathing-humans: In these cases, I think that the concerns you raise apply, for sufficient oversight I think you might need the genie of strong AI, or of downloaded human consciousness...
