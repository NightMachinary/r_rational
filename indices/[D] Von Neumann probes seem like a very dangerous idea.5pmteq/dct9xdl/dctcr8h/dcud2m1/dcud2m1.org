I don't envision constant moment-to-moment monitoring for every single probe - for the in-system oversight, a system of inspectors, even a mostly automated one, would probably be sufficient.

For the interstellar application, have the onboard personality wake up on some schedule, and have some system of checking up on nearby probes.
