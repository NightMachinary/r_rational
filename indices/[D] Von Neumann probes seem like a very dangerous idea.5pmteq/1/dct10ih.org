You seem to have the idea that any error in the code whatsoever will eventually lead to variation in the probes. Then the variation will allow for evolutionary pressures to take effect, resulting in wildly divergent probes including ones akin to a "grey goo" scenario.

The flaw I think you have in your reasoning is that not all replication permits evolutionary processes. There are multiple requirements:

- Reproduction - The organism can create another alike itself. This is the whole premise of the Von Neumann. Check!

- Heredity - The offspring resembles the parent. It is desired for the probe to be identical to the parent. Check!

- Selection - The less fit offsprings will die out. Not Check! All probes will be making more of themselves, and there is very few factors to 'weed' out the unfit probes. Maybe reproduction speed will play a role, but by the time we have a theoretical probe which is better than the existing probe, we'll already have (at least) millions of the original design still spreading. While speed plays a role, there isn't anything to eliminate the 'inferior' versions if it's still capable of spreading.

- Variable Fitness - Some offsprings are better at surviving/reproducing than others. This is the main flawed assumption. You are saying that if there are any errors in the reproduction, then evolution will result. But there can only be competing strains of probes if the mutation is somehow better at spreading through space, faster at reproducing, reproduces more, or is in someway /better/ at something than the original type.

Evolution is not a magical process that generates working lifeforms out of disorder in a finger snap. It is a very gradual process which develops new adaptations with very little change between the parent and offspring. Making a probe more efficient or faster is (most likely) a very hard problem the best human minds will be trying to solve. Complex adaptations which do something outrageous like taking advantage of unknown laws of physics or warp gravity to travel faster can't spontaneously appear out of nowhere since it will require multiple adaptations which in the process will likely be a detriment to reproduction.

Sexual reproduction is an evolutionary strategy to /speed/ up evolution and it still takes hundreds of generations for even the most minor adaptations to spread. The probes will be more similar to asexually reproducing species which are hundreds of times slower at evolving. Furthermore, the probes will take centuries to millennia per 'generation' traveling between stars.

Any variability in the probes will overwhelmingly be more likely to be a detriment or be meaningless.

Finally, this is something that can be tested beforehand, via computer simulations by deliberately introducing errors to the code and see what viable results can occur. Then we can introduce self-correcting redundancies to parts of the code most likely to go wrong as well as general error-checking mechanisms to prevent the errors in the first place.

TL:DR - Evolution requires very minor errors which can lead to numerous viable mutations. Evolution is a process which in this case is already unlikely and we can prevent it to arbitrarily close to zero likelihoods.

Sorry for having such a long post. I kept coming up with more to say!
