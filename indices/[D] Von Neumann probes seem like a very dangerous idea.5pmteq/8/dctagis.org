Load the probes with a governing AI that manages the replication. Or better yet, load the probes with uploaded minds /and/ AI. Although at that point, the line between "probes" and "colonizing starships" starts to blur.

I'm pretty sure any self-respecting civilization would at least load a governing intelligence to prevent such a scenario as you described, and it wouldn't even be that hard once they have the tech to create such probes.

Plus, they may have other duties besides exploring. Seeding the galaxy with life, preparing planets for colonization, contacting and uplifting other species, scientific research, etc. Why send out multiple probes to do each thing when you can send out one that can do all?

A good way to reduce malevolent variation is to send the probes out in "swarms". Packs of a dozen or hundred each, that would check themselves and each other for discrepancies. The chance that a majority of them will experience an error that is both malevolent /and/ prevents error-correction rapidly approaches zero the more probes there are in a pack.
