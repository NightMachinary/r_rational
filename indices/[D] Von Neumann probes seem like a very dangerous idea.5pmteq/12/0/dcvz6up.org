I have not read it. Its in my general area of interest, so I might read it in the future. I think you might have left out a words, but I think this is an offer for a free version of the book, sorry if that interpretation is wrong. If it is an offer, thank you, but I need to politely decline. I make it a habit to buy any entertainment media I am interested in, even if the effect is small I like to encourage and support the creators of anything I am interested in.

Are you the author?
