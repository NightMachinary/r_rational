From Perenelle's perspective, in chronological order: She experiments with the stone a bit to find more about its properties. Realizes Cadmus is still alive and has the Elder Wand, goes to him and ambushes him, taking the Wand. The wand then suggests to her how she could defeat Baba Yaga, and so she goes to Hogwarts.

From the perspective of Ignotus' ghost, he's watching Nell's fight with Baba Yaga at the same time as her fight with Hermione a few centuries later.
