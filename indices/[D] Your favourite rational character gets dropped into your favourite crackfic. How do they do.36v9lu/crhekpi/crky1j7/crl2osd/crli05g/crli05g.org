Sounds cool! I'd read it, especially the second version.

I've got a half-written recursive fanfic on my hard drive, in which a Sakura in a world much like our own is contacted and introduced to the wide multiverse of Sakuras. She realizes that a version of herself brought up as a child soldier, granted crazy amounts of power, with multiple histories of severe psychological torture, and the moral decay natural to spending the majority of your life in time loops with no consequences - and decides that no, she doesn't actually want to allow SuperSakura a lot of influence in her reality.
