I would fully support doing the next gen kiddies (altered sanely, of course) as the focus of a sequel. Maybe even keep one of them as local-Sakura's kid. Remember, Salad's mom isn't a demi-god herself, but she would have gotten the skills dump from meta-Sakura. And local-Sasuke could still be Salad's absentee father, because fuck the set of all Sasukes everywhere.

Drop one or more of the kiddies into the ongoing meta-loop along with the adults, but not in direct contact with them. Start with Salad going off to find her father and dying almost immediately to a mysterious foe. And then again. And again. And again. She thinks the key to ending the loop is finding her father. Remember, she's cursed already, so she's making some bad decisions. She's also already awakened her eyes' first level, which is a Bad Thing.

I think dropping three or four of the kids into the same loop-zone would be a good change from the original, too. Just have the big scary three as background godlings in the metaverse and their local copies as slightly better off canon versions. Would take a little while to work out the butterfly effect of Sakura not sucking during the Chuunin exam, but it should make everything work out better for her to literally have her own deity looking over her shoulder.

The canon ninja war likely wouldn't even have happened with a competent and literally blessed Sakura helping keep Sasuke from going evil, but that doesn't mean the curse on the world is lifted. The big bad is the still ongoing fight with the forces of evil, of course. Something little ninjalings can't really fight off. And you'd get a chance to have them run into the super trio every once and a while, as they are dimension hopping themselves, putting out fires and trying to use the loop to find more answers.

I think this makes breaking the Uchiha eyes demon curse the overall goal, and "big bad" for the story being the demon realm itself.
