The thing is that you can get a C&D regarding your fanfiction even if you didn't earn a single cent and didn't intent to earn any money either. It's just that most IP holders don't care to go through the hassle of sending out C&D notices and/or following through with them when it comes to mere non-commercial fanfictions. Only most though. There have definitely been cases in which IP holders successfully stopped instances of fanfiction.
