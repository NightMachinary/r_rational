  Prostitutes do this all the time; the john pays for "time", not for the actual sex, but there's an understanding between the two that sex will be involved.

Close analogy, but what we're really talking about is (the arts equivalent of) a /sugar daddy/ relationship---the sex and the money are exchanged on different time-scales, rather than as a 1:1 transaction. I've never actually heard of someone being pursued for participating in such an arrangement.

And yes, I didn't quite mean "is this legal" so much as "is this able to escape notice by being seemingly above-board to the relevant parties, such that companies with a history of pursuing IP claims don't bother to pursue people who are infringing in such a manner."
