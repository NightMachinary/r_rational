Alternate thought: is it alright to /heavily suggest/ donating to your Patreon account, by outright stating that those donations will directly translate into you writing more IP-infringing works?

In that case, you're not making money /from the works/; you're being given gifts to go on being you, and you are a person who happens to make those works.

I'm pretty sure that as long as you /don't/ outright state the connection, everything's good, especially if there's other creative outputs the you have besides the IP-infringing work. The key question is whether you can actually say out loud "if I get sufficient donations, I will /be able to/ continue work on [IP-infringing thing X]", or whether that has to remain implicit.
