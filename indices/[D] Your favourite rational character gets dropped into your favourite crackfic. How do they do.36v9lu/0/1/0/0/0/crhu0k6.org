  The Obliviation Problem had been troubling Hermione for a long time. In short, it was possible for a wizard to do whatever they liked to a muggle without regard for things like consent or ethics, and then erase all their memories of it after the fact. This made it nearly impossible to realize there had been a crime at all. Under the old regime, the response had simply been to shrug and say that these things happened, with the unspoken agreement being that it was practically a victimless crime. Hermione had reformed the Department of Memory Modification over the course of three months (/Hermione Granger and the Amnesia Codex/), but that left every other wizard on the planet to deal with, and the only real stride that had been made towards stopping the problem had been letting everyone know that Hermione Granger took that kind of thing seriously. Eradication of anti-muggle crime seemed impossible short of panopticon surveillance or making every wizard take an Unbreakable Vow, neither of which were currently practical.

The "we're doing this for the good of everyone" line is what I would expect out of the wizarding department of public relations. The real reason that memory erasure is legal is that muggles have very few rights in wizarding society (which was the case in /HPMOR/ as well).

And even if you break the Statute at great risk to yourself, wizards are still in charge. They have all of the power and the will to use it for their own ends. If you're Lex Luthor, are you going to trust a handful of quasi-medieval people led by a trio of seventeen-year-olds with nearly infinite power? Especially given how they've acted up to that point?

(And add to this the fact that Lex is working with incomplete information, almost by necessity.)

Edit: If you want, the alternate ending is, "By the time summer had rolled around, Lex Luthor had secured a position as Defense Professor at Hogwarts."
