The epilogue is written as though it's the culmination of six or seven books. The titles of these "missing" books are:

- Harry Potter and the Wayward Scion
- Harry Potter and the Prophecy Engine
- Harry Potter and the Faithful Servant
- Hermione Granger and the Amnesia Codex
- Tracey Davis and the Double Witches
- Draco Malfoy and the Nighttime Menagerie

All things that I would have liked to explore, if I had infinite time to write things. In-universe, these are all written by Luna Lovegood. (Also, I thought it was funny.)
