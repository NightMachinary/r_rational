Seems to me that Lex Luthor, going by his characterization in The Metropolitan Man, would find it impossible to countenance the existence of a magical world of which he is not fully in charge of. He would be as horrified by the potential of the international magical community to destroy or dominate the world as he is of Superman. If he can't rule mages, he would likely seek to eliminate them.
