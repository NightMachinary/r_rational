ohh difficult! I would go with tom.. I mean Harry Potter-Evans-Verres. the fic is harder as there is a tie among [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][make a wish]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/YetAgain][Yet again with a little extra help]], and familiar of zero replacing fanfics. How does it go? hmmm while trying to free Dumbledore from the mirror. harry on his 6Â° year discovers the secret for /true/ horcrux 1.0 (sacrifice free!) and creating a couple bodies imprinted with his personality with the P-stone he sends 'living' probes to the words within. in the first Mr black's (aka harry) identity is discovered by HPEV playing 10 questions early on, but decides to tag along while scared of an active voldemort. he eventually notices the differences with his voldie and helps local harry curbstomp him. magitec utopia in 22 yrs. in the second the Oogakari are frankly impressed by Drone!HPEV and tell him that they expect him in the heroes/divine beings meetings they organize regularly but this is /their/ crackfic thankyouverymuch. in the zero no tsukaima fic, Louise successfully kisses and brands drone!harry as her familiar to witch he responds with "Hey! no kissing!" big amounts of curbstomp follow as Hharry shares his worldview and knowledge with Louise while avada kedabring or oblibiating obstacles as needed. magical egalitarian utopia in 50yrs
