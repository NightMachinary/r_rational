How crack does the crackfic need to be? And can I use my own stuff (and is it wrong that my own stuff is my favorite, since it is /exactly/ calibrated to my tastes)? Screw it, I'll do it anyway. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Lex Luthor from Metropolitan Man]] gets dumped into [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zakjx/spoilers_all_a_crackslash_epilogue/][my crack/slash epilogue of HPMOR]].

Lex Luthor is sucked through a portal, and ends up in the far-off future of the year 1991. The world is a new and confusing place; technologies that were theoretical in the 1930s are now the sort of thing that only old people use. Lex has been deprived of his vast fortune, his invaluable assistant Mercy Graves, and the bulk of his knowledge is out-of-date. He goes to the library to find information on what's happened, and finds that the entire world is not what he remembered it to be. There is no Metropolis; New York City has taken its place. Lex greedily searches out references to Superman, only to find that in this universe, Superman is a fiction, as is Luthor himself.

He spends the next few months trying to rebuild his knowledge and his wealth; identification has become much more difficult in this new era, and knowledge is the domain of specialists rather than the generalist that Lex had always seen himself as. He's intelligent though, and driven by the desire to understand the gulf between the universe he'd been in and this new one. He takes over one business, and then another; the technologies have changed, but the backroom deals and pressure tactics largely have not, given that people are still people. There are exciting things happening in the world of financial securities, and over the course of seven years, he propels himself to the top.

Still, there's something missing. There's no big problem to be solved; there are no aliens here. The very laws of physics seem to be different, as they would never permit something like krypto particles. Lex reads the comic books, and they make his past life seem foolish. The accumulation of power seems pointless; it has nothing on the importance of saving the world from Superman. All that changes in 1998 when Lex falls ill with lung cancer.

He makes a study of his disease. He learns everything there is to know about it. He brings in the best specialists, and oversees new and exciting research. None of it does much more than slow the progression. His comic book counter-part died of cancer, and Lex wonders if this is a joke the universe is playing on him. Then one day, he makes a miraculous recovery.

Lex does not believe in miracles.

His people want him to be thankful. Instead, he's suspicious. He makes a study of spontaneous remission. He gathers logs from hospitals, under the guise of an interest in healthcare. It's natural for him to assume that his opponent -- and he already thinks of this phenomenon in those terms -- can watch him at every moment. It takes a cluster of top-of-the-line computers and complex mathematical models in order to find the pattern. The enemy is smart, his tracks have been covered, but there is still an unmistakable sign. The enemy understands statistics and how to make a pattern appear random, but the fact that the enemy is trying to accomplish his goals means that there is some leakage of information.

Lex Luthor finds his first wizard in the spring of 1998. By the time summer comes around, he is ready for war.
