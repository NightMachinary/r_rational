The question isn't "is this legal or not". It's:

- Would anyone notice?
- Would I get a cease and desist?
- Would I honor that cease and desist?
- Would they take me to court?
- Would I have to settle things with them in an arbitration process in lieu of actually reaching court?
- Would I be able to win in court?
- How much would winning cost?

Specifically with regards to "I'm not being paid for this, /wink/," that's not really a new area of the law. Prostitutes do this all the time; the john pays for "time", not for the actual sex, but there's an understanding between the two that sex will be involved. This doesn't have that good of a record as far as fooling the police or the courts, because the justice system is made up of people who are capable of the same logic.

I don't think that having a Patreon or similar up disqualifies you from writing infringing works, but I do think it has the potential to draw someone's eyes towards you, and since infringing works are already of dubious legality, it could result in a world of trouble. Remember, the "legal or not" distinction separates out into a bunch of other questions, and it's not so simple as saying "this is totally legal" because if you're going before the courts you've probably already lost (unless you win big enough to cover your legal costs).

(And again, I don't really have the interest in the first place.)
