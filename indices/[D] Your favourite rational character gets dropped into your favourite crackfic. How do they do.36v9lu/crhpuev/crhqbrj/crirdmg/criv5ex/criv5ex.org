I'm not an intellectual property lawyer, but I am an intellectual property enthusiast. Let me preface this by saying I don't really have an interest in taking this any further, which would make it a non-starter. And *tl;dr:* No, it's not "legal". But if I did want to do it ...

Legality is a tricky thing. In some alternate universe where I made a Kickstarter in order to write "Lex Luthor and the Twilight Masquerade", there are a couple of possibilities.

1. Kickstarter/Indiegogo/Gofundme shut it down right out of the gate because it violates their Terms of Service or they have the legal right to pull it. I don't know that any of those explicitly prohibit fanfic, but they could shut it down anyway with no questions asked.

2. The project gets funded, I begin writing a story/novel/novella, I get a C&D from either J.K. Rowling, Warner Brothers, or DC Entertainment (or, technically, Eliezer Yudkowsky). Either I violate the C&D and we go to court (see 4) or I stop writing. If I stop writing, the TOS of all those sites probably demands a full refund, and this resembles option 1 except for having wasted time and possibly money.

3. The project gets funded, I write the story/novel/novella, and I get a C&D. I stop hosting it on my website or anywhere else, stop all promotion of it, and never mention it again (or ignore the C&D and we go to court, see 4). It's still out in the world though, so mission accomplished, unless they want to sue me anyway, in which case, see 4.

4. I wind up in court, against a very large law firm. If I'm lucky, or happen to know someone who knows someone, I get representation from the EFF or similar. Almost certainly this would be an ideological case rather than one intended to secure earnings; court costs would almost certainly be higher than I would expect as a payout on such a niche book. The primary argument for dodging copyright:

   - The story I have written is /transformative/ in a way that has artistic merit and does some good for society. It does not diminish the originals in any way, and does not deprive the original creators of income.

   That's the whole argument. If the court buys that, then we're good, I've won the case, and I'm free to continue distribution until the inevitable appeal. If the court /doesn't/ buy that argument, we're considerably less good. The work gets taken down and out of distribution, there are legal costs, etc.

5. The project gets funded, no one sues me, we're good! Ideal scenario.

But like I said, I have no real interest in the first place, aside from all the legal issues involved.
