The entire crew of the Impossible from EY's "Three Worlds Collide" wakes up to find themselves in the world of "Shiny and Blue" a shockingly well-written, funny and heartwarming Harry/Dumbledore time travel fanfic that I read several years ago and only vaguely remember now. The wizards in the department of mysteries notice the strange fluctuations in the spacetime continuum that mark the arrival of the crew shortly after Harry arrives in the 1957, and some of them are captured under the charge of "violating the international statute of secrecy." When they're interrogated under veritaserum by representatives of the International Confederation of Wizards, it is believed by most that they are crazy and therefore unlikely to be a threat to the statute. But a few of the smarter ones, (including Tom Riddle) realize that they are muggles from a world with "magical items" but no wizards or witches, and are of course horrified, believing that the muggles of the TWC earth had somehow exterminated all of their wizards and witches, like witch burnings on a global scale, and with the "magical" weapons that these muggles had with them on their "ship" when they arrived, it was entirely plausible. He also realizes that the alternate humans have an indefinite lifespan. Fearing for the safety of wizard kind from muggles, Tom Riddle researches a bit about the muggle world, discovers nuclear weapons and the internet, and realizes that it's only a matter of time before the statute of secrecy is broken permanently, and the only way to save the wizards is to take control of all of the nuclear weapons before the muggles can use them. Harry "Crockett" and Dumbledore try to stop Tom Riddle, while the crew of the Impossible is trying to figure out what to do. They don't have a way back to their home universe. If Tom Riddle successfully takes over the world, the global quality of life for muggles and muggleborns will significantly decrease, as will the quality of muggle science, technology and education. But if Tom Riddle doesn't take over the world, then the nuclear weapons would still be a threat to wizard kind, and the crew of the impossible of course can't use the imperius curse. Meanwhile, Harry "Crockett" and Albus Dumbledore are still teaching at Hogwarts when they're not fighting Riddle/Voldemort or seeking out his horcruxes. I'm not sure how they do it, but a plan is thought up by the ex-confessor (not sure of his name) to try to figure out the key differences between this earth and their original one, and if it was possible to adapt some of the methods used for saving their home earth for the one they are now in.

Also, is it weird that I'm rather unsure whether I want to ship Akon with the ex-confessor or not? If it weren't for the centuries of age-difference, I might think they could be kind of cute together...blehh. I can't believe I just said that.

It's a surprisingly great read, and I highly recommend it. It's kind of long though.
