[[/u/datapackrat]] reminds me that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover]] is /totally/ a crack fic. And it already has the perfect scenario for dropping in a new character! Wonderful.

OK, my favorite rational character ... hmm. Probably Skitter?

OK, so we've got Skitter adventuring her way through a chain of increasingly "higher" universes, picking up companions along the way. I imagine she'd achieve godhood in a few of them, considering, um, her ability to break even the most innocuous-seeming power.

Then I guess the actual /story/ would play out much the same, albeit possibly with Kepri derailing the discussions at the end when she regains her powers.
