Ugh. Later stage, Rational Sakura from Time Braid ends up in a crossover in the otherwise pure Harry Potter story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]]. It is a porn comedy. Yeesh.

How does it go? Very well. Voldemort's main soul piece is sealed and involuntarily exits the atmosphere at high sped soon after our pink-haired super-assassin figures out the score, and Hogwarts gets much needed educational reform. At knife point. No one who's met and likes Naruto would stand for either Harry's educational or home situation. And the Magical government might suffer a few sudden reorgs. Our out of place protagonist even has a way home after.

And Harry gets even luckier, after Hermione inevitability learns a few special techniques. Of course.
