I had to reread TVTropes' entry on crack!fics to remind myself of the particulars, and... there aren't too many that I'm particularly into. About the only two I really like are EYudkowsky's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover]] and the multi-authour [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/mlp-time-loops]] . Of the two... I think I enjoy the latter more; for one thing, there's so much /more/ to enjoy.

As for my favourite (aspiring) rational character... I've got to admit that I have a certain fondness for Bunny of S.I.

So - Bunny wakes up one day in her own past (probably when she was pulled out of cryo), and gets to live the rest of life again, until she dies. And then again. And again. And then she wakes up and things are a little different; some of the talking ponies claim to have been repeating their own lives for many, many loops.

Bunny, naturally, assumes she's gone insane; but the framework described does continue to match her experiences. She has millions-or-billions of loops to look forward to while the computer running reality gets fixed. She's probably going to get crossed over into what she knows as fictional settings in some of them. Nothing she does has any lasting effect, save on herself or any loopers (or sysadmins) she meets. And she's started to get a handle on the more likely ways she can die.

"And the best thing, the very best thing of all, is there's time now... there's all the time I need and all the time I want. Time, time, time. There's time enough at last." (Her glasses break) "Oh, come /on/. Fine, I'll go hit the age zone to get my eyes replaced first thing. Maybe /this/ time I'll live long enough to find out when the Second Singularity will hit, so I'll know how long I've actually got to work with in any loop..."
