This is a great idea! Also, no offense, but considering the purpose of the site, your design is downright terrible. I mean it looks cool, but it also looks ominous. It looks like it was made by a stylish super villain. You need to change the design to something else, something professional and calming and not something that will scare people away or harm yours or the website's reputation. At least that's what I'm worried could happen if you keep the design as it is. Maybe I'm being paranoid. Aside from that, it looks great! Definitely going to participate in this! Thank you for setting this up!

Also, I think you should make the name "winning at life" and have a conway's game of life motif in your design.
