Ha! You're right, as [[/u/MoralRelativity]] stated, it is too 'dark and broody', or in your words 'looks like it was made by a stylish super villain'.

I mindlessly picked the one I liked the most between the five or so the website presented me with (perhaps my personal style is a bit super villain-y), but don't worry, I'll change it to something less intimidating, even thought I'm not sure I'll continue using this example at all.

I like the idea of naming it Winning At Life or something of the sort. It won't be exactly it, though, since there are no domains available for the name. Right now I'm also considering an idea related to the concept of a "Player Character", as in the PC among NPCs.

I am not familiar with Conway's Game of Life, and while googling it displays an interesting... well, /[[https://www.google.com.br/search?q=conway%27s+game+of+life][thing]]/, it doesn't seem like something I could give enough thought to in the moment, so I'll learn more about later and get back to you.
