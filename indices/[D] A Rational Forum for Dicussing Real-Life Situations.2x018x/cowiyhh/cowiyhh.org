I would participate.

A strong recommendation do not create subforums yet. Three reasons:

1. In the beginning there will not be enough posts to fill them. You'll have several empty subforums and the rest will have only one or two posts. It makes the sight look weak if you fragment it that much.
2. Until there's a lot of traffic there's no reason to put an extra click between people and the content they want.
3. The names of the subforums you've currently generated may not end up being the best way to divide the posts. Topics and themes will emerge organically; subforums can always be created later, once there's enough traffic on that topic to make it sensible to have a subforum.
