Chapter 2 doesn't take place on Earth, indicated with the line "constellations similar to Earth's". This alternate planet hasn't been featured before in the series, though the Lovecraftian multiverse has (going all the way back to The Atrocity Archives). The authorial intent is probably for it to be alien and confusing to the reader, a thrown-in-feet-first introduction to a society unlike our own, but how much that works for you is an open question. Stross wrote a [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2017/06/crib-sheet-the-nightmare-stack.html][crib sheet]] for the novel here, which contains spoilers, but also lays things out a little bit more clearly if you really detest the slow-roll of information.
