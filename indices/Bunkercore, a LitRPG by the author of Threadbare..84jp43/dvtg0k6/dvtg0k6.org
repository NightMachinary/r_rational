Hmm. It's not a very sensible world, or at least not one with rational technology design. I'd have to go back to imagining it to fantasy/video game world in order to get proper suspension of disbelief. As is, things like how the AI isn't allowed to freely switch between circuits as needed, how construction upgrades improve all existing construction free of charge, how building a door requires defense tech while making a rock tunnel into a neat corridor is cheap and aesthetics seem to be free all breaks me out of the story each time.
