Just letting you know, I posted a review on Amazon.

#+begin_quote
  I bought the book about three hours ago and I'm now writing a review after finishing it.

  It's an extremely fast-paced book and while I initially thought it would be too short at ~150 pages, it turned out to be the equivalent of a 500 page novel packed into a shorter book. I was sucked in by the interactions between the characters from the very first pages and I felt rage, sympathy, love, and disgust for each of the three main characters at different points of the story. Unusually, I learned more about the characters through how the others' reactions rather through the behaviors of the people themselves. I suspect it's due to how insane and bizarre their situations are that I was swept up in the flow of the story and couldn't take the time to consider my own reactions. To me, they are real deeply flawed people.

  As a warning, there are fairly gory scenes, but the real horrifying parts of the book are the descriptions of mental trauma. Fiona has managed to make being insane, amnesic, or sociopathic viscerally terrifying instead of being a clinical concern associated with the diagnosis of a mental disorder.

  Favorite parts are when Eden is striving to learn all she can about what is happening to her and using logical reasoning to work around her questionable emotional stability. Worse parts is how the story is so intensely focused on these three people. Despite an event with world-wide consequences, there is very little interaction with other people (two scenes). But that's a manner of personal preference.

  Now if only I could figure out what Veronica's secret is!

Now for a quick review tailored for this subreddit.

I'm mildly annoyed at how good the story was. I only meant to read a chapter or two, but I got sucked in and couldn't stop to do work. I'll definitely buy any sequels. Eden does act rational for the most part, the difficulty is that her goals change very rapidly at certain parts of the story, so it may seem mildly irrational when her quick decisions are giving the readers whiplash. I actually liked it though since part of rationality is making the best decisions when under pressure, particularly time pressure.

Hands down, this story redefines rational horror.

By the way, what was Veronica's secret? I know it should be very obvious, but I'm very uncertain about my guess. [[#s][Is she]]

Thanks for the story!
