I'll answer those out of order, since one flows from the other.

  What process of reasoning led to you deciding to publish by yourself?

I spent a few months in the agent query game, sending samples and letters and summaries to probably 50 agents total. ([[https://querytracker.net/][QueryTracker]] was indispensable.) All I got back was radio silence, form rejections, and two interested parties who eventually decided they weren't interested.

And I completely get it; any who open themselves to unsolicited queries are absolutely /spoiled/ for choice. There must be loads of much more marketable books coming across their desks every day.

However, based on the reader responses I've gotten (before and after publishing, from friend and stranger alike), I know my work has an audience. I'm extremely lucky to live in a time when self-publishing is not only possible, but very cheap and even easy. I've been a proofreader/copy-editor for years and know some great people in that industry (hi [[http://helpedit.com/][Yvonne]]!).

If you're ever interested in self-publishing your own work, I encourage you to check out [[http://helpedit.com/][Help Edit]] (run in part by the above-mentioned Yvonne) and [[/r/selfpublish]]. Between them, you can get everything you need to put out your work.

  After writing a book, how do you get the word out?
#+end_quote

First of all, let go of the idea of having amazing career success with just one book. Of course, every book is your baby, and you should make sure it's good and pound the pavement finding readers for it. But from everything I've seen, no one so much as /breaks even/ before their third or fourth published book. Start now, taking small steps every day (write 1666 words, proofread a chapter, move forward on publishing, send a copy to a new reviewer, etc.).

Also, while we're at it, let go of the idea of the first novel you write being the first one you publish. Loads of people do that and still find success, but in my experience, it takes a few novels before you really learn how to put together a good story and what mistakes to avoid (both plot-wise and in your writing routine). /Eden Green/ is the tenth novel I ever wrote, and the first one I felt was ready for a big audience.

Speaking of which, always keep this question in mind: 'Who is the audience for this book?' In my case, it's rationalist tropers who like internet humor and female protagonists. (This thread has been an utter delight so far.) Whatever choices you make in promotion, always keep that audience in mind. Make a list of books you like that are similar to the one you self-publish, and seek out those readers.

/Eden Green/ has only been out for only seven months, so I'm advising based on limited experience. However, here are the top three things that have brought me new readers:

1. Make sure your book has a TVTropes page. I put this off for a long time, hoping someone else would do it for me, but (even according to their own rules) it's perfectly fine to create and add to it yourself. Start out with the description and a few obvious tropes, then go in every day and add more until you literally can't find any more tropes that fit. Then (I'm at this step now) go through every day and add your book to five of those tropes' pages, so they cross-reference. This is how tropers will find your book.
2. [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/program][Put the book is on Goodreads]] and become active there (review books you like, participate in interesting group threads, etc.). Once you've established a presence, message reviewers who have liked similar books and offer them a free ebook copy of yours. (Goodreads discourages this, but I haven't seen any blowback yet.)
3. Tell people IRL about it! Have something ready that you can hand to them if they're interested, like a bookmark or business card with the cover, a plot teaser, and shortlinks to where they can find it.

I also recommend ACX, the service through which anyone can put an audiobook on Audible. I recorded my own at home, and while it was a full-time job making sure the audio quality and editing were up to standard, it was /so/ worth it for the extra income stream and the ability to say I have an audiobook version. You can also hire narrators through ACX and even pay nothing up front, instead granting them 50% of royalties.

If anyone has any further questions about self-publishing, please let me know!
