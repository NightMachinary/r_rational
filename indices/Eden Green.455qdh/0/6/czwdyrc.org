I like to buy my books on Google Play, and it makes me sad when things are only available on Kindle. This has happened a few times with self-published books posted here =(

I'm guessing there's something in Amazon's contract that prevents people from cross-posting to competing services? I'd rather buy your book than get a free copy, but I don't like supporting those kind of business models.

Do you have a way to just receive cash (paypal, google wallet, patreon)? Or a buy/download site like the one EY posted recently for his mini ebook?
