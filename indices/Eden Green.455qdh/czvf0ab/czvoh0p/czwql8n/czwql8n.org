That review is /amazing./ I read it aloud to a bunch of friends today and we were just dying, especially 'I'm mildly annoyed at how good the story was'. I might use 'Hands down, this story redefines rational horror.' as a cover blurb at some point. Thank you so much!

If you're interested in sequels and haven't signed up already (sorry, this thread and my inbox have exploded, so it's hard to keep track), [[http://homework.never-ends.net/newsletter/][I have a newsletter]].

[[/u/Transfuturist]] has it right; in canon, Veronica is [[#s][]]

I really hope some of the things I say here end up on the TVTropes page as Word of God.
