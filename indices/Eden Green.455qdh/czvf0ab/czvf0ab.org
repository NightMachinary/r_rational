Wow, I'm flattered! There was actually a past thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yf55g/rtrst_scifihorror_novel_eden_green/][here]], where I asked about whether it qualifies as 'rational' fiction (consensus was yes). I can't wait to see the new discussions that take place here!

If any rationalists would like a free ebook copy or an Audible code, please PM me and mention this thread. There's a print version coming soon; if you'd rather wait until you can buy that, I have a newsletter on the above page where you can sign up for ~monthly updates.

If anyone here already read it and enjoyed it, I'd really /really/ appreciate it if you posted a review on [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26058753-eden-green][Goodreads]] and/or [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010ON836U/][Amazon]]!

AMA about the book, writing, tropes, self-publishing, etc!
