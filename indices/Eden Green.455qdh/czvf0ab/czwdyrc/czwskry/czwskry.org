  I'm guessing there's something in Amazon's contract that prevents people from cross-posting to competing services?

You're half-right. /Eden Green/ is currently enrolled in Kindle Direct Publishing's (KDP's) 'Kindle Select' program, which allows things like giveaways and countdown promotions. Part of this involves agreeing to keep it exclusive to Amazon.

That said, I'm extremely underwhelmed with Kindle Select. One of the promised benefits, enrollment in Kindle Unlimited (which allows certain members to read the book for free, a good promotional tool) /has never worked with this book./ I've emailed back and forth with KDP support for /months/ and received zero explanation for why. My day job is in customer service, and it goes without saying that I'd be in big trouble if I let that happen to a customer.

The book's current enrollment in Kindle Select ends sometime this month, at which point I fully intend to 'go wide' and post the book on as many services as Draft2Digital will allow. This unfortunately [[https://draft2digital.com/steps/][doesn't include Google Play]].

If you'd like to support my writing and other projects, [[https://www.patreon.com/fekketcantenel?ty=h][I have a Patreon]]. If you'd rather stick to this one-time purchase, please drop me a PM and we can discuss using Paypal. Of course, you're welcome to a free ebook copy or Audible gift, but I understand (and appreciate!) that some folks really want to support indie authors.
