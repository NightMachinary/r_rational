We seem to be halfway through finding out whats actually going on and what the different characters really want, though.

- The High-Father wants humanity to destroy itself using the power he gave them

- Nic, the being Nic met a few chapters ago, and Roke all want to stop him

- Dizzy basically wants to be Atlas

- Simole wants to live an enjoyable life whilst supporting Nic and Dizzy

- The Gweur rebels want to overthrow the Ranvar hegemony and for some reason see Nic as the leader (probably related to the Librarian or Roke)

- Fanny wants breakfast
