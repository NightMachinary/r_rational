I disagree. The style of the story is surrealist, but the core of it is pure rationality. To borrow from the sidebar - It is 100% about intelligent characters solving problems through application of knowledge, examining goals and motivations, with intellectual pay-offs, and improving their meta-level thinking capabilities, in a fictional world with consistent rules (even if those rules are intentionally surrealist).

Conversations have characters with consistent mentalities, employing mental models of other characters. One side will be lying about reality to the other and trying to make the other believe things, and while also revealing knowledge about themselves. /In theory/, every well writter work is like this, but this is one of the few that truly requires it to have even a baseline understanding of what's going on.
