I think you hit it on the nose when you called it surrealist. Surrealism and rationalism seem antithetical to me.

#+begin_quote
  It is 100% about intelligent characters solving problems through application of knowledge, examining goals and motivations, with intellectual pay-offs, and improving their meta-level thinking capabilities, in a fictional world with consistent rules (even if those rules are intentionally surrealist).
#+end_quote

There has been a couple of intellectual payoffs (rules lawyering, mostly) but nothing that I would consider meaningful for the plot or for character development. Problems aren't being solved, as far as I can tell. (Or if they are being solved but I just I haven't been able to tell, that's also a problem.)

You can't argue that the world has consistent rules when we don't have any actual knowledge of the magic system. If everything's up for grabs, then nothing's inconsistent.

It would go a long way if the author made everything less mysterious... If we could actually see if someone's ideas are proven right or wrong, or if someone's plans succeed or fail. From a rational perspective, I want to see characters who act rationally -- I can't see that if I don't know what they're thinking (Nic keeps hinting that he is doing things for reasons but we don't know what those reasons are, nor do his actions really make sense from what information we've been given. We also aren't inside any of the antagonists' [if they are antagonists] heads.)
