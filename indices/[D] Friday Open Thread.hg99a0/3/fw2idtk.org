Hey, can anyone point me to the origin of the maxim which goes something like "Every device can be defeated by a device which is less powerful, but more specialized"? Searching in Google or on TV tropes (i/h) has failed me, but I think I might have seen this here.

The context is that I wanted to mention somewhere that Good Judgment Open (a prestigious forecasting tournament) didn't see the Zarda v. Altitude Inc. Supreme Court decision coming, but FantasySCOTUS (a lesser-known and less prestigious site) did, so I'm left wondering.
