I'm almost finished with my next project, which I'll say is a collection of non-fiction stories and essays in the style of David Sedaris or Mark Twain.

I want to sell it for money. What's a good place to self-publish a digital book? Amazon is tempting, but my problem is that I want people to be able to have the book without paying for it if they don't want to or can't.

It's not for altruistic reasons. I have been to websites where people put free art up and have a little donation button in the corner, and I almost never give them money. But multiple times I remember downloading an album or game from an artist's website and a box coming up and telling me that the album was several dollars, but if I didn't want to pay for it I could have it for free.

This is exactly what I'm looking for. The idea makes me feel powerful. I would be giving my work away for free while also establishing that it's clearly good enough to charge money for, which makes anyone who doesn't cough something up seem that much greedier. I don't think I can pay my rent with internet guilt but I am willing to try at this point.
