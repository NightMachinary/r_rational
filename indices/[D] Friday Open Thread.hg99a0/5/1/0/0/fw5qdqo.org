Being able to fully model the behavior of an outgroup makes it harder to kill them for the benefit of your tribe. It is also less important to model individuals of the outgroup than it is to model their general behavior and the behavior of a large group of them gathered together, in which case erring on the case of caution and expecting the worst is conductive both to not losing stuff to the outgroup and to motivating you to combat them.
