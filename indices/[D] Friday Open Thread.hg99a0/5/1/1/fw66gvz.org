I will defends "Theory of Mind" as appropriate in this case, as the failure really is about '[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#False-belief_task][False Belief Tasks]]'

Most policy arguments come down to an interaction of (perceived) facts and values.

For instance "(empirical claim) I believe that mandating masks will significantly rescue the spread of Covid versus not having a law" + "(value claim) Saving X people is worth adding Y legal restriction" -> "I believe we should have a law"

Then, when I see someone disagree with my conclusion, it's because they're either working from different facts, or value the tradeoffs differently.

It's /profoundly/ common for people to not understand or consider the "false beliefs" possibility and just assume that there is a value difference.

In the above example that looks like me saying "Why would they put their stupid ideas about freedom above the million lives that mass will save!"

In contrast, the person could share my exact values on lives:restrictions, but not think that a /mandate/ will do much above just asking people to wear masks.

(NB: I'm not taking a position on covid policy, it's just a clear example)
