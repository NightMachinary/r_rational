I've only encountered "theory of mind" in the context of child development, where it means a pretty bare-bones version of the ability to understand that people have different object-level knowledge. That is, whether you can pass a test like "Sally put her ball in the toychest, then left the room. Alice took the ball out of the toychest and put it in the drawer. Sally came back, where does she look for the ball?" Which is a skill I do expect all adults to have.

Expecting people to model others beyond that level... yeah, it's sometimes a bit depressing. And worse when you consider that people seem to have a better theory of mind reserved for people on "their side" than the one they use for the out group / enemies / the underprivileged.
