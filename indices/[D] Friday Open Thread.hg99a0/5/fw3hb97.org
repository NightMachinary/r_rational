I am becoming less convinced that most people actually possess theory of mind.

Like, you can state that different people believe different things, and everyone will agree with that. But if you try to go any further than that, religious people in particular will fail to understand the implications of that. They know intellectually that people believe different things to be true, but they cannot be convinced that this means people will also have different opinions on their reasons for believing things to be true.

We've all encountered the Bible-thumper belting out quotes from their ancient book, and we've all been utterly unconvinced by their claims (if there are any Christians in the audience, replace the Bible-thumper with a Jehovah's Witness or Mormon, or possibly an extremist Muslim Imam depending on where in the world you are). But if you talk with them and open with, "Why should I believe your book/interpretation is true," they'll keep quoting as if that has any meaning to you. They aren't prepared to consider that people don't think the foundation of their truth is true, and that this means they should react differently to those people than they would if someone were merely questioning an interpretation or claim made by the book.

I know religion is spiders, but that isn't the only context where this comes up. People who follow propaganda outlets genuinely don't understand that people who don't follow those outlets will see reality differently than them. They will then often conclude that everyone who does not follow their outlet is evil, when the truth is that everyone else just has a different source of information. Some doctors still to this day dismiss patients' concerns as psychosomatic, played-up to get a reaction, or straight-up lies, particularly where female patients are involved. US cops and their apologists genuinely don't appear to understand that the people they've been oppressing /feel oppressed./ The hyper-wealthy do not get exactly how angry everyone else is getting at them, or how dangerous this is in the long run.

I think the term theory of mind does not accurately describe reality. It's not a switch, to be examined by psychologists doing experiments on toddlers to see when it gets flipped. There's a spectrum, and at the lowest end are full adults who will say they understand that different people with different experiences will believe different things while failing to behave that way, while at the highest end are those who genuinely believe people when they describe their experiences and why they have convinced them of different things. Just saying humans have theory of mind fails to describe reality as I observe it. There are a lot of people who just don't behave that way.
