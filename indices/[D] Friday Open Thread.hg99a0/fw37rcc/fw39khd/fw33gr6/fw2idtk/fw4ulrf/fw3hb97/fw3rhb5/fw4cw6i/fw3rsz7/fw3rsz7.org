There are good political and game-theoretic reasons to not take people at face value. Most of your examples aren't overly irrational. The religious guy citing the holy text as validation of the holy text actually works not by convincing you that it's true, but by signaling that the Church will come at you if you disagree publicly. It also is a cheap argument to stop you from reasoning them out of their religion.

What I'm trying to say is, people usually do have theory of mind when they'll benefit personally from having it.
