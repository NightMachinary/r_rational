Here's the full history of community transmission figures for the state in question: [[https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-community-transmission/vic]]

It went from 0,1,2,3 cases of community transmission between the 7th June and the 16th of June and now has been having ~10+ for about a week. (That said the past few days they've been doing random asymptomatic testing and whatnot so [[https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-tests/vic][they've gone from 8k tests per day to 20k tests per day]] - population approx 5m)

They're going to walk restrictions back no doubt so hopefully it gets contained. Fortunately the other states have very few cases so we can share testing capabilities.
