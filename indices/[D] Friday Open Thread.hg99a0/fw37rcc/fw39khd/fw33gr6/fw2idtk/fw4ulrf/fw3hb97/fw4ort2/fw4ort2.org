Lol, Australia has started panic buying again because one state is having a modest rise in community transmission (from "practically zero" to "a little more than zero"). Meanwhile my state hasn't had a single case not linked to people entering from outside (who are under mandatory quarantine) in the past two months.

However, the pasta shelves were looking bare when I went to the supermarket this morning an hour after it opened, and there's limits on paper towels. The lady next to me at the self checkout had bought two JUMBO packets of toilet paper and bags and bags of bread.

Those of you who are, you know, actually in mid-pandemic... you have toilet paper now, right? ðŸ™„
