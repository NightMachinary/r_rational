You make a great point, but I don't think it's unknown.

"Theory of mind appears to be an innate potential ability in humans that requires social and other experience over many years for its full development. Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind." - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind][Wikipedia's article on theory of mind]]

The official stance isn't that it's some kind of binary switch, far as I know. It's like the trope of getting wiser as you get older. There's no wisdom switch, and getting older doesn't automatically make you wiser. You have to be at least a bit reflective on your experiences, and have enough of them. Doing both moves you in a certain direction just like I'd imagine genuinely trying to put yourself in someone else's shoes moves you in more empathetic / theory of mind related directions.
