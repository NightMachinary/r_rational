There's a trait I've noticed in myself that I'd be curious to learn if other members of the community share. I look for and keep track of new technologies that would provide a benefit to my life, and then never implement them. RSS is a great example. I know basically what it is and I suspect I would benefit from using it more regularly, but I've thought that for years and never gotten around to setting it up. Password managers are in a similar category.

Does anyone else find themselves not implementing relatively low cost life improvements? Alternatively, anyone have any similar life improvement technologies to add to the list of things to be implemented soon^{tm} ?
