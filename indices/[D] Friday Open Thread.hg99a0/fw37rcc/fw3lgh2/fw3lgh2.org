A summary -

A New York Times journalist was about to publish a (supposedly mostly positive) article about SSC. However, the journalist or one of their superiors insisted on publishing Scott Alexander's real name in the article, which Scott thought would hinder his ability to work with his patients, possibly cost him his job and maybe endanger his safety. To make the NYT reconsider the decision, and to mitigate the damage if they didn't, he's taken down the entirety of SSC until further notice. It will be restored if the NYT promises not to publish his name, if they do publish it, it's staying down indefinitely.

Right now, everyone is mostly confused. Why is the NYT pushing this policy, how will they react to this development, will the (nontrivial, if not overwhelming) pushback from other public figures and publications affect anything, what are the NYT's internal politics like right now? Nobody knows, and the NYT hasn't made any substantial official comments as yet.

Some fans of the blog are writing letters to complain, (agreed to be a good idea, so long as it's polite and presentable) some are cancelling their subscriptions, (if you do this, remember to specify why) while some are conspiring to spread misinformation about Scott's name to confound attempts to find it out. (/not remotely/ agreed to be a good idea)

The SSC discord server has closed invites due to a flood of new members in the wake of the attention, news may be found at [[/r/slatestarcodex]] and, if the blog reopens, the SSC mailing list, which is still accepting subscriptions. Stay tuned.
