Our lockdowns are starting to end, but we never actually ran out of toilet paper. People would line up outside stores to try and buy it all in the first few minutes after the stores opened.

That made it look like there was trouble, but we never had any supply hiccups and at the transmission peak either enough people had hoarded enough or the policy changes had worked but there was toilet paper available most places at most times instead of only early morning.

Edit: there's still enough demand that yeast is near impossible to buy so people who like making bread have to come up with alternatives.
