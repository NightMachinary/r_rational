I have to say, though, when I went back to the shops today to pick up some more things (I know, I'm living such a charmed life that I have the luxury of going on /two/ shopping trips in one weekend), I saw toilet paper, pasta, paper towels, soap, etc in large numbers and /I felt comforted/ and /had an urge to buy some/ in case I can't get more later (I didn't, FWIW). That scared me.

Because what I /do/ know is that in the height of everything, Italy, New York, wherever, nobody went hungry. I can deal with no pasta for a month if it comes to that :P
