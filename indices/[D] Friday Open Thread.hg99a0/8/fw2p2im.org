Anybody know of a good advanced stats site for soccer? I love statsbomb but they hardly write public-facing articles anymore

If there are any American football fans, check out [[http://www.footballoutsiders.com][www.footballoutsiders.com]]. Their stats (DVOA and DYAR) and the reasoning behind them has made me a much smarter football fan (plus they have a bunch of really good writers), and now I want to understand soccer better too
