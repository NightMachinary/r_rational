I /have/ heard of people going hungry due to coronavirus.

But it wasn't because of a lack of food on the shelves to buy. It was that the people in question required regular, small jobs in order to earn enough to be able to /pay/ for their food supplies. Not a failure of food availability, but a failure of job availability.
