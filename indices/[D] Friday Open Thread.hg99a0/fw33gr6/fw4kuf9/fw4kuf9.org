Not with technology, personally, but this sort of thing affects me every so often. For example, I had a rubbish bin that was rather annoying to use because its placement meant I kept having to walk across the room to use it. It took me months before I took the five seconds needed to moved it to a better spot.

This is probably a form of akrasia, I think. Something that would have a long-term benefit but requires a small short-term cost makes the mind have a disproportionate pushback to doing it.
