I'm the opposite.

Sometimes I set up some technologies to improve my daily life and it feels great! My life is improved and I'm really happy I did it. You should try it and you'll be happy you did!

A RSS reader in particular only takes a few hours to set up and it saves you hours of compulsive checking in the long run; I recommend Inoreader.

A password manager takes a little more time, you probably want to set aside an afternoon for that. Also, the technology hasn't quite matured, especially re: mobile and browser integration, but it's already quite useful. I personally use KeePass, but there's not much difference either way.
