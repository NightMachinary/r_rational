I don't think it is. In canon, the sharingan is able to see chakra flow, to copy any technique, etc. Also, if it is the three-tomoed sharingan, it is supposed to 'see' a bit into the future/predict the oponent's movements. Here it has only been described as being able to perfectly see details.

Well, Sasuke also copied the motions of writing in the exam, but that could be by the original, 'automatic' ability or just by being able to see detail so well as to be able to copy the movements.

P.S.: Byakugan may be a bit more powerful, it is said that it can see as far as your regular eyes would in an open field, or something like that. That's a significant range increase to the untrained byakugan, isn't it?
