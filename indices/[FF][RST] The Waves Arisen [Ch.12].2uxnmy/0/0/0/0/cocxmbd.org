  One recurring criticism that's leveled at HPMOR is that HJPEV simply isn't a normal child, he's mostly an author avatar Fixer Sue with a few instructive character flaws.

HPMOR is obviously not the kind of story, where you'd expect to see an average Joe as a protagonist. It's a story about extraordinary people wielding extraordinary influence over the fate of humanity, so this kind of criticism puzzles me. It's like criticising stories about Miyamoto Musashi on the basis that he's simply not a normal adult, but mostly a Swordsman Sue.

  I'm worried that there may be a tendency to pattern off of HPMOR and take it as simply okay for the protagonist to be strangely devoid of any of the usual foibles or downsides of youth because HPMOR did it.

Perhaps this is because extraordinarily rational people are expected to keep a handle on their hormones and not allow them to skew priorities to catastrophic degree, when matters of survival are at stake? I'm no expert on child soldier psychology, so I can't say how true to life Naruto's behaviour is, but I did not see anything terribly implausible so far.
