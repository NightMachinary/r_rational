Nerdy kid or not, Naruto should be hitting puberty relatively soon if he hasn't already, and the effect that would be expected to have on his priorities shouldn't be ignored. One recurring criticism that's leveled at HPMOR is that HJPEV simply isn't a normal child, he's mostly an author avatar Fixer Sue with a few instructive character flaws, and the story is saved mostly by the problems he's facing being much harder than canon.

Rational fiction seems to be drawn to young adult/shonen-like stories because they exist in worlds where individual skills and abilities can have an outsized impact on the world, and at least in the case of fan-fictions, canon-established focuses on growth and self development along those lines.

I'm worried that there may be a tendency to pattern off of HPMOR and take it as simply okay for the protagonist to be strangely devoid of any of the usual foibles or downsides of youth because HPMOR did it.
