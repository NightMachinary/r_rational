From here on out I'm just going to assume that if a named, canon character is introduced in place of a generic character they will be killed off bluntly, shortly after.

Just so we're on the same page, is nature chakra in the context used here of the same type as nature chakra used by Sennin/Sage Mode, or will that be referred to as sage chakra?

Naruto's obliviousness to Hinata's attraction to him is starting to seem a little forced, though. Given the short life expectancy and the fact that apparently only ninja-ninja pairings are likely to produce "viable" offspring, I'd expect that young ninja would be encouraged to pair up ASAP. Guy is only ~26-27, and Lee at least ~14-15 given that he was ahead of Naruto and at least in canon delayed in his entrance to the academy, so for Guy to be plausibly romantically linked to Lee's mother, pairings would have to be expected in the 13-16 range. Without a cultural taboo against relationships and sex at that age, Naruto being so bookish and nerdy that he analyzes her motives and possible courses of action when she discusses things with him seems a bit much.
