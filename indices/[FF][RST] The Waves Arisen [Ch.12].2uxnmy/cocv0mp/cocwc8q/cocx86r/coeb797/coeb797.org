His character flaws are not instructive. Rereading HPMoR let me see exactly how flawed and mistaken Harry has been. The first time around, it seems OP because Harry is simply smarter than a majority of the readers and knows it, but retrospectively you can see the flaws that Harry has both overcome and fallen to. He is actually very childish at the start, and he's remained quite childish.
