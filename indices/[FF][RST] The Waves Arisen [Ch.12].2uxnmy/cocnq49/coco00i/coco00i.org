There is a lot of dramatic irony that exists if you have some basic canon knowledge. I think not knowing it though may make things a more interesting surprise for you. Read on if you prefer the dramatic irony.

Context for the ending of last chapter [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nagato][Pein]]

For the most recent events: [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Gen%27y%C5%ABmaru][here you go]]

Oh and the seal that Sasuke has is [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Orochimaru%27s_Juinjutsu][not]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Cursed_Seal_of_Heaven][good]]

You can just google each Naruto character's name as they come up and see the general cannon deals. Orochimaru is pretty much an undead evil ninja mad scientist... and he is behind Sound Village too in canon.
