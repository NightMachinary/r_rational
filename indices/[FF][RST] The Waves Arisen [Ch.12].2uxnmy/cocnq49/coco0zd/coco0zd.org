Gen is presumed to be Orochimaru, one of the previously mentioned Sannin. He is a legendary ninja, incredibly similar to Voldemort (they both have a snake theme going on, a lust for knowledge and immortality, and the whole ability to body snatch thing). In the manga, he stole the body of Gen and used it to found the Village of Sound (though in canon I believe he didn't hold the deception very long). In canon, Orochimaru gives Sasuke the curse mark to tempt him into coming to Sound for a powerup, so that ultimately he can jump his soul into Sasuke's body and finally gain a Sharingan (the others being in Itachi's face, a difficult place to get them from, or previously killed by Itachi).

Orochimaru's goal is to learn lot's of jutsu. Sharingan is very useful for learning jutsu. Orochimaru (in the manga at least) can jump his soul into another persons body. I'm sure you can see the implications.

Note, the fact that they're going /too/ Sound /away/ from Leaf and that Naruto thinks this is their /best/ option is a huge bit of dramatic irony. The audience is, I suspect, supposed to know that Orochimaru/Gen is bad news bears.
