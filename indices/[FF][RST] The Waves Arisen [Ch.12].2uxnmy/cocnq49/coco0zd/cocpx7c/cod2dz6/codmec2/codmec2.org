I considered this, but presumably, Orochimaru would have queued up lots of nearly-complete jutsu research that only needs one look from the sharingan. It'd be much better to "tech up" with the results of that research /before/ attacking Konoha, rather than after. Maybe the deal would involve Orochimaru killing Danzo and giving one of his sharingans back to Sasuke, though.
