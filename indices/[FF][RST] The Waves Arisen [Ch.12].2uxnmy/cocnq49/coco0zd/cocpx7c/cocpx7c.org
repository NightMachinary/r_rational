Given that /everyone/ in this universe seems to be at least a bit more rational (except maybe Lee), I wouldn't be surprised if Orochimaru was actually Naruto's best hope for Fixing Everything. Correctly persuaded, he's a Library of Alexandria of lost jutsu, where any one of them used alongside "nigh-infinite chakra capacity" might produce a foom.

If that was what was on the table, I can imagine Sasuke could be easily convinced to give Orochimaru one of his eyes in trade. (It's not like Orochimaru actually needs both of Sasuke's eyes, let alone his whole body.)

(And that's just Orochimaru on his own. If Naruto manages to "get through to him" in the way he frequently manages with various villains in canon, I could imagine getting all three sannin on the project.)

Orochimaru always seemed to me like someone who was just resorting to "evil" methods for lack of anyone who appreciated his goals, and would cooperate with him. In this much more grey-and-grey morality universe, where Naruto is already a missing-nin, Orochimaru wouldn't be a villainous foil to Naruto's intent; he'd be more like a failed-at-the-same-quest mentor, in the Mazer Rackham sense.
