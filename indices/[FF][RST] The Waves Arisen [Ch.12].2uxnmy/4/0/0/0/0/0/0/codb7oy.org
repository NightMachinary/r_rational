Civilians can't say no. Worse, for ninja with skills in the areas of illusion or mind-control, they can't even /want/ to say no. So ninja can violate people all day long and not even have the people they are hurting cry. In fact, after they rearrange their minds, they will be enthusiastic. Exuse me, I need brain-bleach.
