No. It sounds like a simple Mendelian inheritance where one gene is responsible for all of the ninja-chakra abilities which makes sense if such a gene is artificially engineered (there's a couple of chapters in HPMOR about the same idea about a single gene being a marker for magic).

From the comments about ninja-ninja pairings producing ninjas and ninja-civilian pairing producing mostly civilians, it sounds like the ninja gene is a recessive trait. Recessive traits frequently skip multiple generation and act as if they will disappear in a few generations which is why we have people who think [[http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/redhead-extinction.htm][blonde and red hair will vanish]] from the gene pool despite the hair colors being around for centuries. One way to confirm my theory is to check whether or not civilian-civilian pairings has ever produced ninjas. This does occur, because otherwise the Academy would be only training clan children and Sakura Haruno wouldn't be in the Academy at all.
