  avoid death by boredom.
#+end_quote

I was thinking more likely madness, with the brain conjuring up fantasies of what's not physically possible in order to entertain itself. There's bound to be more physically impossible things than physically possible ones so living in one's imagination would probably become easier. Sort of like how people start to hallucinate when sensorally deprived -- someone would have experienced pretty much everything there is to experience, many times over, so anything outside their fantasies might seem effectively like white noise to them, or close enough to encourage the same symptoms.

Either that or maybe just "death" by wireheading. I'm not sure burning out pleasure receptors is something that can get boring.
