#+begin_quote
  Watch every amusing cat video
#+end_quote

I'd bet this would get boring after like, 10 years, 20 tops.

#+begin_quote
  Write every piece of fiction that pops into my head and won't go away
#+end_quote

I'd give this a max of a lifetime of writing before it gets boring. 100 years. Let's say 10 lifetimes if you're creative, 1000 years.

#+begin_quote
  Find out what life is like after you transform into a wolf or an eagle or a whale
#+end_quote

I'm not sure this is possible but ok, another lifetime spent as each of those. Maybe a few more animals -- let's say 100 animals/creatures and a lifetime spent as each of those. 10,000 years.

#+begin_quote
  Become good enough at harp to perform in front of a major audience
#+end_quote

Let's be charitable here and say you spend another lifetime not only becoming as good at harp as you can pretty much ever get but also just screwing around with it. 100 years to make sure you're a master, 100 years to get bored of being a master.

#+begin_quote
  Ditto for standup comedy
#+end_quote

Sure, 200 more years. You then spend 100 more reliving the best parts on youtube, along with the cat videos.

#+begin_quote
  Read all the good fiction in existence
#+end_quote

I'd bet a lifetime spent reading would get boring and should certainly take care of the better works but let's say you also include some more obscure stuff. 300 years, 3 lifetimes, spent pretty much just reading, sounds plenty enough to get bored, to me.

#+begin_quote
  Watch all the episodes of Firefly that our Friendly AI friend will create for me
#+end_quote

It's a good AI and manages to entertain you for 10 lifetimes, 1000 years.

#+begin_quote
  Go back to school and acquire advanced degrees in history, politics, mathematics, computer science...
#+end_quote

Each degree takes WAY less than a lifetime but let's say you also git gud at each of those. Let's say 100 subjects, a full lifetime for each, 10,000 years to get bored.

#+begin_quote
  Have a life that is worth writing a memoir about and then write it
#+end_quote

One lifetime spent writing, one lifetime editing. I'd bet it'd get boring after that. 200 years.

#+begin_quote
  Use an appropriate vehicle to explore the bottom of the ocean
#+end_quote

A lot of it would be obscured by darkness and would look samey. I find it hard to believe someone can spend two entire lifetimes on that and still remain interested. 200 years.

#+begin_quote
  and the inside of the sun
#+end_quote

I find even one lifetime spent on this a stretch because it'll pretty much be "light" everywhere, but whatever, you're bored and spend a lifetime examining all the minutiae of the plasma. Let's say you spend another lifetime becoming a sun expert. 200 years.

#+begin_quote
  Perform a North Polar traversal of Saturn
#+end_quote

Let's say a lifetime to git gud enough to go there and two lifetimes to get bored of studying it and come back. 300 years.

#+begin_quote
  Go asteroid mining and strike it rich
#+end_quote

That doesn't sound fun to me at all -- it's novel initially but ultimately you're not doing much more than breaking rocks in space. Let's be conservative again and say you spend a lifetime as an asteroid miner and 2 additional lifetimes on the journey there and back and to add it to your memoirs. 300 years.

#+begin_quote
  Play high stakes poker and win Play high stakes poker and lose
#+end_quote

I find it hard to believe poker will still be interesting after you spend 200 years becoming good enough to effortlessly count cards. Let's say 100 more years learning to read people. 300 years.

#+begin_quote
  Meet the love of my life and make her happy
#+end_quote

Let's be super conservative here and say you spend 10 lifetimes, hell 100 lifetimes, screwing your way through the earth's populace, 10 lifetimes learning enough chemistry to make cures for all the diseases you get and 10 lifetimes to manufacture them. 10,000 years +1,000 years + 1,000 years let's round that and say 20,000 years.

#+begin_quote
  Go on a space walk
#+end_quote

Maaaaybe 200 years to get there and have your walk for ~50 years and get back. It's just black and stars all around you, I can't see it being fun for long. But let's say 500 years.

#+begin_quote
  Ride on a space elevator
#+end_quote

Physically impossible, sorry.

Let's say 3 lifetimes before someone lets you strap yourself to a rocket to get launched in space and another 2 to get back. 500 years.

45,320 years in total.

Gratz, by my calculations, you're still in your "teens." 4% of 1,000,000 years. Even if you're resistant to boredom and triple all my estimations, that's still barely more than a tenth of 1,000,000 years, nevermind a billion years.

After this you say, screw it, and do everything here all over again. And again. And 7 more times, 10 total.

453,200 years. Still less than halfway to a million and way less than that to a billion.
