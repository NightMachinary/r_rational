I guess there's an impasse. I didn't spent too long on my reasons why those things would become boring either. Sure there's lots of time to come up with things but there's only a finite number of things to do (assuming performing a particular action n+1 times doesn't count because it gets boring) and only a fraction of them keep people entertained.
