OH FUCK

/Master of the Five Magics/ actually starts out pretty hard-fantasy but by the end I'm going "you did the equivalent of auditing the first class in 'intro to the fifth magic' and now you're beating up demons with it?"

OK, I enjoyed it, guilty pleasure, but if I was reading it now I'd classify it as wish-fulfillment SI fanfic.

I vaguely remember what you're talking about but I don't actually remember reading the sequels. Maybe I did.

Edit: "OH FUCK" wasn't directed at the previous commentor, it was just exasperation at myself as the fail of this book came pouring back in.
