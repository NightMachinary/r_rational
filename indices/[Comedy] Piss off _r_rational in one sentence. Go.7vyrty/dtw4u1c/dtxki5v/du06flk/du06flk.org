I've read one about a world with fixed and well understood laws of magic, and a society built on them, until it turns out that there are previously unknown "metamagicians" who can, with effort, replace each law with different variations on the theme. Eg changing from the Maxim of Persistence: Perfection is Eternal, which requires exactly accurate performance of rituals, to the Maxim of Perseverance: Repetition Unto Success, which doesn't care about accuracy but requires the rituals to be done hundreds of times.

Cue societal chaos.
