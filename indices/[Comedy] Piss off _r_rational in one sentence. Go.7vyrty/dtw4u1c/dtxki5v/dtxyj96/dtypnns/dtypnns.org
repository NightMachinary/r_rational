[[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] is almost certainly the other one you're thinking about, and is arguably a better example than Ra, since Ra's particular brand of magic is mostly consistent even though it deliberately flies in the fact of most known science.

Unsong, on the other hand, has a world where rational materialism is literally breaking down in favor of metaphysical symbolism and abstract theology. So of course megacorporations start manipulating this by using sweatshops to brute-force discover the setting's magic.
