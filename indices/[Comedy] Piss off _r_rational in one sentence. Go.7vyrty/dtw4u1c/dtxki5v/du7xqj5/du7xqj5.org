I think you've just inspired me. I currently have an idea in the works but have no clue as to the setting I want (real world? alternate history? completely fantasy?) until now. I did know that I wanted something vaguely 18th early 19th century Europe but with completely different societal rules and your idea just made a lot of things fit together. Would you mind if I wrote it?
