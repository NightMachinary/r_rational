just because we like to read HPMOR, doesn't mean the HPMOR-Harry is not a Mary Sue...

also just because he has different opinions than you, doesn't mean he is trolling. (i'm trolling here, but not lying)

Also the use of a fallacy, doesn't mean his point is (completely) wrong.a

Personally I like to read about hypercompetent characters, but I know it is bad writing. (i disagree with his paragraphs about genres)
