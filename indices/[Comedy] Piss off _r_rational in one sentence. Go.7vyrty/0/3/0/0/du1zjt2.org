Indeed, and this is also what really makes the difference between hard and soft sci-fi. You can write a hard sci-fi story in a world with a lot of fantastic and exotic violations of known physical laws, if the world and the plot is consistent.

You can have the weirdest magic, you can have literal gods literally walk the earth, the suspension of disbelief can work if your story sticks to the rules it set up. I could imagine some pretty hard and rational fic in a D&D setting, even if it makes fun of many of its ridiculous features, mainly because how well-established the rules of magic are: it is well known and well described what every spell can and cannot do.
