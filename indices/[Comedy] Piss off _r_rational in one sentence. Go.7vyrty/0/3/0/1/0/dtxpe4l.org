Why people complain about it? Cause it breaks the rules.

Game of Thrones is set in a universe where Dragons exist. These dragons can fly. It is also set in a universe where throughout the show, people travel at medieval speeds.

Then we enter the last part, and the dragons fly, as we know they can. And some dude suddenly travels 2000 miles in day.... hold up. that ain't right. How did he do that? And our suspension of disbelief is broken.
