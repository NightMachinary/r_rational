I think that it actually /is/ common for different works to adhere to different standards of "reality". Cartoons would be one good example, especially the classics like Bugs Bunny or Wile E. Coyote; the work is absurdist, and exists within this framework wherein someone getting smashed in the head and growing a foot-long lump exists beside gravity kicking in when you realize that you're not running over flat land. Magical realism is written such that metaphorical or visual aberrations are part of the grammar of the work. Surrealism is about evoking something in the reader rather than being strictly literal.

So then you get people who come to science fiction or fantasy, and see something like a dragon, and think "oh, okay, everything in this story is metaphor or allegory or not /supposed/ to make sense on close inspection" even when that's clearly contradicted by the narrative grammar, word of god, or just common sense.

In a way, fiction trains us in how to read it, and I think the reaction of "it's fantasy, therefore it's made of plot holes" is just that training gone amok. (As compared to something like telenovellas or soap operas, which often /are/ made of contrivances and plot holes, but that's part of how they're meant to be enjoyed, and how they present themselves.)

(I think maybe if I make this argument again it will be with an extended metaphor using painters like Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, and Chuck Close, each with their own unique style, where their individual paintings would be ruined if a tenth of that painting was done in a completely different style.)
