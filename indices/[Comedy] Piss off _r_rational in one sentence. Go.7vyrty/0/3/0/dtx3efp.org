Non-specifically, the idea that suspension of disbelief for one thing (like the existence of werewolves) means suspension of disbelief for a totally different thing (like a plot that doesn't make sense). It's fairly common to see that line of argument used (I have a few guesses why).

More specifically, and what I was thinking of when I made that comment, there were a few episodes of a popular fantasy series ([[#s][show's name]]) where the producers played fast and loose with the established speeds and travel times in order to make their dramatic moments happen, and that particular line was one that I saw a fair amount, because that show has big honking dragons.
