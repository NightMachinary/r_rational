You talk big but ultiamitly you are all no better than any other shiftless cogs that make up modern society, you tell tales and build tall unsteady semilogical constructs but these tend to be neither precursor or inspiration for action but rather an excuse not to, to put it off indefinitely and without connection to action "Rationalisim" is no better or diffrent than any other vice such as alcohol, religion, social nets, escapist media or any of the rest of the ways to convince yourself that your base habits, what you were going to do anyway, have meaning aside from exstending life for it's own sake, and you know you arn't going to change.
