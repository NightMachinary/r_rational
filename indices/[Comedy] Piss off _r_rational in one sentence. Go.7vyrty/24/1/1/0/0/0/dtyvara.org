  Her problems with Winslow do not translate to distrust of Arcadia and sure as hell doesn't translate to an immediate distrust of the Heroes with their PR machine.

I never said it was logical, but Taylor's mindset is made abundantly clear---she has an instinctive distrust of institutions.

  I'm 19 and rather cautious. I can quite confidently say that as a teenager I was not that reckless or impulsive.
#+end_quote

I didn't say all teenagers were like that, but many are, and I imagine most people know or knew teenagers who are indeed reckless, anti-authoritarian, and have poor impulse control.

  It worked up to the point he was basically alone with it and holding his own for a little while. A situation I just explained was impossible to arise because there would be flyers tracking it or he would just dismiss the plan in the early stages because it requires him to go toe with toe with a guy that can outfight groups of high class brutes and he is not one.

It's certainly not “impossible.” Remember we're talking about a story, here. Armsmaster set about trying to isolate Leviathan, and he succeeded, much to his detriment. Recall that he honestly believed that his nanothorns would kill the beast, he was in a very bad headspace at the time, and even under the best of circumstances he had an arrogance problem. The flyers couldn't track Leviathan very reliably because A: it was raining cats and dogs, and B: Leviathan is incredibly fast. Recall that Legend, for example, can accelerate to move faster than sound, but as he accelerates, his awareness dims proportionally. Alexandria is possibly even more nimble despite being slower, but her senses aren't as sharp as his, and Leviathan had nearly drowned her. Glory Girl has a middling Mover rating, and her top speed is 80 mph. So it's not at all incongruous to me that Leviathan can take advantage of the confusion and slip away, considering he's regarded as the fastest non-teleporting creature in the world.

  Yes but a lot of villains whole character can be summed in a single trauma, mind rape or dumb drive.

You can sum up basically any character or their motivations like that, though. Go ahead, try. I can't think of any character complex enough that their motivation or personality can't be summed up laconically like that. The real factor that makes a character deep, to my mind, isn't how simple or complex their personalities or motivations are, but rather how they engage with the world around them. Normal people can understand and relate to that much easier than they can to a simple motivation to commit murder.
