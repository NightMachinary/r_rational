  Yes but they are not sympathetic

Perhaps not to you, but to others they might be. After all, being a teenager is one of those essentially universal experiences---at least among Worm's intended audience of teens and young adults.

  Either Leviathan is slow enough that flyers can keep up with him or he is fast enough to bowl Armsmaster over before he even knows what hit him regardless of his predictive software and halberd.

In fairness, think of Leviathan's goals here. Sure, he can go fast enough that he could probably have spoofed Armsmaster's software earlier than he did. But his entire schtick---and that of the Endbringers in general---is to provide a good fight, to raise up glimmers of hope just so that it hurts more when they smash that hope to smithereens. It was perfectly consistent with Leviathan's motivations and best interests to allow Armsmaster a brief moment to shine before mercilessly crushing him. This isn't just my interpretation, either---both the text and Word of Wildbow confirm that the Endbringers were deliberately holding back just to make a show of things.

  I can think of some but you are right it is not completely fair criticim.

I'd love to hear what some of those you thought of are, then, because complex characters fascinate me.

  “The real factor that makes a character deep, to my mind, isn't how simple or complex their personalities or motivations are, but rather how they engage with the world around them.” Don't know what you are getting at here.
#+end_quote

Basically paraphrasing this: [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent]]

Wildbow's characters consistently think up new and brilliant ways to get ahead, or leverage their own powers, or exploit the weaknesses of others'. It's what Yudkowsky would call the “spark of optimization,” and it really helps sell the illusion that these are real people with thoughts and desires.
