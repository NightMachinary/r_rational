  I didn't say all teenagers were like that, but many are, and I imagine most people know or knew teenagers who are indeed reckless, anti-authoritarian, and have poor impulse control.

Yes but they are not sympathetic

  It's certainly not “impossible.” Remember we're talking about a story, here. Armsmaster set about trying to isolate Leviathan, and he succeeded, much to his detriment. Recall that he honestly believed that his nanothorns would kill the beast, he was in a very bad headspace at the time, and even under the best of circumstances he had an arrogance problem. The flyers couldn't track Leviathan very reliably because A: it was raining cats and dogs, and B: Leviathan is incredibly fast. Recall that Legend, for example, can accelerate to move faster than sound, but as he accelerates, his awareness dims proportionally. Alexandria is possibly even more nimble despite being slower, but her senses aren't as sharp as his, and Leviathan had nearly drowned her. Glory Girl has a middling Mover rating, and her top speed is 80 mph. So it's not at all incongruous to me that Leviathan can take advantage of the confusion and slip away, considering he's regarded as the fastest non-teleporting creature in the world.

Either Leviathan is slow enough that flyers can keep up with him or he is fast enough to bowl Armsmaster over before he even knows what hit him regardless of his predictive software and halberd.

  you can sum up basically any character or their motivations like that, though. Go ahead, try. I can't think of any character complex enough that their motivation or personality can't be summed up laconically like that.

I can think of some but you are right it is not completely fair criticism.

  The real factor that makes a character deep, to my mind, isn't how simple or complex their personalities or motivations are, but rather how they engage with the world around them. Normal people can understand and relate to that much easier than they can to a simple motivation to commit murder.

I don't know what you are trying to say here.
