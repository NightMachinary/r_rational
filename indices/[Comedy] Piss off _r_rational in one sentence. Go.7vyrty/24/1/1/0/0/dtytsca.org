  Bear in mind Taylor is a child, and not one prone to making good decisions. She's also much more put off of the wards by her experiences with authorities like the school, whereas the Undersiders were decidedly more anarchic, as she subconsciously likes. Also, Lisa's a pretty excellent manipulator.

Her problems with Winslow do not translate to distrust of Arcadia and sure as hell doesn't translate to an immediate distrust of the Heroes with their PR machine.

  It drains sympathy... because none of us have ever been arrogant, stupid, anti-authoritarian teenagers? Armsmaster is 100% correct when he raises every single one of these points to her, it's one of the earliest indications we get that Taylor is indeed an unreliable narrator.

I'm 19 and rather cautious. I can quite confidently say that as a teenager I was not that reckless or impulsive.

  Did you miss the part where it emphatically didn't work at all?

It worked up to the point he was basically alone with it and holding his own for a little while. A situation I just explained was impossible to arise because there would be flyers tracking it or he would just dismiss the plan in the early stages because it requires him to go toe with toe with a guy that can outfight groups of high class brutes and he is not one.

  I wouldn't call some of the Nine one-dimensional, but whatever. I suspect you're using morally ambiguity as a shorthand for “depth” here, but I think one can absolutely be both evil and still be a well-developed character.

Yes but a lot of villains whole character can be summed in a single trauma, mind rape or dumb drive.

Siberian - Lost his daughter, somehow that made him a crazy cannibal that projects as image of daughter. No depth explored.

Shatterbird - can't really remember much about her, seems to have similar issues to Jack.

Crawler - Masochist, that is it.

Mannequin - Mind raped by Ziz

Bonesaw - Some depth. Twisted mindset associated with being a good girl, basically mind-raped by Jack and later Contessa.

Burnscar - Mind raped by her power

Cherish - Some depth, shitty person trying to take advantage of shitty circumstances.

Jack - Has narcissistic issues like Arms-master but is a villain and succeeds where arms master fails. A bit of depth but also a bit derivative.
