“There isn't a good reason for Taylor not to have joined the Wards before her first night out. It is dismissed in one line as bad because of teenage drama and scheduling but then she is so desperate for affection that she joins the undersiders with more teenage drama and problems.”

Bear in mind Taylor is a child, and not one prone to making good decisions. She's also much more put off of the wards by her experiences with authorities like the school, whereas the Undersiders were decidedly more anarchic, as she subconsciously likes. Also, Lisa's a pretty excellent manipulator.

None of these are “good reasons” if your standard is “a protagonist who never makes mistakes.” They are absolutely good reasons if your standard is “people doing things consistent with their character.” A protagonist who does things because of their flaws is not the same thing as a protagonist who does things for no explained reason at all.

“There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group with a thinker called Tattletale and expecting that cover to last long term. There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group when you have no official backing and indeed official disapproval. Taylor approaches Soverign Citizen level stupidity which drains a lot of sympathy.”

It drains sympathy... because none of us have ever been arrogant, stupid, anti-authoritarian teenagers? Armsmaster is 100% correct when he raises every single one of these points to her, it's one of the earliest indications we get that Taylor is indeed an unreliable narrator.

“Conflict keeps getting propped up by one dimensional villain charachters like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse Nine.”

I wouldn't call some of the Nine one-dimensional, but whatever. I suspect you're using morally ambiguity as a shorthand for “depth” here, but I think one can absolutely be both evil and still be a well-developed character. And, not to put too fine a point on it, but shallow people and serial killers and the like absolutely do exist. Not everyone is particularly complicated.

“The Leviathan fight is some bullshit. Armsmaster's plan was bullshit and shouldn't have worked at all.”

Did you miss the part where it emphatically didn't work at all? Armsmaster expected that his Nanothorns would be able to cut through anything, and they didn't. He expected his predictive software to work, and it didn't. He got his arm and leg torn off for his hubris and nearly died. Worse, Leviathan wasn't even deterred. It took Scion's arrival to drive him off.

Look, I get it if you don't like the work, you're entitled to your opinion. But your nitpicks don't even make sense.
