There isn't a good reason for Taylor not to have joined the Wards before her first night out. It is dismissed in one line as bad because of teenage drama and scheduling but then she is so desperate for affection that she joins the undersiders with more teenage drama and problems. You can say unreliable narrator and someting about her father but her father her is basically a non-entity.

There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group with a thinker called Tattletale and expecting that cover to last long term. There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group when you have no official backing and indeed official disapproval. Taylor approaches Soverign Citizen level stupidity which drains a lot of sympathy.

Conflict keeps getting propped up by one dimensional villain charachters like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse Nine.

The Leviathan fight is some bullshit. Armsmaster's plan was bullshit and shouldn't have worked at all. Leviathan may have great mobility but that shouldn't prevent Legend or Eidolan from keeping up with it and providing updating location reports. Armsmaster plans to and does fight Leviathan one and one. That is completely suicidal given how dangerous Leviathan and the other endbringers are stated to be. I don't care if he can predict or has the halberd to damage it. Leviathan should have still wiped the floor with him immediately just on its strength and speed.

At the hospital they lock Skitter into restraints because she is a villain including her broken arm. Then she gets out (no one notices her swiping the keys with bugs and the bugs are able to unlock her restraints) and moves into the next room over to find unmasked Shadow Stalker (They keep heroes and villains right next to each other. Shadow Stalker's mask is taken off and kept off for some reason. Shadow stalker is set right next to Skitter). Then she is caught by the heroes and then her team mates show up immediately (She gets restrained to her cot but not them and nobody questions this)

It has a lot more flaws but I don't want to reread it to find them.
