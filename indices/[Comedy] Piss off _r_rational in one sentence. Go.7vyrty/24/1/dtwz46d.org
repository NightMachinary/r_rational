I think there are a lot worse things you could say to upset Worm fans like me:

“Worm is poorly-paced, poorly-edited edgelord schlock.”

“Worm is for obsessive nerds who think a million-plus-word slog is just warming up for a sequel.”

“Taylor is a terrible protagonist and the story goes out of its way to excuse her horrible behavior.”
