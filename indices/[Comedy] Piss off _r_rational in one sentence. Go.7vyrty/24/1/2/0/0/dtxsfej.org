  Basically the whole point of Worm is that we're supposed to see Taylor as an extremely unreliable narrator making questionable choices

that's pretty subjective as well. she's written as a pretty typical "heart of gold caught in a bad situation" protagonist. you can read into authorial intent if you want, but saying that the "whole point" is that it's meta-ironic is a pretty big hand wave. Do you have any real evidence of this authorial intent from within the text? How is this communicated to the reader?
