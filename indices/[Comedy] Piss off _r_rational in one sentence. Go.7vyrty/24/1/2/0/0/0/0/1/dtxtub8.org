She's not supposed to be the “good guy,” though. How Taylor views and rationalizes her own decisions through a haze of her own biases is very different from how the plot and other characters treat her. Many people empathize strongly with her and think she is the “good guy,” but I see that more as the story doing its job well.

And it's fine if your problem is more with the scrapes she gets out of. If that breaks your immersion, you have every reason to not like the story. But it didn't break my immersion, and I think that there was adequate explanation/reasons things turned out the way they did. Rarely did I get the feeling that she'd be spared just because the plot demanded it with little other justification or reason behind it.
