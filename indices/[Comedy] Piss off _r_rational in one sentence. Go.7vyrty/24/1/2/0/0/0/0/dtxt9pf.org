  It's not just something you can infer by looking at Taylor's actions, or reading the interludes and comparing their POV to the Taylor chapters, though some have (looking at the We've Got Worm podcast there).

then it's not in the story. the author's external views not aligning with taylors is not the same thing as the portrayal of a character within that story.

she's written as a protagonist with good intentions who gets pushed into being a villain by her environment. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that take on a character or story, mind; but given she's supposed to be the "good guy" in the story some of her questionable actions do seem to be excused or treated lightly.

my problem with it isn't really that, though. It's how wildly unrealistic her successes are. The timeline selection deus ex only works so far; if it were a true rational fic she should be dead early on. the situations and enemies she survives are ridiculous.
