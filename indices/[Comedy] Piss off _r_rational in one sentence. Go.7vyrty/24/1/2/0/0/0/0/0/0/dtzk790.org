having losses or injuries doesn't balance out the victories. the world isn't some cosmic karma scale. the question is whether it's plausible that the series of fights she won/drew could all turn out as they did. honestly the list of injuries (bakuda, oni lee) just reinforces how she continues to have close calls where she should simply lose and die.

While there are individual /explanations/ within each scene, there's no plausible justification for why she continues to survive and be successful in general even when facing melee specialists in close combat.

in terms of specific deus ex machinas, they ABOUND. I alluded to a big one earlier: Grue's second trigger event with bonesaw. This is an egregious cliffhanger scenario with the whole team knocked out or helpless and about to be cut up, and one team member just suddenly gets extra powers.

Look, the story works as a dramatic superhero tale. it doesn't HAVE to be a rational fic to be what it is. it leans on narrative necessity and set pieces, makes heavy use of tropes and deus ex machina - and these are all acceptable tools to create an entertaining story. But it doesn't stand up to being a true rational fic.
