I think you misunderstand what Deus Ex Machina means and why the trope is bad in the first place. For something to be a Deus Ex Machina it needs to fit a couple criteria:

1. It was not foreshadowed, or the reader did not know to expect it was possible.
2. It was inconsistent with the plot as it was portrayed previously. (e.g. a god descending from the heavens to solve the plot even when they had opportunity to do it previously, and did not take it)
3. Relies too much on serendipity, and the power of cosmic coincidence.
4. It solves all of the characters problems.

Grue's trigger fits exactly one of these criteria - number four. We know about second triggers from the dialogue about Narwhal in Gregor's interlude and at the beginning of arc 8, specifically that it comes from a stimulus that is worse than the original trigger event by a large margin. So we know it's possible beforehand. It's not inconsistent with the plot or too coincidental, either - we know for a fact that Grue is disassembled into bits and stashed into a freezer, fully conscious and in pain. This is introduced to us /before/ the others are even in serious jeopardy. So even if Grue's trigger is convenient to the characters, it's not "god being lowered from the rafters" convenient. And moreover, it doesn't immediately solve all of their problems - it scares off Bonesaw and gives them a chance to retaliate, but Grue is left permanently scarred, the Slaughterhouse 9 is still in town, and their worst offense has yet to come.

I'd like to know what you think a justification is other than "individual explanations within each scene". Ignoring those individual explanations is tantamount to ignoring evidence for something because you believe it to be impossible - just because an outside retrospective view makes success seem unlikely doesn't mean that a real, plausible explanation for why it happened is nonexistent. I would understand saying that if these moments were off screen or narrated after the fact, but they weren't. You can't say that "coincidences are piling up" when individually most of these coincidences make sense in context and aren't really coincidental at all. You /can/ call them contrived - they almost certainly are - but rational fiction doesn't care about contrivances so long as they fit the rest of the rules of the genre. Otherwise things like the magic in HPMOR would automatically invalidate the story. I feel like Worm very safely falls within the boundaries of rational fiction.

(Also, I've been meaning to say this, but I avoided it in the main essay because it was a little off-tone: saying /Worm/ relies on tropes of the superhero genre is like saying /Game of Thrones/ relies too much on the tropes of historical fantasy. It's the kind of completely idiotic assumption you could only make from a bubble that has /never read/ a story that relies too much on tropes, or doesn't know how to distinguish genre reconstruction from the original genre itself. Worm takes superhero tropes, takes them apart and tries to reconstruct them to fit a setting that makes sense as a coherent whole - if you didn't grasp this immediately, you either didn't read Worm properly, or you have never watched a Marvel movie in your life. Watch those and then tell me what a Deus Ex Machina in a superhero story looks like.)
