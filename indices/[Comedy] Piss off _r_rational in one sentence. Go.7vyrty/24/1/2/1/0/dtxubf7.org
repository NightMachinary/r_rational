it's no more rationalist than any other grimdark superhero comic book.

Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

this is the cardinal rule, and it is violated constantly. the plot is structured as a series of Boss Battles, with build up and world filler in between. The protagonist goes into every fight as a scrappy underdog, and yet comes out unscathed, even in ABSURDLY ridiculous odds.

Characters are tropey, and Worfed constantly - the next Big Bad is always set up by other characters raving about how scary they are, and mini-baddies getting their asses kicked, only to be put down by a TEENAGE GIRL with a power that has extremely limited combat applications.

In a rational fic with consistent rules and realism, she should not have survived /any/ of the major fights, from Lung to Armsmaster to Hookwolf and on and on. Every fight is increasingly implausible, and after a while I just became numb to the whole thing. I'd spend the fights waiting for her to stumble into a scrappy victory, and the time between fights trudging through all the setup for the next one. It lost all the tension and drama.

That said, the worldbuilding is great. it's a fantastic setting with great characters and creative powers. It has a ton of promise as a universe; it's just not rational fic, which is fine.
