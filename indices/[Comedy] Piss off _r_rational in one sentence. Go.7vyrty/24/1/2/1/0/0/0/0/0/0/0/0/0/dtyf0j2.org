  Now, you may or may not find these explanations satisfactory in a literary or probabilistic sense, but you can't deny that they exist, and that the story is being consistent with its own internal logic

again, the most important point from my last comment was that it's the /trend/ that matters, not individual incidents. If by coincidence and scrappiness a hero wins against the odds, it's just another heroic story.

If this happens five, ten, twenty times in the same story, it starts to become a pattern. In this case, individual explanations for why EACH event occurred are no longer sufficient. The narrative must explain the pattern as a whole, or cease to be rational.
