oh my god you shouldn't even mention bonesaw lol. there was a deus ex if ever there was one.

look, there being "reasons" in a story for how things happened isn't the same as the story being reasonable or rational. If the enemies Taylor defeated were as easily bested by "underestimating" as you suggest, they would never have gotten where the were.

for SOME villains to have an overblown reputation is plausible. for her to face the biggest named heroes and villains again and again and come out on top is just railroading. that the narrative gives /excuses/ for this in the context of the scene isn't sufficient to make it a rational story, or set it apart from any other superhero narrative. There are reasons why the Xmen and avengers win too within their stories. that doesn't make them rational fic.
