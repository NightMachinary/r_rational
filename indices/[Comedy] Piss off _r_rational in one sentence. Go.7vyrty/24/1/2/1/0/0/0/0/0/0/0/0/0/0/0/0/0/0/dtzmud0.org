Call it narrative handwaving if you like, but it IS a textual explanation and it does exist within the story, so it is entirely consistent with the established internal logic of the story, which has been my whole point all along.

Besides which, this mostly happened later in the story. Earlier, according to Word of Wildbow, he'd rolled dice to determine who would survive the Leviathan fight, Taylor included---which is why the deaths of Kaiser and Dauntless in that fight seemed so shocking and abrupt. If Taylor had also died, the narrative would have shifted over to Aegis, Faultline, or Panacea.
