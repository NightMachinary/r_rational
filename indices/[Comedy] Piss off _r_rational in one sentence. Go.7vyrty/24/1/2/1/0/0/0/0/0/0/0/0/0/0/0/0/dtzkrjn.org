There are plenty of offered textual explanations. First and foremost, Taylor is not nearly as weak as everyone else makes her out to be at first. That ought to change the numbers in her favor right off. Second, Coil was sheltering her and the Undersiders for her entire early career, barring the Lung fight where she would have died if not for Tattletale and the Undersiders' intervention. Also, Dinah Alcott claims that when the end of the world comes within two to five years, Taylor is always there. Literally always, in some form or another. This heavily implies that she is a key point on Contessa's preferred Path to Victory, and as we later see, she does prove pivotal in the battle against Zion.
