“I'm looking at objectively the powers she is shown to have, and the powers of her opponents.”

Define “stronger.” In Worm, powers work on anything but a linear scale of strength. It's more akin to chess, or rock-paper-scissors. Or, to mix metaphors further, you can say the Bismarck is “stronger” than a teeny little biplane carrying a torpedo, but in Worm as in real life, pure “strength” isn't everything in determining the outcome of a fight.

“She consistently fights stronger opponents and wins or draws. This is a fact.”

Actually, the most common outcome when Taylor finds herself arrayed against a stronger opponent such as Armsmaster, the Siberian, or Behemoth is that she either manages to flee, fails outright, doesn't pick a fight in the first place, or teams up with others to fight them on the most favorable terms she can manage. Taylor is rarely shown to tackle any opponent singlehandedly, aside from unpowered thugs and capes at a huge disadvantage.

“There is no explanation offered for why Taylor is exceptionally good or lucky at besting stronger opponents.”

Probably the single closest thing to this argument actually being accurate is when Coil tries to kill Taylor, or when Taylor kills Alexandria singlehandedly. In the former, the text itself explains why and how she escaped. In the latter, it's not really a Deus Ex Machina, because A: Taylor was far away from Alexandria at the time, not in arm's reach, and B: Alexandria's weakness to suffocation was foreshadowed at least twice before in the Leviathan and Echidna arcs. Now, you may or may not find these explanations satisfactory in a literary or probabilistic sense, but you can't deny that they exist, and that the story is being consistent with its own internal logic (regardless of whether you agree with that logic).
