Eh. I disagree. I think the worldbuilding is a big part of what makes it a rational fic, and from my perspective, rational fic is not at all the same thing as literary realism, nor should it try to be. Because then that would mean there was no actual story in many cases. You always have to accept at least a little bit of compromise to make things interesting.

And that definition of rational fiction is a bit basic, but even there I'd argue that pretty much everything in Worm happens for a clear and well-established reason, but whether you find those reasons immersive or plausible is another matter entirely. The story both A: has an internal logic and B: follows its internal logic consistently, which in my opinion makes it a rational fic, if not necessarily a rationalist fic.

Of course, Worm mostly stands out because the other stories in its genre are the polar opposite of rational fiction. They have no logic, internal or otherwise.
