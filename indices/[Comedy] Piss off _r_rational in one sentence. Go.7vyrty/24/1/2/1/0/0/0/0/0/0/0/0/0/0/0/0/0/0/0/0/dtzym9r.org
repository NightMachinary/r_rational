  the narrative demanding a specific result post facto is not evidence a bayesian analysis would accept as increasing the prior likelihood of an event occuring.

How do you even define “post facto?” If you assume that Worm was basically complete in the author's head prior to being serialized---with everything planned out ahead of time to be a certain way to conform to a plot---then how is it different from any other novel? Yudkowsky even says that it's an author's prerogative to “cheat” by being able to jump forwards and backwards in time. What matters is if the plot makes sense in the sequence as it is written, not as it is conceived by the author.

Even so, Worm was not actually written like this. Upon starting, Wildbow had finalized most of the worldbuilding and characterization, but not the actual plot. That flowed much more organically, and could have followed many different possible paths depending on how certain things turned out. Worm is a truly serialized work, not just a very large book that happened to be released in installments.

  you are basically just saying "the story requires X to happen, so this happens, and this is 'consistent internal logic.'" This is not the same thing as "the story offers a set of rules and context, and the natural outcome of those rules is X."
#+end_quote

Not at all. I'm saying that the fact that X serving the story and also being a logical consequence of prior conditions is not mutually exclusive. It can be both.

  I don't think we're going to convince each other, but my position remains that Worm is narrative driven, and not a rational fic.
#+end_quote

If the events of the story were not already given sufficient explanation through worldbuilding and foreshadowing PRIOR to those events occurring, I might agree with you. As it happens, I don't see anything in Worm where some later event just blatantly contradicts what we were informed about the world from the very first page.
