As for whether Worm is really a rational fic, the best way I've heard it explained is that Worm is a rational fic, but not a rationalist fic. Its purpose is not to educate on rationality nor science, or even good storywriting. It's a character- and plot-driven work, and in my opinion, that brings much-needed diversity to the loosely-defined “genre.”
