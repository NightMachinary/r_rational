  and yet comes out unscathed

Unscathed can hardly define what Taylor comes out as in most of her big fights. Unless you said "unscathed" but you really meant "alive". In which case, I point out to you that despite the lethality of so many of the powers we come across, most superhero fights don't end in death (it would be a waste of characters if every single engagement ended in someone dying). However a good chunk of them do end with multiple deaths, especially the fights with the walking WMD's.

Especially considering that Wildbow established in-universe that there's a reason most of these fights don't end in deaths; the consequences are that much worse for everyone that wants to stay within the lines.
