I'm looking at objectively the powers she is shown to have, and the powers of her opponents.

She consistently fights stronger opponents and wins or draws. This is a fact.

This is improbable. Improbable events should be explained in a rational story.

There is no explanation offered for why Taylor is exceptionally good or lucky at besting stronger opponents.

A series of individual coincidences or reasons why any specific fight went her way does not suffice. It is the TREND that matters. This should be plain to any bayesian analysis.

The reader must be able to ask "is this outcome likely, given the conditions and context I'm given?" For worm, this answer is no. The story relies on coincidence and improbable outcomes.

This is probably the most rigorous definition of a rational plotline, now that I think about it. Does it conform to probability theory given the context and constraints provided?

There is no plausible explanation for why things /in general/ turn out like they do for Taylor except, "the narrative demands it." This is typical for non rational fiction, and anathema to real rational fiction.
