And even if you accept that there is a pattern of things going Taylor's way, which I don't necessarily think is borne out by the text to any unusual or unexplained degree, you are basically left with two options: either the story is indeed breaking its own internal logic in the general sense, or the odds that things turned out the way they did are not nearly so implausible and the story is indeed obeying its internal logic. I believe the latter, for the most part.
