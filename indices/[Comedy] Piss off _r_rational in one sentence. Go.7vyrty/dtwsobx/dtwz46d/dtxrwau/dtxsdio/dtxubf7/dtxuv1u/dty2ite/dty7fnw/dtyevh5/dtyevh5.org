correct, it does not HAVE to be, you can have RPS situations. But taylor's power isn't a direct counter to most of her opponenets abilities; she wins despite a power disadvantage, not because of it. IE - outmaneuvering armsmaster in close quarters combat when he's set up specific countermeasures to her abilities.
