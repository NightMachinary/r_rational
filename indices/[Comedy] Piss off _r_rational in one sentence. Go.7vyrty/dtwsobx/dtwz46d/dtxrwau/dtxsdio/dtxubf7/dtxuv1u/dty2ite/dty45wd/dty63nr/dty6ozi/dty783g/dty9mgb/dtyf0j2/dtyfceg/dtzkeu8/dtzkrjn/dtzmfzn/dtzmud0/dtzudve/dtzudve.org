the narrative demanding a specific result post facto is not evidence a bayesian analysis would accept as increasing the prior likelihood of an event occuring. you are basically just saying "the story requires X to happen, so this happens, and this is 'consistent internal logic.'" This is not the same thing as "the story offers a set of rules and context, and the natural outcome of those rules is X."

the dice thing is a neat factoid, and I respect it if true, but not really relevant to my point.

I don't think we're going to convince each other, but my position remains that Worm is narrative driven, and not a rational fic.
