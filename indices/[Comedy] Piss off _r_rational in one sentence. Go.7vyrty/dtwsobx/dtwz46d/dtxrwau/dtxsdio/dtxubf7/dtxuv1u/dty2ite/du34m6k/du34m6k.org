  Armsmaster nearly defeats that same endbringer in 1 on 1 combat

That...is not true in the sense. People felt hope in that scene and so when read, it seemed as if that was the case. But Armsmaster didn't even come close to even kinda-sorta defeating Leviathan. This was purely a misperception. You can argue whether it was a valid misperception, based on the data they had available, but it certainly was one. Leviathan came nowhere close to losing to Armsmaster, and that's considering that Armsmaster spent years preparing for this particular engagement
