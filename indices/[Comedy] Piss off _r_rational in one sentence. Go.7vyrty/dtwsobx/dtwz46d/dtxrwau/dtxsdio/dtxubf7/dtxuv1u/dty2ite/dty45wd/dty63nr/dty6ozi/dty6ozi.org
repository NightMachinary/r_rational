Seems to me that what sets apart an excuse from a reason is whether it breaks your immersion, which is an eminently subjective thing. “Narrative convenience” doesn't matter very much to me, so long as there are reasons besides, but it clearly does to you.

For example, saying “If the enemies Taylor defeated were as easily bested by "underestimating" as you suggest, they would never have gotten where the were” only makes sense if you put it in the context of the story. If YOU were writing Worm, you might have done things differently for different reasons, but the fact that this isn't what happened does not necessarily make the reasons why it happened invalid. And I'm not saying that underestimating Taylor is necessarily a make-or-break factor in any of her fights. Rather, underestimating Taylor is a make-or-break factor in whether the READER accepts the outcome of her fights.

In other words, if you consider Taylor's power to be deceptively quite strong, like I do, the outcomes of her fights become a lot more plausible. Likewise, if you're looking at the same reasons and logic but working under the assumption that Taylor's powers are relatively weak or useless, it's not going to seem plausible that she can survive as long as she did.
