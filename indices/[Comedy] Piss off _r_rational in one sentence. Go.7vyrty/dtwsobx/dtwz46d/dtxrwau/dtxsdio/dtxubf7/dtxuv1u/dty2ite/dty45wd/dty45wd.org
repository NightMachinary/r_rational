“worldbuilding has nothing to do with rational fiction. worldbuilding is part of any fantasy or sci fi narrative and is not by itself sufficient to make a story rational.”

True, but I'm using the term “worldbuilding” loosely, as shorthand for “this is not a story with radioactive spiders and immortal telekinesis mutants.” I consider it rational because it A: has an internal logic that makes sense and B: follows this logic consistently. That's all.

“If a villain or hero is described as a terrifying, cold and relentless killer who has defeated countless other capes and eluded top law enforcement for years, then an expectation is set up within the rules of the world that they be that powerful. If that same villain is then defeated by a teenage girl who is not rated as especially proficient at combat and doesn't have a power that gives her exceptional survivability or offensive abilities, those expectations have been broken, and the logic of the world is not consistent.”

I think this is not an accurate way to look at this. Why? Because in the context of the story, there's a difference between how a thing is perceived, and what it actually is. Taylor's power is actually quite good, but it's routinely underestimated. It's a mistake overconfident characters in the story make, and helps explain why many of them are defeated. And it's not just Taylor---Jack Slash is considered to have an underwhelming power, but it's actually much more than it seems, which is how he was able to build up such a record.

“The endbringer that attacks brockton bay kills dozens of capes and holds off hundreds more, including ridiculously overpowered S-tier heroes.

Armsmaster nearly defeats that same endbringer in 1 on 1 combat.

Taylor defeats Armsmaster, TWICE.

The reader is left going "WHAT??" There should be a transitivity of relative power here.”

Again, in the context of the story, Armsmaster deployed an experimental weapon against Leviathan (which didn't even work), Leviathan was deliberately jobbing the fight, Armsmaster had the time to set up his predictive software and isolate the battlefield, and Armsmaster STILL lost badly and nearly died.

By contrast, he was never, at any point, trying to kill Skitter, but she went all-out against him. That's quite an imbalance, especially considering Armsmaster consistently underestimated the scope and diversity of Taylor's power. Also, calling them “defeats” may be a bit of a stretch---Skitter managed to get away. Trainwreck defeated Armsmaster after Skitter slipped away from the gallery attack intact, and she used human shields at the confrontation at the school.

“You can do the same thing with the slaughterhouse nine. They shred through other capes in increasingly ridiculous Worf scenes, yet taylor manages to outfight some in direct combat, and outmaneuver the group. Again, Mannequin beats Armsmaster (with caveats, he didn't have suit, I get it) then Taylor beats mannequin despite his being immune to insect bites and peper spray, her main forms of attack. It's completely unbelievable.”

Perhaps in your opinion, but Taylor's beating at Mannequin's hands speaks for itself in my opinion. He underestimated her, and she forced him to retreat at great cost. Also, Mannequin is not the entirety of the Nine, he has his own strengths and weaknesses. Taylor hardly proved effective against Manton/the Siberian, or even Jack and Bonesaw.

“One of the most important aspects of "things happening for a reason" in terms of rational fic is that the story does not leverage Deus Ex Machina to drive the plot. Worm makes heavy use of this trope to let Taylor survive ridiculous situations and move the plot in the direction the author wants.”

Deus Ex Machina implies that the salvation was inexplicable and not previously alluded to or shown. I frankly don't think it applies here, as my previous examples show. There's almost always a reason things happened the way they did, and in my opinion pretty damn good reasons at that. The latter is the most important factor, I think, and the fact that it also happens to serve the themes of the plot and characters just doesn't spoil that for me.
