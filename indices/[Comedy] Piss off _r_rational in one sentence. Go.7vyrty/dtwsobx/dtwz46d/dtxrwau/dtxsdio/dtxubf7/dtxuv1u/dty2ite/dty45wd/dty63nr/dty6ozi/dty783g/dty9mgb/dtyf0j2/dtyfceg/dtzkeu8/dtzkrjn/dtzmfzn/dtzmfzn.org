all narrative handwaving, sorry. relying on "fate" and "timelines" retroactively is really thin. basically saying "the story demands she survives so she does." this is the opposite of rational fic.

also, fwiw, Coil's power is a limited explanation as well. he's only picking between two worlds, and is not expressly looking out for her wellbeing in every choice. he's not an adequate explanation for why she's successful, except in the case of her engagement with Armsmaster, where she wouldn't have gone in at all if they wouldn't have been successful.
