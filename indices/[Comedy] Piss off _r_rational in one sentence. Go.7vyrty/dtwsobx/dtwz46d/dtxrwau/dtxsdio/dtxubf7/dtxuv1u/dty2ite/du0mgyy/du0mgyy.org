  You can do the same thing with the slaughterhouse nine. They shred through other capes in increasingly ridiculous Worf scenes, yet taylor manages to outfight some in direct combat, and outmaneuver the group. Again, Mannequin beats Armsmaster (with caveats, he didn't have suit, I get it) then Taylor beats mannequin despite his being immune to insect bites and peper spray, her main forms of attack. It's completely unbelievable.

Warning to anyone who wandered this far down the discussion but doesn't want any spoilers: there's lots in here.

The S9 are explicitly stated multiple times to be constantly losing members. The impressive thing is that the /organisation/ lasts so long, but the individuals in it drop like flies. The members who have lasted a long time are the Siberian, who's literally invulnerable (Manton isn't, but he's protected by Cauldron); Bonesaw, who's stupidly durable and has the second-best medical power in the whole setting from what we see; Jack himself, who has a really strong Trump ability that makes him a threat to /Contessa/; and Crawler, whose power is basically that he recovers from almost any damage. Of those, Crawler is killed by the Protectorate in BB, and Dragon kills Manton.

Mannequin doesn't beat Armsmaster 'with caveats' - Armsmaster's a Tinker, so without access to any equipment he's physically just a regular guy.

The S9 in general are mostly scary because they strike and disappear. They can't stand up to a whole city's worth of capes, and they don't. When they go toe-to-toe with other capes, they tend to either outnumber them, outgun them, or otherwise stack the deck in their favour first. The scary thing about the S9 isn't how strong they are, it's all the collateral they cause and how hard it is to put them down for good.
