worldbuilding has nothing to do with rational fiction. worldbuilding is part of any fantasy or sci fi narrative and is not by itself sufficient to make a story rational.

I am not demanding realism in the sense that the world must conform strictly to reality - obviously I'm perfectly willing to accept super powers or magic as part of the story. What rational fic demands is strict realism within the world it describes.

If a villain or hero is described as a terrifying, cold and relentless killer who has defeated countless other capes and eluded top law enforcement for years, then an expectation is set up within the rules of the world that they be that powerful.

If that same villain is then defeated by a teenage girl who is not rated as especially proficient at combat and doesn't have a power that gives her exceptional survivability or offensive abilities, those expectations have been broken, and the logic of the world is not consistent.

Lets put it simply:

The endbringer that attacks brockton bay kills dozens of capes and holds off hundreds more, including ridiculously overpowered S-tier heroes.

Armsmaster nearly defeats that same endbringer in 1 on 1 combat.

Taylor defeats Armsmaster, TWICE.

The reader is left going "WHAT??" There should be a transitivity of relative power here.

You can do the same thing with the slaughterhouse nine. They shred through other capes in increasingly ridiculous Worf scenes, yet taylor manages to outfight some in direct combat, and outmaneuver the group. Again, Mannequin beats Armsmaster (with caveats, he didn't have suit, I get it) then Taylor beats mannequin despite his being immune to insect bites and peper spray, her main forms of attack. It's completely unbelievable.

One of the most important aspects of "things happening for a reason" in terms of rational fic is that the story does not leverage Deus Ex Machina to drive the plot. Worm makes heavy use of this trope to let Taylor survive ridiculous situations and move the plot in the direction the author wants.

This is fine for normal fiction. You admit Worm is a character and narrative driven story, and this indicates also what it is not. Not everything has to be rational fic. Worm can be an enjoyable story without fitting that genre definition.

It does have creativity and some rational elements in how it approaches powers and worldbuilding, and I think that's why many [[/r/rational]] folk like it. The way powers are used is clever, and the world is interesting. That rigor unfortunately doesn't extend to the story itself, which is why it falls short of being a rational fic, but it's not necessary for it to be.
