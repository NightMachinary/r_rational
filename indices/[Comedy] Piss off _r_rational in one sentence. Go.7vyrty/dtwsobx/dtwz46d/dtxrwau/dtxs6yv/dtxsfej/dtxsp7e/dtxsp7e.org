Well, Wildbow has stated in many different ways and at many different times that Taylor's viewpoint is supposed to be separate from his own, and her choices are supposed to be ambiguous and not “right.” It's not just something you can infer by looking at Taylor's actions, or reading the interludes and comparing their POV to the Taylor chapters, though some have (looking at the We've Got Worm podcast there).

I wouldn't call it meta-ironic, rather it's just that the main character is flawed, and is meant to be flawed.
