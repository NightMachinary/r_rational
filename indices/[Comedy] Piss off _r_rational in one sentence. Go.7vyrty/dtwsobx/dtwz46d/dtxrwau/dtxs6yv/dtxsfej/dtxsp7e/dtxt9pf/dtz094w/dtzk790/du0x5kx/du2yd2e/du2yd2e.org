"don't understand Deus ex" and " didn't read worm properly" .

Lol no. Grue got a new power suddenly through no action of his own that saved the day at the last second. That's the fucking definition of a Deus ex machina. Your "requirements" are increasingly shrill biased justifications because you like the story and don't want to admit it's flawed in any way.

Done with this pedantic shit. All you've managed to do is make me dislike worm more as I rethink about it.
