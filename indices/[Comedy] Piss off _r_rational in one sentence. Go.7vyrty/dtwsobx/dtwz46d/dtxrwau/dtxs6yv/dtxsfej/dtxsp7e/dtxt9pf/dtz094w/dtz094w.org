I think you're not giving Wildbow enough credit here. Not only is Taylor /obviously/ morally questionable from basically square 1, but she also experiences a huge amount of realistic losses right on top of the other really early in the story.

In terms of Taylor's character itself, you don't even need to look further than 1.01:

  It would be so easy, so easy to just go Carrie on the school. To give the trio their just desserts and make them regret what they had put me through: the vicious e-mails, the trash they'd upended over my desk, the flute --my mother's flute-- they'd stolen from my locker...

  I was all too aware that I'd get caught and arrested if I attacked my fellow students. There were three teams of superheroes and any number of solo heroes in the city. I didn't really care. The thought of my father seeing the aftermath on the news, his disappointment in me, his shame? That was more daunting, but it still didn't outweigh the anger and frustration.

  Except I was better than that.

Right off the bat we get a glimpse into her violent tendencies. She wants to take revenge. She doesn't even care much about the opinion of her own /father/ (one of the most sympathetic characters in the book) - the only thing holding her back from "going Carrie" on the school is her belief in her own moral superiority. For the rest of the story up until Arc 8, we keep seeing increasingly questionable decisions on her part that lead to direct punishment (using immense force against lung, coming up with the hostage plan at the bank, antagonizing Armsmaster because she can't listen to his perfectly reasonable advice, taking out Lung's /eyeballs/, using unsportsmanlike like tactics against the heroes at the Gala, and finally, burning the letter to Miss Militia) throughout each of which she maintains that she is making the right decision, even though she later faces /direct, well-foreshadowed/ consequences of each. None of these are excused by anything other than her internal monologue. Taylor was never doing "the right thing" as in the objectively correct decision, and an observant reader would have noticed this as well - it's just so easy to be suckered in and accept her narration as the objective facts. Her villainy isn't subtextual, it's literal.

As for early Deus Ex Machina, have any in mind? I think the Undersiders showing up against Lung was justified very well by the story in all respects, and it would be silly to dismiss it for not properly foreshadowing their existence in the /first arc/. The bank was nearly a flawless operation, but it made sense in context. Bakuda's toe rings were foreshadowed about a chapter after she first stepped on screen, and besides, in this fight Taylor takes heavy injuries and gets a concussion that's used to spur yet another plot forward. Lung's vulnerability to Newter's drug bodily fluids was foreshadowed in the meeting in Somer's Rock when Newter was introduced, and then again in Gregor's Interlude, I think. And in each of these early victories it's pretty explicitly stated that Taylor is hunkering down somewhere like fifty feet away while her bugs do all of the work. She's actually rarely in direct combat, and whenever she is it's treated like a very big deal. With Rachel she got stitches in her arm, in the bank she got knocked out with a fire extinguisher, with Bakuda she hurt her limbs again and got a concussion (which took a good week of recovery and never really got better until a bit after /Leviathan/), Oni Lee nearly decapitated her, etc.

I could go on forever. Just know that there are more details in /Worm/ than you remember. All of it is in the text if you aren't in a hurry to get it over with.
