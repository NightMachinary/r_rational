Well, 1 and 2 are entirely subjective criticisms (which is very annoying when they are levied against fans of the work with the attitude that these opinions were objective and everyone else is just wrong), but I wrote 3 to be just plain wrong (which is a different kind of annoying). Basically the whole point of Worm is that we're supposed to see Taylor as an extremely unreliable narrator making questionable choices, and the plot/story absolutely do not try to justify her decisions.
