  A bad head space doesn't excuse an obviously suicidal and dumb plan like this

Armsmaster's fragile mental state doesn't excuse taking this risk, but we're not trying to make excuses for Armsmaster's hubristic madness, and nor is the story. I'd also note that what we learn of Endbringers later makes his actions look far dumber in hindsight, and with understanding just how far he'd fallen to get to that point. It was still dumb given what Armsmaster believed about the Endbringers then, but people do dumb things all the time and Armsmaster is certainly no exception. He's a lot like Taylor, ironically enough---bad with impulse control, and can easily point out flaws in others but not his own biases. Eminently human failings, those.

  Mostly characters in serialised shows where they are given multiple character arcs or evolution of character. e.g Avatar

Prince Zuko is arguably the most complex and well-developed character in that series, and even he and his motivations can be summed up as “hotheaded prince” and “restoring honor,” respectively. Boiling down characters like that isn't wrong, necessarily, but it hardly captures the reasons why we build up empathy with these characters or appreciate their depth.
