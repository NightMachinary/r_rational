  Prince Zuko is arguably the most complex and well-developed character in that series, and even he and his motivations can be summed up as “hotheaded prince” and “restoring honor,” respectively. Boiling down characters like that isn't wrong, necessarily, but it hardly captures the reasons why we build up empathy with these characters or appreciate their depth.

The difference is that his character is actually explored but I already said my previous criticism wasn't completely fair.
