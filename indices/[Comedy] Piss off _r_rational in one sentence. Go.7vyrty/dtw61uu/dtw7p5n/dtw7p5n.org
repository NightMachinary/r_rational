A few more:

"It doesn't matter what others tell you. What matters is what you /believe in/."

While trying to tell someone about a well-known fact. "Nope. You are wrong." Guy shows you a random article from some obscure website. "See? This /proves/ you are wrong."

"That's the way it was always done. That means it's the right way, end of story."

When disagreeing and using Wikipedia as a source. "What the hell you are talking about? Everyone here tells you it's X, not Y. Who cares what internet has to say about it."
