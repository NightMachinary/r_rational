One story I've really been wanting to write is in a setting where magician's strengths are inversely related to how well they understand magic. So you discover you have the gift of magic, start playing around with it, learning its powers and limitations, write down the system, and suddenly you can't do magic anymore. Meanwhile your buddy, who also developed the gift but who is as dumb as a rock, continues to throw fireballs and enchantments around despite having no clue how it works.
