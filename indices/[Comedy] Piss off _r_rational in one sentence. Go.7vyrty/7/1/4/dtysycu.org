Ell Goonish Shive has something sorta like that, Magic is intelligent but not in a way we would recognise and the rules are "built?" with narrative causality in mind, they thus can be slightly inconsistent and with exsploitabilities and flexabilities but this is fine due to the cultural circumstances this iteration of magical law surrounds, if Magic can't remain in it's cultural context or it's fundamental laws are called into conflict and it cannot be resolved with minor subtle changes I.E. a magitech civilization limited by hideously expensive elemental aluminium finds a way to mass produce it or something philosophically important to the Magic like the distinction between organic and inorganic becomes irrelevant or like in the stories case fundamentally secret magic becomes public then the whole thing is rebuilt from the ground up, this principle works in reverse too, if the removal of some particular laws means that a race that uses shapeshifting in their biology can no longer shapeshift and would go exstinct then those laws are less likely to change. That said it's not that big a part of the story, if you want something much better then try reading Fine Structure, it quite different, rather darker, more complex and definitely "Sci-Fi"er and has a mechanic like that quite centeral, I shant say more.
