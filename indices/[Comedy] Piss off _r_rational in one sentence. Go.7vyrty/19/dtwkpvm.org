I'm going to steal a gem from a true master of the art:

"Do you realize what genre cavets and aesthetic trappings are? They're the things you put in a story to evoke a feeling that 'this is cyberpunk' or 'this is high fantasy' or 'this is a coming of age story'. Things like, megacorps which don't very much care about you, or not wanting to grow up and become an adult, or a strange new world that doesn't exactly operate according to your rules of logic (for example, strange wizards who do things in strange ways?). These are things that settings live on. If you drive a monster trunk full of your 'logic and reasoning' over these things, you are failing to understand what makes these settings evocative and inspiring in the first place."
