I will be honest. This one is one of the most annoying quotes in this entire post to me. The reason is that it was clearly written by someone who has some clue of what they were talking about but somehow missed the obvious reasons for rational fiction. A logical world with people acting with human minds has many advantages. The magic system or whatever is special about it sets as a different world, whereas the reasonable villains and others show that people are still people. The consistency of the world helps with immersion, and lets people speculate ahead regarding the plans of the characters. All of these are positives that require the logic the author of this quote hates. This person said something that sounds reasonable unless you think about for a minute and that annoys me the most. A consistent world with consistent people is plus whether you like exploring people or exploring worlds.
