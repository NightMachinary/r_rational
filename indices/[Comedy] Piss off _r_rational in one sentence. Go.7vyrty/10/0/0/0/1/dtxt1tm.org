I mean, /I/ don't have a million year long bucket list. I just have faith that future me will not run out of new things to do. And if she does, I'll hopefully have the option of increasing my intelligence to enable more novel experiences.

I don't think there's a finite number of interesting things to do in the universe, and I /definitely/ don't think that I'll ever reach a point where I'll say "ok, that's enough, i want to stop existing forever now." That's the kind of thing death-supporters claim old people say, and I see no reason why it'd be more likely at 8000000 than at 80.
