np! While I barely play it myself it's a super fascinating game with a big strategic depth. For the day you become invincible/get stuck in a timeloop/want to learn more I can recommend watching final tables of big tournaments (e.g. WSOP or Aussie Millions. recent one is [[http://www.twitch.tv/runitup/v/224579882]] ), where the casters can see the cards that players have and can explain what the thought processes are, or simply finding twitch poker streamers that you like (nanonoko, jeffgrosspoker, kevinmartin987, runitup, lexveldhuis and many more)
