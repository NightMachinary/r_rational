There may be a finite number of things to do, but that number is always increasing due to the millions of content creators. As you gathered more interests, eventually it would become simply impossible to keep up with everything.

Example: You can read a book in a day that would take an author a month to write. If you followed just ~30 authors then it would be a full-time job just to keep up with their work. And that's just one hobby.

Most authors are not that fast but the point still stands - no matter how long you live, there will be thousands of content creators creating content faster than you can consume it.
