A week late to the party, but I just want to nitpick about card-counting in poker. You can count cards in blackjack, but in poker the deck is completely reshuffled after every hand so it's completely worthless. Poker skills are about learning probabilities, bluffing, and reading and understanding all available information (raises, folds, bet sizes as well as unconscious signals people may send when nervous). If you're joined in your pursuit by other people you might be able to spend a lot of time one-upping and learning from each other.
