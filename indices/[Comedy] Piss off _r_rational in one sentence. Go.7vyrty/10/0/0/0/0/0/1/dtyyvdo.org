Eliezer has written a post on this [[https://lesswrong.com/lw/wx/complex_novelty/][exact problem]], more or less, so I recommend you read it.

Putting aside the fact that you /vastly/ underestimate how much of something it would take to get bored, and that you don't factor in the fact that some of these objectives might be done at the same time, we still haven't even skimmed the top of the barrel. How about: meet every human that ever lived, will live, and is living in every town within every country on every planet and get to know them until I love them better than they love themselves. Create simulated universes that perfectly represent my favorite fictional worlds and live out lifetimes as every single man woman and child within them, forgetting each time. Work on enough science to discover the key to faster-than-light travel and unravel the mysteries of the universe. Create alien species, if I can't find them on my own, and work silently to uplift them to the same standards that I hold myself.

The point isn't the amount of time any of these things take. The point is that I want to live a thousand years already in order to fulfill my goals, and in a thousand years I expect I'll want to live a thousand more. If these are things I can come up with as a sub-centenarian babe like myself, how many more objectives will I have thought up in a thousand years? What about a million? If I don't have any new goals, that's surely a crisis of creativity, not an objective limit on the number of possible unique mental states that a human can experience.
