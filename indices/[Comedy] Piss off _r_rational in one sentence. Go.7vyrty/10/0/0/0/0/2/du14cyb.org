#+begin_quote

  - Watch every amusing cat video
#+end_quote

They get repetitive and boring pretty quick.

#+begin_quote

  - Write every piece of fiction that pops into my head and won't go away
#+end_quote

You're just not creative enough.

#+begin_quote

  - Find out what life is like after you transform into a wolf or an eagle or a whale
#+end_quote

Pretty terrible, actually.

#+begin_quote

  - Become good enough at harp to perform in front of a major audience

20 years. 30 tops.

#+begin_quote

  - Read all the good fiction in existence
#+end_quote

2 years.

#+begin_quote

  - Watch all the episodes of Firefly that our Friendly AI friend will create for me
#+end_quote

Rocks fall, everybody dies.

#+begin_quote

  - Go back to school and acquire advanced degrees in history, politics, mathematics, computer science...
#+end_quote

8 - 24 years.

#+begin_quote

  - Have a life that is worth writing a memoir about and then write it
#+end_quote

Write it as you go.

#+begin_quote

  - Use an appropriate vehicle to explore the bottom of the ocean
#+end_quote

There's nothing there but a bunch of bottom feeders.

#+begin_quote

  - ...and the inside of the sun
#+end_quote

Nope.

#+begin_quote

  - Perform a North Polar traversal of Saturn
  - Go asteroid mining and strike it rich
#+end_quote

So /boring/!

#+begin_quote

  - Play high stakes poker and win
  - Play high stakes poker and lose
#+end_quote

Does it have to be poker?

#+begin_quote

  - Meet the love of my life and make her happy
#+end_quote

Never going to happen, I don't care how long you live.

#+begin_quote

  - Go on a space walk
  - Live in a space station
  - Ride on a space elevator
#+end_quote

What is this, a bucket list? If you want to do it, just do it already. Okay, fine:

#+begin_quote

  - Go on a space walk
#+end_quote

No actual walking involved.

#+begin_quote

  - Live in a space station
#+end_quote

It's kind of interesting for the first 30 minutes, and then they show you the toilets.

#+begin_quote

  - Ride on a space elevator
#+end_quote

Takes way too long and doesn't get you very far.
