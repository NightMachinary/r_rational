So us being able to live for 1 mil+ years is something you're willing to debate back and forth but the idea that, in that time, we'd find some way to surpass the current limits of our own biology (which, in case I need to point it out, is a /mandatory requirement of living that long/) is where you draw the line and call it a pipe dream?

That's....dumb.
