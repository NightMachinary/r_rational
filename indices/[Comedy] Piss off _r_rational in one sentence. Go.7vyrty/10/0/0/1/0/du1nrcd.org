Can you provide any solid evidence that this is not a result of humans aging physically? That it is specifically caused by us having been alive for more years, and nothing else? That if we achieved some manner of immortality and ceased physical aging, and spent all of our lives with as much energy and ability to act as we have in, say, our mid 20s to 30s, we would still stop caring about stuff after roughly a century?
