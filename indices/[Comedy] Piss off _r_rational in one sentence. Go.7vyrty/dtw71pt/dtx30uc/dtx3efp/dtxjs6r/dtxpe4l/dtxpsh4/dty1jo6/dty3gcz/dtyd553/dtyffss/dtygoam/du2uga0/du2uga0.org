Then they could have taken a few seconds to /show/ those extra days. It would have cost maybe six minutes total of the episode to show the blacksmith running heroically through the snowy landscape (and lets forget he saw snow the first time in his life just days ago, and has lived in a city all his life), shown the gang on the island suffering from the cold more and more every day, and shown the raven and dragonflight passing over various geography at various times of day. It could have been short cuts mixed in with some other part of the plot going on.

Terribly handled. I was going /"oh, come on!"/ multiple times in that episode. And it doesn't end with the travel times.

Like when Snow decides to run /away/ from the rescue dragon (/doh!/), fall and /sink/ into a freezing lake, not only survive but crawl up, find his sword within easy reach and then /not/ die from hypothermia before a deus ex ranger rides in, puts snow on his undead-immune horse and then promtly sacrifices himself. It is so /obvious/ that those painful plot acrobatics were just to make Denny worried and then happy when Snow lives.

So, yeah, that rant felt good. It's even more glaring when the series is so damn good in other aspects.
