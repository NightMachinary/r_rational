it was a problem through the whole series that came to a head with that flight.

More and more, characters started jumping around from place to place like they had jetpacks. Littlefinger and Varys were the worst about this. They would pop 1000 miles in the course of an episode, where it took months in the past. This was hand-waved all along by show watchers as just asynchronous timelines, and while it felt weak it was an explanation that just had to be accepted.

The scene on the frozen lake put an end to the timeline explanation.

Here we had events that had to be lined up chronologically, because they were causal.

1. Jon and team gets chased by wights.\\
2. Jon sends Gendry to run to the wall.
3. Jon is trapped on the island in the lake. it is day time and the lake is melty.\\
4. Gendry runs to the wall - a trip that was a substantial trek just an episode earlier\\
5. A raven is dispatched to Dany\\
6. Raven arrives at Danny. It is day time.\\
7. Dany starts flying to the wall.\\
8. It's night time on the lake, and the ice freezes. wights attack.\\
9. Dany arrives.

This all has to happen in less than a single day. The distance from Dragonstone to the wall is thousands of miles. It's completely implausible, and compiled on top of all the previous examples of teleporting characters it just broke the ice, so to speak.
