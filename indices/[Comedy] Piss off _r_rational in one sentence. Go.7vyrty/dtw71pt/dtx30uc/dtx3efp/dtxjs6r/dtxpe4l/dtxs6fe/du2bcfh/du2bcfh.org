Not the original commenter but, in my opinion, it's because there's a difference between upfront, stated and accepted suspension of disbelief (aka "Wands let people do magic") and unexplained inconsistent disbelief (aka "These horseless carriages are actually pulled by winged death-horses that you can't see and no one's mentioned in the four years you've been here")

The issue's magnified by how much it impacts the plot. Thestrals weren't 'game breaking' (floos, brooms, apparition, etc.) so it was fine, to a point. The GoT thing was legitimately game breaking.
