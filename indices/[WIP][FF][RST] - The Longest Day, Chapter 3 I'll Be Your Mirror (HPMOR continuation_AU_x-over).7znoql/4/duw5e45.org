Great chapter! I only liked the Hermione portions of chapter one and two, but this chapter finally made me like the Harry and the ponies part too.

Harry and Pinkie's conversation was everything that the Twilight-investigating-Pinkie's-pinky-sense-episode failed to be. I quite liked Harry's reaction.
