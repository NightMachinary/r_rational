Nothing really explicitly says that death doesn't happen, but I also can't recall ever seeing a character explicitly die.

But there are several non-Princess characters where it's implicit that they're hundreds of years old. For example, King Sombra courted Celestia hundreds of years ago. And Granny Smith was around at the founding of Ponyville, which is hundreds of years old.
