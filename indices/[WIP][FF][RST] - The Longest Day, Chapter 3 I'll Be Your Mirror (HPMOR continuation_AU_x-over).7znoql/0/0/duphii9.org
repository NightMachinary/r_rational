  I'm guessing she didn't start out with a viewpoint so closely aligned with Harry's, but is good enough at making friends and sherlocking that she knew that's what she needed to say to reach him, and maybe also ended up believing it in order to be his friend.

Pretty much. People don't really seem to /die/ in the MLP universe, so she's kind of unfamiliar with the concept, but it's easy enough for her to see how it would make someone sad, really, really sad. Pinkie doesn't like to see people sad, and she's very, very good at figuring out what buttons she needs to press in order to make people not-sad.

That said, I don't think their viewpoints were that far different to begin with. She just phrased her own beliefs in a way that would resonate with Harry in specific.

    How did Harry guess that the Philosopher's Stone is real and Dumbledore hides it?

It's mentioned in later chapters that Harry has read about the Philosopher's Stone and its owner, Nicholas Flamel, and it's open knowledge that Dumbledore is friends with Flamel. Although Harry thinks the powers are exaggerated, he expects that Dumbledore is not as skeptical.

As for guessing that it might be hidden at Hogwarts, well, if Canon!First Year Harry and HPMOR!Draco were able to figure it out, I think it's well within the capabilities of HPMOR!Harry to figure out as well.
