That's a fair point, I guess we can just chalk this up to different interpretations of what Harry thought of the Stone in Chapter 87, prior to Quirrell's confirmation. I interpreted Harry's skepticism as being about the /powers/ of the Stone, rather than its /existence/. The same way he might look at a Muggle magician's magic wand and say "That's not a real wand."

Discord really only mentions the Stone as a way to get Harry thinking about Dumbledore. At this particular moment, Harry is more focused on this prophecy that Discord is talking about than he is the Stone.

All that said, the Stone is still something of interest to Harry. I suspect his non-reaction in this chapter will make more sense in the context of the upcoming chapter, wherein he has a little chat with Dumbledore about several matters, the Stone being one of them.
