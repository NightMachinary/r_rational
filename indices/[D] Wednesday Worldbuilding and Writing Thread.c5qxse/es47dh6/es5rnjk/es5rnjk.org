Some of this depends on how powerful the powers that the supersoldiers get. You could imagine some supers that can assure mutually assured destruction however most powers wouldn't, which would have a significant impact on the progress of the cold war.

I imagine that the US would use most of this serum on it's soldiers meaning that you damn well want to be sure that your vets gain a good pension and a good therapist to avoid them blowing up train stations and whatever.

I think that it's a mistake to have supers become crimefighters from an optimization point of view. Superstrong supers violate conservation of energy and can be used to produce renewable electricity, used for research to understand where the holes in our understanding of physics are, and can for many purposes replace multiple squats of soldiers/tanks/battlecruisers.

Personality enhancing powers would make great politicians, spies, teachers, or would just quickly rise to the top of whatever organization they were in. Mental enhancing powers would make great researchers, city-planners, advicers, economists, and anything related to investment or risk. Mind-reading is excellent for negotiations. Same goes for folks that have powers related to post or precognition. People with telekinesis can make a killing in transportation or heavy menial Labour.

There's a lot better uses of supers than to send them after criminals, especially when the number of super criminals should be low when the US government have control of the source of powers.
