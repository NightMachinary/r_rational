Thanks!

Yep, all those are likely to make an appearance. Gaining the powers themselves would be too OP, but gaining biological features (even ones induced by powers) is generally fair game.

By this metric, Kryptonians and other beings of that level would be fine, but honestly I might make specific exceptions to things like that - it's just too much power. Repeatedly eating Crawler until he can't anymore is definitely going to happen at some point.

Generally, full free shapeshifting is a direction I don't want to go, but there will be some more limited kinds. For example, obviously there are octopuses, and on the more fantastical bent from other settings there are kandra from Mistborn, who can shapeshift as much as their knowledge (and gastronomic history) allows, but they can't make hard tissue.

To me the main problem with full, unrestricted shapeshifting (especially the supernaturally empowered kind) is that with enough knowledge, logically it enables the ability to split off biomass from yourself and create an army just by eating. Obviously there are ways to mitigate this, but I don't think there are reasonable ways to prevent it from /eventually/ happening.
