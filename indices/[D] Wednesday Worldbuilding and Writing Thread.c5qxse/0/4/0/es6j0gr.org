I love Super Minion! Yes, it is a little like that, but there is a difference in my mind that is very important. This difference is the fact that Tofu analyses, understands and reproduces the biology and my MC do not (or rather, only understands it on a basic level). This means he doesn't have too much potential to become an expert biologist turned mad scientist, which I generally favour from a story perspective. Better to keep things at a lower level as much as possible without feeling contrived, if you ask me.

Going with the Super Minion approach, the main character necessarily has to understand the biology on a deep and practical level to produce results. Obviously, this knowledge and skill can have all sorts of unintended and unknown consequences and paths of action. Since I don't have anything like that knowledge, I wouldn't be able to do all of that justice, so I prefer to limit the options.

I think having biology function somewhat like static upgrades is a good direction to go, because it can still be pretty interesting (biology is fascinating) and makes this story actually feasible for me to write.

Sorry, I seem to go on a lot. Obviously I've got a ways to go before I'll be writing this story. And it's really late right now so brain don't work good.
