That is a pretty good way of doing it. Has the power still be strong but not 'I can solo the world with my eyes closed' strong.

Also while reading your comment I just rememberd that the [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/7887/Toriko][Toriko manga]] was a thing and it is mostly biological baced shonnen super powers with some food baced mysticism thrown in there. It's like the author took a look at what biology can do in the real world and cranked that shit up to 11 ... out of a possible 5.

You got trees that grow so fast their branches can chase and hunt people down, animals who's survival instinct are so good they can predict and react to threats years before they happen while on the other side of the planet, a character who's 'hair' is actually a set of hyper thin prehensile tentacles that can bind opponents up and intimidation and social combat being a thing with Toriko being able to make a grown man piss himself in the first chapter and being able to avoid fights with animals stronger than him by being so threatening they don't want to mess with him. The manga has a few problems, the ending being rushed the main one, but I adore the power system and 'natural world x100,000,000' flavoring behind it.
