Ha! Funny thing, I'm actually thinking this fic would /start off/ in MHA. The way I'm likely to have it, is that they can't gain the quirks themselves, only products of them.

For example, he could gain a strength boost by eating the hyper-efficient muscles of someone with biologically based super strength, but eating someone who had super strength based on their quirk magically directly applying force wouldn't result in any gain. TBH, I think this is the only way it could work without being OP, since the MC's quirk /already/ optimises things to avoid accruing negative traits. Otherwise he could just go grave robbing for an absurd power boost.

Other superhero settings are likely to function the same way. Basically, if it's biologically plausible it's fair game, but if it's too weird then it's not gonna happen.
