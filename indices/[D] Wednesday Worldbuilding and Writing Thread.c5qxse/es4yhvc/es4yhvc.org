I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas /about the magic/ not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world.

Death Magic. Death magic is related to flesh magic, except it instead reverses the biological process to bring the flesh to it's original state as long as the enchantment lasts. Death magic is powered by arbitrary matter (including optionally the flesh it is being applied to), the more matter (and denser) the longer the death magic enchantment lasts. Living flesh can only have it's own flesh consumed (not arbitrary matter) as a power source. In general death magic got it's name for reviving the dead, this is a laborious process which involves visualizing each of the things the caster wants the dead to be able to do.

Examples:

- Speak With the Dead: Assuming the head is mostly intact, a death mage can imaging the process of death reversing to when the head was able to speak and converse with it. The original personality of the dead is not there (unless the death mage knew them well enough) but memories can be somewhat accessed.
- Raise Dead: By visualizing a sequence of things a person could do before death a corpse (or skeleton for better mages) can be made into a poor soldier. However the dead will not know anything the caster does not visualize, reflexes and memory can be recovered by the magic, but if the caster does not visualize jumping then the dead will not be able to jump even if their reflexes were impressive, If the caster does not visualize opening doors then the dead won't be able to navigate buildings, even if it has memories of secret entrances.
- Revival: As long as a person isn't warm and dead (or their death was quite recent) a death mage can revive them, though it takes a heavy toll (metabolic energy wise, but not permanent) on the death mage.
- Destroy Flesh / Beautify: By reversing the biological process of something living and powering it with itself, they can destroy arbitrary flesh. Done gently one can look younger, but it takes an equivalent number of years of the being's life.
