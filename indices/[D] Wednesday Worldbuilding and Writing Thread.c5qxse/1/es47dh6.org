I'll apologize in advance for any mistakes I make regarding community guidelines. This is my first time commenting or posting here, and while I have read them, I may accidentally slip up.

So, I am trying to build a superhero setting from an alternate history where a meteorite containing a special serum was able to give a select few U.S. soldiers superpowers in World War 2. Essentially, they replaced the development of nuclear weapons as it happened in real life.

This leads to the U.S. being a much more powerful superpower and throwing their weight around because they have the superpowered muscle to back it up.

EDIT: I should have added more.

Everyone gets a different superpower from the serum, and their children have a chance of having superpowers. The powers are not exactly the same though, and are not even guaranteed to be similar.

About ~5 years after the war ends is when superheroes become government sanctioned crime fighters.

- What pieces of world history should I absolutely not forget when constructing how things went down up through to the present day?

- Are there any easy mistakes that one can make when going off of this kind of divergence point?
