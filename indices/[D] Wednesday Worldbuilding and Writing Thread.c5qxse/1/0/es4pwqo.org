Huh? I mean, I think I know where you're going with this, but that's a distinctly strange mental image.

  What pieces of world history should I absolutely not forget when constructing how things went down up through to the present day?
#+end_quote

For some less obvious ones (i.e. not directly part of the Cold War or the Civil Rights Movement)...

- The rebuilding of Japan, and their innovations in the field of quality control
- The Chinese Civil War
- The relentless expansion of the American military-industrial complex
- The Catholic reforms of Vatican II
- The establishment of Israel and the resulting wars in the area

  Are there any easy mistakes that one can make when going off of this kind of divergence point?

The two things that I would caution are flip side of the same coin. If an event is due to a long-term trend, then a small deviation in surrounding events are unlikely to change it much. On the other hand, if something only happened because the right sequence of events happened at the right time, then a small deviation in that sequence of events will absolutely chance things.

As an example, Kennedy probably would have passed some kind of expansion of civil rights, even if he hadn't been assassinated and LBJ did so in his name. On the other hand, the terrific expense of the moon missions may have caused them to be scrapped if Kennedy hadn't been shot, because a lot of that impetus came from his death.

And the US probably would have ended up in another Middle East war if 9/11 hadn't happened. And Congress may even have found a way to pass the Patriot Act, or something like it. But the Department of Homeland Security probably wouldn't have been created if a profound attack hadn't shown Americans just how bad their federal agencies were at communicating with each other.
