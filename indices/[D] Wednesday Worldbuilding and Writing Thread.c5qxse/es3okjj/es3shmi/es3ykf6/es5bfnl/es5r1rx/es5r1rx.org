I would want two things out of such a story.

Firstlly, I want to see an exploration of the social stigma surrounding cannibalism and the disgust/selfloath that could come from eating people, ideally in some kind of analogy to veganism. I feel that there needs to be a good, and preferably utilitarian, excuse for why someone need to use that power.

Possible themes to explore includes rules such as 'only eat non-sentient beings' however in most universes the truly powerful beings as sentient so it's a severe limitation. If I were in this case I might make a rule that I would never eat a sentient being that I myself killed in order to avoid becoming someone who makes up flimsy excuses to hunt down people. Or have a very strict rule about what people have to have done for me to hunt them down. You could possibly do it in a humane way(i.e. drug someone, slice a piece of delicious meat from them, and use a restorative power to restore said meat).

Secondly, I want to see someone be smart about this strong a power. In the few stories I know of with a protagonist with this kind of metapower, the power accumulation always start out with an accident and the protagonist just gains powers as story appropriate. I want the protagonist to gather information and find the best approach to gaining a well rounded power set. At minimum you want some kind of offensive power, some kind of all purpose defence(forcefield, dragonscales, being able to turn into mist, possibly mental defence as well.) and some kind of fast movement(teleportation is ideal but fast running or flying can work), information gathering power and anti information powers, as well as any power that aids in power accumulation(such as a way of generating money so you can buy people's redundant organs, temporarily neutralize powers, generating people's muscles, restoring muscles to long deseased powerusers etc.)

In terms of actually answering your questions, other have already done a good job of covering most things. I'll add that there's a good chunk of biopunk universes(e.g. twig), the parasytes in the Parasyte anime are biological, in the naturo verse chakra is stored and controlled biologically(I think?), and in a good chunk of magical universes the magic is stored physically somewhere. Though I would stay the heck away from the naruto verse until I had mental defences and the heck away from Parasyte until I had a lot of physical powers going for me.
