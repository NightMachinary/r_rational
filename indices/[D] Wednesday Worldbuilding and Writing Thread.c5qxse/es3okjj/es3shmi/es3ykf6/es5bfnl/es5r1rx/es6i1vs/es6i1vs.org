Sorry for the wall of text!

  I feel that there needs to be a good, and preferably utilitarian, excuse for why someone need to use that power.

Yeah, at some points there are going to be situations where it's arguably the right move to eat a person's body. Whether or not the character would go for it is another matter entirely that relies on the specifics of it all. Your note about settings rules for hunting down and killing people and the justifying thereof is a good one, and though I've thought of it before you've definitely expanded on it.

Eating only non-sapients is going to be the main rule they abide by. While it's true that the best powers are usually reserved for the people of a given setting rather than the animals, there are still many powerful creatures that you don't need to feel guilty about killing to eat.

And, it's not just fictional organisms on the menu. The story is going to start out in My Hero Academia, which is basically Earth with superpowers and a bit in the future. There are loads of awesome powers you could gain just from real organisms, plus I think I can easily justify unexpected synergies. What the power actually does is optimise his body based and input and criteria, with the input being the food that it can select from, and the criteria being how it makes those selections. These criteria include, to some degree, the wishes of the user, but it's still a passive power rather than active so it's never going to be full controllable.

In regards to the MC being smart about his power, that's definitely going to happen, but I think you're overestimating the gains he can make. Pretty much any power that is basically just magic isn't going to be acquirable. Generally only macro scale physical features will be available, and while there will be some exceptions (special cells that lack senescence etc) gaining whole powers isn't a direction I want to go.

For example, if someone has the power to fly through generation of reactionless thrust, he's not going to be able to gain that by eating it. Same thing goes for powers like telekinesis, teleportation etc. But he can totally gain things like acid spit, hyperefficient biology, radio eyes etc.

I'm inclined to stick with this limitation when it comes to other settings, too. Some magic abilities will be on the menu, many will not. He could still gain and learn some forms of magic that are available through other methods, but that'll be limited too.

Looking at what I've written, I feel like maybe I've dialled down the MC's power too low, but maybe not. I honestly do think staying on the lower level of possible power for this idea is beneficial, since even with all these restrictions he's going to be maybe still a bit OP.

Due to the unreliable nature of when and how powers manifest in My Hero Academia, the first use of it will definitely be an accident. But you can rest assured that afterwards he'll be doing his best to gain the most from it. He's not going to be some hypercompetent genius about it, but he IS going to be realistically smart about it. There is going to be a bit of the story mirroring real life in that he's obviously going to use the internet and other resources to look up interesting things to eat, just like I am doing to find interesting bits for the story.

Now we're finally up to the reply to your final paragraph, sorry about that. Twig, Parasyte, and Naruto are all most likely going to make an appearance. Still good suggestions though. I think next time I post about this story I should include a list of what I've already thought of or had suggested to me. Your mention of other biopunk universes intrigues me, could you name some? Twig is the only real one that I could think of.

IIRC you could justify that having no chakra at all would protect against mental attacks in Naruto, and even without it he may be able to stay out of sight for long enough to remedy this weakness. Physical toughness is likely to be one of our MC's highest stats, right behind perception (note: this isn't a litrpg ;P), so parasytes aren't likely to be too much of a problem, especially since they're typically alone - and once you've eaten one the others aren't near as much of a threat. It's partly for this reason that I'm actually thinking of just transplanting the parasytes into some other setting as some bio-experiment, like Star Wars or something(their psychic sense would slot well into force sensitivity). They're the only real interesting thing about their setting, so I feel like not much would be lost here anyway.

Phew! That was a long one! Thanks for giving me so much to think about though, I relish the opportunity to dive into these things.
