Most of the D&D Monster Manual

It's even sorted out for you! Your character should be able to gain any ability tagged Ex, which means it comes from the monster being simply exceptional. The other categories of special abilities are Su or Sp, which boil down to "magic" and thus probably don't count.

For example, if your character ate some [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/vampire.htm][vampire steaks]], they could get the ability to drain blood, fast healing, resistance to electricity and cold, the ability to climb like a spider, and a bit of resistance to priests - but not the ability to dominate folks with a glance.

Also, arguably, eating bits of an entity with higher stats should grant the character stat points.
