The obvious low-hanging fruit here would be DC, Marvel, Worm, and other superhero settings. Chock-full of absurd and absurdly overpowered biologically-based superpowers: Kryptonians, Asgardians, Bonesaw's experiments, and so on. You could even consider some funky synergies with Crawler from Worm, whose power is /also/ focused on biological adaptation (and there are probably dozens of characters similar to him in other franchises).

But if I had to talk about fictional biology I found most /interesting/, and not overpowered specifically, then it would probably be the main character and other shapeshifter species from Everybody Loves Large Chests. Pretty cool overall.
