I'm still plotting out that story where the main character has the ability to passively gain beneficial traits from anything organic that he eats. At some point, I might be making this story a multicross, with many new settings introduced.

What is some interesting biology from other fictional settings that you think is interesting?

Also, you all gave some really good advice for real adaptations, so if you've got more of that I'd love to hear it!
