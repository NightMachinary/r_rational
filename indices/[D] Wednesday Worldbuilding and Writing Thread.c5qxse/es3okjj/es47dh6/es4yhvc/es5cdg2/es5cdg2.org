I think that for this system to make any kind of sense you're gonna have to really nail down the metaphysical underpinnings of life and death in your universe.

'cuz IRL, death isn't an off switch. Sure, there's people who are definitely alive, and there's people who are definitely dead, but in between there's a whole spectrum - and as medical technology advances, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbE8E1ez97M][that spectrum gets wider]].

Like let's say you've got some peasants who're getting guillotine happy. They've lopped off the head of the King. A loyal Death Mage nabs up the head at the moment of severance.

King's dead, right? His head's fallen off. So the Death Mage applies the "power from arbitrary matter" ability to preserve the head.

Except time passes. It's a hundred years later, and a whole school of death mages have been passing the insanely well-preserved head of the King down for generations.

Now, we have the technology. The technology to hook the king's head up to a bellows and run some air through his vocal cords. Turns out, he wasn't quite dead this whole time! The head can survive for a few painful moments when separated from the body! Also he's really mad because he's been living those few painful moments for the last century!

Or let's say you're really rich but also very old. So you pay a Death Mage to make you younger. Oh, but the Death Mage can't do that! Living flesh can only consume itself!

So they kill you. Stop your heart. You're dead. Mr. Death Mage uses like ten cows to revert you back to your early 20's. Then Mr. Lightning Mage starts your heart back up again. Hooray, you're cured of old age!

If you don't want things like this to work, you're going to have to basically /give/ people some sort of metaphysical off switch that says "you're definitely dead and also you're not coming back to life", and with which death magic interacts. At that point you might as well just call it a soul imo.
