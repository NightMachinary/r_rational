It depends. Some of them can be killed just like everyone else, but some have powers that are able to help them get out of trouble of the kinds you listed above. However, I'd say most of them probably can't beat a tank one-on-one. The other threats there are relatively minor since anyone without a combative power would be helping out with intelligence, infiltration, etc.
