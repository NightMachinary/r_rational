Very good point, and I've been thinking about it. In this setting, the idea of being a 'superhero' is an American cultural trend. All comics as of 1941 were made as war propaganda to boost morale for the people that were using real powers now.

The sanctioning of heroes is mostly to give the public a sense of safety after some scuffles between the super community and the civilians.

All the same, I should give some thought to those supers who would rather go into a more traditional field. After 70+ years, there's really no way that it should be an uncommon phenomena unless some sort of law is put into place outlawing it, which just seems silly.

Thank you very much!
