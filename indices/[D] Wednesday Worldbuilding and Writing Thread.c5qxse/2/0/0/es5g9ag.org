  I think that for this system to make any kind of sense you're gonna have to really nail down the metaphysical underpinnings of life and death in your universe.

  If you don't want things like this to work, you're going to have to basically give people some sort of metaphysical off switch that says "you're definitely dead and also you're not coming back to life", and with which death magic interacts. At that point you might as well just call it a soul imo.

I have but they are semi-spoilers.

  Sure, there's people who are definitely alive, and there's people who are definitely dead, but in between there's a whole spectrum

Agreed. A death mage can only get a full biological revival if they reverse the process of death (e.g. the patient is not totally dead on a couple of important metrics). After that they can only perform a magical revival which is bringing about an "undead".

  [head thing]

Brilliantly macabre, and well within the bounds I expected (though your specific example breaks some rules, and would be the fulltime job of 10 death mages to preserve the head using only death magic, but it could work with some minor changes). Yes death magic can allow a person to be preserved forward in time and then revived.

  So they kill you. Stop your heart. You're dead. Mr. Death Mage uses like ten cows to revert you back to your early 20's. Then Mr. Lightning Mage starts your heart back up again. Hooray, you're cured of old age!

This example breaks a couple of rules. For starters the magic that can be done on dead flesh and live flesh are separate, because there are different processes in motion. To give a simple metaphor, a death mage can't reverse the aging process if you aren't aging anymore. Also if the death mage can't bring you back then an electric shock definitely can't.
