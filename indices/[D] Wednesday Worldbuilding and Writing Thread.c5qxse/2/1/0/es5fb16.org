  Why is the change temporary?

This was a failure of explanation on my part. So there are effectively two classes of reversed effects. Those that use magic to effect the world as if the state was reversed, like having a skeleton walk around. And those that are reversing actual biological matter from one state to another, like reviving someone recently dead. One might even call them two different magics, but the study of them is so intertwined they are considered one magic.

  can this be munchkin into death magic powered mechanical power?

Not in a useful way I would imagine. Fissioning the raw material used in the spell would give one more energy. Or just instructing a skeleton to spin a crank.

  Death magic sounds like a paramedics best friend?

A journeyman death mage (10+ years experience; journeyman is the peak most mages reach) can do 3-4 revivals per hour for about 8 hours per day without collapsing of exhaustion. The revival is effectively temporary, it's basically jump-starting the patients body for a few seconds. The technique is actually to spend a couple minutes fixing up the patients body as best as possible (using stuff like CPR to buy more time) before attempting the revival. They also have to be rationed so most patients will only get two revival attempts (times out the death mage for 30 minutes), one in a triage situation if that. People still die.
