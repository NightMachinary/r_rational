> to it's original state as long as the enchantment lasts

Why is the change temporary? Is their some cosmic entropic fairness that resists permanent change, or is their magic too inferior or clumsy to allow for a permanent change? If it's a completely reversal when the enchantment ends, can this be munchkin into death magic powered mechanical power?

Death magic sounds like a paramedics best friend? The revival mechanic sounds like it is not intended to be temporary, but even if it is, other interventions can be used to stabilize the person after the death magic fades?
