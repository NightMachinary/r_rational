You're right that diachronically it doesn't work, but synchronically... users of the language don't always have the history in front of them when making those linguistic connections.

I don't know if |с| is normally thought of by native speakers as two different words, or one word with two different constructions---like |за| and |по|, which take multiple cases for different meanings and /do/ have a single etymology---but I wouldn't be surprised if at least /some/ people treat it as if it were a single word with meanings perhaps related in a folk-etymological way.

(As an example with a different word, just today I learned that a /pool/ of water and a /pool/ of funds are apparently not related etymologically, but I've certainly considered /pooling/ a single concept of material literally or metaphorically being collected into a mass. Conflation of concepts is certainly a thing that can happen when the sound and spelling of diverse words also fall together.)
