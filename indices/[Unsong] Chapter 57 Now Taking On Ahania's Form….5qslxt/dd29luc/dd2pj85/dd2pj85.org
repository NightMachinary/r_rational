And, in fact, to quote a great man,

#+begin_quote
  "Such as...?"

  "Such as 'The Sun is a star.' Or 'Mars is a rusty place with deserts and volcanos, like Sinai.' Or 'A body in motion tends to remain in motion.' Or--let's see now"--she quickly scribbled some numbers on a pad--" 'The Earth weighs a million million million million times as much as a child.' Or--I recognize that both of you seem to have some trouble with special relativity, but it's confirmed every day routinely in particle accelerators and cosmic rays--how about 'There are no privileged frames of reference'? Or even 'Thou shalt not travel faster than light.' anything they couldn't possible have known three thousand years ago."

  "Any others?" Joss asked.

  "Well, there's an indefinite number of them--or at least one for every principal of physics. Let's see... 'Heat and light hid in the smallest pebble.' Or even 'The way of the Earth is as two, but the way of the lodestone is as three.' I'm trying to suggest that the gravitational force follows an inverse square law, while the magnetic dipole force follows an inverse cube law. Or in biology"--she nodded toward der Heer, who seemed to have taken a vow of silence--"how about 'Two strands entwined is the secret of life'?"

And indeed, as she goes on, she points out that God might well have wanted to lay proof of his actions for the "wise and learned", but could just have easily left a colossal crucifix in orbit or something. The whole "electricity" thing is really weak. For instance, God Himself describes creation like so:

#+begin_quote
  Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
#+end_quote

I do not know which Hebrew word is here translated into "foundations", but if the Zionist scholars decided that an apt translation was "the forces of gravity exerted by the Sun" or "the gradual disintegration of a pre-solar accretion disk", they would not, in fact, be plumbing the depths of knowledge evinced by the author of Job.

Edit: just for completion's sake, chashmal is used exactly twice in the Torah (IIRC, in the book of Ezekiel to describe angels, and their actions); it is /not/ used to describe lightning, or static shocks, or brain activity in any sense. Crucially, angels in UNSONG aren't really described that way either, at least not yet.
