Yeah, I was unclear on it when OP posted the theory, and he never replied to why the marriage name is relevant. Best I could come up with is that without it, sharing the Explicit Name with a Robin interred in Hell would require the long reach of a (long distance-cast?) Marriage Name and umm .... Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not it. Whatever it is, I'll be surprised if it is so direct a mechanism that today's post gives any real weight to it.
