  I once read an atheist tract that asked why God didn't prove His omniscience by putting predictions about science or technology in the Bible. The answer is that He did and they're just not thinking kabbalistically enough to notice. Any Israeli schoolchild can open up the Book of Ezekiel and see a 6th century BC prophet describe the angels he encounters as “glowing with electricity”.

This whole book is overflowing with what I want to call "confirmation bias", but may in fact be a new type of fallacy that has yet to be taxonomized by fallacy-ologists. I've thought about it for a while but it only really came to a head in Interlude ש‎: Obama. Like, Obama's daughter is named Malia. The personification of evil? Well, the /obvious/ objection is that Malia is a normal Hawaiian name, but the /strong/ objection is that it's the Hawaiian version of Mary (presumably not evil incarnate). And the prophecy given by Lovecraft specifies that the strange dark one will wear red robes, whereas Obama wore blue.

I know, there are other counterarguments you could make, but all this really shows is that the similarity of two sets increases exponentially the more you're willing to disregard the contrary evidence.

On an unrelated note, I'm nominating Sarah for a "The ring is mine!" moment at some point before the story's over.
