I suppose there's no reason he couldn't have, apart from that that poem is titled "Nyarlathotep", and "-hotep" is an Egyptian suffix.

(I will take your word that barak o'bama is how "lightning and heaven" is pronounced in Hebrew. But, being moderately fond of linguistics, I have yet to find a language that conflates the concept of "and" and "of/from")

That isn't really the point though, I was just musing that if you're willing to accept absolutely no rigor whatsoever you can sort of prove anything; even if we're not accepting non-religious evidence, there's all kinds of alternative interpretation. Satan may quote the scripture for his own purpose and all that.
