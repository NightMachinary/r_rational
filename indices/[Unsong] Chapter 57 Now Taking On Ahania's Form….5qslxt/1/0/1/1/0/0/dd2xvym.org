That wasn't the point?

When you read a text written thousands of years ago talking about something even further back and it says "egypt", that doesn't refer to modern egypt, it refers to a lot of Africa, possibly including the birthplace of Obama's father. Ergo, kabbalistically, Obama is 'descended from egypt' or whatever.

Applying the modern US borders or what have you to kabbalah concepts is different from applying modern borders to the territory being referred to in the past
