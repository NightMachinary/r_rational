I know and love the series for its place in history, and if you can get past the cultural dissonance they're actually pretty fun.

My point/headcanon/joke was combining the fact that FTL travel implies time-reversal and that the only net-energy-gain for nuclear reactions of iron is in the past, means that the FTL ships can go FTL /because/ they can go FTL. It's an engine that goes because it can't start.
