Now, keep in mind this series was begun in the 30's, prior to the Manhatten Project. Triplanetary was first serialized in 1934. The series as a whole also features star pumped x ray lasers, relativstic projectiles, antimatter projectiles, relativistic planets, antimatter planets, and /relativistic antimatter planets/ used as weapons.

There is a trope called [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace][Lensmen Arms Race]] for a reason.

I think he gets a pass on that one.
