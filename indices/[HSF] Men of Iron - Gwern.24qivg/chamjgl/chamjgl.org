It's funny, If you read the really, really old sci fi "Lensmen" series, in the prequel 'Triplanetary', there was a race whose entire culture ran on some kind of fusion engine that only consumed allotropic iron. They can to our solar system to get it, because their system by chance had very little of it.

Of course, our heroes managed to steal the technology, as well as their FTL, reverse engineer and improve upon it, and return home in a stolen ship.

But their mining technique was very similar to this, only they stole it from the ships in space at the time. And it also stole the iron from the bodies of humans if I recall.
