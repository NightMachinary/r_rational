Now that's good stuff.

I'm not sure I'm convinced that just imagining stuff happen, without any external stimulus (since the narrator in the story is able to distinguish between memories and events, there has to be some noticeable distinction between what people there imagine and what is really happening), would be sufficient to make it into utopia, but then I remember [[http://i.imgur.com/Y17qMMp.jpg][a Terraria player spending years entertaining themselves by imagining things the game can't feasibly support happen]] and, in general, people who are really into roleplay and yeah, for sure it would be a paradise for this kind of people at least.

Virtual currencies are possibly feasible, yeah. I guess they could be used in exchange for stories and to facilitate the creation of more stories.

I don't think communication through Sivad would be possible, the form it takes seems to be everyone's personal delusion and it avoids disclosing most of the info about things happening in Mondays.

The book travel idea is interesting. There isn't much to see in the world of Mondays, but it could cut the time needed to find everyone (though it sounds to me that the bottleneck is convincing people to take the same side on the question).
