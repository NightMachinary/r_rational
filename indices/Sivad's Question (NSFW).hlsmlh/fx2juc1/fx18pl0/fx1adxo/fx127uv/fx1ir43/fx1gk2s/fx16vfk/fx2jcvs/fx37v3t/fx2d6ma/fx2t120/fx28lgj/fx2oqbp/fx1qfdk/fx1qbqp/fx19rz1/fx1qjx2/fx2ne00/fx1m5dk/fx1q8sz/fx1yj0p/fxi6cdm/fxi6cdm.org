I thought it was that they hated Mondays, and this causes the narrator's revelation that the problem is unsolvable because Garfield is some kind of deity or arbiter of reality, and he "hates Mondays" and doesn't want the people there to escape. I might be reading too much into it, but one mark against the idea that the complacent Garfield-readers /themselves/ are the immovable obstacle is that there must be people who are content to read Garfield all day who died on other days of the week, but there are other days that managed to move on to the paradise. The one thing that we know is unique about Mondays is that it's Mondays, the thing Garfield hates.
