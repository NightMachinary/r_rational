Very Borges. Anybody looking for more stuff like this should check out short stories by him.

[[https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf][The Library of Babel]] and [[https://web.itu.edu.tr/%7Einceogl4/modernism/lotteryofbabylon.pdf][The Lottery in Babylon]] immediately come to mind. Find a collection for more like these. He was prolific and his works are widely translated.
