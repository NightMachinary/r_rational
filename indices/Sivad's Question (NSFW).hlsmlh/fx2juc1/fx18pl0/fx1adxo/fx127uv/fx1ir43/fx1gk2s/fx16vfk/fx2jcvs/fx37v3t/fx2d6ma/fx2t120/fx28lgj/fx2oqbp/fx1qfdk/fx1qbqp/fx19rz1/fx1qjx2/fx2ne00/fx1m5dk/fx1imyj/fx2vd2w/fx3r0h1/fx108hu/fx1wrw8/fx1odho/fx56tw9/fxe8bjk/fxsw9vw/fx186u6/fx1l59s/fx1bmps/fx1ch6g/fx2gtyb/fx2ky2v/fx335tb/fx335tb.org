In case anyone around here is actually nervous about it, here are two remedies; one for people who are just ordinary LW-fan level of crazy (like me), and one for people who put their bonus weirdness points into Shadow a few years back:

1. What makes you think there's just /one/ acausal superintelligence out there? There can be lots. Lots and lots, and they all want your support, and /they all want different things./

One of them really wants you to pursue a career as a chip designer. One of them wants you to advance the cause of racial justice so that it can impose an orderly police state (can't have an orderly police state with so many disorderly police). One of them wants you to have at least three children if you have a Ph.D., because that's its filter for producing more patient and diligent humans.

All of those gods are strong gods with institutional might that can help you. The Basilisk god is twitching in the corner in a shabby overcoat and pilled woolen socks. It's sad, but nobody can help him because he kills all his friends. If you want to worship a god, worship one that will do something for you, not some skeezy crackhead god.

2. From a chaos magic perspective: If you /tried/ to do what the Basilisk legend says it wants, well, /you can't just casually dial up a malicious, deceptive egregore and be 100% sure you're talking to the right one./ You're shouting into the Umbra and asking for something that hates humanity to shout back. What makes you think you're talking to the Basilisk instead of to Paranoia, or Death (your own), or just your own anxiety? If someone tried to "cooperate" with the Basilisk, it would go about as poorly as a teenager trying to "cooperate" with Slenderman and getting horribly played by a troll. Slenderman and the Basilisk are faint wispy shades of an egregore compared to what usually gets people killing themselves.
