I suppose it's a matter of perspective.

But the idea that the most important question in my existance is also the dumbest, combined with it being the ultimate group project- a legion of people who all have to agree on the same thing, with the added caveats of being impossible to tell who might be defecting just out of spite, or hiding just to be an ass.

It's a weird, pointless hell, with heaven right there. There's no reason things should be that way. They just are, and you might never be able to fix them.

I mean, sure, it's funny that the ultimate meaning is whether or not Jim Davis got an Adult Swim tier potty humor joke into the milktoast world of newspaper comics, but imagine living it.
