  Monday as the second day instead of first day of the week is uniquely American I believe.

It's not. Not sure why you think it would be unique American.

Traditionally in both Judaism and Christianity Sunday is the first day of the week. According to both religions, God created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th day, which is the Sabbat, which is Saturday. Christians moved their holy day to Sunday to celebrate Jesus's resurrection, but still recognize Saturday is the 7th day.

I don't know when the shift to seeing Monday as the first day of the week happened, but it must have been in relatively modern times.
