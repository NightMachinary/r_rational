for its length this story is doing so so so much? It reminds me a lot of 17776 or some of Ted Chiang's short stories (and presumably lots of other stuff) where it lays out an absurd premise and then super efficiently explores how people realistically react to it. Some spoilery thoughts:

- the towers seem analogous to forums/threads or (more likely) Discord servers/channels, with the screamers being trolls etc etc
- this isn't the main thrust of the work, which instead is using the never-ending hell that is Garfield as... a never-ending hell
- sivad is just davis backwards, obviously
- was inclined to think death-by-cookie-dough is a reference to something but maybe not
- I'm reminded of that one SSC story about scissor statements
