Would someone mind explaining the ending? Is the point of view character implying that those people are some kind of zombies or are stuck in a endless loop of reading? I interpret the ending to mean that you could convince and sync everyone in Mondays except these kind of people, but I don't understand why. Is it because some people are happy there and wouldn't want to leave?

Is there a clue from the fact that 1 other day hasn't been collapsed yet?
