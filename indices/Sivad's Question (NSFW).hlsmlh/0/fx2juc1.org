This deserves a lot more praise and analysis than I can do at this moment but for now I'll just point out something I haven't seen anyone mention, which is that Jim Davis's last name would be seen backwards when viewed through the fourth wall by a fictional character in a universe created by him. I'm pretty lost about the Kings/Creator lore for now.

It's a pretty goddamn on-the-nose allegory. That's not a criticism, that's just a statement of fact. Online we don't have the experience of touching each other, we can't hug or kiss or fuck or fight through these screens. We can just travel or congregate (unless we're targeted by Screamers who care more about hurting us than we do about maintaining group cohesion.) Or we can abandon all pretense of logic and good faith and just start saying the most expedient thing at all times. YYyyyup. This... sure is online discourse in 2020.

Phenomenal work. IOU 2 literary analyses.

Edit: I remembered a story with a similar timeline, [[https://archive.org/stream/Fantastic_v20n02_1970-12_LennyS-cape1736#page/n85/mode/2up][Been A Long, Long Time]].
