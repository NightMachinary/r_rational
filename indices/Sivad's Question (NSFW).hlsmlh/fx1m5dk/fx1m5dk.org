The following is almost a stream of conscious as I read this story, writing basically what I think as soon as I read it without reading the rest of the story. I write this after reading the story just to show you how natural gaze's world-building is and how coherently it follows through. >!

#+begin_quote
  If one runs in any cardinal direction from a tower at a fast pace
#+end_quote

Is there a magnetic field then?

If not how do you know what a cardinal direction is. Without the sun for orientation cardinal directions will be significantly less useful, only those with compasses can use them.

Also the choice of "first floor" instead of ground floor suggests that this land is not European (0 = ground is used in the United Kingdom, most European countries, Mexico, Cambodia and former British colonies.)

If the bedrooms are not decorated how do people know they are bedrooms? Or does a bed not count as decoration? What about wardrobes or en suites? The lack of kitchens or farms or washing machines or bathrooms suggests that these people need no food and excrete no substance but do sleep.

If the book is indestructible I suspect its use in construction or science to be useful.

  It is impossible to see two at once from the same location.

The obvious question seems to be reflection. If you look at one tower then raise a mirror to occupy only part of your field of view what do you see? If you close one eye and bring the mirror to occupy all of the other eye you should see the tower in the mirror right? Then if you reverse eyes you will see another tower.

Also it says always exactly one, presumably this isn't true if you look at the sky, or the ground, or close your eyes, or are blind, or look in between the towers.

Monday as the second day instead of first day of the week is uniquely American I believe. I don't understand why he says human name though. "Monday" is hardly a human name it's an English name. Surely people who arrive will be speaking different languages. After all in Chinese and many other languages Monday = "first" + "day".

#+begin_quote
  There were never children in Mondays. Those who die before the age of sixteen are sent immediately to the shared paradise.
#+end_quote

So murder all children is the moral suggestion for the pregame life? If you could communicate with them that is.

I'm happy I managed to predict the inability to excrete just from the absent description earlier in the text. That's why you really have to comb gaze's stuff. Everything is there or not with a purpose.

#+begin_quote
  We do not and cannot speak any language from Earth. I once knew English and some Portuguese, and I cannot remember how to speak either. The language on Mondays sounds similar to German, I am told, but it involves frequent purring, which we are all innately capable of. Strangely, it often takes newcomers minutes or hours to first notice the switch.
#+end_quote

If you do not remember how to speak it do you not remember things like the name of Monday after all German starts the week on Monday and has a ground floor of 0 not 1. If you can compare the language to German it would seem to me it would require some sort of processing.

With the Garfield books are the names translated or in English? Again this would seem like a clue you could garner about the language.

Regarding the answer it seems obvious to me that even if the character did consume dog semen it would take multiple days to produce and print a comic so the comic released upon that day would obviously not have been on the same day so the answer is no. There's also the greater question that no date applies to a comic since it was released on that date doesn't mean the character existed at that time.

Also the culture clash from 200,000 years of homo sapiens has to be great. Even if you can't hurt people you can emotionally isolate them and attack them in other ways. Humans are social creatures and having 10 people follow someone to harass them seems to be unavoidable.

Abandoning the conversation to leave for the next tower seems unproductive. Isn't the point to convince everyone at one tower to vote one way? The way doesn't seem to matter since Sivad is willing to disclose information about the previous vote (that it didn't happen). Plus 50/50 better than 0 odds. Arguing whether it's right or wrong seems really dumb. Just keep getting everyone to agree on one vote and then reset memory do it again. Flip a coin to choose what side. This way eventually you'll get out even if it takes a few attempts. Though in general I don't think it's possible to get everyone to agree and such an endeavour is pointless as there will be people with mental health issues incapable of changing their vote.

Screamers! This story is excellent at foreshadowing and following through on premises.

I don't get the ending joke sadly but nice story anyway.!<
