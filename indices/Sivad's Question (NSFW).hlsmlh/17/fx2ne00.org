The narrator refers to staying in some places for millions of years. Now, surely there are some people who enjoy Garfield; by all means. But to read the same limited corpus of comics, over and over again, for /literally millions/ of /literally years/? No; come on. Even allowing for one-seventh of humanity being within Mondays, that is not within the limits of human psychology.

Nonetheless, the story is good enough that it inspired me to look for a weakness, which is the mark of skill for any dystopia.
