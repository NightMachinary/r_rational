The answer is NO by the way.

> There is a series of comics less than year before the comic in question where Garfield awakens to find himself living in an existential nightmare, Jon and Odie abandoned him and he starves in an empty house and pretends everything is ok.

Sorry for this imperfect quote, can't copy from [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]].

Anyway - the rest of the comics happen inside starving Garfield's brain, so nothing really happens, so the answer is No.
