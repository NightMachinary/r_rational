This criticism is essentially a statement of fact - "given this premise, X would not happen, Y would" - which seems to me a strange thing to be confident about.

Yes, people would tire of the question, but they would tire of everything else about Mondays too, and wanting to get out, question-related problems is the sensible thing to focus on. Humans aren't infinitely stupid, but we /are/ bad at coordination, and /total/ coordination gets exponentially harder with billions of people and no fast communications. Whether you can have a fulfilling life given eternity, grass and other people seems like a longstanding philosophical problem, with strong arguments on either side.

Which of these forces would win out? I don't know, and I certainly don't expect my guess to be better or worse than that of the author, or that of anyone else without relevant experience, which I'm not convinced exists.

Another angle - even if I were more confident in whatever opinion I held, I'm not sure I could hold this against the story. It wouldn't make it a story about not-humans, it would make it a story about humans, presenting an opinion contradictory to mine about how humans are. So, while I might then /disagree/ with the story, it would hardly be nonsensical because of it.
