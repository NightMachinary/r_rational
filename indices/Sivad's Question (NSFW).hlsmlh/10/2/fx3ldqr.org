Hundreds of billions is not timescale of heat death of the universe. Timescale of heat death of the universe is ten in power hundred (plus minus fifty), or possibly much more depending on the model.

Generally I agree - that kind of system would be ruled by statistical physics - switch to paradise is kind of inevitable if system is not hardcoded to avoid it. It should happen even before everyone brain would become random generator of electrochemical signals.
