What kind of paradise you imagine people could make out of nothing but grass, mud and Garfield books? Time isn't a magical solution to everything in absense of any useful resources. There's no material for almost anything to happen, except for maybe some origami art, using the books pages. Also you could probably weave the grass into some kind of a shitty rope, but then what?

Even going inwards instead of outwards with building paradise and trying to wirehead yourself buddism-esque way doesn't work, because it's impossible to go insane in Mondays (the story even mentions people who tried this approach and failed at it).
