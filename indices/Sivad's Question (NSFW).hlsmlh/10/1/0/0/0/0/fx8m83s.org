I admit that imagination games are a bit weak, but considering the immortality and absence of any need to worry about resources, I figure it's around ~17776 levels of finding things to do with isolated immortal existence. And, I think the power of [[https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/28][imagination]] in Garfield being what it is diegetically, Sivad would need to nerf the pleasure derived from imagination pretty hard before Mondays could be considered a net negative. (But it could well be that part of "not letting people go insane" includes being simply unable to suspend disbelief or achieve any level of immersion in any form of storytelling, depending on how hard Sivad is enforcing the hell dimension aspect.)

Edit: Just read the link, and hm. I was excited to see another example of somebody getting much more out of a video game than people usually do, but the casual racism ruins it for me. (Yes, I know, 4chan, free speech, but this isn't 4chan and it doesn't make me feel great when I see casually racist stuff anywhere near this sub.)
