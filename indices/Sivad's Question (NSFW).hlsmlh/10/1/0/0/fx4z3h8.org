Just for fun, I figured I'd take the quickest crack I feel like I reasonably can at constructing utopia within Mondays:

#+begin_quote
  I can remember everyone I have spoken to since I have come here and all the conversations I have had in enough detail to recreate them perfectly in my head.
#+end_quote

Here's our keystone. Everybody has nearly perfect memory.

Suppose for a moment that two chess enthusiasts meet, and they want to play chess, but they haven't any pieces. However, they both have perfect memories and understand the rules of chess very well. This is sufficient for them to play chess. [[https://xkcd.com/505/][In fact, this is sufficient for simulation of arbitrary universes.]] (If that level of granularity is unrealistic, crunchy tabletop campaigns work too.) Screamers cannot permanently end these universes, either. Since they remain perfect in memory, the best the Screamers can do is pause execution, and if someone has a sufficient mental grasp of the universe they're imagining, they may even continue execution while cut off from others. This is all very wordy to say that given infinite time and no need for food, sleep, or shelter, humanity would invent an infinite number of imagination games. (To quote [[https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/28][the Garfield strip in which we learn the events of the comic are all in fact delusions within a dying cat's mind]], "An imagination is a powerful tool. It can tint memories of the past, shade perceptions of the present, or paint a future so vivid that it can entice... or terrify, all depending on how we conduct ourselves today...")

Virtual currencies are even possibly feasible. Can Sivad be used to get answers to arbitrary math problems or to pass messages to other people in Mondays? It seems unlikely, since the universe of Mondays seems to be designed to discourage communication outside one's own bubble, but if he allows access to any shared information of any kind, it could essentially create arbitrary additional layers of reality, and if he allows arbitrary mathematical operations, he may even be able to offer encryption services.

One thing I'm curious about that I don't see addressed much in the story is the idea of people congregating. It seems like people mostly wander around freely without any reason to gather in one place, with only the Screamers bothering to coordinate at all. So, hypothetically, any number of people could occupy the same physical space. It would be an interesting game (and therefore something that people would likely try) to see how many people could hold one book at the same time. After all, people are able to interact with each other through physical objects. What would happen if thirty people all held the same book with both hands and, holding onto it as firmly as possible, took off sprinting North? Would they be able to accelerate the book faster than they normally move, and thereby, accelerate each other? What if that number went up to a hundred people? A thousand people? It might be a way to try to reach a wall-- gather everyone in a tower who wants to go North with you, ride a book north to the next tower, repeat. If you can get up a good amount of speed, start stopping at every other tower so you don't have to stop as often (then every third tower, etc.) At that point, even if you lose people occasionally, you should still bring a good bit of novelty to the towers you travel to, and if you can get the book travel meme to spread, you might be able to use it to travel more easily around Mondays later on, once you've traced out the perimeter. (after all, any time a sufficient number of people all want to go the same direction, they'd just self-coordinate around a travel book. Yes, some people would scream or try to interfere, but they'd be outmuscled by sheer volume.)

Edit: I had a couple of other thoughts. For one, Screamers can be countered by plugging one's ears with grass and inventing sign language. In fact, to disorient the Screamers, they could join in on the screaming, and just abandon sound as a communications channel.

Another thought I had was the possibility that eventually, once the book meme spreads enough, an anti-travel-book meme might arise, and people might gather to pirate books whose only purpose is seeking out and taking control of other books to interfere with people's attempts to travel.

Hmmm. it's not a septillion years' worth of worldbuilding good, but I would be interested in hearing some stories about a contingent of people trying to reach the northern wall by riding a Garfield book. They'd only stay on the forefront of the meme's light cone until somebody puts together a faster book and catches up to them. Then once the meme has caught up to them, it's a giant game of tag with an unknown and fluctuating number of players. Or... a marathon gauntlet.

Heck, once book piracy emerges, you might wind up with anti-pirate books. Enforcers around the center of Mondays who hunt down any book who's interfering with the use of travel books.

Actually hold on books are a scarce commodity suddenly and nooooow you've got the basis for slavery and capitalism and wars and heists (the books don't regenerate, right? so factions would start stockpiling books because eventually only the factions with the books can travel...)

So, to extend things to their logical conclusions, at some point somebody in Mondays might sit down and describe a long, involved, complex story with hundreds of protagonists and millions of plotlines to someone over the course of several centuries, followed by a cryptographic signature spoken aloud character for character then verified alone with Sivad, after which point the client gives payment in the form of three Garfield books, whose value is that it 1. is a scarce good and 2. allows any old horde of humanity to travel at a reasonable pace elsewhere in the world to catch up on the highly valuable stories there.

It's not sex, drugs, or rock n' roll, but it's something to do. I wonder how large a choir could be assembled in Mondays. They could all stand right on top of each other and try to harmonize and compose and sing a song together. Well, hmm, everyone's voice sounds like German purring, but there is air (they puff it out their noses while they read Garfield at the end) so presumably vocalizations are possible and I don't think musicality is explicitly outlawed by Mondays' physics.
