This is some Lasagna Cat material right here.

Specifically reminds me of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh9oLs67Cw][this.]] This man speaks for a solid hour about a single Garfield comic, and totally sells the fiction that he's been obsessed with it for a lifetime and has found deep personal meaning in it.

And since there's an XKCD for everything, it also reminds me of [[https://xkcd.com/915/][this.]]

EDIT: Sure, why not add spoilers.
