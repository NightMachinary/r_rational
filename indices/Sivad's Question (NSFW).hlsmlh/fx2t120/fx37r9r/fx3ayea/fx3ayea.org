  What kind of paradise you imagine people could make out of nothing but grass, mud and Garfield books?

You still have a brain, no? And access to some fraction of approximately 1/7 of all the humans who ever lived. That's a lot of brains, and I hear you can do pretty interesting things with them. Some people even claim they might be the most complex things in existence (I personally think those people might be underselling existence, but who am I to judge?).

Sounds like a fun and fully recursive problem. I do enjoy a good challenge!

If that's not enough to hint at what I'm too lazy to elaborate on in this comment, this is where I [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nCvvhFBaayaXyuBiD/shut-up-and-do-the-impossible][obnoxiously quote LW at you]] in passing while offering a deep insight. Unfortunately, I'm also too lazy to think of a suitably deep insight. I suppose "I respect your right to be upset at not having a definite final happy ending, but don't tell me what I can't do with my immortality or where it has to 'end up' to be worth it" might suffice?
