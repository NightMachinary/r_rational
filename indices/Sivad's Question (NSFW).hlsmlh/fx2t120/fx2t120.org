This was fun to read, but ultimately flawed in a way that makes the conceit nonsensical.

The story introduces and plays with the idea of numbers so great as to be functionally infinite to human minds, yet they're treated as mere props and window dressing. The plot is a plot of decades at best, and is artificially stretched to "millions", "hundreds of billions", and timescales comparable to the heat death of the universe, all without any thought as to what it would actually be like for anyone to live through it. This is not what eternity looks like.

The PoV character describes a handful of "interesting" towers and people as if, having traveled that long and seen so many, those occurances wouldn't be better described as frequencies. They encounter people willing to scream for a million years just to troll people, but people who have companionships lasting hundreds of billions don't consider the idea to "just wait for them to get bored and leave" when the time you have to wait is, functionally, an eyeblink in comparison to the length of your latest conversation. So many things /should have happened/ in these eons, and yet didn't.

The story does a good job of revealing a certain flaw of human nature. Yes, humans will argue anything ad nauseam, and divorced from consequences, will do things such take novel positions just to stand out and be unique, spin up webs of belief to justify not changing their mind, and get fed up and break things out of spite (or just troll people for the lulz). It can be difficult to coordinate around anything when there is even a modicum of uncertainty.

But you will have a hard time convincing me that, among all possible failure modes, /this/ is the one that arises in the face of eternity.

Humans are not this dumb, nor are they so interesting as to be capable of exploring the nuances of a single line of thought for a million years, much less a /billion/, much less timescales comparable to the heat death of the universe.

Just as the screamers get bored and carry on, so to would everyone else. Even given the conceit that it's an unsolvable problem (as if even in the Mondays, someone wouldn't have thought to treat it like a logic puzzle and get people to coordinate around /that/ after wasting so much time arguing about whether yes or no means anything when it's literally keeping you all from going to paradise -- or even shifting to try and make progress on understanding human psychology and why such patterns emerge in the first place!) -- even then, eventually people would /also get tired of the question/. Not just a few. Absolutely friggen everyone!

Okay, so you can't touch and can't have sex and can't hurt each other and can't ever die, yadayada. Yes, and? It sucks, but after miserating over it for basically eternity, you'd think someone would have the insight that you don't need an externally imposed, rubber-stamped, This-Is-What-The-Creator--Themselves-Intended paradise to be handed to you in order to have a fulfilling existence. You can in fact just do it yourself! You literally have all the time in the world!

Fun premise, good writing, very entertaining. But I'm not reading a story about humans.
