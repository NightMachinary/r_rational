It's stated to be a binary question with a correct solution, but it's not stated that the correct solution is unchanging and there's a pretty easy hypothetical mechanism for that change: the correct solution depends on authorial intent, and +Davis+ Sivad is the actual author. He just decides which choice he intends when the vote is leaning one way or the other.

This could mean it's Actually Impossible to escape, but somehow I feel like rather than that he'd change the answer to ensure that whichever answer is converged on ends up correct...if people can converge on any answer at all. That makes it seem more like a "test" and less like a crapshoot

Also it's not like he's bound to tell the truth, anyway. The entire premise is potentially questionable, although far more interesting if one doesn't.
