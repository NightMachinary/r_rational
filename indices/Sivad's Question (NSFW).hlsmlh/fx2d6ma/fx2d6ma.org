The story of a warlord in Mondays might be interesting.

The chief problem is the stupidly large scale of Mondays. If anyone decides they don't want to be found, it will take a /very/ long time to find them. Any attempt to coordinate runs into the problem of the draw distance. Signals only hop one tower at a time.

Compared to that, recalcitrant targets that you can actually locate are easy. They can be stripped of their supports, bombarded with screamers, analyzed and bribed, or have their loved ones located and used against them.

Its also totally unknown what minerals are available underneath the dirt, or if the dirt has any useful clay. Given the general despair of the setting, I'm assuming none and none.

So the only manipulable resources are grass and dirt.

Tracking humans via footprints left in the grass is conceivably possible.

It might be possible to get roving bands weaponized hunter psychologists to track and forcibly convert runners.

I'm picturing a long, spindly empire, with most its population made of thin arms of small squads of people manning grass fires slowly sending clear text messages back and forth. the arms move frequently to accommodate the needs of the hunter teams.

Its still going to take a /really long time/. There are large groups of people who are willing to scream for a million years just for the sake of griefing. If one of them decides to run west for time T because fuck you, the search for them will take on the order of k*T^2, where K is probably larger than one. This continues until the limits of the walls, which no one has hit in a billion years.

They are going to be stuck for a while.
