I initially fell into the dog urine camp, because having never smelled much of either, I expect dog urine to smell and taste worse, and thus to motivate a stronger immediate reaction from Jon. Dog urine makes sense with Liz's remark because a common pregnancy test is to look for hormones in the urine; thus, she means "You have just consumed the urine of a bitch whom I have ascertained is pregnant."

However, perhaps this does not hold water, or other liquids. Odie is assigned male gender; if this matches the dog's biological sex, then /he/ cannot bear puppies and would not be tested for pregnancy. If Odie is physically male, then he would be the most likely source of dog semen in the exam room; although I don't believe expressing semen is a typical part of a veterinary check-up. Perhaps he's being bred?

If on the other hand, Odie is biologically female and fertile, she may be the recipient of an impregnation or the provider of urine intended for a pregnancy test.

If the liquid is /from/ Odie, then female Odie implies urine and male Odie implies semen.

If the liquid is intended /for/ Odie, then Odie must be female and it's semen.

What fraction of dogs have an assigned gender (including name, pronouns, fur decorations) different from their biological sex? If Odie is (say) 5% likely to be misgendered, then Jon might be too na√Øve to know whether his dog is a boy dog or a girl dog. However Liz, who has inspected Odie all over, knows for sure (but may maintain Jon's ruse out of politeness).

(Also yeah, Odie was Lyman's dog at one point. Lyman was totally Jon's boyfriend, at least according to my half-sister. (It was the '80s, we were bored.))
