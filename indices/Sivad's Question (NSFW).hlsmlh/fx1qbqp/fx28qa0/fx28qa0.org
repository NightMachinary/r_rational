A common theme in the strips is Garfield saying "I hate Mondays", which is a really strange thing for an unemployed literal feline to think. However, given the name of this particular purgatory, it's almost certainly a feeling shared by most other residents.

Thus, after having found (perhaps) the seven people in 1/7th of the entire population of humanity who actually /enjoy/ Garfield, the punchline to the story itself is "I love Mondays!"
