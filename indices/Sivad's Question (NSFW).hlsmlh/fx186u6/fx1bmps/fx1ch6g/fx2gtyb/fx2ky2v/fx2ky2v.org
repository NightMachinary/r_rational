Someone came up with a decision theory-flavored version of pascal's wager that involved reasoning about a hypothetically possible superintelligence that would torture people forever if they failed to help create it, and posted the idea to LessWrong. Eliezer Yudkowsky overreacted initially, calling out the author with shouty words, and then later deleted the posts. Streisand effect blew it up, causing it to be "the thing" LW and even EY are known for outside of rationalist circles.

It is /really/ not worth promulgating, and although some people purportedly worried about it to the extreme, no one actually takes it seriously.
