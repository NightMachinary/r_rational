This means that Naruto placed a log there before (or during) the fight on purpose, right? I think phrasing it as "very purposefully" would make that part easier to understand, but the word "purposefully" looks ugly compared to "explicitly".

Then again, explicit also means something like "clear and obvious", which this was not, because it was meant to be a trap, so it's a little misleading.
