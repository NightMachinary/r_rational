Some of them, a lot were described even so, though I can't go into specifics without spoilers. [[#s][Spoilers]] were technically killed offscreen, but it was described because Byakugan saw it. Also although [[#s][Spoilers]] was 'killed' offscreen, the 'fatal' blow was struck onscreen.

And then there was [[#s][Spoilers]].

Holy fuck was there [[#s][Spoilers]].
