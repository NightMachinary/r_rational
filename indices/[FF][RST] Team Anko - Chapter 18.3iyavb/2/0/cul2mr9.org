  don't pull the "that was but a clone" trick too often (at least without foreshadowing the deceit).

Yeah, I had intended to have something in there about a flicker as she stabbed him -- the point was that a clone kawarimied with him at the last second. Looks like I forgot to put it in, though.

  The descriptions of the combat were easily visualised, so it felt quite cinematic. Kudos.

Thanks. My method for writing fight scenes is to visualize the whole scene as I'm doing it so that I keep track of which way people are facing, etc. When I was writing the bit where Hinata threw knives at Sachi and Ichiro I wrote it, then realized I had her doing it with the wrong hands so I had to switch the directions. It makes it much easier, I find.
