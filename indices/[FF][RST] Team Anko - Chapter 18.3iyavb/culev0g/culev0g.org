I'm loving everything. The drama, the scope of the world (despite the minor plot point of how the Republic and the Elemental Nations don't know of each other's general abilities despite the existence of radio and global communications satellites and the Republic going on a several decade unification war which may or may not have involved nuclear explosions, and what about Gamabunta's frog dimension, and the Sage Snakes and other miscellaneous creatures and Jiraiya and Nature Chakra users that supposedly can detect events from around the world?), and I actually like the romantic situations here.

I'm pretty certain that you won't go through the cop-out solution of having a m√©nage-a-trois, but a satisfying conclusion will eventually be worked out.

I mean, these are 13 year olds. THIRTEEN. They might have a switch which turns them into stone cold killers, with a sadistic edge in the case of Hinata, which reminds me less of a trained soldier than a kid playing around with frogs and dismembering them out of childish curiosity... but they certainly do not have an Adult Maturity switch that suddenly makes them take the same decisions as grown ups in relationships defined by romantic rationality, previous experience and sexual desire.
