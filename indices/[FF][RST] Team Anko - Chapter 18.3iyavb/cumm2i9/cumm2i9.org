Yet another awesome chapter. The violence, while unexpected, was definitely appropriate in a Doylist /and/ Watsonian way.

I won't comment further on it, as others have already done a better job of that, but I'd like to mention that the story /probably/ should be bumped from T to M. ff.net has been known to take down misrated stories previously, so I'd err on the sie of caution.

In fact, if we go by the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/][ff.net guidelines]], this should /definitely/ be M.
