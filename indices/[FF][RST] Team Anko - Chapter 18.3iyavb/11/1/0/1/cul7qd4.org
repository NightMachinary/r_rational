Hinata is a genuinely nice person. She's also an emotionally abused thirteen-year-old girl who's been training to be an assassin since she was eight. She's severely lacking in self-confidence as a result of the abuse, which gives her a degree of hesitance and passivity. Make her angry enough to burn away that hesitance and you get this.
