Brilliant. Definitely had some shock impact from how suddenly and all over the place it descended into violence.

I was much entertained by how serious the violence was. Definitely in a different category from the usual Naruto "and then we punched each other with Chakra and someone spat a bit of blood maybe" combat.

Very excellent chapter.
