They were attacked with deadly intent.

Hell, one of Naruto's solid sapient clones was killed stone dead. Doesn't matter if it /turned out/ to be a clone; at that moment in time the enemy attempted and seemingly succeeded in killing him.

The sound genin bit off more then they could chew, is all. I don't see Lord Orochimort putting up much of a fuss over it, especially since they violated his orders of "no kill jinchuuriki or hyuuga brood mare".
