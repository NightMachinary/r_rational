Their first interaction was when Orochimaru tasked them to spar with Team Anko while Naruto was in the hospital. Shino and Hinata took Ichiro down in seconds; Team Kaiya got some licks in, especially against Hinata, but both went down within a couple of minutes. Shino got furious when he saw Nariko smash Hinata into a tree several times; after he took Nariko down, he kicked her ribs in and then shoved an explosive tag in her mouth with full intent to blow her head off. Fortunately, Anko stopped him. To add insult to injury, Hinata even kept one of Nariko's chakra ribbons as a trophy.

Their second interaction was when Ichiro stalked Hinata and Naruto and pulled out a bow as though to shoot from ambush. Hinata saw it and the two of them ran.

Team Kaiya has been stalking the team for several weeks and putting enormous time and resources into setting up a lethal ambush which partially succeeded--Naruto's clone was killed. The team was pretty much working on a "once is fun, twice you're done" model.
