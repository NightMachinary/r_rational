I agree in some respect. I do find that the romance isn't executed terribly well, not just in this chapter, but in the story as a whole. Like, I found Anko's brief summary of her polyamory to be better than the NaruHina development in the story, which says something. I'm liking the rest though.

The romance feels almost forced in a way, particularly the NaruHina.
