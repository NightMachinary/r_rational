That's actually the reason I created the contingent kawarimi. There's too many cases in the anime where we /see/ someone get cut in half (in silhouette), and then suddenly it's a log.

I've never explicitly stated it, but I like the idea that the contingent kawarimi is causality-breaking over a period of a millisecond or so -- you get hit and killed, and then you're alive again.
