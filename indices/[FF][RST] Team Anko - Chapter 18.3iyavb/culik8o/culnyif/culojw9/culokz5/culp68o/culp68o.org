Well, if you can understand canon from that well enough to WRITE fanfiction, I can understand it well enough to read it. You've convinced me. Viva la revolution!

And yeah, I can see why you wanted to tackle Naruto as a setting. It has so much wasted potential. Ignoring the "JUST ATTACK HIM ALREADY, THIS IS NOT HOW FIGHTS WORK" stuff that happens every single episode, the characters are just not even close to Level 1 Intelligent.

The Orochimaru/Tsunade deal where Orochimaru demands Tsunade provide him with the human sacrifices is the biggest example of this I've seen, but every time I try and go into why, I end up on a multi-paragraph rant that nobody wants to read due to how obvious it would be. I'm sure you know just how stupid it is, and if you don't know the details of what happened, I'd be happy to tell you about it with copious swearing.

Suffice it to say that it was a textbook example of what Eliezer calls Hollywood Zombie, a lack of Level 1 intelligence, a lack of any sort of brain in Orochimaru's head asking "What should I actually do to get what I want?" instead of "How do I further The Plot?"

I have triumphantly closed the window where I was watching Naruto. I'm off to the wiki. I didn't realise how bad the show was until I didn't have to watch it any more. I'm free!
