I assumed he wouldn't, considering it was a personal slight that caused him to attack, and Orochimort has shown he is immune to such things. (I'm now stealing that name; I want it to become a thing.) I love your characterisation of Orochimaru as well. I'm certainly not a psychopath, but I'm a bit off the neurotypical path myself, and I found it both funny and disturbing to read about Orochimaru complaining about neurotypical people in a similar way to what I've done in my own head in the past. ("I don't get how people get any real conversation done, they're so busy saying one thing, meaning a second thing, and thinking a third thing!")

I'm happy to do what I can to contribute, even in a small way :)

I believe it was the Raikage, yeah. I'm looking forward to reading more of the fandom's top creations. Do you have any personal recommendations? I already have a few to be going on with, but I figure your tastes probably lean heavily towards the kind of fic I would enjoy immensely. (And, having never read the manga or watched much of the anime, wouldn't require me to have done so to enjoy them.) I've read Time Braid, The Waves Arisen, and Naruto's Compensation. Enjoyed all three.
