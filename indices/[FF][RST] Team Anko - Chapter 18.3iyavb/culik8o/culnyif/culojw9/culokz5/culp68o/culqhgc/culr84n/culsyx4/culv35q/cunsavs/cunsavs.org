Fairly certain it was because the Kazekage was the only kage coming to attend the Chunin exams. In addition, Suna was being severely weakened, and it was also PISSED at Konoha because their daimyo would use Konoha for most of his missions, since Konoha was, well, much better than them. Which, ironically, made them even weaker, meaning he was even less inclined to use them, which made them even weaker, etc etc. So Orochimaru used that resentment to convince Suna to attack Konoha with him. And killed the Kazekage to (presumably) infiltrate the village to the point where he'd be in kill range of the Hokage. Also fairly certain Orochimaru isn't good at playing with others.

The major plot hole here, for me anyway, is that Konoha has a clan full of Hyuuga, many of which attend these exams, so he should've been spotted immediately both due to his disguise being seen through, and the appearance of his twisted chakra.

Also Konoha's apparently lacking in sensor ninja, to the point where you wouldn't be able to recognize one of your most recognized missing nins through sheer chakra senses alone.
