Thank you so much, you just made my day.

I couldn't make it through the anime either; I think I bailed somewhere around the bridge. I just couldn't stand how an entire episode would consist of people glaring at each other and posing, monologuing / expositing for a couple of minutes, and then MAYBE throwing one punch. Plus, Naruto's constant "believe it!" Ugh.
