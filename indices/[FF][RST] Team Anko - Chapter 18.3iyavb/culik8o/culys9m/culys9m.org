Why not just read the comics? They go by a lot faster and don't have the anime filler. Once you get to the end of Shippuden you can even read the pretty [[https://rnaruto.imgur.com/][fan-colored versions]].

If you absolutely prefer watching, though, there are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/3izru6/naruto_kai_all_episodes/][fan-abridged versions]] of the show, too. You get the core of the plot and stuff but save yourself a few hundred hours.
