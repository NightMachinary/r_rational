They're twelve-year-olds, and while that doesn't preclude juvenile romance, males typically are just beginning puberty by then. It might not even be a problem with your depiction, I might just not be able to stand preteen romance. But throwing around declarations of love, the angry drama surrounding Shino (Isn't the entire point of their current plan to make the genin's defection believable to Orochimaru? That should not factor into Shino's jealousy.), Naruto's self-righteous pity ("sad understanding" is Dumbledore, not Naruto), the blatant tract for polyamory, it's utterly boring. They're in enemy territory, and all this romantic drama seems very out of character for their position.
