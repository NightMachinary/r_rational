Yeah. Kakashi is a great example:

- Age 4 (!), entered Academy
- Age 5, graduated from the normally-4-year Academy program after one year
- Age 6, became chunin (!)
- Age 12, became jonin. Note that this is when most kids graduate from the Academy and become genin.

The wiki then says:

  *Despite having gone on several missions,* Kakashi's persistent desire to follow the rules and complete his mission put him at odds with whatever team he was assigned to.

  Eventually, Kakashi was assigned to join a team alongside Obito Uchiha and Rin Nohara under Minato Namikaze's command. *They were given a final test to earn their full genin status;* take one of two bells from Minato.

So, he went on several missions, /then/ was assigned to Minato's team, /then/ became a genin. So, he wasn't a genin when he went on those first few missions?
