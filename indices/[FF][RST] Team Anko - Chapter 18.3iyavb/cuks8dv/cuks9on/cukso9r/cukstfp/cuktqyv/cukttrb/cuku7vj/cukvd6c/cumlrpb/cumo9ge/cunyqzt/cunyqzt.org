The bell test of previous generations is NOT shown in the manga. I don't know about the anime. It's likely filler episodes... The manga does not have so many of these inconsistencies, I'd say

(Absurdities yes, it does have quite a few. But not so many glaring holes in self-consistency as you seem to notice from the wiki)
