That's right, I'd forgotten the part about him disguising himself as the visiting Kage -- Raikage, wasn't it? I've read some great versions of that fight, including one where Haku and Zabuza have been recruited by Konoha, so Haku is there when the Kages fight. Oddly, he /didnt/ end up dead in the first 30 seconds, and actually provided enough distraction for the Hokage to survive, albeit without one arm. (Certain irony there!)

Yeah, that was a most brain dead plot indeed. I can't imagine what Kishimoto was thinking.

Thanks for filling me in -- more grist for the mill...although my Orochimaru isn't going to waste time attacking Konoha.
