Orochimaru has an immortality jutsu (he knows he can't learn everything in just one lifetime), but his body isn't so resilient. The immortality jutsu allows him to transfer his soul into another body, though it can only be done every few years I think. He wants Sasuke to be his next host (for the Sharingan), though I'm not sure why he put the seal on there either, or left him there either. Probably to strengthen him before using him as a host.

Orochimaru also wants to destroy Konoha because of what they did, so at the end of the chunin exams he invades it with an army. To cut a long story short, Orochimaru battles the Hokage, the Hokage tries to kill Orochimaru with a jutsu, but it doesn't take. The Hokage settles for crippling his arms with it instead before he dies.

So Orochimaru has no arms, and can't use any jutsu, which kind of goes against his "Learn all the jutsu" plan. Fortunately for him, one of his former teammates is the world's greatest ninja medic, and she can heal his arms. So he goes in search for her to offer her a deal. The deal is that he'll use his resurrection jutsu to bring her brother and someone else I forget back to life, if she heals his arms.

This is not a bad plan, but the way he goes about it lacks so much Level 1 intelligent planning that it makes my head spin. I assume you've read Eliezer's stuff on writing intelligent characters, but if you haven't, the relevant thing here is that a level 1 intelligent character doesn't have to be smart or rational, they just need to act like a person would. They need to have an inner voice in their head that at least tries to make the right decisions. Every real person has this, no matter how stupid. Someone who lacks this is a Hollywood Zombie, who does inexplicable things purely to move the plot along, something that no person would ever think to do if they were actually trying to accomplish the person's goals.

So Orochimaru lays out the deal to Tsunade, and Tsunade asks what Orochimaru plans to DO with his arms if he gets them back. After all, she knows he's bad news, but she really misses her brother. Orochimaru lies to her and tells her that he just plans to continue to learn jutsu, which is a fairly innocuous goal, right?

JUST KIDDING. No, he tells her the truth; that he plans to grind Konoha into dust.

While Tsunade is reeling from this information (or perhaps the knowledge that Orochimaru is suffering from advanced dementia, clearly the only explanation for why he would tell her this) Orochimaru then reveals that the resurrection requires two human sacrifices, one for each resurrection. Of course, Tsunade will be required to provide these sacrifices. Never mind that for normal people, making human sacrifices is morally repugnant, whereas Orochimaru could do it in less time and with less moral difficulties than taking a shit. Hell, he has an assistant, Kabuto, who'd do it FOR him.

At this point, I stopped the episode, and just sat there in disgust. This is pandering to the plot at it's finest. You don't have to be intelligent or a rationalist to realise that revealing your plan to destroy the former home of the only person in the world who can cure you is a really fucking stupid idea. Let alone then proceeding to ask her to do something that's extremely morally wrong to her, but trivial for you.

This is one of the dumbest things I've seen in fiction. It's not a normal mistake. It's not even a dumb mistake. Even if Orochimaru was moronic enough to tell Tsunade the truth before he realised that it was a bad idea, (yeah right, nobody capable of creating a FUCKING IMMORTALITY JUTSU is stupid) he then volunteered the human sacrifice thing out of the blue. The only reason this was even a difficult decision for Tsunade was for the sake of the plot. There's no reason Tsunade should ever know about the sacrifices, or about Orochimaru's plans. At this point, Tsunade has exiled herself from Konoha. She doesn't even know that Orochimaru attacked the village until he told her.

This is what the term Hollywood Zombie is for. Clearly, the writer envisioned The Plan, and all players of The Plan, protagonist and antagonist alike, were inexorably drawn into its web. Their true goals are to ensure The Plan comes to pass, because they sure as fuck don't act like their plan is to achieve the goals they claim to have.

That's the thing about level 1 intelligent characters. You don't need to be smart. You don't need to know a lot of science. You don't need to be particularly rational. You just need to ask "Is there any reason this character would attempt this course of action, when X is what they want?" And Naruto fails this test in spades.

This was supposed to have more anger and swearing in it, but as I was writing it, I realised the mistake I was supposed to be writing about (telling Tsunade she needed to provide the human sacrifices) in fact was even less stupid than the mistake Orochimaru made earlier of telling her his ultimate plans, and then it became too pathetic to be an object of mockery.

So the true problem with Naruto isn't that the characters are stupid, inefficient, or annoying. The problem is they aren't people. This is, in fact, why I like rational fiction. No matter what, rational fiction requires people to have goals, and to act like it. I love smart characters, but I don't need smart characters to enjoy a work. I just require that they act like actual human beings, who have a voice in their head that says "Hey, if I want to get Tsunade on my side instead of giving her an Angsty Moral Decision, maybe I really, really shouldn't say that right now."

Because nobody would actually act like that if they didn't have a script in their head that they knew they needed to follow.
