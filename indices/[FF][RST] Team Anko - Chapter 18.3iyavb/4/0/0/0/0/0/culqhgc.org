  The Orochimaru/Tsunade deal where Orochimaru demands Tsunade provide him with the human sacrifices is the biggest example of this I've seen, but every time I try and go into why, I end up on a multi-paragraph rant that nobody wants to read due to how obvious it would be. I'm sure you know just how stupid it is, and if you don't know the details of what happened, I'd be happy to tell you about it with copious swearing.

I actually don't know, so feel free to rant. My knowledge of Orochimaru is: wants to know everything (commendable goal, stupid execution), gets chased out of Konoha for horrible experiments, founds Sound, puts the whole "learn everything" on hold because suddenly destroying Konoha is more important, stages a big attack on Konoha, wants to capture Sasuke in order to...make use of his eyes? I think?...so he attacks Team 7 in the Forest of Death during the chunin exams, bites Sasuke to put a cursed seal on him which knocks him out then...um...leaves him there instead of bringing him along? What? Because...reasons?

I'm fuzzy on what he does after that point; he's just too much of an idiot and the plot was too stupid. Because of my frustration with that, I started Team Anko with two concepts in mind, one of which was "What if Orochimaru had been an intelligent rationalist all along?"
