Did you read the manga, or get your knowledge of canon from reading...whatever the plural of "synopsis" is, fanfictions, and character pages? (The latter got me through Time Braid)

The Wave arc (Episodes 1-19) doesn't represent the whole anime; if I hadn't been told this by [[/r/Naruto]] I wouldn't have stuck with it either. The Wave arc is absolutely terrible, and the rest of the anime so far manages to be okay at least most of the time.

It still isn't worth watching if your knowledge of canon is already fine, but it's nowhere near the levels of crap that the first 19 episodes show.
