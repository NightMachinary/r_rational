I want you to know that you are ruining Naruto for me.

I'm trying to go through Naruto in order to better understand fanfictions. I'm currently 112 episodes in, but it's getting harder and harder to watch. Because I'm reading your stuff every week or two, and unlike Time Braid / The Waves Arisen, the main characters are not super ninja. They have less power than the genin in canon Naruto have at the stage I'm up to. So I end up comparing Team Anko with the source material frequently, and the source material comes up woefully short every time.

Why can't we have fights like that in canon? They just stand around. Talking. And occasionally throwing attacks at each other, or making plans over the course of about ten goddamn minutes. I could deal with all the other flaws of the show if they just sped it up a bit. It's not a terrible show, but if I didn't want to read fanfiction of it, I wouldn't be interested enough to watch it. To be fair, this was the case before I started Team Anko. Team Anko just provides an easy point of comparison.

I wish I could just inject the memory of having watched all the episodes directly into my brain.

In all seriousness though, thank you for writing this. I have a very, very high barrier to enjoying a fanfic enough to follow it actively before it's completed, but this one (along with HPMOR) easily fits the bill. I love Time Braid and The Waves Arisen, but I think this'll be better than both when it's finished.
