I think that's a common enough response, and it sounds good in the abstract, but when you take a closer look it's just not all that viscerally appealing in light of the costs and limitations. Humans--our only model for how a sapient species behaves, and probably not atypical in this respect--evolved in societies of relatively small social groups. We have small groups of family and friends, larger groups of acquaintances, and nowadays we have still larger affiliations like religions or nation-states, but each of those groups is, for most people, progressively less significant in our daily lives than the last, and have emotional significance insofar as they touch the closer groups.

The Vatican would be irrelevant if it weren't for the parish church, Washington much less significant if we didn't thank the veteran down the street for his service. The big ideas move us because they give us a glimpse of a larger order at work in our fleeting lives, but by themselves they're flashes of lightning, and don't last. You need cathedrals and parades close by to give them any sense of permanence.

Suppose you're a reasonably well-off medieval English man, say a guildmaster, and you're given the opportunity to convert a kingdom in Thailand to Christianity by donating a significant but not ruinous sum of gold. Being a pious man, you agree with some hemming and hawing, though you don't have a good sense of where in the hell Thailand is.

The money goes off, and you're assured that this kingdom in Thailand is now committed to the Christian faith. You tell your neighbors, and they're very impressed by your good works, and for a little while you get extra business from the publicity. But the news fades, and you never hear from these Thai Christians, except once when they send a letter suggesting that they could convert some neighboring barbarians you've also never heard of if only you send a bit more gold.

Do you send the cash? Probably not.
