I tell them it's a design for a 'warpgate' - a device that permits FTL travel, but only through compatible warpgates.

Of course, it doesn't do that. FTL travel is impossible. Instead, what it does it that it picks up a signal (which I send regularly, once a year, after sending the original message) containing a complete medical scan of myself. The device itself is an organic matter assembler/disassembler; once it has picked up enough organic material (either from hopeful aliens stepping into the machine, or from cautious aliens sending through the equivalent of chimpanzees, or if all else fails by disassembling bacteria that drift into the machine) it then builds a clone of me (memories and all). That clone then has to convince the aliens that he is an FTL traveller and ambassador to their species, hoping to establish peaceful relations. Eventually, he hopes to persuade a leader of some sort to step into the machine (and be disassembled - but the machine keeps some records of every person it disassembles, at least so far as personal appearance goes). Of course, people would be suspicious if no-one ever returned, so I make sure that they do, in a way, return - that is to say, I can set the machine to rebuild and body that it has destroyed so far, with the exception that instead of putting in the original brain, it inserts a copy of /my/ brain. So, when the Leader goes through, I give him a decent interval, and then he appears to return - only it's not him. It's another me, wearing his body.

It shouldn't take long to persuade his staff to also use the machine, and before long I (or one of me, at least) will be in control of the entire world...
