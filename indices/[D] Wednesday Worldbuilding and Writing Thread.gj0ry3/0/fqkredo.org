You are an alien species which has deduced quite conclusively that FTL travel is impossible. Despite this obstacle, you wish to conquer the galaxy. In order to do so, you have decided to transmit radio messages out into the abyss which will hopefully result in intelligent species decoding them, implementing the instructions within and assembling a device which will conquer their planet on your behalf before establishing a colonial government which will extract resources from their planet/convert the natives to the one true faith/catalogue their biodiversity for research purposes/insert whatever reason you like for galactic conquest here.

What are you putting in this radio message? Obviously you can't just do 'hey conquer yourselves for us kthxbye', you've got to trick them into doing it somehow. But how?
