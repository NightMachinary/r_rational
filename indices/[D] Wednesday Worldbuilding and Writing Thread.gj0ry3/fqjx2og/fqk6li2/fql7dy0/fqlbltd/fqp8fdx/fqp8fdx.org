Hm. I was assuming a world otherwise like ours, but with all underground metals removed by some magical means.

But meteors would still fall, anyway; I don't know how much of the above-ground metal present at the dawn of humanity was sourced from meteoric remains falling over geological time.

Also, massive impactors such as the one that wiped out the dinosaurs must have left behind large metal remnants. That would be an interesting fantasy location: the metallic core of a giant meteorite, in the centre of an ancient impact crater-lake, that the locals worship and have been slowly chipping away at for centuries...
