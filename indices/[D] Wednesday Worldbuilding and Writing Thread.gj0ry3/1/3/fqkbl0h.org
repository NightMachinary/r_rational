Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun is set in a future Earth that has depleted these resources. Society is stuck behind a bottleneck despite the elites' access to advanced records. Also, there's some dark shit. Interestingly, lots of overlap with what AW described above (except there's also ancient tech/magic in the setting...) Could be something interesting to glance at for inspiration.
