How did the world end up like that? If there's no soil metals at all, I think everyone dies of malnutrition within a generation. Are there still metals, they're just not concentrated in veins? That's not how what I'd expect from a planet formed the usual way of crushing a bunch of space rocks with different compositions together. Is it just that somebody already dug it all up and left?

Ignoring that, the only hard cap I'm sure of is a lack of electricity.

Real-world technological advancement is not a "tech tree" and it's not a foregone conclusion that scientific advancement is gated by metallurgy. It just seems that way because people with advanced metallurgy developed the scientific method, colonialism, and the industrial revolution in rapid succession. After the scientific revolution, everyone else is moving in slow motion. And colonialism destroyed a lot of non-Western scientific knowledge.

I'd look into the history of Mesoamerica for ideas about how civilization would progress. They were notoriously metal-poor, but had advanced agriculture (terrace farming, raised fields, chinampas, and somebody bred corn to be the way it is). Tenochtitlan before the Spanish arrived was as large as the largest city in Europe at the time.
