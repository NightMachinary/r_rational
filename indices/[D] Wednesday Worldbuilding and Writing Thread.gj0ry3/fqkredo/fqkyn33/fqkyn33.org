I think I've read something like this somewhere, probably on LessWrong. Send instructions to build a computer, and send the program that you want to run on it. Which happens to be a Friendly AI - friendly only to you, that is. There was also a vintage SF novel with this premise I think, which Richard Dawkins mentions in /The Selfish Gene/.
