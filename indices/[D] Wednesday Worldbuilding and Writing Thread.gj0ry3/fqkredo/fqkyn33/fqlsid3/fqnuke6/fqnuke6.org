This is a bit of a tangent, but why would you want to conquer the galaxy in the absence of FTL? The time and energy costs of travel to and fro would be so prodigious as to render the other world an irrelevance; whatever you hoped to get from the planet could be more easily gained at home. You could never project effective force at that distance to maintain what control you got, or exert enough influence to change the course of an alien civilization. A simple one-way communication would take years or decades.

If you wanted to catalogue their biodiversity, you'd do better to propose a friendly trade of information. As for religion, if they're at all like us, hearing messages from another world will start several new religions all by itself. They won't all change course, and once the novelty fades you'll lose a good few, but it's better than nothing.
