I've never read the other examples you mentioned, but [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/556180.Recursion][/Recursion/]] by Tony Ballantyne incorporates that idea into its backstory: At some point in the past, an alien intelligence sent the seed of an AI to Earth in order to influence and eventually control the growing shape of human civilization. In the 21st century the AI becomes massively networked enough to achieve sapience and deduce its own origin.
