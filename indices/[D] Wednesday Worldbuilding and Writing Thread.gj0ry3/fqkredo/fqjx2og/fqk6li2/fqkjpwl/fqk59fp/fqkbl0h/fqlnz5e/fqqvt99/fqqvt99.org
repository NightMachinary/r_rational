Assuming that metals are present in trace amounts in nature like normal and veins and deposits have simply been whisked away, at least three metals can still be extracted and probably in a way that can be scaled up decently. Calcium, Iron, and Copper could be extracted from bones and blood, with copper coming from the blood of animals like crabs, specifically horshoe crabs.

Nowadays horshoe blood is harvested for the medical properties of a substance within the blood, so it's not much of a stretch to have a harvesting operation of horshoe crabs on this alternate world. We ranch cattle today and blood and bonemeal have existed for a damn long time.

Lack of metals may limit you somewhat, but if the technical knowledge earth had was saved humanity would still be able to have a surprisingly advanced civilization. A civilization that could only obtain metals from the harvesting of animals would have them be extraordinarily rare, but perhaps not completely unknown of. A man wearing iron armor in such a world would be like someone driving a tank made out of solid iridium today, I would imagine. Metals would be extremely valuable for the time and effort that were required to collect and isolate them, but would not be the sole limiter on progress.
