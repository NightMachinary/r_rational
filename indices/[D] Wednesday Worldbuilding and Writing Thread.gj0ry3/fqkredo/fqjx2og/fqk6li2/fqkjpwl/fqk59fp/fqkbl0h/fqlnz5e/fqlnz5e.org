In addition to what others have said, I would be curious about the lack of fossil fuels, as that implies that the world has not had life on it for terribly long (or else had its resources depleted), but you say "much like our own"--do you mean that it has complex plant and animal life? If so, it sounds like there used to be civilization on this planet but it crashed very, very hard. This is supported by the lack of accessible metals, which you'd expect to form naturally. Earth is mostly metal, nickel and iron IIRC.

Did the previous civ expend all fossil fuels and extract the metal wealth without leaving any behind in a salvageable form? You'd expect old tools that could be dug up and salvaged, unless it was so long ago that the tools were very far down. Also, volcanism could potentially introduce new metal supplies from the core, I would think. Not a geologist, though.

This is also assuming that the life forms are biologically compatible with our own; if they evolved independently and constitute truly alien biology, they might not be readily digestible for humans. Assuming they are, the animals couldn't possibly be acclimated to humans, so the more exploitable fauna might go extinct, as happened to the North American megafauna when humans first arrived.
