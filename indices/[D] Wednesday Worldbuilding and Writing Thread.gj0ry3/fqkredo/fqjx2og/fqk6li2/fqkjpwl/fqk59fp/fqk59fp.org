That was a subplot in the Raymond E. Feist books. The antagonists didn't have metal, so they used these swords made of composite material and glue or something. They end up invading another dimension for it.

Also reminds me of the porcelain/glass dichotomy between China and Europe. There's a theory that because their porcelain was so advanced, they never developed glass to the point that Europe did. Europe did develop glass, discovered optics, which allowed the development of physics and then the scientific method.
