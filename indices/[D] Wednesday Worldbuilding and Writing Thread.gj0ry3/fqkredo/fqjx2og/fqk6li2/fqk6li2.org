  How much of civilisation is based on geological resources?
#+end_quote

This is a matter of personal opinion but in my opinion: almost all of it, though it somewhat depends on what you consider to be "geological resources". Here, I'll assume that we have no metal, oil, or coal, but we do have a wide variety of stone, soil, plants, and animals.

Generally speaking, metals are going to be the biggest loss, because their loss makes things like coal and oil virtually irrelevant. Without metalworking, there's more labor involved in virtually everything else, and that excess labor requirement is one of the things that keeps people underfed, which makes them less intelligent and prevents them from having time for developing non-agricultural roles.

Without metals, you still have tools, but they're made of stone, wood, or bone, materials which don't hold an edge nearly as well, are harder to shape (you could quibble there), and generally require more labor per unit. Obsidian or flint are handy to have around, and will make things go better if they can be found in abundance.

Aside from those, animals and plants are the other major thing to worry about, from a "how does civilization look" standpoint. Domesticated animals are really important, as are domesticated crops: the more calories you can get per effort/time, the more you can devote to civilizational needs, and that's what will help slingshot you forward. Some knowledge of selective breeding really helps, but that's long-term, and a lot will depend on the genetics of the host animals and plants, since some are more mutable (and with better variations to hunt for) than others. There are limits to what you can do though, since eventually you have highly efficient plants and animals, and there's no low-hanging fruit left.

Overall, if the climate is favorable, I would expect that people will still form cities, and all the technology is still there for paper and moveable type, if more expensive versions of them (it costs more to cut down a tree, chop it up, make paper from it, and no metal means your type is made from wood). There might be books and literate class, but it would be rare. You /might/ have castles or equivalent, but most likely not, unless you have a very workable stone, and a very workable stone is going to be less good for defense, as well as the whole project costing more. Ceramics exist, and are probably a major industry, especially because there are lots of economies of scale there. People can make glass, if they can get a fire hot enough (IIRC it takes quite a bit of effort, but is doable with wood and wood products alone, don't quote me on that).

And that's about where civilization caps out. You could /maybe/ make an aqueduct or something like it, but there are hard limits on your public works projects, which mean limits on how much leverage "civilization" actually gets you. You can make boats without metal, but they'll be limited in size. For a lot of the upper edges, there would be things that were "possible" but which would never be done because there was such a high cost.
