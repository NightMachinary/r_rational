Question: How much of civilisation is based on geological resources?

Scenario: Some thousands of people (or however many are needed to sustain a population) are dropped into a world much like our own, except no underground resources exist - no metal veins, no oil or coal, nothing. How far along does civilisation progress? How different would it be from our own world's history?
