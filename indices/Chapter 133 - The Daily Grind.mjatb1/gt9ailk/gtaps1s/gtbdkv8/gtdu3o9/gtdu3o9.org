It would kind of suck to put that much effort into the interview process to find they're offering a standard desk-drone job for $10k below industry-standard rates with no benefits, though. And a combination of sunk costs and the impression of excitement built by the process itself would mean they'd probably get people signing up anyway.

I think I'd rather stick with a boring face-to-face meeting swapping questions to find a match.
