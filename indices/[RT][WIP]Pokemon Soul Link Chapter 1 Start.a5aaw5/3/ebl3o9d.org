Nice start, getting some characterisation in. Does needs another pass to catch some typos though, and feels a little stilted in places with overly formal word choices that don't quite /fit/ properly.

Red being a professor rather than a champion trainer/battler puts me in mind of Origin of Species; curious as to whether that's by conscious inspiration or just a fluke parallel.
