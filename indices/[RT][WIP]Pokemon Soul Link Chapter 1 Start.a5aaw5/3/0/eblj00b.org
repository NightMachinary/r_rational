Thanks for the feedback. What word choices/stilted scenes threw you off?

I am taking inspiration from Origin of Species, I won't deny that. I allowed that with Red since he doesn't have a personality in the game, but I'll do best to keep other characters more varied from their conception in DaystarEld's work.
