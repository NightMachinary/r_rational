Here the general summary of what I'm doing with this:

Pokemon Soul Link is a Pokemon fanfiction about a trainer aiming to be the very best, like no one ever was, but by using the very worst Pokemon the games have to offer. While there is already a Pokemon Fanfic on this site, I wanted to focus on the competitive aspect of the Pokemon world and the implementation of a new technology known as the "Soul Link."

I almost tried making it into a Rational Nuzlocke LitRPG, but I think that would've been too ambitious.

Feel free to respond, give criticism, tell me whether my writing is more broken than a Mega Rayquaza or my pacing is slower than a Snorlax or that my worldbuilding is less rational than...I think you get the point.
