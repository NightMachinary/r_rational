Thanks for the feedback. I'll try to hit your points one by one.

When I say Special Defense, I am referring to an attribute of the Pokemon. However, and I did a poor job of clarifying this, Specialized Defenses are an actual thing in the Pokemon world I have created. Steelix happens to have adapted far more Physical Defenses (Hard Iron body) and failed to adapt tolerances for various non-physical attacks, such as energy-based projectiles. A raging sandstorm could certainly help defend against energy attacks such as flamethrower or focus blast due to all the debris and rock shards surrounding the Pokemon, who is the epicenter of the Sandstorm.

I have envisioned Poke Energy as functioning somewhat similarly in Pokemon as it seems to in the Anime. Moves like Fire Punch involve the manipulation of Fire-Type Energy within one's body (a fist is a, non-specialized structure) and deal Physical Damage because it physically hits the target. Thunderbolt involves the manipulation of Electric-Type Energy within a specialized organ (such as Pikachu's Electric sacs) and deals Specialized Damage because its the Electric-Type Energy which deals the damage, not physical force. In this way, I can see physical and special categories being distinct enough for use. If you disagree, feel free to tell me why.

I worried about info-dumping the audience, so I didn't give as much detail as I possibly should have in the beginning.

I originally was going to make this story first-person, but apparent I missed the glaring mistake. Thanks for that.

Apologies for the rampant typos. Perhaps I shouldn't have left my English major.

Thanks for the response. It is these kinds of interactions that will hopefully sharpen by writing skills and provide the best possible experience for you, the audience.

*EDIT* The Antagonism between Albert and Everette is intentional, as I would like to emulate the more dickish rivalry present in the earlier Pokemon games.
