For me, the word choice was less distracting than the way that the sentences are constructed to have more words than they really need to. For example, this phrase:

#+begin_quote
  Albert ceased his ruminations for a moment
#+end_quote

That sounds kind of stilted. If you replace the words "ceased" and "ruminations" with more common words:

#+begin_quote
  Albert stopped his thinking for a moment
#+end_quote

That /still/ sounds kind of stilted. The issue isn't simply with the word choice, but the way the sentence is constructed. It probably sounds more natural like this:

#+begin_quote
  Albert stopped thinking for a moment
#+end_quote

Personally, the vocabulary is not the part that threw me; it's more the way that some sentences seem to have this sort of meandering flow to them where they take a few more detours than necessary to reach the destination, or the fact that sometimes you use one long sentence where two shorter sentences might have been better:

#+begin_quote
  He grabbed his drink, a chocolate moomoo milkshake, and began sipping at it daintily, doing his best to preserve the experience and unconsciously thanking Pallet Town's administration for finally getting both a Pokemon Center and a servicing Poke Mart.
#+end_quote

That is a /ton/ of information to cram into a single sentence. In some cases, it's not the length of the sentence, but the ordering and construction:

#+begin_quote
  For a transient moment in Indigo League history, with talent said to match the young Samson Oak, he was Johto's rising star, a champion in the making.
#+end_quote

I have no problem with the word "transient." I am bothered by the way that the sentence starts with /multiple/ prepositional phrases. The first one is fine, but with the second prepositional phrase, it just feels like a big ol' pile of words got dropped in the middle of the sentence.

One case where vocabulary /did/ throw me is when you referred to things using terms that you hadn't taken the time to define yet. For example, here:

#+begin_quote
  There was a tang of indignation in his voice, as there typically was when his prospective *party* was insulted.
#+end_quote

Okay, I know the literal definition of the word "party," and what I gather is that here you're referring to the fact that Albert feels a bit of pain at hearing that Steelix is being insulted, because Steelix is part of the Pokemon party that he is planning to assemble, and so he vicariously feels insulted when Everette badmouths Steelix. That's my understanding of the situation, and I had to read that paragraph multiple times to come away with that understanding, because we're only on the fourth sentence of the story. We don't know yet that Albert as a "prospective party" of Pokemon that he's speculatively assembling, we don't yet know that Albert has included Steelix as part of his speculative roster, and we're being forced to intuit both of these facts from this sentence (and the scant bits of information that preceded it), which it doesn't feel like we've gotten enough context for.

Another bit about word choice: you seem to have a great fondness for avoiding the word "said" in your dialog tags:

#+begin_quote
  "You put way too much stock in the Soul Link, my dude." Everette *stated*

  "It doesn't need to be fast, it's a giant iron snake" Albert *corrected*

  "Of course." Everette *responded*

  "Yeah, but I don't really need to be the best," Barbara *began.*
#+end_quote

Every single one of these uses could be replaced with the word "said." I understand the impulse to avoid repeating the word "said," as it's usually best to avoid word repetition, but the truth is that when it comes to dialog tags, the word "said" is kind of invisible. "Said" is a word that doesn't draw attention to itself and most people won't be bothered if they read the word "said" a half dozen times in the space of a minute.

However, words like "corrected" and "began" /do/ draw attention to themselves, which is something you want to avoid for dialog tags, because our focus should be on the part of the sentence that is /inside/ the dialog tags. I try to stick to "said" whenever possible. There are a few other words that don't bother me as much, like "shouted" (which is a common enough word that it doesn't draw attention to itself, and it does provide useful information about how the words are being spoken) and "asked" (which is almost as common as "said" and thus achieves almost the same level of invisibility), but reading your story, I got the instinct impression that you were trying to /avoid/ the word "said," and if that's the case I'd urge you to stop avoiding the word "said," as it's a perfectly fine word that is very frequently the best way to communicate that a piece of dialog was spoken.
