Bit of an over-use of certain words, that seem out of place in being longer or more 'fancy' than the surrounding context; /ruminating/ instead of thinking, /desiring/ instead of wanting, /persons/ instead of people, lots of things /causing/ each other, a higher frequency of appearance of /upon/ than seems entirely natural... that kind of thing.

Maybe it's a deliberate stylistic choice that the perspective character is ever so slightly thesarus-y, but it happens in the narration as well as their thoughts/speech.

I have a longer list of nitpicks if you want them (well, not yet an actual list - just a copy of the text with highlights all over it, but if you want that as a list I can PM you)
