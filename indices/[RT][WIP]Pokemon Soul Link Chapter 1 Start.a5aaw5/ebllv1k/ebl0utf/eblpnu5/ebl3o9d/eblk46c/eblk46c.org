Really liked it, just a few typos I spotted;

#+begin_quote
  However, he couldn't the images of chansey using toxic and stalling...
#+end_quote

Should probably have something to bridge it with the next clause in there?

#+begin_quote
  His eyes glanced towards the Poke Mart near the entrance of the building and suddenly felt the urge to purchase another milkshake.
#+end_quote

Should be '...and *he* suddenly...'

#+begin_quote
  ...what could've birthed those two geniuses, the young me who both set off...
#+end_quote

Should be 'young men'

#+begin_quote
  As much as he intellectual understood that fact...
#+end_quote

Should be intellectually.

#+begin_quote
  ...to stabilize his heart, feelings the air inflate and delate his lungs...
#+end_quote

Should be 'feeling' and 'deflate'.

#+begin_quote
  ...covered in white sheet The smell of fresh tauros meat,
#+end_quote

Should be a full stop in there.

#+begin_quote
  "Why're you here to early, ya nerd."
#+end_quote

Should be 'so early', and with a question mark at the end.

#+begin_quote
  He kept his eyes towards the ground. a He had a bad habit of starring...
#+end_quote

Shouldn't have the 'a' before the 'He', and 'staring' rather than 'starring'.

#+begin_quote
  He paused. The second reason, which I think...
#+end_quote

Needs opening speech marks.

#+begin_quote
  "I know what you're all here for, and Its exactly what I'm here for as well,
#+end_quote

'Its' should be 'it's'.

#+begin_quote
  "It's a Pokédexes, and the most recent model...
#+end_quote

Should be 'Pokédex'.

#+begin_quote
  This device is the latest version of the National Pokédexes,
#+end_quote

Same issue.

#+begin_quote
  ...because it feels my heart with too much pride."
#+end_quote

Should be 'fills'.

#+begin_quote
  From the burst of light is summoned came a large rectangular table...
#+end_quote

This sentence needs reworking, but the method to do so can be flexible.

#+begin_quote
  ...starter Pokemon by Last name in alphabetical order.
#+end_quote

'Last' should be uncapitalised.

#+begin_quote
  ...until all your peers have received theirs as well."
#+end_quote

'theirs' should be 'their's'.

#+begin_quote
  Albert strode fourth...
#+end_quote

'fourth' should be 'forth', as Albert is first. And striding forth. Words.

#+begin_quote
  ...making a slight imitation of her friend's swagger,
#+end_quote

'her' should be 'his'.

#+begin_quote
  "Do you very best with this, young man."
#+end_quote

'Do your very best'.

#+begin_quote
  Alberto took words with him as he stepped off the platform.
#+end_quote

'Alberto' to 'Albert', 'words' to something else.

#+begin_quote
  What you should search for in the one entitled Soul Link.
#+end_quote

'search for is'

I really enjoyed what I read there, and can't wait to see future chapters!
