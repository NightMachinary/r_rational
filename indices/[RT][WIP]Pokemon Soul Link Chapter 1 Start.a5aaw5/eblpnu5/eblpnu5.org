As to the actual story content - interesting. Hoping to see more. I don't have the highest opinion on Origin of Species. However, other than it and The Game Of Champions it seems Pokemon as a fandom generally takes a look at Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is bad) and goes, "those are rookie numbers." So it's nice to see people writing something coherent in the space.
