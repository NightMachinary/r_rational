Differentiating between "special attacks" and "physical attacks" (or "special defense" and "physical defense" is perfectly fine; I just noted the use of "special defense" as sounding particularly video game-y because it appeared at a point in the story where it wasn't quite clear to me whether we were in a world where Pokemon exist, or whether we were just observing two characters talking about a video game, so it kind of threw me.

I don't think your exposition came across as info-dumpy. For example, dropping the bit about Albert's skin tone as it contrasted with the other people in the room was a pretty natural way to mention his Sevii Island background. I'd just try to put these things earlier.
