The early scene with the discussion of sandstorm (and how no one actually uses the move sand storm, instead preferring to use Tyranitar and Hippowdon for their sandstream ability), felt like a nod to a very specific kind of Pokemon player. In a way, I felt like this was a nod to people like me: people who, at a minimum, try to min/max their way through the Pokemon world, and usually find the world of competitive battling to be the most interesting part of the Pokemon games. So, if that was your intent (and it sounds like it was), I'd say you succeeded in making this feel like a party that I specifically was invited to.

Small correction: if the remark about special defense is intended to communicate that a Steelix could use sandstorm to enhance its paltry special defense, I don't believe this bit is accurate according to current Pokemon mechanics; sandstorm increases defense for rock types, but Steelix, being a steel/ground hybrid, is not a rock type (despite evolving from a rock type). Unless, of course, this is supposed to be our first indication that the battle mechanics present in your story are going to significantly warp what we're familiar with from the Pokemon games.

That said, an opening that started with discussing game mechanics in this way (using terms like "special defense") made me question whether this was a scene with two boys on earth, discussing the Pokemon video games, or two boys in the Pokemon universe, having a conversation about the creatures that inhabit their world. Would two people in Kanto really talk about Pokemon in terms of their "special defense" being an attribute that could be boosted by using sandstorm? We get pretty far into the story before we learn that the conversation is taking place in Kanto (specifically, Pallet Town).

I appreciate that you avoided the thing that some stories do where the opening paragraphs are dedicated to telling us what the characters look like, how old they are, and listing other biographical details, and the way that you brought up Albert's Sevii Island heritage felt really natural. That being said, we don't really get any indicators of what Albert looks like until pretty far into the chapter, it takes awhile until college is referenced (giving us a pretty good idea of his age) and it's not until 70% of the way through the chapter that Albert's Sevii island heritage is mentioned. I feel like moving this bit of description to the opening paragraphs would have helped to visually anchor Albert's character a bit more, and mentioning his ancestry would have also pretty quickly clarified the fact that this story takes place in the Pokemon universe. (Putting visual description closer to the top also helps to avoid the issue where readers might form their own mental picture of what Albert looks like and then feel surprised when they discover toward the end of the first chapter that he looks different than they imagined him.)

The line about Porygon causing seizures made me grin, and it's a subtle reference that doesn't exclude people who don't recognize it (as opposed to the conversation about sand stream near the top, which sort of felt like something very conspicuously written for a certain kind of reader). I was also amused by the aside about the ghostly woman who terrified an Exeggcute so badly it couldn't evolve.

Things that intrigued me most: the idea of trainer classes requiring a sort of occupational licensing with a regional association mandating that trainers to adhere to a specific "look" to qualify for membership, a main character who actually respects someone who cares more about aesthetic than competition (not always a given for the protagonist of a ratfic), and several references to smartphones and the internet existing.

As you might imagine from this list of things I found "intriguing," the conversation with Barbara was a major highlight for me. I enjoyed the dialog between Albert and Barbara much more than the conversation between Albert and Everette; I wasn't sure whether the Albert and Everette's dialog was supposed to be banter between two friends, or an argument between two rivals. (There are several points where the word "friend" is used to describe their relationship, but their dialog seemed a little too antagonistic to be mere banter.)

Technical/grammar issues:

Viewpoint starts off unclear, as the second sentence is this:

#+begin_quote
  He looked with disgust upon the cards I lay at the table before us.
#+end_quote

The pronouns "I" and "us" make it sound like it's going to be a first-person POV, but it quickly becomes a third-person story (and from that point seems to consistently be a third-person story). Aside from this short departure from viewpoint, it seems to be consistently third-person limited, and I didn't find any other glaring viewpoint errors. Still, I'd recommend fixing that second sentence, especially since this sentence makes such an early impression (fewer parts of your story will receive more harsh scrutiny from casually-interested readers than the opening paragraph).

I noticed lots of problems with dialog tags and punctuation. Like, almost every dialog tag in the story has some small problem with punctuation. e.g.:

#+begin_quote

  - "Do you very best with this, young man." He said.

  - "Steelix is trash" said Everette.

  - "You put way too much stock in the Soul Link, my dude." Everette stated as he leaned back into his chair, as if it were his own home.
#+end_quote

I'd recommend looking up a basic explainer on how to use quotation marks for dialog to prevent this kind of small preventable mistake, [[https://www.grammarly.com/blog/quotation-marks-and-dialogue/][here's one that I found with a quick google search]]. Most of these boil down to just using commas correctly.

Typos:

#+begin_quote

  - However, he couldn't the images of chansey using toxic

  - tyrannitar

  - It wasn't complete untrue that skipping Viridian was could him to have to backtrack later

  - His white lab coat *bounce* as he climbed the steps

  - A specimen---actually, let's not use *that* words

  - But *what's* you find especially pertinent

  - and *Its* exactly what I'm here for as well

  - The man who first put Pallet Town *as* the map

  - Albert strode *fourth* from his spot
