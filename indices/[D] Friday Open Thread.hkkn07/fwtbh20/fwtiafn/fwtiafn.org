The Quantum thief is the first book in a trilogy that makes accelerando look normal.

The Ancillary series are really good identity explorations in a bit of a space opera, with some really alien aliens in the last two.

Murderbot diaries would be overpriced for their length if it weren't for how often you will want to go back and re-read them. It's a great cross between someone seeing themselves as a underachieving curmudgeon and competence porn. Murderbot's (who is an artificial construct of biologicals and cybernetics we' would recognize as a person) attitude about human sexuality will be very refreshing for aces and their attitude towards emotions and their slow personal growth are also very refreshing.
