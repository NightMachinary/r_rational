I have this with boardgames A LOT. Almost all worker placement games play similar; I've yet to find one with a great new twist.

Deckbuilding? Oh your twist is you have to fight monsters with your hand? Cool, still have seen ten deckbuilders already.

The great ones are great for a reason, no need to try to reinvent the wheel.
