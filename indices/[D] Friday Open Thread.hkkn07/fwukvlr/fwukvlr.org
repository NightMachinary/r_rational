I've noticed that as I get older I'm starting to be dismissive of new games. My thinking usually goes something like: 'New game X is out, it looks cool but Y older game does all the same things and more with more content, so why should I bother with the new game..'

​

It seems to me from reading some of the game recs on this thread that this happened to people older than me with older games than the ones that are a reference to me. Which is somewhat interesting enough a thought to share.

​

In case you're curious the games I was thinking of were Rimworld and some other newer colony management games which just seem like worst versions of rimworld to me.
