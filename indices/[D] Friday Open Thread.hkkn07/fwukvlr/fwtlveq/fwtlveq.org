There are multiple problems with the US systems of government (/[[/r/rational][r/rational]] rules reminder: No discussion whatsoever of US politics./). I've been considering an alternative to the "elected representatives versus direct democracy" false choice (while retaining democratic principles).

*With elected representatives*, there is the ideal that society selects some of its best and brightest, and allows them to dedicate their full attention to the needs of society, and who could in principle even save society from its own misguided opinions. That of course ignores complications such as needing to campaign, needing funding for campaigning, needing to apply spin, needing to form a tribal-minded base of support, how rhetoric can be unduly enticing to voters, and how voters can be mislead, particularly with regards to topics they are not experts in, and have no time nor funding (nor perhaps will) to pursue expertise in, particularly given the broad range of important topics that come up. The voter must decide their vote, considering each candidate as an atomic bundle of positions, moralities, philosophies, and diplomatic baggage.

*With direct democracy*, policy questions are posed directly to the people. Such events are by necessity relatively rare: the average voter does not have the time, funding, and/or will to perform an in-depth review of many policy questions, and in many cases, the voter may not care. The votes cast by a single voter are unlikely to change a policy decision; the likely outcome from great personal investment in educating oneself on the breadth and nuance of a policy issue is nothing, at least in terms of the voter's own single vote. In principle, voters could amicably discuss such matters and thereby disseminate any insights gained; in practice, many (including this subreddit) actively avoid discussing political matters due to the emotion, pride, and identity-entanglement that too often characterizes such discussion. Attempts to influence the outcome of direct democracy may target the average voter, who has reduced means (e.g., limited time and lacking proactive education on the matter) to defend themselves (and their society) from bad-faith arguments.

*Apart from direct democracy and political representatives*, our society does use at least one other mechanism: the [filtered] random selection of peers, such as to fill a jury. In the case of a jury, the government establishes at least minimal concern to avoid undue hardship placed upon the jury, and in return asks the jury to represent their society to perform an in-depth analysis of a specific question and return a verdict. I suggest that such a mechanism could be applied to questions of policy, where each policy question can be posed to a sufficient sample of citizens. Perhaps an expert arguer is assigned to each relevant position to be decided, and a rudimentary grounding in the general principles of this 'policy jury' is provided, with standardized rules and guidelines, and an oversight official such as a judge. Such a scheme does still rely upon elected or appointed officials, but does at least place the power of the final decision in the hands of 'the people', and does so in a way that promotes and supports at least hearing genuine and competent counterarguments.

*One variant derived from the above* official jury is the informal organization of collectives of individuals, within which people volunteer their time to dig into policy questions, sharing the burden of self-education, and relying upon mutual respect within the group, as well as perhaps the participation of competing viewpoints to help provide balance. This is a way to mitigate the onerous burden of self-education on every question of policy while retaining a measure of rational consideration on the whole.
