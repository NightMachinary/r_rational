This sounds great but is full of massive holes.

1. The biggest problem is who decides what the issues are and how to frame them. That takes expertise, and without representation there is no check on their power. You wave away framing issues even though a massive amount of our political computing power goes to this and exactly this problem.
2. Who appoints the issue judge? Who assigns the "expert arguer?" Is the effectiveness of these experts measured? By who? If your answer is "by computers," that just gives enormous power to the people who write the algorithms.
3. You're assuming jury selection is fair. Juries lay both harsher criminal penalties than judges, and generally less concerned with issues of rights.
4. Random selection means that inevitably some issues will wind up with vastly irregular views on issues. For instance, it's entirely possible that a group tasked with overseeing our nations infrastructure could fill with train fanatics who decided to end highways.
5. Who safeguards the system to prevent from tampering?
6. Some issues are impossible for the vast majority of non-specialists to research. How many people understand the difference between Neo-Keynesian Economics, MMT, and Supply Side?

Even if all the mechanisms worked out right, without people seizing power (which it wouldn't) all the money and influence would just move to the fourth estate.

Variant: Having voluntary issue selection means that only fanatics and people with a financial stake in each issue will engage with the issue. Think the SLS rocket. (This is how congressional committees work.)
