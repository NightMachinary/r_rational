An optimal government system would heavily weigh long term optimization over short term gains. I don't think most people are capable of thinking in that manner.

​

What we'd likely see is something akin to what we already have, with policy heavily focusing on short term gains, but instead of it being caused by the need for re election it'd be caused by the natural human tendencies to focus on the short term at the cost of the long term.

​

There are humans capable of this kind of thinking, but they are not the majority or even a significant percentage of the population. Which means most democratic systems will tend to be sub optimal.

​

What we need is something better, probably AI and algorithms with heavy human oversight rather than relying on our flawed brains.
