  That requires a lot of trust in the people determining the weights, and personally I don't trust that we can't accurately measure or predict the positive effect of social policies.

The problems you state apply to our current system equally, mine just avoids other issues. Also most things can be measured, simulations can be run, and nothing is 100% accurate.

What we can do is make things better gradually, pretty much everybody agrees that the tribalism and short term focus are big issues. If we can fix those that's already a huge step forward.

There's no way of avoiding the trust issue either, you can move it around but it will never go away without removing humans from the process entirely.
