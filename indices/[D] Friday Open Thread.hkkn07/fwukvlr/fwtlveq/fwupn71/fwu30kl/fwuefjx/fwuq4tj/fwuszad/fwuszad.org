It doesn't need to be a proper AI, just an algorithm to sort policies that gets built upon over time.

​

For instance, we input potential policies with weights given to them based on several factors like short and long term benefits, cost, effectiveness, difficulty to apply and enact etc. We employ capable individuals to rate these factors for each policy and they all input their own numbers that end up averaged out when imputed into the program.

​

Then the program sorts the most optimal potential policies in order based on the weights we set for each of those factors.

​

With that we have policies we can enact in optimal order that are weighted upon and account for several factors we deem important without needing any tribal or emotional involvement on our part and avoid a lot of the problems we currently face.
