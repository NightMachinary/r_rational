  We will operate a deliberative process with approximately 50 randomly-selected members of the community who will meet 6 times between August and November to produce recommendations that will be handed unedited to the Lord Mayor for a direct response.

  Invitations have been sent to 15,000 random households, as the City of Sydney seeks 50 everyday people to take part in a citizens' jury that will help shape the future of Sydney to 2050.

  The Foundation is often commissioned to assist governments and others on public engagement projects. We are fortunate and grateful to our clients for this revenue producing work. The projects are budgeted on a cost recovery basis [...] In most years, there is an operating shortfall, which is underwritten by an annual contribution (from The Anita and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis Family Foundation) ranging from $70,000 to $200,000.

The random selection from a pool of those who respond to invitations does risk self-selection bias. But I find this model interesting particularly in that it appears to be actively operating, at least on a limited scale, even if only providing input to existing government in a non-binding capacity.
