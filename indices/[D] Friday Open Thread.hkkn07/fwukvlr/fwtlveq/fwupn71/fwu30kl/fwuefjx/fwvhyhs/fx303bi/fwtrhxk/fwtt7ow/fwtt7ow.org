We have the resources now to use a hybrid system. For instance, we could do direct democracy through blockchain voting (starting up a new blockchain architecture every so often to prevent the calculation lag BTC now faces) for big picture direction questions like, "Do we go to war" or, "Do we invest heavily in anti-aging medical research." Then, we could have people with degrees in relevant fields be making decisions about how resources are distributed within their fields. Ideally, this means only experts are ever deciding important things like how best to handle climate change, and everyone else handles things which they are actually qualified to.
