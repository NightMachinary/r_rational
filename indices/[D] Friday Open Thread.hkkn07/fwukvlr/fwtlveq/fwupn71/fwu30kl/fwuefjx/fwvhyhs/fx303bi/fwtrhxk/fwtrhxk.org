I was actually playing with some similar ideas a few years ago! Specifically I was thinking about the difference between polls and direct democracy after the Brexit vote. If a poll can predict the result within an acceptable degree of accuracy, why not just do the poll? And what actually is the percent error on a referendum (would the extremely close Brexit vote have been different if it happened a day earlier or later)?

Decision by randomly sampled poll is quite similar to decision by jury. I didn't think of actually electing that jury into a working group and having them research until they could come up with policy, though (which is a very interesting idea btw). My thoughts at the time were more based on using permanent organizations of experts. I think I like your version better.

In case it's interesting to folks, the toy model I was thinking of four years ago was to divide political questions into two categories - values judgements and policy questions. Values judgements (how much inequality is allowable? retribution vs crime reduction? whose rights get protected?) are determined by routine random poll (conducting and communicating the results of polls is one of the branches of government). The goal of policy is to produce outcomes according to these values. The policy branch of the government produces pilot programs with measurable impacts, tries them, and expands the ones that succeed. Both are kept in check by the possibility of a vote of no confidence leading to a replacement of the leadership.
