I don't actually think any of the issues in the current system are solved through the adoption of a policy jury. Either the jury is truly random, in which case you end up with roughly the same result as you would have in a direct democracy, or the filtering ends up becoming a political question that dominates the eventual outcome. I think the latter is most likely. You'd simply see a new version of the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture][regulatory capture]] occur with these juries.

Additionally, I would argue that our current system is fairly close to a jury system in some regards, and that that is the reason for some of it's flaws. Essentially, members of congress often don't have the time or inclination to become experts themselves, so they are instead governed by the position relevant stakeholders bring to them. Naturally, corporations and other organized entities have an outsized capacity to bring coherent ideas to congresspeople in format that they can easily implement (up to corporations literally writing the legislation that will be implemented to regulate them). A policy jury would fall afoul of the same problem, where the corporations with the biggest stake in the issue would exercise significant control over the outcome by consulting for the people ostensibly making the decisions.
