OKAY SO this is one of those anecdotes that requires a lot of setup and has very little payoff, which is great becuase it's basically how i communicate, so it'll not come as a surprise to anyone who has seen me around.

the scene: The Christmas Market, La Defense, Paris, France, late November 2019.

the background that got me here: I have just seen my now-LDR partner Mathieu for the last time before I return to Australia to live in the Real World. I spent about 45 minutes on the metro to get from central Paris to La Defense, crying quite a bit because it was a sad situation. I'd arranged to meet my other-now-LDR partner Jacques for lunch in La Defense, which is where he works. We had lunch at Chipotle, because vegan food + france is a non-starter. His lunch break was over and I decided to check out the aforementioned Christmas Market.

the story:

I was looking through the stalls trying to see if there was anything appropriately tacky for me to buy (there wasn't), when I found a stall selling vegan food (what!). It was a small and kind of crummy stall, the sort of thing you might find at markets here, but they were selling a sort of chickpea on bread concoction (which they called raclettes, in the traditional vegan style of naming something after something non-vegan which only serves to disappoint vegans and make non-vegans think vegans are delusional as to what non-vegan food tastes like). I want to impress upon you how much a vegan stall in a French market is an aberration. I wanted to buy their "raclettes", even if I knew they would taste like some sort of hummus analogue rather than the melted cheese they were implying. But I was full and they were expensive. But, like most of the other stalls, they sold mulled wine!

I don't drink alcohol. Ever. It's just not my thing. But I'm texting Jacques about this, and he's responding to me regularly. I had also texted Mathieu but he was in a meeting at work or something so he hadn't responded.

Jacques said to me, "mulled wine isn't alcoholic! we give it to children!"

So I bought the mulled wine, thinking I'd have a nice warm beverage treat and support the vegan stall with my money (four euro, IIRC). Plus I described it to Jacques so he could try it out for lunch one day (he hates cheese in all forms, once again proving that the Alsace region his genetic heritage hails from is actually rightfully German), but I was convinced that their attempt at replicating it would fall flat enough that he could eat it (plus, he was a fan of hummus, so a warm hummus sandwich was the sort of thing that would go down well). Aside: he said it tasted terrible, but not because it tasted like cheese, but just because it was bad in general.

I start drinking the mulled wine. It's nice and warm and spicy, but I can tell it's alcoholic because it has that sharp, alcohol taste. I can feel it start to go to my head. I text Jacques and ask him if he's sure it's non alcoholic. I text my polycule group chat and explain that I'm drinking mulled wine and Jacques told me it wasn't alcoholic. I text Mathieu, who is a fellow vegan teetoler and will thus completely understand my drive to support a vegan business while not drinking alcohol, and tell him I bought the mulled wine but I'm worried it's alcoholic, but it can't be because Jacques said they give it to children.

I get a text message from Kaylee, my husband's girlfriend, saying "yeah nah mulled wine is alcoholic", and her partner Bradley chimes in, "yes, definitely alcoholic".

Mathieu texts me back, his meeting over, and says "yeah, it's alcoholic. we do give it to children but it's alcoholic"

Jacques texts me back, "I've talked to my coworkers and yes it's alcoholic"

The stubborn stingy person I am, I keep drinking it. It's warm and I'm cold. I paid four euro for it and I'm not going to waste it.

So that is how I end up tipsy as fuck wandering around the La Defense train station, which actually worked out well because it completely distracted me from the fact that I was miserable about saying goodbye to Mathieu.

[on the off-chance that couteaubleau, who has briefly met Jacques but not Mathieu, reads this, names have been changed]
