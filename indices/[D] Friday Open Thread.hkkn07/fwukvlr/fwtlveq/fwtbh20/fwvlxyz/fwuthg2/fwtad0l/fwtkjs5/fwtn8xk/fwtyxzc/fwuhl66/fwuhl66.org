I've been hooked on Dominions 5 for 9 month now, recently started playing online multiplayer.

Cons: very high learning curve, bad graphics, bad UI

Pros: Very deep gameplay, counters+counter-counters etc, active community, deep strategic decisions even before the game (pretender design)

Lucid tactics, Attica, Generalconfusion are youtubers who have videos on the game.
