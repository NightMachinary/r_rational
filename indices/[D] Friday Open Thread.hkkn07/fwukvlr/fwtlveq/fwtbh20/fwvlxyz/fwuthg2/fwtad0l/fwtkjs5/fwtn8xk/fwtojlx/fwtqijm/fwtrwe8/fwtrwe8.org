I'll give Endless Legend a try! Apparently I already own it and never got around to it. Thanks!

If you like lighter 4X games (really more of a 3X game), I recommend [[https://krajzeg.itch.io/slipways][Slipways]]. And if you like that I recommend my own [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJP0tie-30][Space Trains]].

I'd appreciate it. I'm curious, but it's hard to say whether I'd gel with a forum without being able to read any of their posts.

  But there will probably be a standalone forum set up for CTH refugees in a week or two.

Yeah, I'm following along on that effort on their discord.
