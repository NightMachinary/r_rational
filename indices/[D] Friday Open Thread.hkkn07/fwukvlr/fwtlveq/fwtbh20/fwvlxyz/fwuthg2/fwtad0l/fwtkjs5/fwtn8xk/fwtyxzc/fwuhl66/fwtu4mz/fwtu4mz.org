I used to frequent [[/r/Dankleft]], but a maoist mod banned me for having rented out a room in my house in the past. I am not quite sure if the people there actually advocate killing all landlords or if that's a meme to them.

I love [[/r/ShermanPosting]], and you will too if Unionist, anti-slaver Civil War shitposting is something you enjoy.

[[/r/coolamericafacts]] features super niche leftist memes meant to trick people into learning about American atrocities. Amusing for sure, but doesn't scratch the same itch.

[[/r/therightcantmeme]] is pretty good, as is the slightly more niche [[/r/toiletpaperusa]]. Neither are really leftist communities, they just make fun of righties.

[[/r/SelfAwarewolves]] and [[/r/leopardsatemyface]] are also quite good.
