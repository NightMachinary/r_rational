  If so, what makes you like MOO2 more?

Well, for one, back in the day, it was a lot easier to cheat at. >;)

More seriously - it's just about the epitome of a good sequel; it takes just about everything that was fun in MOO1, and adds further choices and game-level interactions around them. You can play a simple, MOO1-like game - or get deep into the weeds customizing your species, the galaxy, which parts of the tech-tree to focus on, ship-design, tactics, and so forth.

  I actually haven't played SMAC yet, maybe I should try it.

I like SMAC at least as much for the setting as the gameplay; you might want to watch some of the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8407FAE1DDDA0A31][secret-project videos]], read the Paean to SMAC (starting [[https://paeantosmac.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/introduction/][here]]), go over some of the [[https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/96102-sid-meiers-alpha-centauri/faqs][strategy guides]], and find copies of the GURPS supplement, comic, and novel trilogy...

... or go old-style, and just dive right in and learn as you go, the way we all used to have to learn video games. :)
