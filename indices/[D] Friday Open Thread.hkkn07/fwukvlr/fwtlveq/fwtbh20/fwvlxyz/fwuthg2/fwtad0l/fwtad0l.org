In the story I'm currently writing, I have an odd urge to try to crowbar in some mention of how the numbers 1.41378245 and -0.897371411 have something in common; and how they inexorably lead to the number 0.943635485+0.218233871i. ... Assuming I got the math right. (My initial estimates were that they were somewhere around 1.4, -0.9, and 0.9+0.2i, so I'm reasonably confident I haven't gone /too/ far wrong.)

If you look at a [[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Binet-Fibonacci-Curve_fig6_318785379][picture]] of the Binet-Fibonacci curve, it's where the loop crosses the spiral; the 1.413th and -8.987th Fibonacci numbers are both 0.943+0.218i. I have absolutely no idea what use these numbers are, but I haven't been able to find anyone else on the internet who's ever mentioned it.
