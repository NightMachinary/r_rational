  Bit of a stretch to ask here, but if anyone has any recommendations for far-left humor forums, I could use a new one. I didn't realize just how much of my ability to cope with the state of US politics was based on having CTH around, but they're gone now so a lot of things are catching up to me that used to slide off my back.

There's a discord server for CTH at the moment, and they're working to get a Lemmy instance up, if either of those interest you.

Alternatively, for left-wing memes (although typically less of a focus on electoralism), [[/r/GenZommunist]] [[/r/MoreTankieChapo]] and [[/r/alltheleft/]]. [[/r/GreenAndPleasant]] is similar to CTH, but focuses on UK politics.

(I hope I'm not breaking the subreddit rules about political discussion - I don't make any claims about whether these subreddits are good/accurate, just that they have a leftwing slant)
