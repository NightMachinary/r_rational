I'm a teetotaller because my parents, particularly my mother, use it in a way that's unhealthy and I don't want myself to go there.

I didn't really enjoy the taste of the drink, it was just warm.

I think the vegan-teetotaller crossover is not as big as you think, in dating it's really hard to find vegan men who don't drink and/or don't use marijuana (I avoid the devil's lettuce for the same reasons as alcohol). Like, in fact, I liked Mathieu on OKC because he was marked as vegan and non-drinker and I liked Jacques partly because his profile was a "greatest hits" of [[/r/rational]] and partly because he'd marked himself as a non-drinker (turns out much like cheese he just doesn't enjoy the taste of alcohol).

But it's probably all borne from the same "healthy living" effect that causes the crossover with gluten free.
