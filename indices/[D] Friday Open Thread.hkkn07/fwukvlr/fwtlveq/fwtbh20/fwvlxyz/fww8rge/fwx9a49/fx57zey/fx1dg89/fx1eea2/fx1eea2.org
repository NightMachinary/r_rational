  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/afi8r7/do_you_think_this_community_is_a_bit_snobby/ee0neqa/][/Harry/ doesn't see a reason for Ron to exist. He exists in Hermione's universe just fine, and also in Ch. 88. And from a Doylist perspective, HPMOR should always be considered set against the universe of Harry Potter fanfic rather than the originals, and for the characters themselves to be struggling against the fate that HP fanfic tries to assign them.]]

So I think an argument could be made that Harry's attitude towards Ron doesn't count as a jab at canon.
