That was very thorough, thank you. To be fair, it's been a little while since the last time I read HPMOR, and far longer still since I've read canon.

Still though, my point was that - to me - the jabs seem infrequent enough that they really shouldn't be an issue. We've got 18 or 19 in this thread. But I said /like/ 5 jabs. Even if there's like 20 jabs, 20 things is like 5 things in relation to the /thousands/ of things HPMOR contains.

If there's five thousand things in HPMOR, then if 5 of those things are jabs then one out of every 1000 things is a jab and if 20 of those things are jabs then one out of every 250 things is a jab. Saying "every time EY would have a character take a jab at some aspect of canon" feels like it's talking as if one out of every 10 things is a jab (like in the Marvel movies (which I like just fine btw, I'm not dissing Marvel) the average interval between jokes is like 70 seconds).

If it takes like 30 or 40 hours to read HPMOR, and if there's like 20 jabs, then there's a jab like once every two hours. Maybe it's that the jabs are more frequent in earlier chapters so they seem like a bigger part of the story than they actually are. Maybe something like a jab every 20 minutes in the first few chapters, then the next dozen or two a jab every 45 minutes, then the rest of the book a jab every 4 hours. You can read an entire 300 page book in like 4 hours. There's like 60,000 words between chapters 74 and 84, that's over three hours.

Idk, I just think it really shouldn't be seen as a big deal, especially when it could be coherently argued that a lot of (possibly most of or all of) the jabs are mostly (possibly entirely) valid ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
