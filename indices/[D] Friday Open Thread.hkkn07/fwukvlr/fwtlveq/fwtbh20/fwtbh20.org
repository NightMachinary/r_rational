Just got in the Coursera NLP specialization and find it really interesting. Really enjoy the concept of machines being able to understand what we say. Currently on the [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp][classification and vector spaces course]], struggling a little due to my lack of CS background but overall its an enjoyable experience. Anyone else here working on NLP and what are some fun projects you've made?

Also looking for a good sci fi series to read. What are some novels you've found epic?
