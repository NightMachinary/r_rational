Rimworld seems like a worse version of Dwarf Fortress to me ;-).

I assume some of this musing is based on me mentioning that MOO1 is my favorite 4X game, as it came out in 1993. Something that you might find surprising though is that I started playing it in 2014, after having played a lot of more modern games in the genre.

Genres also tend to have a natural trajectory to them. 4X games have gotten bigger and more complicated over time. Platformers are harder with more checkpoints. AAA shooters went from action games to story-driven to squad-based with cover mechanics and now have a pile of open world mechanics they're expected to have. Sometimes that drift is in a direction you like, sometimes it's not. As you get older, the chances that genre drift has left you behind get higher. But that also happens if you go back and play old classics, as happened to me.

Though I think getting older makes learning complex details of new games/genres less appealing. For example I have no particular desire to learn the massive pile of rules and characters behind a modern MOBA, even though that's less than the effort it took me to learn Dwarf Fortress a dozen years ago.
