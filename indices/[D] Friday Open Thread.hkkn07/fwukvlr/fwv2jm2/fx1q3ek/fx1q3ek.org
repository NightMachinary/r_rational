  4X games have gotten bigger and more complicated over time.

In my experience as a fanatic paradox fan, 4X games have gotten bigger, but less complicated. I love Victoria 2 and its janky economy to death, but as much as EU4's mana system irritates me it is simply a much cleaner game. Compare also CIV 5 to CIV 6, with the district system replacing the old tile/city improvements system.
