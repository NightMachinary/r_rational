That's because nodes in civ are more complex and serve different purposes over time. There's times when you want to build a wander or pop out a settler then you optimize production, most of the time you want growth so you optimize for that. Instead of this node's optimal state is X so it should always do X and when it's optimized I don't want to bother with it again.

But yes you need to build the infrastructure, it's one of the most fun parts of the game for some people. There are also more victory types, like culture, religion, science etc. Sure the optimal strategy tends to be cripple everybody else with war and diplomacy then win by default but there are interesting ways to challenge yourself you can set up.

Search Martin Fenka, he does Civ V vox populi playthroughs, the difference is he does them on deity and generally with some big limitation like avoiding war at all costs, or winning with only one city.

There's a large number of people that can play on deity but most just do the cripple everyone through war then win strategy, he's the only one I'm aware of that actually does things in a more interesting way, granted it involves optimization to an immense degree but it's more interesting than most.
