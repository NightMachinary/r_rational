I'm actually pretty interested in Civ 6, but last I heard the AI was pretty weak, and I haven't heard of any mods that fix it.

The reason I don't care for complexity in 4X games isn't the learning curve (I already know the genre, so it's not that big of a deal). Rather, it's that the complexity so often adds extra decisions between the ones that actually matter. Like in Civ to get a city to full productivity you have to build all the available hammer-boosting and food-boosting buildings, and in MOO to get a planet to full productivity you just max the industrialize slider. There's the same decision ("get node to full productivity"), but in one version you also have to click a bunch and maybe solve some trivially easy math puzzle on the way.
