  Rimworld seems like a worse version of Dwarf Fortress to me ;-)
#+end_quote

Yes and no. Rimworld has a scifi setting and is open to all kinds of things you'd see in one like spaceship bases, crazy technology, evil AI enemies, space traders, genetic manipulation, human leather memes.. Also modding and all that entails.

I'm exited for Dwarf fortress when it comes out on steam this year, until then all it does for me is to be content for somewhat interesting youtube videos.. But yes I don't doubt it's better or just as good, but with the settings differing there's room for both to coexist somewhat filling different niches.

  Genres also tend to have a natural trajectory to them. 4X games have gotten bigger and more complicated over time.

I think you are likely overestimating how complex the new 4x games are. It's just a higher learning curve but the gameplay is basically the same. i.e read a few more paragraphs of in game descriptions of tech and units before playing.

Personally I find Civ 6 to be good, not better than Civ 5 vox populi but still fairly good.

PS. Mods make a big difference, and should not be overlooked. It matters very little if one game is technically worst than another without mods. We are playing on PC, mods are a given.
