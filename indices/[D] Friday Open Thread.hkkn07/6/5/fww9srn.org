There's an entire genre of MOO-inspired 4X out there: Galactic Civilizations, StarDrive, Stellaris, Star Traders... though tbh I'd be hard pressed to pick one out that's got less micromanagement than MOO1, so YMMV I guess.

For the record I'll note that [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250690/Master_of_Magic_Caster_of_Magic/][Caster Of Magic]], a huge collection of fixes and rebalancings for Master of Magic, is now on Steam ;)

There's an emerging genre of FTLlikes that might be more up your street - these tend to focus more on exploration that the other Xs, but the best are a mix of both, and by and large are much more streamlined than the MOO-heritage lot. Maybe try Halcyon 6 to see if that scratches an itch.
