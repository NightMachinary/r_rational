An interesting 4x game that is often overlooked is [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/261470/Distant_Worlds_Universe/][Distant Worlds: Universe]]. Looks like it's on sale right now, so it's totally worth it; I think part of the reason why it's not particularly well known is because it was almost never on sale when it came out.

What makes the game interesting is that it's a 4x game, but not turn-based; it's real-time with pause.

Also, your government will basically run itself (poorly) if left alone, so you can totally just run off and go explore the galaxy while directly controlling a single ship if you want to.

Edit: it's apparently been like six years since I played the game, and from looking at the recent reviews +there's a decent chance it won't run on Windows 10+ it may or may not run on Win10. It worked for me, but there's plenty of unhappy people in the reviews complaining that it doesn't work - so be ready to refund it if you buy it.

Double edit: since I have both Windows 10 and the game, I figured I might as well install it and see if it really doesn't work. Seems fine to me?
