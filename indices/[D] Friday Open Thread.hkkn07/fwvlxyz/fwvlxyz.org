Sort of rational but definitely unpopular, so, putting it here: I've completely given up on WtC. And it's because it's too rational.

What I mean is, it is too /self aware/ in it's rationality. My breaking point was a while back, some speech of Amaryllis's, after the clones thing, where... I don't even remember right now what she was talking about but it felt like the author was slapping me in the face with How Fucking Rational everything is.

I just /couldn't/ anymore.

I like rational just fine. I finished HPMOR. I like it when things make sense and people act like people and make sensible decisions and the progression of events is logical. I can't even put into words what it was with that scene or that story, and I know disliking WtC is like heresy here, so, sorry, I just really needed to get this off my chest.

I had a bad time and kind of snapped on something that has all the hallmarks of something I should be able to enjoy but can't anymore.

Just somebody please tell me if they ever manage to resurrect... Well, you know who.
