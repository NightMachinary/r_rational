I mean, are there /really/ more than maybe like 5 jabs at canon in the entire 660,000 words, though? There's Rowling's bad math with the galleons and sickles and knuts, there's the Half-Blood Prince bathroom scene, an argument could be made for the changes to Transfiguration being a jab... What else is a jab aimed specifically at canon? Hermione should've been in Ravenclaw? Voldemort is a cartoon villain? The Snitch breaks Quidditch?

I'm not trying to be argumentative here, I really am just genuinely curious.
