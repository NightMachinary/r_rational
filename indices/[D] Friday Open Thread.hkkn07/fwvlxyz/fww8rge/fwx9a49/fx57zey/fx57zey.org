- In chapter 6 McGonagall says it's unusual and unhealthy for Harry to be as paranoid as he is. Harry's rejoinder about the planning fallacy includes several hypothetical catastrophes that actually happened in canon, including: death eaters attacking the school, students getting bitten, and Sirius Black escaping Azkaban. It's a joke about how none of the responsible adults in canon effectively prepared for or protected against those events.

- Chapter 7 makes a joke at canon!Harry's expense, since canon!Harry was nearly late due to not knowing where to find Platform 9^{3/4} : /Maybe this was the equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids couldn't become wizards. (And the amount of extra time you gave yourself would determine your Conscientiousness, which was the second most important factor in scholarly success.)/

- In chapter 14 Harry has a rational response to learning about the existence of the Chamber of Secrets which directly pokes fun at the kids' actions in canon: /"It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor," Harry said kindly./

- Same scene in chapter 14, Harry casts shade on the illogical way house points are awarded in canon: /Harry shook his head again. "It's not fair to the other children if I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of and they can't."/

- In chapter 39 Harry makes fun of canon Dumbledore's 'wise' talks: /Well, sounding wise wasn't difficult. It was a lot easier than being intelligent, actually, since you didn't have to say anything surprising or come up with any new insights. You just let your brain's pattern-matching software complete the cliche, using whatever Deep Wisdom you'd stored previously./ (I've seen people interpret that whole discussion of deathism as insulting canon.)

- In chapter 63 an unnamed character points out the absurdity of the Molly/Bellatrix duel in canon: /Ron Weasley said loudly, “Get in line, you lot, I got an owl from Mum this morning, she says to tell everyone she's called dibs” and someone said “ Molly Weasley against Bellatrix Black? Who does she even think she's kidding -”/

- In chapter 74 Harry insults the intelligence of canon!Harry for trying to steal from the restricted section of the library: /He had decided some time ago against trying to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library, for much the same reason he'd decided a year earlier not to look up how to make explosives out of common household materials. Harry prided himself on at least having more sense than people thought he did./

- Chapter 84 casts shade on canon!Dumbledore's claim that talking about trauma in the immediate aftermath is therapeutically beneficial.

- Chapter 100 makes fun of canon!Harry's response to learning about the 'side effects' of drinking unicorn blood: Canon: /“But who'd be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?”/ HPMOR:/“Side effects? Side effects? What kind of side effect is medically worse than DEATH?”/

- Also in chapter 100, Harry points out the absurdity of hiring Hagrid to teach Care of Magical Creatures.

- Chapter 107-109 makes fun of the canon obstacles protecting the Philosopher's Stone. For example: /"Nope," Harry said after skimming the parchment. "Testing whether the entrant can solve a ridiculously straightforward logic puzzle about the order of the ingredients is still not a challenge that behaves differently for authorized and unauthorized personnel."/
