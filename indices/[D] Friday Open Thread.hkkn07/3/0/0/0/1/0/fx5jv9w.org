I don't think the proportion of jabs to non-jabs is relevant in this case. People don't typically engage in high level analysis when forming their opinion of something; what matters to them is usually a more nebulous and subjective 'general feeling' or 'overall impression'. For many people, even a small proportion would leave too strong of an impression that taints their overall enjoyment of the story.

For myself, I never found the 'jabs' offensive because I see them as in-jokes: EY is a member of the Harry Potter fanfiction community, and in my mind that membership grants him license to poke fun at bits of the fandom without coming across as mean spirited.
