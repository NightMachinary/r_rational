Your preferences are valid, but it seems odd to me that you'd find HPMOR /less/ obnoxiously rational than WtC. Maybe it's just my familiarity with the source material, but I found myself rolling my eyes every time EY would have a character take a jab at some aspect of canon he didn't find sufficiently rational, then explain his own rationalified version of it.
