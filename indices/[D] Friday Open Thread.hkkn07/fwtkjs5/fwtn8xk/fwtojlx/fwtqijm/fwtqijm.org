  I have played: Civ 2, 3, 4. MOO1, MOO2 briefly. Dominus Galaxia. Star Drive. Certainly others that I'm forgetting.

Hmmm. I'm not a fan of Civ V & VI, tbh, so I won't recommend those. Endless Legend (fantasy) and Endless Space 2 aren't perfect, but they, along with Civ IV, is what I usually install when I get an itch to play a 4X game. They are definitely more complicated than MOO1, though.

On the lighter 4X end, I really like Civ Revolution, but it's only available on mobile and Nintendo DS (which is what I play it on.) Other 4X-lite-ish games that I like are Space Tyrant and Antihero.

Yeah, I think. It went free a few ago because SomethingAwful almost imploded. I guess find someone who'll invite you? :)

But there will probably be a standalone forum set up for CTH refugees in a week or two.
