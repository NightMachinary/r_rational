As far as 4X games go I'm a big fan of EU4. It's pretty focused in war-time with a lot of tactical maneuvering (if you can force your enemy to attack you in the mountains, that can change the course of the battle, and if you control the seas then a strategic foothold on land can keep their army from grouping up) and has a lot of interconnected systems that create lots of little optimization opportunities.

It tends to become micromanagement-heavy if you go for a world conquest, but the map is large enough that you can conquer and expand for the entire game without micromanagement and still have fun. In addition, the starting map being based on real-life history gives a dynamic difficulty setting: playing as the powerful France is a much easier game than trying to survive Ottoman aggression as Albania. The irl grounding also gives it good ground for roleplay aesthetic, if that's appealing.
