Does anyone here play 4X strategy games? I'm looking for a new one. My favorite is the original Master Of Orion for how streamlined it is - I tried going back to Civ after and the whole game feels like dull micromanagement by comparison. But I'm finally wearing MOO out after a couple hundred hours played, so something new would be nice.

Bit of a stretch to ask here, but if anyone has any recommendations for far-left humor forums, I could use a new one. I didn't realize just how much of my ability to cope with the state of US politics was based on having CTH around, but they're gone now so a lot of things are catching up to me that used to slide off my back.

Finally, I'd like to recommend [[https://acoup.blog/][A Collection Of Unmitigated Pedantry]], a historian's look at media depictions of medieval and ancient Europe. He has a "resources for worldbuilders" index that would be of interest to a lot of folks here, but it's also just a really comfortable introduction to some concepts in the study of history that a lot of pop-history misses out on. Tons of fascinating stuff in there.

(I'll repost in the main rec thread but I forgot last week.)
