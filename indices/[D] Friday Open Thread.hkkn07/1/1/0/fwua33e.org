I think there are two key differences.

1. A truly random policy jury can focus (is focused) on the specific issue in a way that a full-direct-democracy voter does not. We do no decide court verdicts based upon popular opinion, even in well-known cases. Take for example, the McDonald's 'hot coffee' suit, where McDonalds spent money on a propaganda campaign to the point where some people believe the lawsuit was frivolous, when in fact it was a case of severe and permanent bodily harm that came after multiple warnings about the literally hazardous temperature of the coffee that was being served, and a refusal on McDonald's part to settle for even the mere medical costs.
2. Another issue I have with the current state of US government is how money is allowed to flow into political campaigns. Corporations are treated as individuals, and money can by speech, so corporations can for example contribute to organizations to buy ads in support not of candidates but of positions espoused by candidates. These groups are disallowed from coordinating with campaigns, but it is my position that such large sums of money would not be put out there if they did not have an effect on our democracy. There are of course other issues (and rules, effective or not) with campaign donations, solicitations, gifts of jobs, or other favors or favorable trades. I will not pass judgement here on this, but I will bring it up as an example: there were concerns that speaking fees given to a politician may have been a form of transfer of wealth; or at least that there is the potential for the abuse of such a system. Or, setting aside the question of whether politicians can be corrupted in such ways, there is the point again that contributions (etc) would not be made if they had no effect: It is possible to corrupt a political system without corrupting or even influencing any single politician or official, by causing favorable individuals to hold power.

That said, yes, there are holes in the policy jury scheme, including extortion, bribery, blackmail, broad propaganda campaigns, specific propaganda campaigns, propaganda intended to inoculate potential jury members in advance against rational argument (e.g., steeping in emotion, and glorifying pre-commitment, faith in one's position, cynicism, etc). This is countered (to the extent achievable) by whatever appropriate safeguards and watchdogs are applied, along with the exposure of the jury to the specific 'expert arguers' assigned to argue each position -- much like a jury trial with a prosecution and defense representation (with, ideally, an impartial judge presiding).
