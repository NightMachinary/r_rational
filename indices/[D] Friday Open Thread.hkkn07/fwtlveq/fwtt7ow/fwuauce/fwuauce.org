I would not trust people at large to abstain from votes that they have not sufficiently studied. On the contrary, I would expect to find encouragement for laypeople to vote, with some bad-faith or simply confused argumentation be made to "rile up the base".

That is part of why I suggest conscripting some people at random onto the jury, and forcing the 'case' upon them for consideration, as a civic duty.
