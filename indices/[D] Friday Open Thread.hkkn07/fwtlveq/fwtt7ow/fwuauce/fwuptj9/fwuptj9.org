I'm suggesting that the system directly prevents them from voting on issues they are not educated on. So if you pass some certified online courses it unlocks a few big-picture polls in the field. Once you get a degree, you notify the system and it unlocks more granular votes. Once you have some amount of time worked in a field, it unlocks more polls pertaining to that field. People with PHDs and time worked in the field unlock all votes in the field.

Assigning who should be allowed to vote on which issues such that as many people as possible are allowed to vote without compromising the quality of education and experience in the voter pool probably requires some level of AI, but it probably doesn't require AGI. Something capable of parsing natural languages could probably assign most questions reasonably accurately, understanding that with many different categories and levels of voting in such a system, just getting close to optimal poll distribution is going to be as good as being completely optimal. The whole point of voting is to make use of the incredible prediction and modeling engine that is human intuition, while averaging out the vast differences introduced by different people being different. So the system just tosses everything into rough buckets, and people get to harness the power of a well-educated prediction market to run their whole society.
