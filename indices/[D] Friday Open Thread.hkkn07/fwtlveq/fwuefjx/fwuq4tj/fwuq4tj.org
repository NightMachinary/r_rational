The opposite thought had occurred to me. I suspected specialized AI (or other productivity technology) would increasingly encroach upon jobs currently performed by humans. This could in principle lead to continued growth of "the economy", while employing fewer people. That frees up humans to pursue or be employed in civic duties such as education and self-governance. There might be some marriage of concepts like universal basic income, jobs programs, and mandatory service -- all pointing in the direction of civic service. The policy jury concept along this broader notion of 'civic service' is intended to raise the bar for human thought, both generally, and in specific application within these juries. However, I could only speculate about its effectiveness. And, granted, you could push for more civic education without the juries.

I'm not sure that current AI is ready to be thrown at the problem of governance, except perhaps in very narrow, well-defined roles. Hypothetically, if you have a friendly and capable AI-based government, it is presumed or even defined to be superior to a human-based government system. But I would have concerns about the philosophical and ethical alignment of a dominant AI entity. Not leastwise, there are multiple world leaders who I would not like to see defining objectives for a powerful AI.
