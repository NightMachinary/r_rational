I'm reasonably confident they're irrational, given the formulas I've been toying with. But my math chops aren't quite good enough to figure out how to work out any of the three numbers to arbitrary precision; I had to do some manual trial-and-error calculating to narrow the ranges they fell into, and just kept at that until my calculator ran out of digits. (I had some insomnia last night, and it seemed more worthwhile than just trying to count sheep.)

For the spiral, you might get some decent initial insight out of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghxQA3vvhsk][this video]].
