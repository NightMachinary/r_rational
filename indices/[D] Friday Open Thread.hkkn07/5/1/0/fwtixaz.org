Quite sure; I actually expected them to be that simple myself. :)

I just doublechecked with WolframAlpha's Mathematica, and sqrt(2) would lead to 0.943510+0.218270i ; while -2/sqrt(5) would lead to 0.941078+0.223949i. They just don't quite match up.

(Mind you, for story-plot purposes, they might make for a dandy pair of false leads, if I can drop some initial hints of only two digits of accuracy...)
