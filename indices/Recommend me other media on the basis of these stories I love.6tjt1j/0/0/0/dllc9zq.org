The Snake Report is very much like it, though written in English on Reddit as a response to a Writing Prompt. The difference between it and Spider, in a broad stroke, is that The Snake Report is more frantic. Things rarely feel in his control and his plans often backfire as much as they work, but at the end of the day he still finds a way to survive. Overall, it's /very/ fun to read.
