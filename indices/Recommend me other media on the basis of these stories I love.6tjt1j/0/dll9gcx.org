Before anything else, have you checked this subreddit's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki]] yet? It includes many of this genre's defining works and other works more alike rational fiction than unalike.

Special recommendation out of the stories there is [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/][The Waves Arisen]], a Naruto fanfic in which Naruto is clever and in a unique enough position to exploit the system and skyrockets in power as the threats he has to face escalate just as fast.

Alongside The Waves Arisen I can draw special attention to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][The Two Year Emperor]], a story about a Rules As Written D&D setting where a country's system of government involves summoning random people from the multiverse to be a dictator for two years. The kingdom is under threat from a large foreign army, and the new king happens to be a D&D player from Earth; exploits ensue. Like The Waves Arisen, the power levels skyrocket pretty quickly on both sides and it is very satisfying to read.

Similar to Two Year Emperor, I can recommend [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]]. The Inath Federation is under attack by zombie hordes, so the queen uses a powerful ritual to summon a hero to lead the quest for a fabled sword that will save the Federation from the hordes. The ritual works and the hero begins his quest, but our protagonist is a materials engineer the ritual dragged along for the ride and dropped at the edge of civilization.

To diverge from things from the wiki, I can recommend two stories with a remarkably similar premise given that neither was made knowing about the other. [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][I'm a Spider, So What?]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/comments/5xh4o7/chapter_0/][The Snake Report]] are both stories about a human dying and reincarnating into a fantasy world as a weak monster and having to draw on every resource they can just to stay alive. I could go at length about in what ways they're similar and different, but suffice it to say that they're both very fun and you should definitely give them a look.

Happy reading!
