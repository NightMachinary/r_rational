You do you, but there's around 100 chapters not yet translated in the better version, and blastron has only promised once every two weeks (but probably more often), so you might be waiting awhile. I /loved/ it, and am mostly waiting because I don't feel like putting in the effort to (re)read the new parts. I had read quite a bit into it, but I can't particularly remember too much beyond blastron's translation, because the other translation is so confusing.

I would actually recommend reading it, because it's quite good, and that may be enough to have you continue into the bad translation. If not, I'd highly recommend the manga version, which is rapidly approaching blastron's point. That said, the manga doesn't have any of the interlude parts yet either. It's great, though, and I have been keeping up with that.
