Hang on, I'm confused. I have read all of Blastron's translations, loved it, want more.

Are you saying that there is 100 chapters "better version" translations available somewhere? Or that the original japanese story is 100 chapters ahead of the (current) end of Blastron's translation?

Also, I don't read Japanese, so I am restricted to english. Has the manga been translated?
