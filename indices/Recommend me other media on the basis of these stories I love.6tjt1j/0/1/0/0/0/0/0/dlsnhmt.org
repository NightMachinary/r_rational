Blastron's is the better version, but there is 100 or so more chapters of [[https://turb0translation.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html][lesser quality translation]]. It's actually split into [[http://raisingthedead.ninja/current-j-z/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/][two parts]].

The manga is full and actively updating (I think). [[http://mangakakalot.com/manga/kumo_desu_ga_nani_ka][Here]]'s a link I found.
