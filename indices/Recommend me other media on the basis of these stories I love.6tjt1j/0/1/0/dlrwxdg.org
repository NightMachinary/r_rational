It's an online Japanese light novel, actively updating. This guy has the best translation, but he took a hiatus and I think he's actually starting again. There's a huge gap between where he is and where the story actually is.

I don't have the link, but you can probably Google to find the crappier more up to date translation. That's mostly why I haven't really followed the story further, because the other guy's translations made things confusing.

Btw, the interlude type parts happen a long time (a decade I think) after the main story. You might want to read one, then the other. Interludes usually break my flow in reading the story if they're more than a chapter in length.
