I assume you've read the [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/story.shtml][sequel to Luminosity]], the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3f9gly/list_of_stories_similar_to_hpmor/][various HPMOR recursive fics]] (scroll down), as well as [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]?

Since you've mentioned one MLP fic, I'd recommend anything by [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/173607/Forthwith][Forthwith]], especially his (sadly abandoned) [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power][Seeking Power]].

You might like Eric Flint's first novel [[http://baencd.freedoors.org/Books/Mother%20of%20Demons/index.htm][Mother of Demons]]. Its plot definitely shows that it's his first, but the setting, crisis of survival, and kingdom-uplifting problem are still very compelling at least to me.

Also, David Brin has a number of good books that partake of rationalist themes. I'd especially recommend /Glory Season/ and /Kiln People/, as well as his excellent and chilling short story "[[https://web.archive.org/web/20120712170314/http://www.davidbrin.com/thor1.htm][Thor Meets Captain America]]."
