I would like to blatantly push my own book:

[[https://smile.amazon.com/Digital-Me-Alston-Sleet-ebook/dp/B06XR335RT][Digital Me]]

It's a story about a man who, through a bit of legal tom foolery and willingness to do something stupid to take a last chance to survive, ends up being uploaded into a digital world and becomes immortal....and then what happens to him dealing with his /training/ for becoming a so called 'all powerful' digital mind.

it's on kindle unlimited so if you have that it's a free read.
