I would argue that "I'm a Spider, So What?" is over. I'm on like chapter 300 and the original premise has been completely abandoned at this point. We are following completely different characters, the original spider character is gone, the world and its RPG rules basically doesn't have any effect on the plot anymore, and the story is more about metaphysical god-stuff now.
