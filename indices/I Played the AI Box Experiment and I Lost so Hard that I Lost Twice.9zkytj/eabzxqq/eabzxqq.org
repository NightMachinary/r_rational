It appears to not be known: there /is/ an instance of the AI winning the experiment and releasing logs. Here is the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fbekxBfgvfc7pmnzB/how-to-win-the-ai-box-experiment-sometimes][relevant blog post]] by =pinkgothic= and here are the logs: [[http://leviathan.thorngale.net/aibox/logs-01-preliminaries.txt][roleplay scenario setup]], [[http://leviathan.thorngale.net/aibox/logs-02-session-ic.txt][in-character AI and gatekeeper exchange]], [[https://leviathan.thorngale.net/aibox/logs-02-session-ooc.txt][a few out-of-character exchanges]]. Note that 7 lines (out of 242) of the in-character logs are reconstructed from the players' memory, because of computer problems.
