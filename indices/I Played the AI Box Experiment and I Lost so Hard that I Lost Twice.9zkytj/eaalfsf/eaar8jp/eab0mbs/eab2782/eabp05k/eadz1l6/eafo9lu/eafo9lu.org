I think that's basically Pascal's mugging.

I mean, don't get me wrong, there probably are scary avenues of attack open to an infinitely smart AI. I'd expect stuff like row hammering, except on a subatomic levels or even in ways we had never considered before. Or maybe the AI figures out how to make a nuke with nothing but electronic circuits. Those are threats you'd need to guard against when giving large amounts of computing power, memory and lifetime to an AI.

On the other hand, "the AI mind-controls you by talking to you" seems impossible to me. All signs point to us living in a reductionist world.
