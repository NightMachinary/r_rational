I have no clue who they are. All I know is that they conducted an opaque social/psychological experiment, declined publishing the results and then made assertions based on those secret results. I get keeping experimental procedures secret in order to not influence current or potential future subjects, but at some point the experiment has successfully ran its course.

If they were making random claims about random things I have no opinion about I would probably have an easier time believing them, but an assertion that is deeply counterintuitive to me requires more than "believe me because this bunch of people you don't know independently agree with me but no one else is allowed to see what they saw". If that were enough I could just as well join a religion.
