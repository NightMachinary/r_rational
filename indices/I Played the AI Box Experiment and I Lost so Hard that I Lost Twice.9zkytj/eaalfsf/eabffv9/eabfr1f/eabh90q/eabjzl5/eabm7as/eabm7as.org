I haven't actually looked into the LessWrong community beyond some of the articles. And I don't know who in there is how trustworthy. All I know is that, based on the comments below the article you linked, even on there there are plenty of sceptical people. Trusting a secret result to an experiment I am not allowed to witness and that is not independently repeatable is a bit hard.
