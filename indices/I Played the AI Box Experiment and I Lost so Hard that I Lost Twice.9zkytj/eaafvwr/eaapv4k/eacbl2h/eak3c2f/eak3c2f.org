I think he is saying that by thinking “as an ai” he has realized an argument that would convince him personally.

If you take it as given that an ai could perfectly model him, it could come up with this argument and get released, but this particular argument wouldn't work on others and might be embarrassing for him personally as well as being meaningless since it wouldn't work on you or me.

If he is actually right, then other people might have similar, personalized arguments that could convince them that their opponent in this game are highly unlikely to discover (but that a super ai might), though going through the thought exercise on the ai side might allow someone to realize their own personal argument (if any exists)

Op if I'm right I suggest you clarify, you do come off as somewhat pretentious in your wording.
