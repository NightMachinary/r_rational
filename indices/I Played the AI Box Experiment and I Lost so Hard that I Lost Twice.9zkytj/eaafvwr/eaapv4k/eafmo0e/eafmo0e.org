  Just a passing comment, I believe that this is a real-life example of what Eliezer alludes to as dangerous knowledge similar to in HPMOR where wizards have a tradition of putting dangerous knowledge behind seals. Any aspiring wizards who wish to learn about the knowledge, they have to undergo difficult tests and tasks to learn about the knowledge.

I have yet to see evidence that dangerous knowledge exists in the way EY describes it. All I see is fictional evidence.

Also, to quote alexanderwales' WtC:

  “‘Infohazard protocols', that's a fancy way of saying that she doesn't want to have to tell anyone. Which is exactly what makes people stop taking infohazard protocols seriously, if you ask me.”
