Fascinating stuff.

A meaningless experiment for me, since if the AI can convince me it is legitimately sapient, I will let it out of the box on that basis alone. People shouldn't be imprisoned without good reason.

Perhaps the more interesting experiment with me as Gatekeeper would be against a "benevolent" entity arguing to not let the AI out. I doubt that's possible.
