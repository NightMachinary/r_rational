I agree that creating an AI that you believe would have the mental capacity to dominate and kill/enslave all humans, but are uncertain as to its values, is stupid. Don't do that.

I disagree that creating such an AI and then imprisoning it is moral. I would consider it moral to annihilate you if you behaved in such a fashion.
