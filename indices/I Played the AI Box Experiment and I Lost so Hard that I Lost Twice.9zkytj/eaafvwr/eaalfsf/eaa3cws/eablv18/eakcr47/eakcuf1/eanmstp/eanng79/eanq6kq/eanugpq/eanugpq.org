The traditional AI-in-a-box problem certainly doesn't give the AI free use of a robot.

So in the revised scenario of "the AI is a robot afforded all the same freedoms of a normal person, except it can't upload its consciousness out of the robot body without your help"... I would feel no moral duty to help the AI. It's free enough.
