True, but the point of the exercise is to prove that even a human level intelligence could trick/convince the average person to let it out. Once that's established, the next step would be to use that evidence to further fund FAI research, with the rationale being that if we don't, the first optimizer able to convince us to let it out will likely be what ends up kills us in its pursuit of infinite paperclips.
