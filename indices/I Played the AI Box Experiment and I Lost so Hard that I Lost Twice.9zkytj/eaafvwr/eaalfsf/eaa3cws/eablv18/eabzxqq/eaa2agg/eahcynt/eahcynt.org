I think, while this experiment is interesting, it is ultimately irrelevant. I find it far too easy to imagine a scenario where some researchers make an AI, carefully keep it in a box, then (after years go by and people gradually make smarter and smarter algorithms for things) publish their research, and some teenager with too much free time decides to try it out and write an AI without even bothering to disconnect their computer from the internet in the first place.
