Even though I think I would have succeeded at gatekeeping that scenario, I find that one far more convincing than the ones where the logs weren't released. Much more helpful, too, because it gives me a better idea of what sort of person is good at keeping an AI contained (namely, one who doesn't think of AIs as having the same ethical importance as humans). Besides, it doesn't matter how terrible /you/ think it was. What matters is that someone out there was persuaded even though they thought they wouldn't be.
