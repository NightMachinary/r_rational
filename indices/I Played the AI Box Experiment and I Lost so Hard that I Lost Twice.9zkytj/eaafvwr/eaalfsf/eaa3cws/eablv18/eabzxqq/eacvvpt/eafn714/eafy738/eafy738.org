  the first thing you should be asking yourself when you go into AI research?
#+end_quote

Maybe not the first, but it's definitely one to ask yourself at some point.

Yes, the gatekeeper could have trivially won, but they didn't in fact win. One would hope that an AI project would appoint someone competent as a gatekeeper, but who knows. Also even competent people might lose with some small probability, which could still make it dangerous.

Though this particular scenario rests on a lot of assumptions, so maybe its importance is also overstated...
