  Or maybe they were just as convincing and the people they talked to were just easier to influence.

I think it's fairly obvious that the people involved were not, judging from what they wrote, plus the fairly large monetary sums involved in some of the games.

  The fact that they're not releasing their logs kind of puts an upper bound on how impressive these arguments could have been.

I don't see the argument by which you have acquired this claim.

My interpretation, which I think is fairly well supported by his comments, is that Eliezer's main motivation was to refute the argument "I don't know how X could happen, therefore it can't". Him keeping the method secret allows his successes to act as counterexamples to such a belief; the hope being that this stops people making the argument.

I believe (less strongly) that Tuxedage holds a similar opinion, if not as a primary motivation, and one of his opponents who won as a gatekeeper mentions this explicitly:

  When I first challenged Tuxedage to play the experiment, I believed that there was no way I could have lost, since I was unable to imagine any argument that could have persuaded me to do so. It turns out that that's a very bad way of estimating probability -- since not being able to think of an argument that could persuade me is a terrible method of estimating how likely I am to be persuaded.
