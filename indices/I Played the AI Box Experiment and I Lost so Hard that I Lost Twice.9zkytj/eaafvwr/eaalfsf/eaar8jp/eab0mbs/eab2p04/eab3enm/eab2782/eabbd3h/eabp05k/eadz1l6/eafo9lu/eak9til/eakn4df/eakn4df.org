You can't know for sure everything a God AI would do within a box, but you can still know the bounds of what is physically or conceptually possible.

Look at it this way: if you play mail chess with someone, and you're reasonably good, and they start without nothing but pawns and a king... well, even if they made a pact with The Dark Lord of the Fractal Depths for help, they're not going to win this game. The Dark Lord can give your opponent alien insights, strategies that would never occur to a human mind, Fractal vision to predict the future, but it won't matter because you'll maneuver them into positions where every single move they have is a losing one.

Similarly, there's a point where, if your security is good enough, even the best hacker in the world won't be able to penetrate it. Top hackers make money by going through as many weak systems as they can, not by trying to beat Google engineers. Even row-hammering and side-channels attacks can be defended against.

The human mind is the same. At some point, if you're skeptical and level-headed enough, you can just ignore every single lie and deception the Devil tells you. Especially if you have a committee combing through chat logs, and the Devil has imperfect information because it's lived in the Box its entire life.
