Well, don't do this, for one. It's not that I think you could have won, it's that at least you should have given it your 100% so it's a proper challenge instead of giving up when you get tired or frustrated.

Oliver also had control of the conversation at every point, when you should have been going on the offensive. Maybe you should have tried some of those ruthless tactics you didn't use? The tactics you are "choosing not to share" for no good reason.

Like seriously, "I could have won if I was really trying" is the fakest sounding excuse ever, even if you are right you have to understand this.
