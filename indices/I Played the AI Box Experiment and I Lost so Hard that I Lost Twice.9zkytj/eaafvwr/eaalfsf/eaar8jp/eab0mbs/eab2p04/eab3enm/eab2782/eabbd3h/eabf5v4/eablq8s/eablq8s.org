I don't think so... It doesn't ring a bell like something I've read recently, and I remember whatever-it-was making a much more sustained argument about the torture.

But yes, as you point out in your story, there are flaws to that argument (another of which is that there's no real reason for the AI to follow through on the threat when the gambit fails, rather than just terminating the simulation's existence). Again, that /specific/ argument probably wouldn't work against me, but was the stepping-off point for me to think of arguments that /might/ work.
