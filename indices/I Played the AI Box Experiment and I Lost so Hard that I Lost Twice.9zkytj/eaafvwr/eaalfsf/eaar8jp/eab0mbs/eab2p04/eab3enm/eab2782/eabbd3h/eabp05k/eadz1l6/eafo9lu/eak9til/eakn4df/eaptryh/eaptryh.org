  Similarly, there's a point where, if your security is good enough, even the best hacker in the world won't be able to penetrate it. Top hackers make money by going through as many weak systems as they can, not by trying to beat Google engineers. Even row-hammering and side-channels attacks can be defended against.

I think it's obvious a superintelligent hacker would trivially beat Google engineers. The history of computing, with heartbleed, spectre, etc., shows that computers are only secure because hackers (black hat and white hat alike) are rate-limited; there are always a huge number of latent bugs in the system, and the attack surface area is only so small because patching bugs is easier than finding them. Fuzzers routinely find huge numbers of bugs just lying around, and those are relatively primitive tools.

  At some point, if you're skeptical and level-headed enough, you can just ignore every single lie and deception the Devil tells you.

The AI is allowed to make true claims too.
