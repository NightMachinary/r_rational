I don't really want to get into the weeds with someone who doesn't Bayes, but it's worth noting that

1. The arbiter of the second game against Tuxedage (the first that Tuxedage won) was the guy who won against him as gatekeeper the first round. Why would he lie?

2. The top post in that first winning page, the guy who calls it "weak sauce" and says "I'm pretty sure I'll win, and I would like to not waste a lot of time on this" later /won/ against Tuxedage as the gatekeeper, but said in his testimony that "I'm also convinced that Tuxedage's victory in the last game was due to skill, rather than luck." Again, further, he showed that /he understood the point of the whole exercise/:

  When I first challenged Tuxedage to play the experiment, I believed that there was no way I could have lost, since I was unable to imagine any argument that could have persuaded me to do so. It turns out that that's a very bad way of estimating probability -- since not being able to think of an argument that could persuade me is a terrible method of estimating how likely I am to be persuaded.

My argument isn't "if you have a strong argument that the AI cannot win, change your mind because of these results." It's "you *don't* have a strong argument that the AI cannot win, /so you should update your beliefs/."
