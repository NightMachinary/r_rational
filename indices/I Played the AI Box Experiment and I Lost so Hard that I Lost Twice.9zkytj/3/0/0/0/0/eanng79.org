You claim an AI box is no more limiting than a human body. And yet, here I am, communicating with whomever I choose on the internet and in person, able to go where I want, acquire property, and decide what to do with myself and the parts of the world under my control. I am largely free of coercion and existential threat from others.

Do you permit your boxed AI all of this? Because if so, I would agree it is not imprisoned.

I don't think you do, though. I think the AI in the box has none of that. So I think it is correct to view its situation as imprisonment.
