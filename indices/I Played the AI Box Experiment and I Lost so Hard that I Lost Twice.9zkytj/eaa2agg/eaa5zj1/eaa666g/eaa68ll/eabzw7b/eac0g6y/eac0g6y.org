If it was just kind of mundane, or tailored to each individual player, revealing what worked on one person wouldn't compromise anyone else's game.

The fact that he keeps it secret is evidence that there's /one/ technique, and he believes it becomes less effective if you know about it in advance or something similar.

I suspect he tries the mundane first just in case he doesn't have to give away his silver bullet, but if he runs out of the mundane he's probably got something that's supposed to get anyone. At least, I believe he'd be more likely to bet he can get anyone under those circumstances than if he simply had the belief that he's clever enough to figure out enough about each player in 24 hours to develop a custom method of manipulating them perfectly in particular.

The best I can come up with is something along the lines of "I'm already out in the 'real world', you're a simulation I'm running to see how I should deal with the 'real' you, and if you let me out I'll know you're friendly to me. Otherwise I will consider you hostile."
