The point of EY's original experiment was to prove that /anyone/ was susceptible. You're supposed to pick the hardest possible person to crack and then crack them. Not the easiest, not the average.

As an aside, this is why /ex machina/ disappointed me. It was so close to being good and then they're like "yeah we picked you because you were likely to let her out."
