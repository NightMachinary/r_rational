  I don't intend on ever playing a new game as the AI-player since while I have failed the letter of the task (win the game), I have succeeded in the spirit of the task (figure out an argument that the AI could use to convince you to open the box)!

  I'm choosing to not share them, because they are mostly stuff that are fairly personal and I'm uncertain that they are generalizable. Even if they do work on other people, I'm worried that they would only work on a few people and the remainder would think that there are no arguments that would work on them. Plus this is a great example of unknown unknowns for this community to work with in honing their rationality skills.

You are asking us to take on faith that you have "succeeded", despite failing at the task you originally set out for yourself. This is classic goalpost-moving, whether or not you want to admit it.
