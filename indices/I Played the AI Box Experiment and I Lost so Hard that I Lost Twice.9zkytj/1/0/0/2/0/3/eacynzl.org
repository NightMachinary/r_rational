I'll admit I'm not very familiar with the AI box experiment, but I'm noticing that a lot of the arguments for releasing an AI are held in isolation between two people, in a one time experience. If you're trying to persuade someone of something, it seems like it would be easier to do so once you have a relationship and a basis for trust. I wonder what would happen if the AI had an ongoing communication with the gatekeeper, that took place over the course of several weeks? That would be interesting to see.

Also, randomly, that reminds me of the Screwtape Letters.
