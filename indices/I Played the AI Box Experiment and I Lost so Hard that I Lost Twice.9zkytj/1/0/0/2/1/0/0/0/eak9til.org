Why does it sound so imposible to you and what does that have to do whith us living on a reductionistic world ?.

I mean humans are part of the universe like everything else and figuring out how to hack the computer it's in or how to make nukes doesn't seem different to figuring out how to "hack "a human.

Maybe it's posible to convince the gatekeeper maybe it isn't but that seems to depends on the details on how human minds work and it's not obiusly more difficult than other seemingly impossible tasks you would worry about the AI doing .

Maybe you can't imagine how the AI would convince someone, but you can't imagine how the AI would build a nuke whith electronic circuits either and you are still properly paranoid about it.

Books and other people can certainly convince people to do stuff so it doesn't seem obiously imposible.
