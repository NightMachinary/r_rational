YES. YES. This is what a rational story IRL is supposed to be. OMG THERE IS 4 CHAPTERS IN TOTAL!?!?!?!?

OP please post next chapter and index link on page. If I didn't press home I would not have seen the rest of story. EDIT: He already did I just didn't scroll down far enough. Will ad more reviewing later.

EDIT: More reviewing time is now:

This story has a good plot hook and an interesting premise. I am enjoying MC and his inner planing mechanism, not too strong or too weak, with good amount of premade plans. I cant say anything about story formation, writing tenses and grammar, since my brain auto skips on such unnecessary details.
