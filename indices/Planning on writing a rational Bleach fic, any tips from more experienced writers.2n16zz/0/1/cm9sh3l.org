As for writing rational in general (since that appears to be what you want):

- Have your characters think at least one level deep. Have your enemies think about what your heroes will do, and your heroes think about what your enemies will do. If anyone is surprised by anyone else doing the /obvious/ thing, you're in trouble.
- Sometimes the obvious solution is the correct one. In fact, most of the time the obvious solution is the correct one. Don't have people get fancy for no reason.
- Do your research. This is actually just good writing advice, but doubly important when you want characters who know what the hell they're talking about.
- Borrow the cognitive labor of others. There are a whole lot of difficult problems with brilliant solutions out there, and if you use one of them you can save yourself a lot of time and effort. A problem difficult enough to stump a few hundred scientists/engineers is probably better than what you could come up with on your own.
- Make sure that you understand things before you try to explain them. I'm never going to have a story with quantum mechanics in it, because I don't understand it well enough.
- If you're writing fan fiction, be really familiar with the source material. If there's a wiki, refer to it often. This is a subset of doing the research, but I'm listing it here because it's really, really important.
