Some quick tips off of the top of my head:

Kill some characters. People can't constantly have their organs pulled out through their throats only to make a miraculous recovery and rejoin the team like nothing happened. If this is a real world with real superpowered individuals, there are going to be casualties.

The "mechanics" of the bleach power system always seemed really arbitrary to me. Basically, anyone can have any power the writers can think of? That opens up such a ridiculously broad spectrum of abilities, with huge potential for overpowered / munchkin-ed individuals. There needs to be some kind of limiting factor, some consistent logic for how these powers are distributed, otherwise you just have semi-strong individuals trying to go toe to toe with people who are basically gods.

Adaptability. Bleach generally handles the power imbalance problem by having the underdog suddenly find a new hidden strength and becoming twice as powerful as before. Bullshit. It's lazy writing at it's worst, and you've got to work around it. This ties back into the internal logic problem. Sure, maybe there can be ways of increasing your abilities, but they can't just conveniently happen every time you're about to lose. It needs to be more complicated than that, a puzzle that has to be solved.

Maybe the strength of an individual's abilities is inversely proportional to the amount of time they can sustain those abilities in a fight. The strongest fighters would only be able to use their powers for brief periods of time, which maybe wouldn't be such a handicap if they were capable of ending any fight right away, but it would be something that a clever opponent could take advantage of, forcing them to use their powers unnecessarily and then retaliating when they were defenseless.

There's a lot more to look at, but that's all I can think of for the time being. Bleach is definitely not the most rational show out there, but that means there's lots of room for improvement!
