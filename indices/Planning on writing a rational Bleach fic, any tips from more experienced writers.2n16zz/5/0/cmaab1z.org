Well, that's the thing with Bleach. They really aren't. They're invisible dead soul fighting other dead souls, sometimes in one of several parallel worlds with some really goofy rules of their own.

Gritty is fine, but if too much changes it is no longer Bleach. Rather than just make it hardcore and oh so real by killing people to raise the stakes, which is a bad and overused trope, a fanfic writer should come up with consistent measures of power and injury in spiritual combat. If the bodies hit the floor because of that, so be it.

Just don't start a new fanfic by fridging a beloved character for no other reason.

  Bleach generally handles the power imbalance problem by having the underdog suddenly find a new hidden strength and becoming twice as powerful as before.

That's action manga/anime for you. But again, if you remove that, it isn't really the same story. Several plot points actually use this un-lampshaded, throwing someone into combat until they "level up" this way.

I think a writer attempting a revised, fanfic version of Bleech needs to figure out what a rational person would do in response to this situation. I wonder what the Bleach-verse spiritual version of playing in traffic is...
