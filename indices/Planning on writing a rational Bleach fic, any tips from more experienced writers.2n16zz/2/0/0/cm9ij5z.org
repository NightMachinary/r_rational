[[/u/alexanderwales]] and [[/u/ianstlawrence]] have everything covered, I think. The only thing I would add is this: always ask why your characters are doing what they're doing. Then ask why those reasons exist. Then just keep asking why. If you ever get to a point that you're answering that with "Because the plot needs it," then something's gone horribly wrong.
