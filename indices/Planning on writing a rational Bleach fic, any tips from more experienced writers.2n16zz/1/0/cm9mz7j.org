  I think one of the points of Rational Fics isn't just to write a smart story, but to write a story in which the protagonist explains and illuminates his or her thinking so that people can learn from it. Which means that a lot of your story should revolve around creating interesting problems and then interesting solutions that the reader could, if thinking logically and not making assumptions, solve on their own without the main character.

This is a little extreme for my taste.

Perhaps don't focus on the problems to be overcome by the rational protagonist. This often results in really easy and obvious to the reader solutions being the topic of discussion for four chapters to more clearly illustrate the problem and how rational everything is. Sort of boring. It doesn't happen every time, but it is a trope of the rational fanfic genre.

Instead, maybe make it a hero's journey of rationality. Show someone rejecting rationality, them accepting it, then learning about it, then using rationality to solve their problems in the climax of the story. Show them learning through trial and error or others' clues and examples how to be more rational in a dangerous situation.

  Remember the greatest strength your character has in their thinking and ability to reason. The moment that they NEED the big power up that destroys mountains, you might want to revise and think about how they could solve the problem with the very basics.

I'm also not sure I entirely agree with this, as it has a dangerous failure state as well. Often, a protagonist's greatest strength is logically their /great strength/, yet they aren't allowed to use it because it isn't that sort of story. Let them swing that sword around sometimes.

It is another negative trope of rational fiction that the protagonist can be dropped naked into the Amazon rainforest and come out a week later with a jaguar-skin coat and a tribe of quirky primitives following their irresistible logic as they proceed to conquer all of Brazil. It is really easy to overdo speed-chess rationality when an author controls and can see all the cards.

Especially in a magical story world, sometimes a given situation is a Gordian Knot. It can be refreshing to have some problems solved in an action manga through the direct and sudden application of overwhelming violence.

Without that, it isn't really Bleach.

Some of those canon powerups in Bleach are very, very sudden. If that is foreshadowed and explained, I see absolutely nothing wrong with it as a dramatic moment or an approach to solving a problem.

In a world where being strong in literal spiritual combat relies /greatly/ on /believing/ you are strong, maybe bull-headed approaches have merit -- bracketed by periods of stress and what-the-fuck-was-I-doing rational analysis, of course. It just seems to me that none of the calm, cold, reasonable rational tropes work when your attitude affects your ability to fight off invisible monsters the size of buildings.

Hell, I'd read a Bleach story predicated entirely around someone rational trying to figure out ways to psych themselves up for fights they logically /know/ they should lose. Something like a cross between MoR, Bleach, and the movie Crank. I'd read the fuck out of that.

In any case, in the Bleach world, planning to gain and defend against sudden power-ups /is/ rational. Sometimes, swallowing an energy field larger than your head really is the only way to proceed.

--------------

Ultimately, I just suggest that a writer avoid monologues on rationality wherever possible. Those are never, ever good writing.

The structure of the story might also not fit perfectly showing the reader problems -- mysteries have a very specific format after all. Sherlock Holmes stories don't fit this, because that isn't the kind of stories they are. Holmes has knowledge you simply don't possess as the reader. Yet those stories are still beloved by readers to this day. Just, perhaps, not by hardcore mystery genre fans. They are really a sort of period thriller, after all. Maybe your story just isn't a mystery story, so don't force it into those constraints.

But regardless of the format of the story, if you slowly show the reader what it means to be rational instead of dumping a Rational Ãœbermensch on them to quote scripture, I think the narrative will automatically be stronger.

--------------

What's often struck me, reading about and talking with people in high-failure-cost, high-impact jobs, like construction, large-scale manufacturing, and the military, is that the successful people who've been through a lot of hands-on problem solving have a very good grasp on how to solve problems rationally in their domain.

As noted above, very old people will be scary good at whatever they do. Which is why you need a protagonist who has someone with /literally/ more real-world experience and intelligence helping out. Kisuke Urahara, even if not played as very rational, may be your Gandalf for a rational Bleach story.

Maybe extend that idea of domain competence to a more general context in a magical world like Bleach's. Instead of learning how to survive a swordfight, show how trying to deal with a world that has lots of high-powered mystical combat and swordfights leads to rational solutions beyond "hit monster with sword, repeat until dead" and "train really hard, hit monster harder next time."
