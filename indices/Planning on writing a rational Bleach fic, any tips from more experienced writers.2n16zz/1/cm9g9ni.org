I think one of the points of Rational Fics isn't just to write a smart story, but to write a story in which the protagonist explains and illuminates his or her thinking so that people can learn from it. Which means that a lot of your story should revolve around creating interesting problems and then interesting solutions that the reader could, if thinking logically and not making assumptions, solve on their own without the main character.

This means that you want to give your readers a very thorough explanation of the limits and powers of people. And when you introduce new abilities or powers they shouldn't be used to solve a problem that was introduced earlier, instead it might be a reward for figuring out a problem.

I like to think about it kinda like a tutorial in a game. In the beginning you get access to a few simple abilities, and then you have to solve a problem with those abilities. The game (or story) fails if the problems you are solving require additional abilities that the game/story didn't provide previously.

It also fails if later problems can be solved easily through older abilities rather than requiring the new abilities granted, unless that was the whole point.

Remember the greatest strength your character has in their thinking and ability to reason. The moment that they NEED the big power up that destroys mountains, you might want to revise and think about how they could solve the problem with the very basics.

Super Saiyan IV should not exist in your universe.

Here's another thing: if you have characters, and Bleach has this in fucking spades, who are thousands or even hundreds of years old, they are going to fucking rock at their jobs, probably. Even if they aren't rational!characters, they have had a lot of time to get really good at whatever their jobs entail. Now, if you want some of them to lack motivation, so they suck, or to have a really flawed perspective, so they suck, you can do that, but you also need to convince me that the reason they have these flaws make sense.

Byakuya can't be really fucking bad at protecting his little sister and not going through loop holes and just fucking everything the fuck up just because he is honorable. You can't just say that. You have to prove it to me, you have to show that honor > sister. And it has to be somewhat believable. It can be flawed, but the only way that a Rational!Fic works is if the world is consistent, because inconsistent worlds slay rational characters. You can't logically think through problems if the way the world and people in that world work is based off of plot armor or feeling strongly enough just makes you strong to the 10^{10000000.}

Bleach is not the easiest place to start for a rational fic, but if you pull it off it will be awesome. Awesome as fuck.

GOOD LUCK
