In terms of just general writing, or ... ?

- Show, don't tell. Telling us that someone is evil has maybe a quarter of the impact of showing them do some evil thing. The same goes for most character attributes.
- Plan things out ahead of time. If possible, each chapter should be like a little story nested within the larger story.
- Get a beta reader. Tell them to let you know where they're bored or confused, since those are the two easiest traps to fall into.
- Revise early and often. Sometimes, even with planning, it's possible to miss some obvious better alternatives for your story. Revision also gets rid of typos, which no one likes to see. The best things I've ever written were rewrites of far inferior first drafts.
- Make a schedule and stick to it. The most likely outcome of any writing project is abandonment, which is less likely if you have a progress timeline and benchmarks to hit.
- Assume that no one wants to read what you've written. Even if they say they do, they don't. If they're reading your story by some miracle, assume that they're going to stop at any moment - they'll shut the book or close the tab and go do something else. It's your job to hook them in and keep them reading despite these facts.
