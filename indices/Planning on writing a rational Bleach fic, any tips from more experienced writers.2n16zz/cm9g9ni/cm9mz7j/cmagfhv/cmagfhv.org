Haha, it was really interesting to read what you said about my advice, because it feels like you were going: "Oh no, not this again." Which is why I gave my advice because too many stories end up not keeping some of this in mind and then I end up saying, "Oh no, not this again."

I think you added some really good balance to what I was saying, but I think overall I prefer people to lean more into my "camp" than your "camp".

I'm not sure I've ever encountered a story that really listed things out and then rationally went through the logic and the end result was boring, unless maybe it was because it was just too, too obvious? I'm not really sure what that story looks like.

Also, I feel like in regards to the power up thing, that a lot of "rationalist" fics end up having their character do something like "train in a believable way, making full use of a skil", and then, suddenly, they are unstoppable because you kinda gave Frodo the Force with no Death Star to balance it out. I feel like this happens a lot in Naruto Fan fictions.

I totally agree with what you said about rational monologues. I think I assumed a certain degree of basic writing teachings like "show don't tell", keep some suspense if possible, and make sure your story is interesting and engaging, not just a lecture.

That said, I do stand by my idea that what separates a rational fic from a smart fic is that a rational fic tries to spread, at least to some degree, rationality and the myriad nuances that comes with that point of view. No one here wants to fall into the StrawVulcan fallacy (if you don't know what that is, here is a great video about rationalism in popular media: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLgNZ9aTEwc]] )

Anyway, great to see a bunch of people sharing their opinions and experiences.
