Find all of the plot holes in Bleach. Every point where something obvious was skirted to make room for a good story. Then ask what a /real/ person would have done, and make them do that instead. Explain everything thoroughly, so when characters [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandersonsFirstLaw][use their powers to solve problems]], the reader could have hypothetically come up with the same solution themselves beforehand.

That's about it, I think. Good luck!
