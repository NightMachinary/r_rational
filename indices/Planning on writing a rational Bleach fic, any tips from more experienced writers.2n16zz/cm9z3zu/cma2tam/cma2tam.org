The characters don't need to know this logic, though. The readers might need to know, especially if there is a great power disparity somewhere.

Hunter x Hunter is an interesting example of a limiting factor. It relies on a human sense of fairness -- people decide what powers they want, then decide on some set of restrictions on those powers that is supposed to make it fair. But this is open to munchkining; I could create extremely strong powers with limitations on when I can use them, but make enough of them so that I can always use at least one. This means the real limitation is in determining which ones you can use. ("Is Venus in retrograde?
