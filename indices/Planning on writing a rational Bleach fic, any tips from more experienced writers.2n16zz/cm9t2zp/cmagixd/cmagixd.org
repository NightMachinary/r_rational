I think something that also really helps is to remove the idea that characters are stupid, and instead, make them flawed. What I mean by that is, say, like in Bleach, you have Orihime, who, it turns out, has one of the most broken powers (arguably) in the series. It might be easy to then say Orihime is stupid for not properly using it, but if you view her as flawed, you might come up with interesting reasons for why she doesn't use her powers in such a way, or misses their value.

You could give us a little more backstory on Orihime, maybe explore her relationship with her brother. Maybe her brother, despite his good intentions, inadvertently ended up making her feel like she didn't have much value, because he did everything for her. He wanted her to have a proper childhood and to feel taken care of, but he ended up overextending, doing everything for her, everything, and in the process making her feel like she could never do anything on her own. So then, when confronted with powers, she automatically assumes they aren't such a big deal, and this makes sense considering that Ichigo has stepped up to fill the role left behind by her brother.

So now you have an interesting backstory, rather than the flippant and not very engaging throwaway of: Orihime is stupid, that's why she doesn't use her powers well.
