Well first of all, I'm rooting for you on this. I would love to see this come to fruition. I've actually thought a bit about a Bleach story like this myself. And boy do you have your work cut out for you, I can hardly think of a more nonsensical universe that still tries to take itself seriously.

Second, I agree emphatically with what TimeLoopedWarper said: "a writer avoid monologues on rationality wherever possible. Those are never, ever good writing."

Yudkowsky put them to good use in his attempts to teach rationality, but from a literary perspective they are jarring. Just have your character act intelligently from the start, and if any of their actions aren't self-evidently intelligent, then you can maybe give a brief explanation.

By that same token, I think one of the pitfalls that is good to avoid while writing rational fic is the temptation to be disrespectful to the source material. Which isn't to say that you have to keep the questionable canon elements; far from it. What I'm saying is that you should think deeply on a matter before going "you're stupid! Everyone's stupid!"

If you see something that doesn't make sense, fix it. If a character is stupid in canon, then make them more intelligent. Or barring that, broach the matter gently. Don't just call a character a raging idiot, just have the protagonist question why the other character made the choice they did, or perhaps present a better alternative while still being respectful to that character.
