It's the sort of question I love to consider. :)

Bunny has an entirely different set of hormones running through her veins than I do, which have led her to behave differently than I in my own body would in her place. She also has very strong evidence about the nature a Singularity-like event will take, which changes her calculations on which actions should be taken. That said, in Books later than the ones you've read, Bunny makes various mistakes, and goes for counselling and psychotherapy more than once.

I'm doing my best to set her actions to be those I really would take, had my mind gone through similar experiences... but it's very likely that I'm at least slightly over-estimating at least a few of her positive attributes.

And either way, I look forward to your enjoyment of the rest of the story. :)
