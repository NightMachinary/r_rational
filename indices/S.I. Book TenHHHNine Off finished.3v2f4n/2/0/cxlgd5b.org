This is may be a slightly difficult question for you to answer, but does Bunny act the way you would act? Or is she a slightly idealized version of yourself where you are less lazy, a better leader, better to working towards set goals, less prone to mistakes, and other basic qualities to make Bunny do better than you'd actually do in your place?

I consider this a tricky question to ask because it involves knowing yourself fairly well and being able to admit that you aren't as 'good' (for a given subjective definition) as you'd hope/try to be before you can say yes or no.

Either way, I've stopped back in Book #5 (now #4) due to wanting to wait for you to build a buffer, and I have 5 books to read!
