After some thought, I decided that any good hacker would start counting at 0 instead of 1, and so S.I. has gone through a Great Renumbering.

I've started using live-chat with some helpful folk, and have gotten comfortable enough with them, and with a few other changes to my process, that on the days I have time to write, I can hit more than 3,000 words a day. (Though I'm still averaging rather less.)

I'm told that the first half or so of this Book is kind of slow, but that the second half is distinctly improved.

Coming up soon: Action! Mayhem! Kidnapping! Pirates! Monsters! Kissing! A Six-Fingered Man - no, wait, that's something else. But we do have Lagomorphs of Unusual Size... :)
