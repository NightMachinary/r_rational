Great book. The only thing I was able to find wrong with it was a part where he had to drop some voltage using resistors. While this works well for low wattage applications, he was trying to drop the voltage on something running multiple amps. That would have blown all but mulch-hundred watt resistors.

Other than that one goof that only an EE would notice, the book seemed to be very accurate to reality. Would highly recommend.
