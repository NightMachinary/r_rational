Ya. I don't remember the numbers used, but if you take the difference in voltage and multiply that by the amps drawn then you get the wattage that the resistor is dropping.

So if you start with 35 volts, drop it to 31 volts, and you are drawing 8 amps then you are having to drop 32 watts. You are dealing with specialized resistors at that point. Not the kind of thing that would be kept in a spare parts kit.
