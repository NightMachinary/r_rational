IIRC he used multiple resistors so the whole array is dissipating the waste wattage. Also 32 watt resistors, which is the max because again it was probably an array anyways so the required dissipation per resistor will fall quickly, aren't /that/ specialized. They're unusual to see because there's better ways of doing things in most situations but this is NASA so remember everything is usually derated to give larger safety margins and a spares kit would have some pretty unusual equipment.
