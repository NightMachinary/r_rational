Using non-lossy circuit elements, inductor and capacitors. For AC it's suer easy, you just wrap a piece of metal in loops of your input wire and your output wire. The ratio of the number of wraps is going to be the ratio of the voltages. For DC you use a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_converter][buck converter]] or something like it.

NOTE: I've never worked with high voltage situations so I might be missing stuff.
