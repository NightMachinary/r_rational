Planned for less than a year from now, so it's pretty late to kill it. Hopefully that's good.

Also, before Andy Weir was an author he was a webcomic artist, creator of [[http://www.galactanet.com/comic/view.php?strip=1][Casey and Andy]] and totally not [[http://www.homeonthestrange.com/view.php?ID=1][Home on the Strange]] the way I originally wrote, although that is a very good strip.

Damnit.
