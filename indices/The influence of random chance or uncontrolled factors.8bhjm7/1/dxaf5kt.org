Have you heard of quests? There are authors who literally roll die to determine the outcomes of actions chosen by the protagonist (by popular vote). E.g. if they roll 1 out of 100, the protagonist gets a crit fail, which is effectively an unforeseen random event that screws them over. You can find them on sites like sufficientvelocity or spacebattles. (They aren't exactly rationalist though, since the "rationality" of the protagonist is determined by the voters.)

On the plus side, it adds some level of realism to have the protagonist actually fail unpredictably, just like in real life. On the minus side, it's hard to construct elaborate plots when random die rolls can utterly derail it. E.g. maybe you want a plot where the protagonist's best friend turns out to be a spy for the enemy all along, then suddenly crit fail comes along and the best friend just dies. So now your convoluted schemes for how the best friend will betray the protagonist at the worst possible moment goes straight to the trash.
