There do exist (though I haven't delved in to deep), those... I believe they're known as questing websites? Essentially RP type fiction, and I've seen a little on there that's rational. These sorts of stories generally have some random element, being how poorly the MC does in actions and such. Not exactly what you're looking for, but it's a similar idea. Writing around chaos.

A true realist fiction could utilise a vast database of the odds of each of their characters, for example, dying in a car crash on any one day. Sounds like a terrible story, but it might be fun.
