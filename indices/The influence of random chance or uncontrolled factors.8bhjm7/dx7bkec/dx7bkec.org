I would say sometimes, though probably not quite as much as it would happen in real life. It's hard to make entertaining stories about masterminds and intricate plans if you have to be fully realistic about just /how many/ things can go wrong with such plans. I'm thinking of alexanderwales' "The Metropolitan Man", for example, and there's at least /one/ thing that goes wrong because of an unforeseen weather event - and that has vast repercussions on the plot. Of course "chance" events are a good way to slip in your own hand to direct the plot in one direction or another, but of course it shouldn't be anything too straightforward and unlikely (like "the hero wins this otherwise unwinnable battle because a meteor falls on the enemy's head") because that will break suspension of disbelief.
