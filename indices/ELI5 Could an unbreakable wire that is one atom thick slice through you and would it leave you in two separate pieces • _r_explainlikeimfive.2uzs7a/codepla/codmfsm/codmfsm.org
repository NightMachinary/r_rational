Wrong scale. You aren't splitting cells, you are splitting molecules. Blood doesn't shoot out the holes between epithelial cells, so why would blood pressure so anything to a significantly smaller gap? A human red cell is something like a five orders of magnitude bigger than an atom. A simple protein is dozens of atoms.

I'm not convinced it would anime cut you either though. You break some bonds briefly and ... then what? They don't return to the lowest energy state and rebond? Sure, they might not rejoin exactly right and some cells /might/ even die (not sure, cells are pretty robust to minor insults) but I really don't think a big separation is likely.
