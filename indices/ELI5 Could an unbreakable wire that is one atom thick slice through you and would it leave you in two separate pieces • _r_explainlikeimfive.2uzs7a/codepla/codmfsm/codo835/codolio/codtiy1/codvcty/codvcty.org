  Everything explodes if you hit it fast enough with a solid.

Unless you're taking "explosion" to mean /the result of fusion-reaction temperatures being achieved by the kinetic energy transfer/, no, it doesn't. In terms of an atom-thick wire, I'm not sure much kinetic energy would actually be converted into thermal energy; it seems as though the wire would more than likely just go /through/ the body without substantially decreasing its velocity, meaning very little momentum will actually be retained by the body. This small amount will be lessened even further by the fact some of the energy will be used to sever molecular bonds. After all of that, I highly doubt that enough energy will be left to initiate fusion (although of course I don't actually have any numbers to back this up).

  Relativistic explosions eventually are a factor but before that we probably could get pretty good splatter.

I'm not sure what you mean by "relativistic explosion", but an atom-thick wire probably wouldn't generate that much splatter, either. In terms of the cell membrane, well, that's made of a lipid bilayer that's not held together by any actual bonds; it's just surface tension similar to what you see in a soap bubble. If you pass the wire through fast enough, it's possible the membrane wouldn't even be disturbed that much; it'd simply reform as soon as the wire disappears. Internal cell structures such as /organelles/ probably wouldn't fare so well, but I'd imagine very little /splatter/ would actually occur.
