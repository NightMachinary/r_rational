This is a very odd hypothetical wire. I'm not sure it could actually be specified in a sensible way given physics---like, not even if you were overriding the natural physics in some per-simulation-frame way.

Really, it's a question of what the atoms of the wire do when they interact with regular molecules. My expectation would be for the molecules to try to form chemical bonds to the wire (oxidizing it and so forth), and then for those bonded molecules to get dragged along as the wire continues to move.

One of the important questions to picture this more specifically: /what temperature/ is the wire?
