Hum... I know I mentioned above about speed (the ludicrous amount of which that would be needed to make the impact actually explode). But now I'm thinking we need to talk about that here too. I think if we did it slow enough exactly what you describe would happen. Maybe also there are some other time frames... but what about dragging segments of molecules along? I think we might actually need to know what atomic bonding properties this one atom thick slice of unbreakable would actually be.

Would it drag air molecules behind it? would that effect it any more or less?
