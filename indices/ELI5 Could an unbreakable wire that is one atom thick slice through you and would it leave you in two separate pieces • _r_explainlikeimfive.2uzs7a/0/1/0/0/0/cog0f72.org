I strongly suspect that there is a reason that doctors perform surgeries with scalpels rather than clubs, and a reason that wounds heal faster still the finer the scalpel and cleaner the cut they can make. I am personally familiar with the way even the deepest of papercuts can nonetheless heal and close alarmingly quickly and to no ill-effect, and that's with a jagged blade edge a significant fraction of a millimeter thick. You are proposing using a blade whose edge would be measured in femtometers.

While I cannot yet devise a strategy to verify this result empirically, I believe the trend in decreased bodily harm should continue to scale inversely to the width of the blade edge, for in the degenerate case whereby we are intersected by a flatlander, it shall be surely be impossible to notice at all even the existence of a flatland. Neutrinos shine up on us all night, a withering machinegun fire that leaves us riddled with innumerable paths of full peircing entry and exit wounds of negligible size - and we are none the worse for it.

I acknowledge though that passing a point through a solid to draw a line is not as effective as passing a line through it to draw a plane - while asking you to keep in consideration that on these scales even that analogy fails because humans are less a solid and more a liquid - or a void.
