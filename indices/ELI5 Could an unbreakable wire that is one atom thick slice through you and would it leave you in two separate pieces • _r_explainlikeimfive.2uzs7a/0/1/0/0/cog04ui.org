Good thinking. But what's the relationship in scale between what such a wire would do and what Brownian motion would do? And/or there's the following aspect: The motion due to thermal energy is chaotic and, I suspect, would keep the overall same energy level.

This wire would move everything in a few same-y directions, which introduces an information into the soup that wasn't there before, which might have a relevant energetic effect. As an example of what I mean, just imagine half of the atoms randomly bouncing in the exact same direction in parallel, that would be devastating to the macroscopic object.

Also, the wire would introduce energy into the system. Even if it's on the scale of Brownian motion, it would effectively be thermal energy. And too much heat is a thing.
