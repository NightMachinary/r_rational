About the third point: The atoms of the object would at least be shifted around a little. If this would happen to the object a few thousand times at exactly the same spot, changes on more macroscopic scales could emerge. As a visual image: It's like using the smear brush with a low pressure setting in a paint program. You have to apply it /a lot/ of times to get a visual effect.

Affixing such a wire between two poles in between a lot of people walk through (e.g. entrance of office building) could over a long time result in worse health, kinda like an asbestos or weakly irradiated environment, if the people manage to get hit by the wire in the same place all the time, which is super unlikely.
