- You can't have an unbreakable wire. All material objects have a tensile strength and shear strength dependent on their composition and thickness.

- It can't be one atom thick. A wire one atom thick isn't even a monomolecule, it's a line of individual unbonded atoms. It dissolves immediately into monatomic dust.

- It can't cut. On this scale, you would move some atoms and molecules around, but you probably would not damage any of the individual cells or separate them from each other. The line would pass between their constituent molecules, and those molecules would close back up behind it.
