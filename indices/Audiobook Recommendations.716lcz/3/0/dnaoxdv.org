  The Feynman Lectures
#+end_quote

How well can these be consumed and/or enjoyed without an accompanying script? In my university days I /know/ audio and visual presentation (be it blackboard or powerpoint) went hand in hand, one enriching the other. There were, however, courses where the ‘audio track' of a given lecture was at best supplemental to the visual material, enhancing the understanding, but at the same time all but requiring to actually /see/ the blackboard. Think illustrations, formulae, and what have you, where the lecturer says stuff like “As you can see here *points* and here *points elsewhere*, this is pretty obvious, and it follows only logically that *scratches something on the blackboard*.” The only remotely workable version of such lectures was with an audiovisual recording, or, you know, being present.

Or is the audiobook supplemented with a pdf? I had that on occasion.
