I haven't gotten fully incorporated the first volume into my mental models, both because of this, and because the subject matter is a rather counter-intuitive (Volume 1 and 2 are quantum mechanics and advanced quantum mechanics), you'll have to assemble a few things yourself, like equations and Feynman's quanta diagrams, if you want to do your full due diligence and get to that point. There are no PDF, but the lectures are of a very solid in that they explain the development of the current model from experiments, and to quote Eneasz (though he was talking about Tyson there I think) /the sheer enthusiasm . . ./

Short form, it's not a course, it is more like auditing a course where you need to still go buy a book and scrounge up the handouts, but with a damn fine professor on the subject, who both made some developments in the field, and knows how and enjoys teaching the material.
