I'm listening to The Temporal Void, the sequel to The Dreaming Void by Peter F Hamilton. It's a crazy rollercoaster of a novel packed to the brim with sizzling gypsies...I mean it's a pangalactic space opera with some odd but compelling fantasy elements and some memorable ideas, prose, and characters. Be prepared to concentrate a bit while listening.
