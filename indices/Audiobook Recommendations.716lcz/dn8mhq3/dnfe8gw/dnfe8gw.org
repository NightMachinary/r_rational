Reading Sapiens cause it keeps getting recommended, even though I hate longer audiobooks (I think the more time it's stretched out over the worse recall I have)

It's fascinating, but I'm not sure if I want to go into Homo Deus in audiobook format. How does it follow from Sapiens? Does it cover a lot of the same ground cause I don't want to be stuck re-+reading+listening to similar material.
