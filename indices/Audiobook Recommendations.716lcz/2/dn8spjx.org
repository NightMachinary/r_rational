I quite liked the audiobook of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. The reader, Simon Prebble, does /very/ well with voices and accents. The book starts slowly for a few chapters, but gets faster as it goes and comes to a really solid ending by the end of it all.

It's not really rational fiction in any particular way, but is very good fantasy fiction anyways. There is some setup/payoff stuff, but by and large magic is presented as mysterious and is not fully explained to the reader. The characters /mostly/ don't act irrationally enough to bother me or anything. The writing is somewhat affected - it's done in the style of writers like Jane Austen, and it is set roughly two centuries ago.
