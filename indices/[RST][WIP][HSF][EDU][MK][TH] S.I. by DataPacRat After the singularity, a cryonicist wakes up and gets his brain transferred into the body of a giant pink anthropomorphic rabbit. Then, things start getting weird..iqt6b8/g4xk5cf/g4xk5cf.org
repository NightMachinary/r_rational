I was always sad that Wierdtopia didn't go anywhere, but this story seems to take many similar ideas and funnel them in the general direction of a plot.

I'm only somewhere in book 3, but I am so far delightfully pleased with the wierdness. I particularly enjoy the alien societies; the human settlements are depressingly human with a dash of apocalypse, but the squids and the spirits show how morally compatible a group might be without actually being, like, socially compatible. If that makes sense.

So far, I'd highly recommend this to anyone who was a fan of Wierdtopia, and to anyone who enjoys the alien portrayals in Animorphs: The Reckoning.
