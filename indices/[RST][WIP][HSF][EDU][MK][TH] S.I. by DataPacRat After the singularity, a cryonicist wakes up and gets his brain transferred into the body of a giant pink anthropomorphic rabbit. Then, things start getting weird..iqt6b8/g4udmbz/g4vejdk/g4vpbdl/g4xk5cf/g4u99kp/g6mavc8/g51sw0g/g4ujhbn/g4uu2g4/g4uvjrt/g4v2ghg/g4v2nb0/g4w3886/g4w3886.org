Spoiled for slightly nsfw:

I was going to dispute this post, with something along the lines of 'it seems weird for the protagonist to be forced to continually wear a diaper, and also end up anal vored by an ostrich woman (who is explicitly attracted to the protagonist), just as a nod to the furry community'. Like, if I write a story where the twinkish hero is subjected to the wiles of a tribe of large-chested amazonian women, it'd be reasonable to assume some prurient interest, even if it's ultimately a minor plot point that the protag himself doesn't seem to hold interest in. But then I realized that that was actually a different story by the same author, posted here quite some time ago, and that this is one I haven't read before. I haven't decided how that impacts the point.

e: Not a value judgement, though. That story (Weirdtopia) was otherwise pretty enjoyable, and at their worst the fetishes touched upon just made me roll my eyes.
