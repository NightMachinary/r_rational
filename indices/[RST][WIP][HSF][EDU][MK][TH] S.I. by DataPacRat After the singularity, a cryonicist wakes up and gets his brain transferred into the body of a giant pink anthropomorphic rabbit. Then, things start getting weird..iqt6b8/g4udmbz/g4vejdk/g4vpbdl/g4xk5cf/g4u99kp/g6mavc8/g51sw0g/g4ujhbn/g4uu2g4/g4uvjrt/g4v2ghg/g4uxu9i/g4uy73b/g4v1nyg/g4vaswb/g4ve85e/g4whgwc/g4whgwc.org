I'd really appreciate if you put more effort into not being hostile, even if you think that someone else is being hostile to you. This isn't the kind of behavior that's good for discourse.

I personally don't think that it's reasonable for negative judgments (or judgments in general) to /always/ be phrased as subjective, and think you'd have been fine just saying that and walking away. (Though yes, it's more diplomatic to just append "I think" to your statements.)
