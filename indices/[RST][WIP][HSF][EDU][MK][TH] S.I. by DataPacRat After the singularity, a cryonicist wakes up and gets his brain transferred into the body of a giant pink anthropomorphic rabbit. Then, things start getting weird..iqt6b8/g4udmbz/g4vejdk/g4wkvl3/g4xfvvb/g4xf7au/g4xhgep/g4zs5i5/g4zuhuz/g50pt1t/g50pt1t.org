I read a small bit. I think I agree with you that the writing is "bad" but I have different opinions as to why. It seems meandering and frequently off topic.

Further, I'm not in love with the premise as I understand it, and the inclusion of in-line furry porn to demonstrate what the MC's new body looks like (on the official site), while it didn't particularly offend me, leads me to believe the goals of the author won't align with my goals as a reader.
