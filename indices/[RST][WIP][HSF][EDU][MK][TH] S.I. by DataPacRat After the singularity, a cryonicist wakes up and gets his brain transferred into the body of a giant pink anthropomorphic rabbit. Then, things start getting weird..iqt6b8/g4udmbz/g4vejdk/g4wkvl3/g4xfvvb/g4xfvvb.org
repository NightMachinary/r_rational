It's been a long time since I tried giving this a read; but I recall that as of a later book, the character explicitly hired a “live-in therapist”, and spoke with them at length, pretty much all the time. It's actually very well justified; they /were/ going through some shit at the time. But the therapist character's presence in the story outlasts the MC's body dysphoria.

I didn't think about it at the time, but in retrospect it was certainly a way to expose the MC's thinking. Said therapist character is essentially a Watson.

Which is to say, I think S.I. was written to follow /screenwriting/ conventions. In screenwriting, /all/ thinking has to be done in the form of a conversation (because, if it isn't, you end up with the dreaded /voice-over narration/, ala the eleventh-hour directorial patch-up of /Blade Runner/.)
