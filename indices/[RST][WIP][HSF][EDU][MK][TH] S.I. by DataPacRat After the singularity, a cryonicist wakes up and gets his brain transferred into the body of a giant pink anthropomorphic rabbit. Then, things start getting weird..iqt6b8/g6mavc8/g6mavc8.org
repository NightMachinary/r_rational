Something that confused and interested me about the story is that the MC is at best faux-rational, using it to justify their reckless behavior yet there's reasonable(as far as such a word can be applied) consequences despite it being an SI which implies a degree of self awareness that otherwise seems to be lacking. I would not call it a rational story but it has some good ideas at points, the author pulls on weird fetishes for shock value and weirdness but I find this ultimately limits their creativity.

I would reccomend reading it to marvel at the writing rather than the story in and of itself.
