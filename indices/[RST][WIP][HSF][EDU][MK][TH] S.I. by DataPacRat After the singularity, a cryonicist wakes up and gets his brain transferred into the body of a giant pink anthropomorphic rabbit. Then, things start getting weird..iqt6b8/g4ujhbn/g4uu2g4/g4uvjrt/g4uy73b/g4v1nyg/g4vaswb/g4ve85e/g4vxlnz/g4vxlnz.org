I mean you know the author is a member of this community right?

So when you just drive-by say "this is shitty" not only are you being rude to the author you're also not providing any kind of useful commentary. You're just saying "I, some random internet person, think this is dumb and that you're dumb". Not only could you have said the same thing more diplomatically, you could have added some actual useful content to your message. "I didn't like it because for these reasons". Not only is using an "I" statement like that a more diplomatic way to put it, it also means that you're sharing useful feedback, both for the author and for anyone who might be considering reading this.
