Hm interesting. I consciously put this restriction on myself as I write, in an attempt to get me to write more specific and meaningful descriptions of what people are actually physically doing to convey the same information, as a sort of hyperapplication of "show, don't tell".

But truth be told I'm not sure if it works. You may feel the same way about my writing.
