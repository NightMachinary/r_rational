I'm not sure how this is supposed to indicate bad writing. Old-style epics almost never showed any insight into the MC's head, and it's a legitimate style to imitate (see: Lord of the Rings).

The prose could use an edit pass for the occasional typo, but it's very readable. The plot clips along fine, the dialog is followable. The only quip I might have is that sometimes the scene transitions abruptly, but as I get older I find myself preferring that over taking too much time meandering between scenes.
