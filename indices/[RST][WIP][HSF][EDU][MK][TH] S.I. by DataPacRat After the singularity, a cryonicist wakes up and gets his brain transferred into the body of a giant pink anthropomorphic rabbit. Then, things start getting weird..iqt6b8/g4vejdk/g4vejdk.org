I read around two-thirds of the first book before dropping the story. I felt that it was /bad/ writing, but couldn't exactly put a finger on the reason. And now I get it, I think.

It has no inner monologue. Even the worst fanfics took their time to convey how the PoV character feels and what they think. There's nothing like that in the story, it's all words and actions (MC /says/ how he feels). And this utter lack of insight into MC's thought process leads to two main problems: firstly, I'm completely not invested in the black box of a main character, and secondly, it gives an impression of incoherence even despite obviously thought-out setting and plot.

There are other problems, but this made a strong enough subconscious impression for me to stop reading.
