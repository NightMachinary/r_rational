So, my predictions for the fights.

On the left: Krillin beats Yamcha, Goku beats Ox King, Goku beats Krillin. Seems rather obvious.

The right is a bit trickier. Barring any shenanigans: +Son Gohan+ Inari-san beats Giran, and Mai (to everyones surprise) beats +Muten Roshi+ Jackie Chun. Gohan probably beats Mai (but it could go either way).

So in the finals, Goku fights either Gohan or Mai. Narratively, he beats Mai but loses to Gohan. Realistically, he loses to both.
