Well, they were funny-ish in their original context, but here they would just have bogged me down, so off they go, used as setup for a good lampshading joke!

As for Krillin... he looks like in the original, so I'm not sure if that should mean he actually has no nose, or simply has a very hard to see one. A lot of people look weird in the Dragon World. But I'll assume he has a sense of smell like most humans (and unlike me).
