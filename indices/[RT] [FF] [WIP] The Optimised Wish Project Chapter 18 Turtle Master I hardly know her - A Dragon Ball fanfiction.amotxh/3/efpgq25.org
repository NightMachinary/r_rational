Thank you, story writer, for eliminating some of the needlessly ridiculous concepts from the original. I'm looking at you, seductive woman and Stench Man. I understand the original series was for the younger types, but such things were beyond ridiculous.

I assume, however, that /this/ version of Krillin actually has a nose?
