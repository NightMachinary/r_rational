  This seems like something that the tournaments sponsor could easily solve... Just fly in a mega capsule hotel or something, theres probably a festival/emergency offshoot somewhere in the org-chart.

Hm, true, though you'd also need the room to set it up, and let's be frank, not really /their/ problem. If those people wouldn't pay for the hotel, that'd just be a waste of money.

(also for various reason I've decided - and I think mentioned? - that there's a mass limit on capsule objects, and it's around the size of a house. So a mega hotel would require multiple modular capsules to assemble)

  I just now got the jackie chun joke

You mean Jackie Chun = Jackie Chan? I actually recently heard that Toriyama was inspired to make Dragon Ball by the fact that he used to watch Hong Kong Shawn Brothers kung-fu movies while he drew Arale, so in that logic the reference makes even more sense.
