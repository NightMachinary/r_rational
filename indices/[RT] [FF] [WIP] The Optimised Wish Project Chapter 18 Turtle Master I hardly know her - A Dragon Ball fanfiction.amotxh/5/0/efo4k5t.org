I've started going for something like one chapter every two weeks. Then slipped back to one every three weeks, and this one took a month. In general it's a fixed number of weeks because I always upload on the weekend.

As for other writing... not yet. This is a shorter story so I would like to finish it before I put it up somewhere. It'll be on FF.net and AO3 as usual.
