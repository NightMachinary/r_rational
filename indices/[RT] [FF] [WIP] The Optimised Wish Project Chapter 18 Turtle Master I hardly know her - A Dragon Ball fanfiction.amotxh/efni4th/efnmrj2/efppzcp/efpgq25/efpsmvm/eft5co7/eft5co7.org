Thank you. Krillin is my favorite Human character in the series (not that that's a high bar), and the whole 'no nose' thing just seemed to be an art style until they referenced it in the Stink Man part of the tournament. It just seemed dumb for a one-off gag.

I'm also one of the 'nose doesn't work 90% of the time' people, so it always confused me why they did that.

You have a /lot/ of lampshading jokes, and I love them. You take some of the stupid or pointlessly silly things out, but still find a way to use them for humor, and I appreciate that.
