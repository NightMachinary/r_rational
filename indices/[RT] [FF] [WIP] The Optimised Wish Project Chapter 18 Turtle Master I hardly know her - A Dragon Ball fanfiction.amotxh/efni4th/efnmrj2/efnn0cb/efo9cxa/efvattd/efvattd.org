  Realistically, he loses to both.

Any particular reason you think that? Goku has been training a lot since he last met either of them, intuitively I'd guess realistically he beats both of them, but narratively both fights could go either way.

Completely unrelated, but I find I cannot read Krillins voice in anything but the TFS version now (which is interesting, because that is not true for the other characters that have been both this and DBZ abridged) .
