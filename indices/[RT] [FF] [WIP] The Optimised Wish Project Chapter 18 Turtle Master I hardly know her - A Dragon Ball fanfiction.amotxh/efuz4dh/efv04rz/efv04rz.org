Goku's grandfather (really, his adoptive father) was called Son Gohan too. He then named his son after him (which is customary in many countries). In the original show, he's only seen when Baba brings him back from the dead to fight Goku in her personal tournament, at the end of the Red Ribbon arc, as they needed Baba's services to find the last Dragon Ball.
