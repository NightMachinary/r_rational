I guess the scifi/steampunk stuff hasn't really had much of an impact, it feels? Athos has /noticed/ it, but not really /cared/ about it.

I don't think "visible poverty" is offbrand for fantasy city, though, but I imagine it's a broader label for me than what you were avoiding. Might be due to how I've been running D&D recently, since my players enjoy taking down corrupt nobles and the like, so visible poverty is basically dangling an easy plot hook.
