  Ooh, more dog!

  bulbuous -> bulbous?
#+end_quote

Fixed, thanks.

  How can Athos tell visually that they're pipes?
#+end_quote

They're round, metal, and smooth instead of cabled or braided.

  "sniffed each other's tails" - continue to like the dog perspective and idioms.
#+end_quote

Thanks. I've been making an effort on that. The hardest part is colors; dogs apparently see in a spectrum of yellow and blue, which makes descriptions somewhat limiting.

  Ah, visible poor people in fantasy city. Interesting that there are fae(?) in a demon city, but I guess that just shows it's a large cosmopolitan place.
#+end_quote

Yup, I was going for cosmopolitan. Also, I wanted to draw some pros and cons...open borders, inclusive of different cultures, open carry and no major limitations on weapons, lots of wealth floating around, significant (literal) market activity, at least some strong communities, limited or no social safety nets, large amounts of poverty and vagrancy. Classifying those into pros and cons is a highly political issue so I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader; the point is to show that it's complicated and to make the city feel real.

  Eugene continues being an asshole, but feels like less of one than previously - maybe he's not as angry any more?
#+end_quote

He's mostly gotten over his rage, at least as far as Athos can tell.

#+end_quote

I loved that movie.

#+begin_quote
  As we go through the city, I can't help but feel the alien-ness is a bit... underexplored?
#+end_quote

Which alien-ness in particular? There's a limited amount that I can explore it just while characters are walking through the city not talking to anyone, but I did try to showcase it as much as possible.

#+begin_quote
  Finally a bit of exposition about the Patchwork Realms?Hooray! And we find out that Bjorn's from a sci-fi realm.
#+end_quote

Yup. I had originally had a vague idea about doing the standard "nomad warrior from far away, serves as a cultural contrast for the main character" but decided that was too on the nose and too clich√©. Instead, I decided to go for "starship engineer".

  Murray has had three lines and I already like him. Probably a bad idea, since he's an infernal.
#+end_quote

I'm glad you like him. He was fun to write.
