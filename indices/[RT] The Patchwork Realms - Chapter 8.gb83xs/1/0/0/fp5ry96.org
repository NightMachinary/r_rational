As to the "alien-ness" I don't know how to express it - I'd just finished the latest batch of Worth The Candle before starting this chapter, so maybe it's just that the way it's done there resonates with me particularly well. I guess a lot of it fell into "standard fantasy city" until we started digging into the demon- or system- specific bits.

Thinking about it a bit further, I guess it's seeing the second-order consequences of differences between the alien races, but that's not something that Athos is likely to know about or observe at this point.

Also, large central landmark building in a fantasy city with unusual architecture? Ten mana says they end up going there at some point.
