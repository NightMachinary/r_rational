Thoughts as I go:

Ooh, more dog!

bulbuous -> bulbous?

How can Athos tell visually that they're pipes?

"sniffed each other's tails" - continue to like the dog perspective and idioms.

Ah, visible poor people in fantasy city. Interesting that there are fae(?) in a demon city, but I guess that just shows it's a large cosmopolitan place.

Eugene continues being an asshole, but feels like less of one than previously - maybe he's not as angry any more?

"jittery malaise" - ooh, is there some kind of demonic mind-effect? ... yeah, as I go through this section it's fairly clear there is.

... translator? [[https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7261971.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Dug-pixar-up.jpg][dug.jpg]]

As we go through the city, I can't help but feel the alien-ness is a bit... underexplored?

Okay, demonic moneychangers, makes sense.

... Huh? Marza doesn't have whatever kind of soul these demons work off? Interesting but not really relevant yet.

Finally a bit of exposition about the Patchwork Realms?Hooray! And we find out that Bjorn's from a sci-fi realm.

Negotiation scene... eh. No feelings about this bit.

Murray has had three lines and I already like him. Probably a bad idea, since he's an infernal.
