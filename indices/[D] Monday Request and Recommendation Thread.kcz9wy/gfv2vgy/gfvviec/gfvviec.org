I follow quite a few webcomics on a regular basis. Here are the ones I love most due to their high quality story and artwork:

--------------

*[[http://www.lackadaisy.com/][Lackadaisy]]*

A beautifully detailed period piece, this webcomic follows a wide cast of characters connected to the 'Lackadaisy' speakeasy as they deal with tumultuous times in prohibition era St. Louis: rival gangs, malingering revenue agents, and past secrets that refuse to stay buried.

The art quality is professional level. All of the characters are portrayed as anthropomorphic cats, but they act just like humans, with amazing detail in expressions, clothing, and scene setting. Like most webcomics, the art style changes a bit over time, but in my opinion the quality starts out high and grows to become truly phenomenal.

Example pages:

- [[https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=4][Early on]]
- [[https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=151][More recent]]

The webcomic is relatively slow to update (understatement), but it has been reliably and steadily growing since 2006.

*[[https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/][Outsider]]*

This story is a space opera set in the 22nd century, after humanity, having achieved spaceflight, finally makes contact with an alien civilization for the first time. Sadly, first contact proves to be an ill omen: the aliens turned out to be refugees fleeing a pan-galactic war of annihilation waged between rival civilizations. Armed with intel from this encounter, the leaders of humanity realize that they must inevitably choose a side or risk being wiped out by either of the galactic super powers. The story follows a crewman on humanity's scouting expedition sent to investigate each side.

The quality of the art is consistently high. The character style is a bit more anime-esque compared to the others I'd recommend, but the artist does a excellent job of meshing the drawn parts of each scene with the 3D rendered spacecraft interiors.

Example pages:

- [[https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider003.html][Early on]]
- [[https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider058.html][More recent]]

Like Lackadaisy, Outsider has often been slow to update, but it has been chugging along reliably since 2001.

*[[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/][String Theory]]*

Sting Theory follows the life of an unethical scientist in a dystopian alternate universe USA where science has created abilities that seem supernatural. The aftermath of a catastrophic lab failure lands the main character in prison, his life seemingly in ruins, but powerful people lurk behind the scenes, angling to use him for their own ends.

Out of all my recommendations, this webcomic has the most dramatic evolution of style over the course of its story. It starts out grayscale and cartoony, but eventually develops to wonderfully detailed color palettes, scene setting and character design.

Example pages:

- [[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/pagethree/][Early on]]
- [[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/page-twenty-seven/][Middle development]]
- [[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/chp6-page-05/][More recent]]

I can't comment on the update schedule of this one since I haven't been following it as long, but it began in 2009 and has quite a few chapters already posted.

--------------

*[[https://unsoundedupdates.tumblr.com/][Unsounded]]*

(/This one has been recommended by quite a few people on this sub./)

This story follows two unlikely allies in their fraught journey to places they never should have ventured. Along the way the artist explores the depths of the unique fantasy setting: nations at war, conflicting theologies, and science on an uneasy leash to politics.

The artist began her professional career long before starting Unsounded, and it shows. Out of all my recommendations, this one has the highest consistent quality throughout, and the artist loves to play with the variety of her medium. She has a flare for breaking through the borders of the page at climactic moments.

Some example pages:

- [[http://www.unsoundedcomic.com/comic/ch02/ch02_17.html][1]]
- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch03/ch03_04.html][2]]
- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch03/ch03_29.html][3]]
- [[http://www.unsoundedcomic.com/comic/ch05/ch05_18.html][4]]

Unsounded also has the most professional update schedule out of all the webcomics I've ever seen. During posting cycles, the artist always uploads several pages per week until a chapter is fully uploaded (which typically means months at a time of steady, fast updates). Then, when the chapter is completely up, she takes a month-long hiatus to build up her page buffer again.
