Webcomics, what do you like?

[[http://www.genocideman.com/]] Scifi, completed. "I didn't survive Oslo. Oslo didn't survive me."

[[https://girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php]] Epically long Steampunk by the Foglios of magic - the gathering fame. Unfinished, but close to endgame, should be done a couple years.

[[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html]] DnD fantasy stick figures. This too is mildly close to the endgame, unfinished.

There is the singularly awesome Dresden Codak but main story updates so slow it might as well be dead. Famous among these parts for ua. [[http://dresdencodak.com/2006/12/03/dungeons-and-discourse/]]

Fine and sweet near-future Scifi, finished, (bit of nudity+sex) nmg.thecomicseries.com/comics/357

[[https://unicornjelly.com/]] starts a bit silly but its themes are [[/r/rational]] relevant, its got the Eliezer seal of approval. Fantasy+SciFi???

[[http://tangent128.name/depot/toys/freefall/freefall-flytable.html#1]] In Freefall, we follow an uplifted wolf on a newly colonized planet and her struggles with the classic Asimov themes. Been called "the most scientifically accurate webcomic".
