Genocide Man looks perfect, thanks!

I don't know how to describe my tastes, they're a bit wide. Generally speaking I like prudent characters who might be a little cynical but not necessarily evil. But I've also loved [[https://www.peppercarrot.com/][Pepper&Carrot]] (besides that and SFP I don't think I've read another webcomic).

Can't say I've ever been into hard SF, but if the work can be considered a classic, I'm willing to go into it. I liked Asimov mostly for Salvor Hardin.

I'm quite fine with "weird" things. So yeah, mainly anything "classic," or otherwise just anything people thought was interesting.
