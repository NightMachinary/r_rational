What are some rationalist works that have the same basic setup of Worm (One day a fraction of people gained superpowers) except with a PoD set back in the early 20th century instead of 1982?

In other words, Worm set during the World Wars and other political chaos of that era.

It doesn't have to be a Worm fanfic, but ideally it'd be as dark or more than Wildbow's work, and it'd be great if it had the same system since it's already very elegant.

Feel free to recommend rationalist fiction that takes place around this era and is similarly alien space batty.
