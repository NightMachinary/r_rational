Any recommendation on books that teach mental techniques for how to overcome or control anxiety and clear your mind when it comes to making important decisions? Asking for someone else, so pretty basic stuff that can 1: give better custom advice than I can (I don't have much about techniques for overcoming anxiety that seems to work for them) and 2: actually have a tone that's not too technical or laden with data and scientific references, all while still being grounded in actual behavioural science and not some bogus magical self-help bullshit.
