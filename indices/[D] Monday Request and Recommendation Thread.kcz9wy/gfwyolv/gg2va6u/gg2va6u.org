Can't say I have, but if you want a decent take on Harry you could try this crossover fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7551730/chapters/17174713][A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't My Fault]] i found on [[/r/TheCitadel]]. The premise is that the ritual in Changes sends Harry and Maggie to Planetos, specifically to Braavos. The writing level is so-so but the plot and characterization is fairly interesting. It's abandoned, but it has over 250k words.
