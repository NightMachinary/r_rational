I suggest you try TTS. Voice Dream works very well on mobile, and there are good solutions for Windows as well (TextAloud and Nextspeech? I have forgotten the exact names ...) You might also try cloud (e.g., AWS) TTS; They might be better. Anyhow, all of these sound well enough, and I've listened to countless hours of TTS content.

Also search for “HPMOR Podcast,” the group has audiobooks for some rational stories (including short stories). Very well done.
