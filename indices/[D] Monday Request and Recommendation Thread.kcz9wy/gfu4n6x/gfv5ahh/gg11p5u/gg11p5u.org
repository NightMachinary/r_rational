Are the sequel's chapters on Patreon? How many?

I was considering supporting in order to read ahead early, but the author's Patreon has the text "Apocalypse: Generic System is being published, and book 2 does not have any advance chapters yet. Only WOTR has advanced chapters. I will update this when book 2 begins to land." which put me off supporting for now as I'm not interested in WOTR. Is the text out of date?
