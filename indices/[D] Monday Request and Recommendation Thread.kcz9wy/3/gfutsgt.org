People here seem to quite like progression fantasy.

Watching the protagonist grow in power, acquire ever new abilities and come to gradually dominate every new environment they find themselves in seems to be satisfying.

Is there any satisfying /regression/ fantasy? Could it be done?

/Pact/ could be classified as a regression fantasy and what I read of it I found distinctly unsatisfying. The protagonist keeps (unrealistically) surviving, while losing parts of himself and failing to achieve his goals.

Maybe, if instead the protagonist willingly spent their body or potential (like a spacecraft spends delta-v) to achieve changes in the world, the enjoyability could be improved.

Does anything like that exist?
