Twig is sort of like that, although to be fair the protagonist retains a similar level of competence as he goes on through the story. A large part of the regression is due to being a teen kid against some real powerful people (not really spoilers), and losing resources he used to have for granted. The other part is due to some major spoilery reason. I don't know if I'd call it satisfying, since I stopped reading before the story ended, but I have heard that it has one of wildbow's more positive endings.
