Maybe try mindfulness meditation? I recommend the Waking Up guided meditation app. [[https://youtu.be/CN-_zzHpcdM][Here's]] a sample from their youtube channel. It's by a guy with a PhD in neuroscience, so not spiritual mumbo jumbo.

There's a one month trial . The monthly fee is a bit expensive, but very worth it imo. If it's out of your price range you can email support and they'll give you a one year code for free.
