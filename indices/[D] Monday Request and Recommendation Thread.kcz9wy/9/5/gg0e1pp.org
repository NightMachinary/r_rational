For me, [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/][Noita]] is rational in that it's all about manipulating fairly complex spell modifiers and numbers till you get something obscenely overpowered to match the strong, numerous enemies and the volatile environment. The world is huge, there are parallel universes and all kinds of things that make it seem 'real'. Each biome may seem independent but it's all part of a greater whole, worms move between... etc. I like the consistency of it.

On the same note, [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/460950/Katana_ZERO/][Katana Zero]] is sort of rational in that sense. It makes sense for you to be able to retry, time and time again given that's your superpower. The gameplay fits the theme. Also both are overwhelmingly positive.
