The [[https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56][HPMOR audiobook]] is amazing- all the characters are voiced separately, like a radio drama. Harry's voice is perfect, innocent with a touch of whining, but with enough range to be a little frightening at times. Snape becomes an uncannily likeable mild-mannered professor who just likes to bully people which was an interesting take on him. Quirrell is respectably thuggish.

Just found [[https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TF77XsD5PbucbJsG3][Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets]] from [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]], its a new ongoing 2nd year story from the end of HPMOR, both hilarious and clever.

Seconding [[/u/timecubefanfiction][u/timecubefanfiction]] 's recommendation for the webcomic [[https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]]. Its a bit, um, weird, but very high quality, like a left-wing-focused version of Watchmen. As an aside, I'll recommend everything [[/u/timecubefanfiction][u/timecubefanfiction]] himself has ever written. Have been a fan since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/g1ajqh/the_one_where_quirrell_is_an_egg/][The one where Quirrell is an egg]].

A request: does anyone have any webcomic recommendations, especially ones that are well-known? I haven't read any webcomics besides SFP so if people have any favourite classics (rational or not) I'd appreciate it.
