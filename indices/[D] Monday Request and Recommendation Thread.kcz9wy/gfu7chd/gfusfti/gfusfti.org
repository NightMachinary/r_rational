Pretty much any sandbox game that isn't a open world collectatons AAA games.

â€‹

Rimworld, Dwarf fortress, Cities Skylines, Factorio, Oxygen not Included, Kerbal space program, Starsector etc. They are rational in a way that it requires thinking, planning and proper actions to succeed. But in general they aren't story based, you build your own story as you play.
