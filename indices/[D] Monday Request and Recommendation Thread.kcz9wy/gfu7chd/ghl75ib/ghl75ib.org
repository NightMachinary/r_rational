The Witness is an explicitly rational/ist/ puzzle game and walking simulator. Highly, highly reccomended. It is a game that is trying to, on top of just being a neat series of puzzles, show you something true about insight and discovery and the order underlying the world. Also, it's just beautiful, in a colourful, clear and deliberate way.
