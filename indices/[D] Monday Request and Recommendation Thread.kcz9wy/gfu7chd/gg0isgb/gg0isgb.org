Everyone has already mentioned some of the best puzzles or sandboxes out there, so I'll go for more story based stuff. I'm currently playing Crying Suns, a space rogue like about an admiral who keeps being revived by an AI from a memory backup trying to restore a fallen stellar empire. Feels very Dune in setting, with some Warhammer 40k thrown in, but the story (quite simple, and I still haven't seen the ending) has a lot of transhumanism in it, as you can imagine.

Children of a Dead Earth is a strategy game about fighting a war in the solar system, between human colonies. It's as realistic as it gets, as in, literal orbital mechanics are involved. Not much plot though.
