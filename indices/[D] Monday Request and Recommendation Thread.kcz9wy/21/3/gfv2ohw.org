I recommend /KonoSuba/ and /Hinamatsuri/ (manga) neither are extremely rational but both are extremely hilarious. There is anime of both.

What I find very engaging about /Hinamatsuri/ is that what might be just throw-away jokes in other works will often have long-lasting effects on the plot here. The status quo is definitely not conserved.
