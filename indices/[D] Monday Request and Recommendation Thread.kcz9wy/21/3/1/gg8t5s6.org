If we're talking comedy manga, can't avoid mentioning /Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to/, a clever and arguably pretty rational romcom about two very smart and very dorky teenagers in love who try to one-up each other with mind games to pull a confession out of each other. It's very funny, very character-driven, and often uses its setup to make some quite poignant and down-to-earth observations on how romantic relationships work, while often lampooning the worst tropes of the romantic comedy genre in the process. The only reservation I have is that lately it has had a bit of a penchant for going into more straight-faced serious arcs that are frankly the worst part of the series for me. Not awful, but a lot less believable and clever than the rest.

Also, seconded both your recommendation, and recently I've started reading /Yuusha ga Shinda (The Hero is Dead)/, which is very Konosuba-like. A sleazy, cowardly, good for nothing farmer kills the destined Hero who's supposed to defeat evil etc. by mistake, and is forced by a necromancer to take his place as a soul inserted in his (now rotting) body. Cue shenanigans as he tries to live up to a reputation he can't possibly match and/or shamelessly make use of it for his personal advantage, occasionally happens to defeat worse evils than he, and generally be a force for Chaotic Neutralness at best.
