I personally rank Small Gods as one of the best Discworld novels, but I'm also someone who on rereading any given Pratchett entry for the fifth time thinks "oh yeah, that's why this is my favorite one". Even if I wouldn't quite say 90% are /as/ good as Small Gods, there's easily 20 more books in the series that are at least that good, and most of the rest are still excellent in their own right.
