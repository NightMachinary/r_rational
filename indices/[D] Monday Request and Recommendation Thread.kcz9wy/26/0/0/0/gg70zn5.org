I generally agree with you but overall I found /Perilous Waif/ frustrating.

On the one hand, the world building is close to brilliant. It's a great example of "hard far future sci-fi" because while there is some handwaving and clarketech going on, it feels more science-based and down to earth compared to something like the star trek setting. Critically, it takes the technology it introduces seriously and considers its effects on the wider world. Also, it handled the big AI question well (what are humans for in the future?) and manages to create a world where human(ish) main characters aren't obsolete.

Additionally, there are some fantastic story threads in there. There's the whole "Level 6 AI" plotline simmering in the background but there are also plenty of identity, free will, and consciousness/transhumanism questions floating about. Then there are all the space-opera elements which leave the setting open with basically limitless potential.

On the other hand, when the author's tastes (and proclivity for writing erotica?) shine through things get a little... weird. I mean, I'm not opposed to sex in my fictions, but this story hits all the cringe-inducing tropes (eg all women are lesbians, actual furries, etc) and some that are not cringe-inducing but simply ick. Like, I get that the protagonist "ages faster" so she's "older than she looks" but come'on. There are a /lot/ of things that raise red flags for me and some serious "men writing women" issues.

This is why I find /Perilous Waif/ so frustrating. It has a fantastic setting, perfectly serviceable fun characters, an engaging story, and countless story threads that could all individually be pulled out and spooled into a whole books, /but/, all this good has an uncomfortable pallor cast over it from the author's proclivities which make me feel like checking the local sex-offender listings.
