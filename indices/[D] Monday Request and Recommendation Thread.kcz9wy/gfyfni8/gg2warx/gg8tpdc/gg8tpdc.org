In fiction harem usually is employed in the context of anime or anime-inspired stuff, so I'd say it's not vague, and in practice:

#+begin_quote
  a guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks

is /definitely/ what it will mean 99% of the time. Recently, a much funnier incarnation of the trope is found in the manga /The 100 Girlfriends who Really Really Really Really Love You/, which is a comedy about some dude who is literally forced by fate to have 100 girlfriends - not just love interests, literal girlfriends. So it's a true polyamorous relationship (that gets increasingly more ridiculous with each new addition; I believe he's somewhere around 10 or 11 at this point), and funnily enough, far from being your typical dense or perverted self-insert, the protagonist is instead this super considerate, super loving guy who treats all the girls with incredible affection and understanding and would likely give his life for any of them at a moment's notice without a second thought. I'd call the series wholesome overall if not for the fact that the ages of some of the characters would make their romantic association more than a bit questionable in real life (I think overall the whole thing is SO ridiculously absurdist and unrealistic, having also a habit of repeatedly shattering the fourth wall into non-existence, it's easy to overlook it as just part of the craziness, but YMMV). It's definitely a very unique, and for once, very /literal/, take on the harem trope.
