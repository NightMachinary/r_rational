  In fiction harem usually is employed in the context of anime or anime-inspired stuff

Anime/light novels-inspired harems admittedly tend to take the "guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks" route. However, more recently different, much more explicit, types of "harem" and "reverse harem" fantasy/science fiction books -- think E. William Brown's "Daniel Black" books -- have become popular.

An Amazon Kindle search on "reverse harem" finds over 10,000 matches. Spot-checking suggests that roughly half of them have SF/F elements. A quick check of the ISFDB robot's internal database finds over 4,700 books with the word "harem" in the title, including over 2,500 "reverse harem" titles. And that's just the stuff that /hasn't/ been added to the main ISFDB database (yet). See [[/r/haremfantasynovels]] for more details.
