Most of these are on Royalroad btw.

Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends is good, has some interesting main characters. The power system is very consistent and deep, and the author does this great thing of having interludes from the most powerful people in the world. It's just overall good (compared to other litrpg/xianxia). The main characters sometimes make questionable decisions, but most of the time the decisions are because of power interactions (power requires sacrifice, and whatnot). Overall I'd say most characters beyond a certain power level are competent, and that even if the protagonists seem OP, the author finds a way to give everyone powerful OP abilities.

Defiance of the Fall and He Who Fights With Monsters are good popcorn fics. Not too rational, has pulpy protagonists who always get a lot of power and popularity while quipping witty one liners (especially the second one). They are fun guilty pleasure reads.

I've heard good things about Forge of Destiny and The Path Unending, which both started as quests on SV and SB and then migrated to RR with nice edited versions. Same for Ave Xia Rem Y, which wasn't a quest but also migrated.

The Dao Of Magic starts off pretty meh, but it has some really interesting ideas and some interesting implementations of said ideas. Starts with a top level cultivator trying to ascend to the next realm, but getting smited down by angry upper realm cultivators into a much lower realm with almost no qi. I'd recommend it just to check out. I was interested enough to read up to the latest chapter. It's on hiatus now though.

There's Street Cultivation, which gets recommended here sometimes. It's on Kindle Unlimited I think.
