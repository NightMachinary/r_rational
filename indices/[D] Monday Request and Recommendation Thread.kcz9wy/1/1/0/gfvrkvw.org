I tried Senior Brother, but it's way too heteronormative, explicit in its gender roles, and the comments about the little sister character were kinda blergh. I only tried it for a short while, maybe it gets better or backflips, but I've tried too many stories that play that bullshit straight to various degrees that I didn't think it worth the time to test.
