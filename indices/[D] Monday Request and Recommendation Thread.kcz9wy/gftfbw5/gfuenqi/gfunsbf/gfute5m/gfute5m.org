Yeah, it's definitely only rational in a vacuum. Even in his next appearance in Thor 3, he's teleporting and creating matter willy-nilly, both of which would have solved problems in his standalone movie, and don't even get me started on his appearance in Infinity War and Endgame.

If you consider the movie as its own entity though (which fair enough if you don't or can't), I'd maintain that it meets a lot of the criteria for rational fiction.
