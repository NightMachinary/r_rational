I check out the trending stories of RoyalRoad pretty frequently to find new stories to read. From the past few weeks these are the one's I've found to be decent or enjoyable:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch][RE: Monarch]] - A time-loop story in the vein of re:zero/MoL. It's not very far in so far, but it's decently written with a character who has to struggle through his problems. An aspect I liked about the story is that the main character is reflective on how he approached life and learning. MC also isn't the smartest/strongest character in the series, with the author stating that "a theme of this story is that power comes slowly and often at great cost" . Definitely seems like it will go more towards the tragedy side of a time-loop with a moving save-point he has no control over. I'm really enjoying it so far and would recommend it.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run][The Perfect Run]] - Another time-loop story, almost completely the opposite of the first. By the same author as "Never Die Twice" and "Vainqueur the Dragon", and definitely not rational. It's a bit quirky/zany in the beginning, but I found it easier to stomach once you realize the character has gone insane from the time-loop, and has regards for consequences of his actions. It's a more fun story, with an interesting world and powers, definitely not for everyone. The author is 3/3 for completing his last books, so you can have some faith it will be finished.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37934/sexy-space-babes][Sexy Space Babes]] - This is erotica. With such a ridiculous name, yet still good reviews, I decided to actually read it. I'm not sure of its literary merit, but I thought it worth mentioning as it has gender-stereotypes reversed for aliens, and starts with a male protagonist that thinks of this as a "good thing". It starts to slowly slide off into sexual harassment, concern about sexual assault, and a shift in attitude to how the main-character approaches sex (kinda). I guess if you're going to read erotica at least it has some social commentary in it, light as it is.
