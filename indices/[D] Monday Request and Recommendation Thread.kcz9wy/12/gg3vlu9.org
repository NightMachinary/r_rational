Tower of Somnus just released the first few chapters of Book 2, so that's on the menu again. (Book 1 was a NaNo project.) It's an extremely Shadowrun With The Serial Numbers Filed Off corporate dystopia, but actually well-thought-out, plus an alien-sponsored VR-MMO. (The aliens took one look at humanity and went HAHA NOPE QUARANTINE THIS SHIT, more or less.)
