I want to second the Shadow of Angmar; Harry makes pretty good choices, works with limited information, experiments with the environment he's in, and so on.

On top of that, the world building works well with what Tolkien had and the quality is good. It really feels epic, in that slow, wondrous way that the original LOTR had.
