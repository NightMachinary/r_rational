[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/199001-the-masquerade][/The Masquerade/ series]] by Seth Dickinson (fantasy, sort of) and [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/166200-terra-ignota][the /Terra Ignota/ series]] by Ada Palmer (sci-fi). Both have exactly what you're asking for, and focus on it front and centre. They're also very well-written, clever, and original.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33852053-gnomon][/Gnomon/]] by Nick Harkaway, a sci-fi novel, also fits, and is, too, excellent. Be warned, though, it's also a metafictional mind-screw.

*Edit:* I also recommend [[https://qntm.org/ra][/Ra/]], a hard sci-fi urban fantasy, and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/#post-20503664][/El-Ahrairah/]], a /Worm/ AU fanfiction that focuses on Cauldron (note: /El-Ahrairah/ is unfinished).
