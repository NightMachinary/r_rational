One of my favorites. Would love to see this setting seriously expanded on.

I think somehow when I first read it iI hadn't realized who the author was (early days of my reading WtC maybe so I didn't immediately recognize the author name?) and I never rally internalized that, so it still surprises me every time I see who it's by, and gives me hope that maybe some day after infinitely more WtC there might be more. (And naysayers, I refuse to acknowledge I live in a world where there could ever not be more WtC to look forward to).
