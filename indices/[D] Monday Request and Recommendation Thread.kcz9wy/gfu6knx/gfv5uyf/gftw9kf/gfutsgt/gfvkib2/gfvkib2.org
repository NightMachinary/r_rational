Season 2 of [[https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/hilda][Hilda]] just dropped today on netflix. I recommended season 1 here before as a prime example of wit and charm and wonder and whimsy put to clever storytelling and great worldbuilding. Season 2 seems equally good so far. Recommended for adults and kids.
