I recently read the Cradle series and the first couple of books of the "Thousand Li" series. I'm interested in trying more xianxia, so I'm looking for recommendations. Requirements:

- Above all, a good translation. Ideally the writing would flow similarly to a novel originally written in English.\\
- A rational setting isn't required, but the protagonist shouldn't make too many Idiot Ball decisions. I'm okay with a story that doesn't hold up when looking at the background details like the world's economy, as long as the foreground makes sense.\\
- Tropes are fine, since I don't have a lot of xianxia experience. I'd be perfectly happy with a relatively generic story that's executed well.\\
- Complete is not required but would be a bonus.
