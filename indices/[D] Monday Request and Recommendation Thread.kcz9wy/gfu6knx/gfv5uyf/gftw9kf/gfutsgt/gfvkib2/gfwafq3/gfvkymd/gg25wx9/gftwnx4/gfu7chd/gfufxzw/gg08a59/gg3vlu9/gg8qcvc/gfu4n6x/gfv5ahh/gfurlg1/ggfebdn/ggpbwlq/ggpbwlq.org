No, it's an apocalypse scenario by way of a system. The world ends because aliens, gods, fate, or an ineffable force institute an RPG-like system, typically with monsters, levels, and so on. Frequently, but not always, geography is also messed up, either earth is jumbled with aliens worlds or humans are moved to another dimension. In this case, the plot is that all humans are given a choice of tutorial difficult, transported to a small test dimension, and must survive before returning to a changed world.
