/Evolution Man, or How I Ate My Father/ by Roy Lewis is a 1960 novel about a family of cavemen during the Pleistocene. They're led by a genius and extremely self-aware (as in, breaking-the-fourth-wall, actually-knows-the-names-of-geological-eras self aware) man who has a great knack for revolutionary inventions that will define the future of humanity. They invent, among the other things, fire, cooking, and marriage. It's a really funny novel that I'd say has also some elements of rationality - not in the sense of it being realistic (as I said above, comedy trumps all realism in it), but in the sense of representing in a humorous and condensed way the kind of mechanisms that could indeed have driven our early ancestors when laying the foundations for our culture. That said, it's still based on a 1960 understanding of anthropology and paleontology (such as the very notion of prehistoric men living in caves...), so expect it to be a bit dated in terms of its science.
