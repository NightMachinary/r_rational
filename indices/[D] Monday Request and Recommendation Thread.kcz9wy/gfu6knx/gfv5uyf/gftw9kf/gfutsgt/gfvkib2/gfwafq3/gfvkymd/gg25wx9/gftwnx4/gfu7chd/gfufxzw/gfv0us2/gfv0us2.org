I think [[https://pithserial.com/][Pith]] matches most of your criteria. To wit:

It's very Worm-y in tone, set in 1930s (or thereabout) magical Britain-equivalent.

Superpowers come from magical ability, with magic newly exposed to the wider world. Magical power varies widely across mages and every mage gets one initial and unique ability (so that's pretty Worm-y) but can learn more.

As for wars, the great war against the genocidal China-equivalent got won about a decade ago by magically expunging their whole culture from reality, leaving it a failed state.

In the Britain-equivalent, poverty is high, crime is high, social stratification is high and they are out of colonies.

The stars are long gone, the world is flooded, a revolution might be brewing and the water is ever rising. It's quite a Worm-y feeling.
