Yeah definitely. I honestly wasn't a huge fan of it but it wasn't terrible, I guess just not my taste.

I wasn't hung up about the point investment at the very beginning, seemed reasonable-ish, but I think some people blame all of his weird choices on being high and I'm like... No. Was just one choice lol.

I'm not one to say "x book should be/do y" but I almost wish he had been high for longer than just doing one thing, ie he is high and thinks the faeries and stuff are just part of his trip. 🤷‍♂️

I'm glad macro is doing well with the book though, despite everything I've said 😅
