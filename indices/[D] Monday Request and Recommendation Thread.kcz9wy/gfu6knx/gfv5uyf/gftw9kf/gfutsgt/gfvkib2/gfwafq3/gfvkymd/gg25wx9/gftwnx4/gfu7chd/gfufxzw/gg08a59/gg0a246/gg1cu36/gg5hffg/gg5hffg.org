Ar'kendrithyst is 50% slice of life and 50% action fantasy. There are big fantastical events that happen, but the author also shows the downtime between those events, and the characters just having fun or going about their daily lives. It's somewhat controversial on this site, but if you can get past the protagonist's personality, I found it very enjoyable.
