I'm currently completing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering, having taken Laser technology as one of my specializations. I don't think I have a chance to compete in that game. Just the description of all the details you have to take into account when designing your ships...

  PHYSICALLY ACCURATE MATERIAL PROPERTIES - All materials, chemical reactions, and spectra are physically correct. When your arclamp pumps your solid state laser, the pumping bands need to match up with the actual emission spectra of your excitation gas. When the photon absorption of a material is needed, it is derived from actual refractive index spectra data.
