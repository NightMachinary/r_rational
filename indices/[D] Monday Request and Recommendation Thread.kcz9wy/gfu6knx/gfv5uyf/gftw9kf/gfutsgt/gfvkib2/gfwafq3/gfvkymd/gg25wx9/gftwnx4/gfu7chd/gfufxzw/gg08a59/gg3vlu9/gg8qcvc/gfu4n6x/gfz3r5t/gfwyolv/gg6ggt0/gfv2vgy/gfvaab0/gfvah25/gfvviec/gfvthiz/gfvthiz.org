[[http://nmg.thecomicseries.com][Never Mind the Gap]]- character-driven, somewhat slice-of-life about humans and androids coexisting in a small town. Fairly realistic depiction of AI (though no singularity takeoff). More importantly, the characters are compellingly written and rational.

Much more well-known classics, to the point I would normally assume anyone asking had already read them: [[https://xkcd.com]], [[https://www.smbc-comics.com]]. Both are very-long-running, regularly updated one-offs that can be read in any order, focusing on science and philosophy humor.
