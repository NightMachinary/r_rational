I'm looking for stories with a big focus on gaining wisdom, or better, having wise protagonists. The closest examples I can think of are God of Eyes and Humble Life of a Skill Trainer. The protagonists aren't the most powerful, or even all that rational. But I really liked their drive to understand and empathize.
