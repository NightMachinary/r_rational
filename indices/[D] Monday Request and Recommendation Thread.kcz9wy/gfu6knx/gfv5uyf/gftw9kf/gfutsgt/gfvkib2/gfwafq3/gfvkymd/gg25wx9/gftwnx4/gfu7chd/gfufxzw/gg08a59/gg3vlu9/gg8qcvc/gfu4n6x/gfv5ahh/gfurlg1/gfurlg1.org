I enjoyed it a lot. The start is a bit irrational in the build choice, although everything else the character does is quite rational. He wears armor, plans his approach, gathers information etc.

​

It's really good, the setup for his build was a bit too forced, he's in a dangerous place without any information and chooses to raise a stat he doesn't know anything about that will provide him with as far as he knows no benefits but he still does it. A rational person would either add to it gradually or at least try to get some information on it first but other than that it's very good progression fantasy.

​

I like the author, all he needs to do is not write harem stuff like he did in his other stories and most people will enjoy them, who knew.. I want to recommend Wake of the Ravager to my irl friends, but with that cover and that start it just can't be done.
