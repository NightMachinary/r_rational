Perilous Waif is gleeful sci-fi fun, with a well-done setting and a naive but capable protagonist.

The author actually tries to work out a halfway sensible far-future setting that still has human conflict. He comes a lot closer than most recent books to the sacred triple of "futuristic /and/ realistic /and/ relatable."

It's a lot less suffused with violence and sex than the author's other books; it's also a lot more upbeat in tone.

Interplanetary stowaways, cybernetic upgrades, legendary derelict navies floating in the interstellar dark, AIs contemplating the right of humankind to continued existence - there's a lot of space opera fun here.

The MC definitely has more power than ideal for maximum tension. The interest is "how will she handle this?", not "can she survive this?"

I think it's a fun romp, especially if you crave books that take their far-future settings halfway seriously.
