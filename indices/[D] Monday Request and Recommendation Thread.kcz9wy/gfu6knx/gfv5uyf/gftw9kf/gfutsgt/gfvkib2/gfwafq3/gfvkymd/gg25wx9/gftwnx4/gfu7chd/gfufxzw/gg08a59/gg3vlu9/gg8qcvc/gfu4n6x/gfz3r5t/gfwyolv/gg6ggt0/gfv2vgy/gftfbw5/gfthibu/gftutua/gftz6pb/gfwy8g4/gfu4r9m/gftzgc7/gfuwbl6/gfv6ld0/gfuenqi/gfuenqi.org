I would argue that Marvel's /Dr. Strange/ is decently rational, especially for a summer blockbuster type movie. I mean, it features a protagonist engaging in independent study to better understand the rules of a magic system they're exploiting.

Although it suffers from telling not showing a lot of the time, it has a cast of competent characters who all pursue their own ends fairly reasonably, and while some of them make choices driven by emotion, none of them ever really hold the idiot ball that I can recall.
