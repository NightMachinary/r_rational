  Yes, the game is buggy as hell. Yes, there are legitimate complaints about game systems and questlines

The things that make that recommendation controversial (at least that I was aware of) were more, uh, ethical/moral. Mostly that CDPR crunched the hell out of their employees, and also that it fucked up anything gender-related in the fetishistic directions in both their marketing and their actual in-game implementations/representation. Neither of which ought to be encouraged with wallet-voting.

Fair warning that I've not personally extensively researched either of those claims myself, but what I saw seemed pretty convincing, especially on the crunch front.
