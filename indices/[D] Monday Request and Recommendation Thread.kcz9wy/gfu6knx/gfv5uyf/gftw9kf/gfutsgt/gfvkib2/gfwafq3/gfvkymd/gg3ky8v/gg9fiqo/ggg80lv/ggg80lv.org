/The Wandering Inn/ has this in spades, I would say. It is known for its large cast of characters, all of whom are highly fleshed out and develop. Characters whose arcs involve gaining wisdom, cleverness, and empathy include Erin (the main protagonist), Ryoka, Yvlon, Pisces (my favorite character), Geneva and her crew, the Antinium as a species and Yellow Splatters in particular, and Rags.

The story is very long and the first book is the weakest. If you are willing to commit to it, push until the end of the second book before deciding whether to continue.
