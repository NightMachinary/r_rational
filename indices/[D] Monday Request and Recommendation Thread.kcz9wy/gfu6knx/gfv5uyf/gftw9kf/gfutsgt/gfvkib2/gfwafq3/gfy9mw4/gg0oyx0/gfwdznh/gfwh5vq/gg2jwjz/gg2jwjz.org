  For the crunch thing, as it's external to the work, I wouldn't consider it's impact on whether or not to recommend the game.

Well, from a purely utilitarian perspective, that is /exactly/ the kind of thing you consider. By buying the product you encourage the practice, because you help make it pay off. If you universalise your behaviour, "everyone refuses to buy games produced with crunch" would be a surefire way to end crunch forever. It only exists because many either don't care, or can't resist the temptation of the pleasure the game gives to them for the sake of a greater collective utility.
