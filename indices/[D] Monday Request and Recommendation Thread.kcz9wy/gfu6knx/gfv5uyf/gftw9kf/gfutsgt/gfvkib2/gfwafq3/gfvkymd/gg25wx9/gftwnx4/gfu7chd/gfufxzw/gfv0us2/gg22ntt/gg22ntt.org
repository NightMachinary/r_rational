Not rational as such, but the Wild Cards series has a great premise and many interesting characters. Basically aliens drop a virus over New York that kills 90%, makes 9% "jokers" (deformed in various ways, sometimes with abilities), and makes 1% "aces" (some sort of powers without the primary downside). There are something like 30 books in the canon now and new ones are still being produced.
