I'd recommend Schlock Mercenary, if you can stomach the art at the beginning. That part gets a lot better.

What starts out good, and stays good is: There's no status quo. It literally starts off with one of the main characters breaking a monopoly on interstellar travel, and all the ripples and changes that come out of that.

Every faction has goals and intelligent characters that do things even when the protagonists aren't visible. It's also complete!

Be warned that it literally ran daily for fifteen years, there's a lot to read.
