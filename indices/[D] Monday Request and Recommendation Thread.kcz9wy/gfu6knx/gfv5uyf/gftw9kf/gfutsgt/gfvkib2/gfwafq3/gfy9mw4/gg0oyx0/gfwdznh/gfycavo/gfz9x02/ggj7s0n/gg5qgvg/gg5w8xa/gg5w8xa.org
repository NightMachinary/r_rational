I also enjoyed these newer big-budget-production games (but you want to get them on sales): /Prey/ (2017), /Titanfall 2/, /Doom/ (2016).

/Black Mesa/ (Half Life 1 remake) is cheap and the original segment came out in 2014. /Metro/ 1 & 2 were nice.

Those are just some spectacle-y FPS-y games I liked. There will be lots in other categories. What are you looking for?
