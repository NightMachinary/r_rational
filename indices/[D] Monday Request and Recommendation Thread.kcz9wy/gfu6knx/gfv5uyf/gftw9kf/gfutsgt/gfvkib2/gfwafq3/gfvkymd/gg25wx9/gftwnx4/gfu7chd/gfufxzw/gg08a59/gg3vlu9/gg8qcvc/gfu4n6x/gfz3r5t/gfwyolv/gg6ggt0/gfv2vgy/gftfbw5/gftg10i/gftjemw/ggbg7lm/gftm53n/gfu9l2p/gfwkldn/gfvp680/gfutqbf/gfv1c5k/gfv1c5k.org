Just started reading this, and I'm enjoying it so far. I ran into a bit of an unexpected snag though, when I tried finding a map to refresh my memory of the series. Apparently getting a decent-resolution copy of the official Westeros/Essos map (that you can read the city lables on) requires buying the official atlas for $40. I don't think I spent that much on the first five books combined!

That paywall seems a little... unreasonable?

Edit: I found a fan-made map that seems to be pretty accurate, compared to the official one. It's not as pretty, but it's a whole lot more readable. [[https://atlasoficeandfireblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/asoiaf-known-world-new-mountains.png]]

Story is still pretty great. Joff appears to have finally come out the other end of the madness tunnel, and Captain Nakaro seems pretty legit.
