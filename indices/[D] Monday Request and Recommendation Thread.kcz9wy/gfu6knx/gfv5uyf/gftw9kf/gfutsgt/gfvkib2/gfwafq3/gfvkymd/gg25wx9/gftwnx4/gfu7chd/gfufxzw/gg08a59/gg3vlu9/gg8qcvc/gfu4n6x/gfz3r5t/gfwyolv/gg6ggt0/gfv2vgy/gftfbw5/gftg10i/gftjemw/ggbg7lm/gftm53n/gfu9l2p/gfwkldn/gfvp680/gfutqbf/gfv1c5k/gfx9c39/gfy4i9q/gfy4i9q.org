If you aren't interested in reading the rest of the canon books, it would be worth reading a wikipedia level plot summary of them. It does help to have the background.

It's an AU. 98% of the facts presented in canon are preserved, except for a few crucial details. And there's a lot of filled in details when the story goes places that are only barely mentioned in canon. The biggest difference is that it's a time loop so the actual story progression happens over and over again, sometimes fairly close to canon and sometimes dramatically different.
