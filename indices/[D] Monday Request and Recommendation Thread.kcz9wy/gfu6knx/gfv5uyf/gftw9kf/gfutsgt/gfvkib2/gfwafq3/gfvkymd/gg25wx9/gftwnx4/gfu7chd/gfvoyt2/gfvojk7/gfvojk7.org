Zachtronics Games are about as rational as you can get before you start programming in python.

Factorio too.

Disco Elysium might be right up your alley. You can be as rational or irrational as you choose, with benefits and drawbacks to both. It's part arthouse, part detective mystery, part existential philosophy, and part a critique of modern society... depending on your build. Yeah it's some wild stuff.

Outer Wilds maybe.

Noita is another roguelike with a big focus on learning the lore and interactions of elements within the game. If you've ever played powder game, a flash particle simulator from the days of miniclip, it's like that but with procedurally generated worlds and much more interaction and explosions.
