Hi, I'm looking for some progression fantasy. It doesn't have to be 100% rational but I would prefer if it doesn't have any idiot ball or any I'm evil just 'cause type of character. And nothing with less than 300.000 words or 1 published book. Pls assume I already know WtC, all of wildbow's fictions, or the other works that are recommended every thread. Thx.
