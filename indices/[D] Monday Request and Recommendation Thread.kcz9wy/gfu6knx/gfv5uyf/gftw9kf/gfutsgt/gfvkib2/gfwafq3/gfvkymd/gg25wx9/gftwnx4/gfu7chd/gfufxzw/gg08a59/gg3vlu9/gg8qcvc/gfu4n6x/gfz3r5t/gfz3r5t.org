Has anyone here ever tried playing [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/][5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel]]? If you've ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], this is basically exactly the kind of version of chess you'd train on if you were a general preparing to fight that sort of temporal war. It's a pretty baffling game because even if you're decent at chess it makes you feel completely inadequate - I doubt any human could fully master the entirety of its state space (the AI doesn't appear very good at it either). Small note, though, the "5D" in the title is effectively a bit misleading - the game is "only" four dimensional, as you have the two standard dimensions of the chessboard, time, and parallel timelines. Still. Really fun stuff!
