No, that's not the thing. Dr. Stone isn't realistic, but the reason isn't that the scientific principles themselves are ever wrong - there's an actual consultant for that stuff. The unrealistic part is how much labour they can pack in very little time, often without concern for other side tasks that would still have to be performed, and how good the stuff they build with very crude means ends up being. It fails (or rather, it purposefully ignores) economics, not science: there is a reason why hunter-gatherer or barely agricultural society don't have complex industrial machinery nor any drive to build them, and it's not just that they lack the basic principles, it's that they don't have the food surplus to even spare the time to make that stuff. Basically, most of the people in the village would starve to death (especially in winter) because they spent time helping Senku build his contraptions instead of gathering food.

That said, the manga's objective is obviously to be a fun adventure romp with a lot of informative bits about physics, chemistry and engineering, and an earnest love for science and its more human side. I would be plenty willing to forgive its faults just based on it being the rare representation of the scientific mindset as something not opposed to humanity and empathy, but complementary to it. There's a lot of great moments focused around how science can help people realise themselves or overcome their limits, and Senku, while being a bit of a loner, is also plenty appreciative of the worth of other people and knows how to be a team leader - even with his ridiculous skills, he's not just the lone genius carrying the whole narrative, there's a lot of contributions from everyone else too.
