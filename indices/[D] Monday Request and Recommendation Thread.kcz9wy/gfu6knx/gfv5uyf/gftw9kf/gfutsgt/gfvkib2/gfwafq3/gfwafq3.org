This is going to be controversial, but I'm going to recommend Cyberpunk 2077.

Yes, the game is buggy as hell. Yes, there are legitimate complaints about game systems and questlines. But it's absolutely gorgeous (even on my decrepit gaming laptop (GTX970M/intel i7 4720HQ)), has engaging characters, has phenomenal music, and touches and (and to a limited extent, explores) transhumanist concepts of interest to the [[/r/rational]] community (though I was a little confused by their indirect anti-immortality stance, even though so much of the game is about fighting death.)

I had a solid 30 hrs of fun getting through the main story and a number of the sidequests, and expect at least another 5-10 even before any DLC/updates come out. Well worth it for my money, and once they start issuing discounts the deal will get even better.
