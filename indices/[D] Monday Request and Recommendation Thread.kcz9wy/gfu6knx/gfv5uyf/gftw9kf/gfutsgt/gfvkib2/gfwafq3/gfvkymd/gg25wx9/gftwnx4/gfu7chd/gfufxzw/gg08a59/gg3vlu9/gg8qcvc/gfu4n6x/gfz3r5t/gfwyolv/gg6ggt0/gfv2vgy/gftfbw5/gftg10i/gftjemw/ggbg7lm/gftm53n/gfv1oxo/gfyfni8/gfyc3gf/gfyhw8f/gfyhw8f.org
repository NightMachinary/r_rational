Uh, maybe give a bit more detail?

What did you like about it? What would you expect other readers of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] to like about it? Maybe what other works is it comparable to?

On that last note, how would you compare it to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] (the author's perhaps most well known work)?

Also, I just read in a reader review that apparently the protagonist effortlessly wins everything. How accurate is that?
