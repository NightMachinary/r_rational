Anything that has someone with godlike power sacrifice that power for a moral end would be satisfying. The challenge would be the initial character development with a godlike being who cares for people who have less power.

Most fight scenes are like this. E.g. a HighWizard -like figure defending younglings, expending power as he does, until he's empty of power or dead.

Spoiler suggestion of a novel that has a bellcurve of progression and regression that favours more regression than does the epilogue of Worm: >! Wizard of Earthsea has this in later books !<
