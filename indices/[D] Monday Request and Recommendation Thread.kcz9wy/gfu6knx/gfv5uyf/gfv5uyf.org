This is gonna be a very niche request, but is there a xianxia where the protagonist actually acts as if he's in a world where offending/fighting the wrong person means death?

Meaning they avoid confrontation, try their hardest to fly under everyone's radar, obsessively take precautions, only take fights when they are almost certain that nothing can go wrong, run from wars and mainly build their power through safe methods and by outlasting reckless cultivators.

So far the closest I've gotten are protagonists that nominally admit how stupid drawing attention is, and then end up being the center of attention anyways. So, are there any stories where the MC is actually averse to risk?
