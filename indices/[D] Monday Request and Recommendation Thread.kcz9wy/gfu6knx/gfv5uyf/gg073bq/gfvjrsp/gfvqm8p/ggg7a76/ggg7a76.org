I strongly de-recommend Warlock of the Magus World. It talks about "particles" and "radiation" and "energy" but the magic system isn't hard or scientific at all; it's just science as attire. The protagonist is intolerable and even though he is competent, the AI chip in his head (which he got by pure never-explained coincidence) makes the majority of his power once he hits a decent level of cultivation. The first arc is good and the Purgatory World arc is also good, but overall I wouldn't recommend it. The only strength it has is its scheming; the good arcs are the ones where the scheming is the most frequent and important.
