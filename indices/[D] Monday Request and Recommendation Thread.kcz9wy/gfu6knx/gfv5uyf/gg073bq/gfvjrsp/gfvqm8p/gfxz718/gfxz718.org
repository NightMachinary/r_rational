I just started reading A Will Eternal by Er Gen, and it seems to be what you're asking for; The MC's goal is to live forever, and he is avoiding fights and practicing cultivation. I don't know if this will keep up, but worth a try.

Update: I dropped it. The MC will eventually take absurd risks for people who are essentially hostile acquaintances. The MC also progresses absurdly better than others, with pretty much no explanation given; I have already read (partially) RG, ISSTH, POT by Er Gen, and they were all much better plotwise. AWE is not bad in humor though.
