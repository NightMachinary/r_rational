Heart of Cultivation fits your criteria, though not only is it still quite short and in progress, most of the chapters have been bundled into an e-book. The MC is quite weak, and is constantly flattering cultivators, "giving them face," etc. There's lots of danger still, but the author tries very hard to justify it as "sane person put through trying events."
