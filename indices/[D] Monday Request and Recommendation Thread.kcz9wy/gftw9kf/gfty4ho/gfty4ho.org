Have you read The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Shea and Wilson?

It's a great novel but is extremely unique in style and presentation; the book jumps from character to character and across years /in the middle of paragraphs/, and the story is told in a highly disjointed, nonlinear way. It's very enmeshed in 60's/70's counterculture.
