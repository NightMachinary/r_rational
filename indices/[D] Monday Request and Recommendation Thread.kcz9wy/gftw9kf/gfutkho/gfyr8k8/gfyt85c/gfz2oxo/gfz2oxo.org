Hey, there's always Armin!

I wouldn't call Attack on Titan rational, but mostly for other reasons, mainly:\\
- the 3DMG is cool and all, but there's no fucking way it's the most practical or feasible way to fight Titans, especially for a society that seems otherwise stuck somewhere around the Renaissance, technology wise;\\
- also, while the Titan shifters are certainly a huge threat, it's hard to believe that giant, slow, lumbering idiot Titans, stupider than most animals, could be that much trouble for humans with weapons and horses, even if they're hard to kill;\\
- lots of informed ability, very little shown in the way of it. No, you will not convince me that Erwin casualty-rates-of-90% Smith is a "good commander" just by having multiple characters saying so;\\
- way too many rules about how Titans work (especially in the last arc of the manga) that seem contrived and are suspiciously plot convenient, being revealed just at the right time.

It's still a really good manga, but it's not perfect writing and works more at a level of political/philosophical themes than as a fully believable fictional world with a unique magic phenomenon.
