Twig and Pact by the same guy have similar themes, although Twig moreso than pact. I really liked Twig's big reveal.

If you're okay with not too rational guns blazing action fanfiction, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon][Man off the Moon]] has Nameless (basically Shirou) from fate grand order getting up to shenanigans in Mass Effect. One of the best and most fun ME stories I've read. There are big secret organizations, big secret ancient civilizations, big secret technological revolutions, and best of all, some great "Don't trust anyone, not even yourself" moments.
