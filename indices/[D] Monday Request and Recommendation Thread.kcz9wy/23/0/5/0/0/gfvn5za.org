Adding onto what he said. There is a lot of development within like 5-7 chapters after the prologue. Joffrey is literally broken down and rebuilt again and again until he comes out the other end more sane than he started. It's not as cheesy as it sounds, and I found it very satisfying seeing his development into someone you can actually root for. If you don't like it after chapter 10, the story is probably not for you.
