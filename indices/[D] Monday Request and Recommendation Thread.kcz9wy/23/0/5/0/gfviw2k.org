There isn't one. Unless something drastically changes where the story is now, the prologue is non-canon for the story. There's incidents kinda like that, but by the time it gets that far the background plot is a lot more present in the story and that scene itself wouldn't make sense.

If you can't stand time loop stories, this one probably isn't for you. It might be worth sticking it out till like chapter 15, the loop structure doesn't change much, but Joffrey as a character does a lot. And most of the loops after that are much longer than a month or two. Some are like 20 years.
