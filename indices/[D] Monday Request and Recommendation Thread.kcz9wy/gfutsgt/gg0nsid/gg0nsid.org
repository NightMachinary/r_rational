I think it would have to be a balance between a regression in most sectors, for a progression in some others. Tuesdays With Morrie maybe? As the story progresses, Morrie's physical and finally, mental state regresses visibly. This is offset by the lessons he continues to teach to Albom up until the end.

Though it's not really a /fantasy/.
