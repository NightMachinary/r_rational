A Mortals Journey to Immortality is about a guy with average cultivation talent, trying to lay low and stay off the radar. Although he takes some risks as he gets a higher cultivation level, he avoids pointless conflict and picks his battles.

My Senior Brother is Too Steady is about a guy who is extremely paranoid and wise to the xianxia tropes. Whenever he acts, he hides his true capabilities and identity, uses remote controlled disposable clones and makes backup plans for his backup plans. If he didn't get dragged into matters due to pure chance, he would be perfectly content sitting in his mountain cave for countless millennia cultivating.
