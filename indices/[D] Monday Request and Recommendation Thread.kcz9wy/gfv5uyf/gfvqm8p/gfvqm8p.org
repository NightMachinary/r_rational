Warlock of the Magus World does this, though it has some other fairly serious issues (evil protagonist, some really messed up stuff far into it) that make it a shakier recommendation. My Senior Brother is Too Steady is supposed to be premised on this, but I found it uninteresting for other reasons. The protagonist of Lord of the Mysteries does a moderately decent job at this, doing things like maintaining multiple identities and doing divinations every time he takes a serious action.
