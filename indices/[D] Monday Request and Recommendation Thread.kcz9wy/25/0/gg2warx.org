Harem is a stupid, overly vague term already. It can refer to a guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks as in most "harem" anime, or straight up polygamy, or a guy owning women as slaves, or just a promiscuous guy in non-exclusive relationships, and a bunch of other such scenarios. I'm not a prude by any means but I fucking hate harem in any fic because I know it'll mean stupid characterization, clumsy misogyny and bad writing.
