I just finished it. I really appreciate how the story subverts the "adventure kid" trope a bit by giving the protagonist actual interpersonal and behavioral consequences.

Hilda's self-reliance and unchecked confidence leads to to her becoming increasingly arrogant and reckless, and incurs actual costs on her relationships. She becomes dismissive of authority, which negatively affects her relationship with her mother, despite very lenient and hands-off parenting. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't actually fail more starkly as a result of her flaws and that way incur some character growth(her mom getting hurt in the last episode, for example), but it is a kid's show after all, so it's fine.

I look forward to the next season.
