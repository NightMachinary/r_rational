  he's teleporting and creating matter willy-nilly, both of which would have solved problems in his standalone movie

You could argue he learned those skills in between the two movies, so that's not necessarily a problem. Infinity War and Endgame though are kinda inexcusable if you want to be rational, also because it's unclear how is Thanos not already fundamentally invincible when he has the Space Stone. That's enough to one shot anyone, just teleport them in the fucking interstellar vacuum.
