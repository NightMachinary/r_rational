Not really mainstream or entirely rational, but I recently watched this movie and was surprised at the fairly rational approach to munchining a portal to parallel realities where there's some time dilation when traveling between them. For example,it turns out that 1 hour in the parallel reality equates to 1 minute in ours (I don't remember the exact ratio) so they head into the alt-reality with their laptops to finish an app they'd been working on before an impossible deadline. They even try to munching the lottery.
