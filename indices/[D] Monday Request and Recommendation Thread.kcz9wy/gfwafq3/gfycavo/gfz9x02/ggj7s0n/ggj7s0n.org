  It's statistically highly unlikely that it's "the best" in any objective non-contrived sense.

That kind of ignores that hardware and software has advanced over time. I don't think you can say, at least, that on high end hardware and the highest graphical settings, that it isn't among the top games out there for graphical quality. From what I've seen, it is indeed the best for graphics, though I haven't seen every game out there.

The other elements individually don't stand out, but as a whole package the sheer amount of stuff and quality of it as a whole does put it as the best RPG for me.

The thing it does very well that other games don't is that it is set up to be very immersive. The ray traced lighting helps A LOT with the feel of the environment, the character animations are all very high quality. But there's also another angle - the cyberpunk aesthetic aligns incredibly well with typical "videogamey" elements like UI overlays, crosshairs, scanning things for info, even upgrading items (mods/cyberware). Things like calling your vehicle, fast travel points, even down to enemies mostly becoming aware of you at the same time if one detects you (or a camera does), all the elements make sense diegetically. So a combination of very well done environments, lighting, and characters as well as thematically well integrated gameplay elements does a great job of pulling you in to engage with the story - arguably the best part of the game.
