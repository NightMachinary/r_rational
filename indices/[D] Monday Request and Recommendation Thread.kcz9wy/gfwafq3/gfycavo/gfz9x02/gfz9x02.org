We've had tens of thousands of games over the years (hundreds of thousands, if you include mobile stuff). It's statistically highly unlikely that it's "the best" in any objective non-contrived sense.

Personally, I will probably get it in like 5 years from now, when it's patched, cheap and running at 60 frames/s on my laptop.
