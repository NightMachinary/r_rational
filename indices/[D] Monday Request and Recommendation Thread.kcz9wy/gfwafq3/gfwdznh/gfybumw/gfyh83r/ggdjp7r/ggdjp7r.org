Late reply on this, but Cyberpunk gender is decided by the voice you pick. I believe this is for voice acting timing reasons, given that >90% of players would be aligning the two, and not having that would require yet more work, which CDPR doesn't exactly have time for.

A lot of the controversy on gender issues in the game seems to be stemming from ignorance of the game and knee-jerk reactions, rather than legitimate criticisms, imo.
