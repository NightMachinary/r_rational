For the crunch thing, as it's external to the work, I wouldn't consider it's impact on whether or not to recommend the game. If you feel like you can't financially support cd projeckt red due to it, I would suggest just pirating the game. It's DRM free, after all.

As for the sex/gender stuff, I essentially ignored all the marketing and went in blind (and not specifically looking for it.) I wouldn't say there are no problems to be found with their representation, but I would say that I personally did not find any problems: the treatment of sex and gender in cyberpunk seemed relatively in line with what I'd expect from a cyberpunk dystopia with omnipresent body modification; it didn't take me out of the world, at least. In fact, the deliberate hypersexualization of literally everything played firectly into the game's lore pretty well.
