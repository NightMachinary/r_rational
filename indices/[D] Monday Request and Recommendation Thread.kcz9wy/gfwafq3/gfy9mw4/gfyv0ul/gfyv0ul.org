I got a bunch of graphical glitches, got stuck a few times, and blindly walked into an elevator shaft and couldn't get out after an elevator failed to appear.

Honestly, it wasn't so bad. The bugs weren't immersion breaking when I realized I could pretend they were just part of the relic malfunctions lol.
