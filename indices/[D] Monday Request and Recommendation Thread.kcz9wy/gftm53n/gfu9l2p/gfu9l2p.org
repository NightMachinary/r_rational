I highly recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]], an ASOIAF timeloop fic. It's not a gamer fic, so there's no levels or points, but there's a very real sense of progress over time as the main character goes from, well, Joffrey, to an actual legendary hero.

Plus it's 740k words and very well written.
