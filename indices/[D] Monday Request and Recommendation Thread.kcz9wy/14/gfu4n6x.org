[[https://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Generic-System-Macronomicon-ebook/dp/B08PW28MKC/ref=zg_bsnr_7538386011_10?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=3TPW11QVQRC13ACNCWDV][Apocalypse: Generic System]] by Macronomicon has been completed and released as a Kindle book. I thought it was consistently strong and the ending was a good balance of being self-contained and leaving some room for a sequel or sequels. The author would be well served to contain his other works a bit more as he did with this one.
