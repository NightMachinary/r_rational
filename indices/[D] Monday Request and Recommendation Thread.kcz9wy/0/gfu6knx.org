These threads have given me so many fun recommendations during this slow lockdown year, I figure it's time to throw some recc's back.

Shadow of Angmar, a Harry Potter - Lord of the Rings crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]

Rather than returning from King's Cross to the final battle with Voldemort, Harry is summoned across the worlds by the Witch-King of Angmar during the fall of Fornost, a little over a thousand years before the War of the Ring. The Witch-King thought he was summoning Morgoth. He is... displeased.

After being freed following the fall of Angmar, Harry travels across Middle-Earth, trying to understand this strange world he's wound up in, adjust to using his magic without a wand, and above all, find somebody who can help him find his way home.

/The Beast of Beacon/ , a RWBY fanfiction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13504249/1/The-Beast-of-Beacon]]

It is set in an alternate timeline in which Adam Taurus decided to follow Blake after her departure from the White Fang and join Beacon Academy himself. Throughout the story he attempts to fit into an unfamiliar environment in hopes of reconciling with his former partner.

I think the character of Adam , the abusive undertones of his relationship with Blake, and the portrayal of Faunus and racism are better presented here than in the show. And don't worry, this is not an Adam/Blake story.
