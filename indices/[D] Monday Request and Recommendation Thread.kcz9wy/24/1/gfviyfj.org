Reverend Insanity is probably the best xianxia out there. Miles better than anything written by both english and chinese authors.

The protagonist is one of the most rational ones I've seen. However he does some pretty awful things in order to accomplish his goals. If you are okay with a Neutral Evil protagonist, I can't recommend it enough.
