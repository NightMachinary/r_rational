I think the characters mostly make internal sense. They're not rational /people/ - Eren in particular is a fucking walking ball of trauma and anger issues - but then again, they're orphaned refugees turned child soldiers in a world in which the enemy is basically giant zombies. I think we can excuse their mental health not being top notch.
