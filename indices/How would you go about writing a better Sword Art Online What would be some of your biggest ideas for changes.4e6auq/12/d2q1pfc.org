SAO gets a lot of flack for "It could have been better". The way I see the anime, it did an excellent job at telling an excellent story in 15 episodes, then ended. (And then I simply ignore everything after the first season of the show.) It was very much character-focused, and did a great job showing the emotional aspects of a death game, and the domestic aspects of what it meant to /live/ there. You have shops, you have schools, you have crime, you have power-hungry leaders, you have old fogies who love to fish, you have romance, and if you're really lucky, maybe something more.

So yes, you could stretch the Aincrad arc into a show spanning several years, and there'd be a lot to explore. Personally, I wish they did too. But as a 15-episode story, that wasn't its purpose, and they did a great job showing something new every episode.
