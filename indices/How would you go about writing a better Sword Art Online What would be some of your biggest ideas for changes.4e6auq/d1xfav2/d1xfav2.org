SAO had a lot of potential, and did a lot of things ... well, I hesitate to say "wrong", because the show was very successful, but not the way I wanted them to be done.

/Personally/ I would have placed the focus on guilds and guild politics, since that's a proxy for people and their interactions with each other, but I was a guildmaster in World of Warcraft so naturally my perception of MMOs centers there (this was back when beating Molten Core was considered impressive). From what I can remember, SAO comes close to ditching the guild concept entirely, and the protagonist does pretty much everything by himself as a lone wolf.

If you want a different progression, the progressions that most MMOs have are:

- Level progression
- Attribute progression
- Skill progression
- Item progression
- Player skill progression (how good the player is at the game)
- Story progression (areas locked until questlines are followed)
- Faction progression

I would probably split the castle up into sections that each have their own requirements. To get to floor 81, you need to have killed the boss of floor 76, acquired a rare pendant that can only be made by crafting from rare ingredients, and be able to make it past that iteration of the Hall of Trials.

The bigger problem with the conceit is that if permadeath is enabled, the optimal strategy is really boring; grind grind grind on enemies that there's no risk against. If there's a 1% chance of death when fighting an enemy, then by the time you've fought ~70 battles there's a 50% chance that you're dead. There are definitely ways to combat that from a mechanical standpoint, but I generally think that risk minimization doesn't make for great stories. (And if the game combats risk minimization, I would expect an enormous attrition rate.)
