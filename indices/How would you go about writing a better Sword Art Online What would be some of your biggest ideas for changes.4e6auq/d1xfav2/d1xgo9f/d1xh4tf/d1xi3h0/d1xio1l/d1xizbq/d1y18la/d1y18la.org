What if you just put a hard cap on the number of players that escape - Faction alignment compared to the leader of the final raid has a major impact, player strength has a minor impact? And no-one knows exactly how many escape - it could be everyone, it could be anyone who isn't an enemy of the winning faction, it could be literally only the members of the raid group that takes down the final boss, it could be only the guy that gets in the finishing blow. Hell, it could be /no one/. But there's a ray of hope, if slim.
