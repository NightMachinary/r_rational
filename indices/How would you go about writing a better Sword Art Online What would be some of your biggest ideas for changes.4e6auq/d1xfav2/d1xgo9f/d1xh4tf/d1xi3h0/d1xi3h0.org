Multiple factions can survive - but only the ones 'allied' with the faction of the player that is raid leading the final boss encounter.

A situation never emerges of all of the factions allying, or all players joining a specific faction, because they aren't rational/trusting enough to do it. One of the factions 'zerg rushes' another in the game's first few hours, causing a lot of bitterness. Racism absolutely becomes a thing, quickly, in the game. Furthermore, I earlier mentioned how there are strong incentive in place for betrayal, since you can steal from other players and switch factions. Players may choose to switch factions purely to isolate or remove themselves from a dangerous enough environment, since they can be stolen from/attacked by members of the same faction. Jails in this game are barely functional, there is no equivalent to a secure federal prison and no higher law enforcement from real life authorites...so the scheming is going to be multi-layered.

Yes, the setting is intended to be pretty darn dark. Not out of intention, but purely because the scenario, carried out to its logical conclusions, demands no less.
