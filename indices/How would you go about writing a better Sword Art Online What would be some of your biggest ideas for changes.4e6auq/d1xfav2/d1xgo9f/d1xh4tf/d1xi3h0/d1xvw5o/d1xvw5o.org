  Jails in this game are barely functional, there is no equivalent to a secure federal prison and no higher law enforcement from real life authorites...so the scheming is going to be multi-layered.

That's not really multi-layered. That's one layer: The only effective method to enforce rules is death. You only have two kinds of 'crimes', ones which are minor enough to be dealt with via slap on the wrist, and capital crimes.

Unless there is some mechanic induced other way to show displeasure, such as a way to shun or remove people involuntarily from a faction, this is going to go the way of post-apocalyptic wasteland politics very quickly.

This actually reminds me of Log Horizon, where the players were collapsing into anarchy because it was impossible to enforce rules, until one group stood up and through manipulation of the game systems forced a set of basic laws to be accepted as they had the power to control access to player housing or bank locations.

Also depends on how private property rights are enforced. Are things in your inventory inviolable? Do they drop when you are killed or knocked unconscious? Can you be stolen from? If there is some leeway here, there may be an option for some other punishment form.
