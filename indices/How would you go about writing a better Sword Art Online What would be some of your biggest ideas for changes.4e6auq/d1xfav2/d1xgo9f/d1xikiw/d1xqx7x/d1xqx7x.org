Guilds throw male prostitutes at female raiders, and female prostitutes at male raiders, but it turns out that for interesting sociological reasons (afk shunning of LGBTQ folk, maybe) the top-class raiders happen to be the people who are most-shunned in real life and therefore play the most games. So now you have a faction of LGBTQ folk, and straight factions, and what if a straight or ace player gets tired of having their only reward be sex? Maybe they try to join the LGBTQ faction. Are they turned away? Are they accepted? Do we get warring factions of Social Justice Warriors and Status Quo Warriors? Do they ally? What happens if an SQW faction allies with an SJW faction?
