An interesting way to reduce the grimdark and increase the scheming is to have a 'blob' mechanic where if you defeat your enemy in a specific way (eg. reduce their hp to 10 points without killing them) you can force them to join your faction. Factions would be rewarded or penalized as a group for their successes and failures. 2 interesting results of this would be that every combat group would have a low power attacker to try to enslave the bosses, and that people would usually stay loyal to their faction because the only way to leave is to come close to death.
