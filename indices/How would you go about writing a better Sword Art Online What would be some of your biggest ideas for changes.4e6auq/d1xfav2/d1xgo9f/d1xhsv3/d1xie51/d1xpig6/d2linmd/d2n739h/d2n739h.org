FDoD is mostly original in its plot, ideas, and especially magic system. Legally speaking, I think original content is the author's IP even in fan fiction, else works like /Fifty Shades of Grey/ would be tainted and thus ineligible for publication as original works. That said, I can't find any information on that specific issue having been before addressed by a legal body.

Ethically speaking, plagiarism is disingenuous and robs creators of recognition for their contribution to world media.
