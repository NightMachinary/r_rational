Yeah, it's more about attributing credit to ideas' originators; we agree on that. From a publishing standpoint it's not quite moot, as FDoD could be made into an original work with but a few tweaks. Treating creative fan fictions as a wild west of ideas free for the taking isn't conducive to incentivizing original FF, in my opinion. Whether FF is worth incentivizing at all is a separate issue.

To clarify my position, I think it good policy to treat authors as owners of their original content. Inspiration for themes, like, "VRMMORPG death game with a focus on politics", I ethically think should be credited, but are not the IP of an author. If they were, cyberpunk would have never become a genre.
