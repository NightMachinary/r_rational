  I absolutely agree that risk minimization and forcing characters into grinding of easier content is a natural consequence of a permadeath penalty. And to an extent, that's fine. In real life, across military history, each active duty combat soldier has been supported by on average 10 support personal, I read that statistic somewhere. In World of Warcraft, cutting edge raiders are only a small minority of the playerbase. But, still, given the permadeath penalty, powerful incentives with a real life impact are needed to get people to play the game as intended, minimizing grinding by elite players.

Have you read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/][My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected]]? It's a cross of Oregairu and Danmachi, two things that I am 100% not at all familiar with.

Here are some ideas that derive from that story:

- Player characters may not be aware initially that this is a Death Game, only that their friends never logged back in. The exit menu controls don't work. Creeping horror.
- New player appears, confirms Death Game state.

  Cutting edge raiders are absolutely provided with women by their guilds - which will absolutely horrify and fascinate the real world when they begin learning what is going on in the game.
#+end_quote

- Who said that the cutting-edge raiders are interested in /women/?
- Are the reward characters provided to player characters actual players? Are they NPCs? Could they be NPCs, but are actually PCs because of weird player economies boot-strapped atop the in-game economy along the lines of the casino workers in [[http://www.localroger.com/prime-intellect/][the Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]? (In a post-scarcity friendly-AI-maintained virtual reality, the only money allowed to be used at one person's casino is money based off of the paid labor of known humans.)

I'm going to take a moment and kinkshame the entire Internet.

  in this world, the full-dive VR (I call it 'synaptic' VR) industry was jumpstarted by the porn industry after it started becoming accessible outside of medical and military functions, so pretty accurate sexual functions are in the game.
#+end_quote

There's the capacity for realistic sexual functions. Does that mean that the game-builders /included/ the capacity for realistic sexual functions? What if players are all walking around with libidos out to /here/ but no way of fulfilling them because of the carnal censor code? What if a player figures out how to hack the game engine to allow sex in a certain area? What if there are sex-available areas included in the game from the beginning, but they're controlled by NPCs or by guilds? What if a brothel is maliciously burnt down, leaving whole continents without sex?

Medical and military functions means that this game has the capacity (but not necessarily the code) for realistic hitboxing and damage counting. Is medicine magical or mundane?

  In a rational, mature portrayal of such a setting, prostitution would absolutely be a fairly significant 'profession.'
#+end_quote

This is only true if the game mechanics and game interface allow for prostitution.

  Only the faction/allied factions that defeat the final boss can leave the world.

How is this enforced? Who knows? How do they know?

  Raiders will tend to be significantly wealthier than plebeian grinders or merchants.
#+end_quote

Is this true? Remember DnD-style murderhobos. They've killed the dragon and acquired its hoard - but how do they transport the horde to the bank? Or do they build a bank around the horde, and become castellans instead of murderhobos? (There's a long blog post about this that I'm not able to find the link to.)

  Voting for the faction leaders of each race is to function as a true democratic system - so clearly the system would be heavily biased in favor of the guild masters of large, popular, well connected guilds.
#+end_quote

That's assuming that guilds are composed entirely of player characters, and that the game doesn't have built-in methods of determining faction leaders. It could just be that the faction leader's interface is automatically presented to the highest-combat-point-having player in the faction, which becomes /interesting/ if the combat leader is absolutely useless at management. You'd get guild-level bureaucracies to handle the decisionmaking, but they'd have to convince the combat leader to press the appropriate buttons. And what if the faction leader isn't reporting the faction's accounts correctly to the bureaucracy? An upstart young fighter could beat a rat in the farm and learn new things about the faction's books that put the former leader in a bad light.
