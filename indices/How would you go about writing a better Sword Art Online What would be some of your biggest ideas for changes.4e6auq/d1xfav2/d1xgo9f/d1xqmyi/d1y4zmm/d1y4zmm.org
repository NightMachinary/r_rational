  That's assuming that guilds are composed entirely of player characters, and that the game doesn't have built-in methods of determining faction leaders. It could just be that the faction leader's interface is automatically presented to the highest-combat-point-having player in the faction, which becomes interesting if the combat leader is absolutely useless at management.

Isn't the quote you replied this to coming from the author himself? If he says that in his world faction leaders are democratically elected then it will probably be so until he decides that it isn't a good idea for the story anymore.
