You could also draw inspiration from Log Horizon. On that anime the MC is a somewhat rational mage whose specialty comes from strategy and planning, he doesn't fight in the front lines but rather directs the party keeping close control of their health and mana levels.

He also deals with the ramifications of a system where there's no set economy and the NPCs as resources or characters on their own right.

I think the first days would be chaos and the characters would require to stay together and avoid getting into trouble until things settle. Everyone would be in need of leadership so if they're charismatic enough they could rally them and form the first guilds.

Kirito was a misantrophist and wasn't much of a team player. Depending on what you want to focus on, you could keep him like that and have +Klein+ BallsDeep69 (the fun but sadly forgotten support character) manage social interaction or have a more people person Kirito trying to lead his group.

There's also the fact the SAO system wasn't defined, in most MMORPGs you can't get by going solo against everything and you require to party. My main grip with SAO was how Kirito seemed to roll over any enemies on his own when that's usually counterproductive in RPGs.
