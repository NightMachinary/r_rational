I /really/ liked a certain aspect of Kirito's character that SAO only every so often touches on. How he's a competent problem solver, capable of piecing together genre-pertinent information, and a competent mercenary besides. Kirito is a /very/ good character to use as a window into worldbuilding and problem solving.

My intention with the story's dark swordsman is to have him as a competent mercenary who quietly work on behalf of several faction leaders while he's piecing together the greater mystery behind the world - finding the identity of the Game Master and his accomplice, and other lesser criminals. He's in an unusual situation. He's forced into being a solo-er as much out of circumstance as by his own choice.

Guild leadership/battlefield leadership is more intended to be the role of the heroine and the main character's friends.

Thanks to this thread I'm realizing that in a setting as guild-centric as this one will have to be, the main protagonist can't quite be a second Kirito. He won't be as dominant in the raiding scene. I'll have to consider how to go about this.
