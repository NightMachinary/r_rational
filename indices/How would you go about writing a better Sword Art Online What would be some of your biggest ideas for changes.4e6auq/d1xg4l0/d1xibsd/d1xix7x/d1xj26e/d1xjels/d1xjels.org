That could work. I mean a joke I liked from SAO: Abridged is how Kaayaba was a sadist and purposely put mechanisms in place to mock the players and promote conflict.

If he's as deranged in your fic as in Abridged, you could write he implemented a system where PKing also gives you drops and experience points.
