A good mechanic would be

#+begin_example
  if P1 kills P2:
      P1.exp += constant1^(P2.level-P1.level+constant2)-constant3 
#+end_example

This system would make high level players targets, and low level players untouchable. It would also provide an excuse for the high-level loner archetype; high level players would be afraid of assassins and lower levels would be afraid to become collateral damage.
