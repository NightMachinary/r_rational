Maybe he could form a mercenary group like *Laughing Coffin* where he takes care of unsavory tasks the other guilds can't afford to be known doing and reaping the benefits from them.

I liked how you wanted to focus on faction betrayal and your ideas on guild politics. Some guilds may want to assasinate key figures in other guilds but do so covertly to avoid an all out guild war. That's where Kirito and his mercenary group enters the scene, taking care of the obstacles or undesirable players so that they can stay focused on grinding and clearing the game. Asuna could be his main link to the Knights of the Blood Oath and primary contractors, and have romance and the like come from those deals.

That would also mean he can ask for good fees and get rare drop items from the guilds as payment if you want him to still be a powerful and dangerous enemy. Conflict could come by him butting heads with other mercenary factions like Laughing Coffin that perform the same "services" his group does.
