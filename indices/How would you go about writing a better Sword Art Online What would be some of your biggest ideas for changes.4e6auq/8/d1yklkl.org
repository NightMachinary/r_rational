The one thing I would really want to see with loner protagonist similar to Kirito is to make him /lose/ because of lack of cooperation.

That is, present a weak, inexperienced character (let's call him Klein), hilariously incompetent but with decent management skills. The initial perception of 'Klein the comedy character' will gradually turn into 'Klein the guild master/strategist excelling at leading people towards the common goal'. But still being horrible at direct combat.

Will Kirito detest Klein as a 'coward who can't fight for himself'? Will he later realise that, perhaps, if he joined Klein earlier, he could have saved more people? Will Kirito resent Klein for that?
