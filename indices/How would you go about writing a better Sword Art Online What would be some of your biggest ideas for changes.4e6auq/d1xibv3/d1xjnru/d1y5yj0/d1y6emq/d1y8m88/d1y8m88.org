If we use World of Warcraft as our example, starting zones become ghost towns through natural progression of the world anyway. So long as there's some incentive for it to happen, elite raiders will trivialize content for lowbies simply by virtue of being able to come in, party up, and blow through everything. Back when I played this was fairly common, not just with elite raiders helping their real life friends, but also with smaller guilds trying to recruit new members. There's little risk involved for either party; the lowbie gets powered up in a hurry and the elite raider is at virtually no risk of death.

As for alternate incentives you might be able to use, if you think you need them, a raider needs support personnel, but he might benefit from those support personnel being higher leveled or with better attributes. I believe at one point World of Warcraft tied secondary skills (fishing, cooking, enchanting) to character level, though I have no idea whether that's still the case.

(I also think there's a certain level of narrative drama available in a ridiculously powerful guy in Tier 15 armor blasting his way through a dungeon for a herd of lowbies.)
