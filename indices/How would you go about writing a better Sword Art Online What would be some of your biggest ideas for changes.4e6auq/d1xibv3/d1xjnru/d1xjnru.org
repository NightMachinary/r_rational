Yeah, I thought for a while about Endbringer-type enemies, as a way to force the lowbie players/cowards into taking action, but I don't think it's for the best. Awesome as the Endbringers are as a story mechanic, I don't think they are a rational solution to the setting's flaws and they would introduce some of their own. How would the people who stay in the Town of Beginnings be motivated by an Endbringer showing up? They'd just die or flee - they couldn't contribute to such a fight. Attrition on the front lines will be bad enough without putting in place unbeatable enemies. Motivation to force people to raid can be put in place by other ways.

Also, the Endbringers aren't characters so much as they are forces of nature. It's probably best to focus on purely human opponents and motivations.
