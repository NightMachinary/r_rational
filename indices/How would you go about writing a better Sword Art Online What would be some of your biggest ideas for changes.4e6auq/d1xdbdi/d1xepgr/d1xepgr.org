Yeah - the stat and skill system.

What I've been leaning towards is a two-part leveling system. Leveling of the character and, more importantly, their skills. Character leveling (player power increasing) is intended to be strongly logarithmic, if graphed out. A max level character (intended to be functionally impossible, there will be exponentially increasing diminishing returns on the speed of character leveling as one approaches level 100) will be stronger than a base level character, but only by severalfold, like how a world-top weightlifter can bench only several times what a random joe off the street could.

The real onus of character progression is intended to be in their skillset. A high level character will be many times more mobile, have more stamina, have a far higher mana capacity, have a much broader skillset for defensive abilities, illusions, healing, armor piercing, CCing/tripping up enemy movement, etc.

It is intended to be a difficult stretch to overcome, but a level 1 starting character should absolutely be capable of beating a max level character. Leveling up won't increase one's base walking or attack speed, weapon skill, won't dramatically increase HP or base weapon damage, etc. A critical headshot will still kill anyone.

Inflation is to be dealt with by a strongly resource intensive crafting system. a housing market, taxes and rent (faction and guild taxes - the faction leader is a player, also system rent fees for owning the property), and middlemen fees. There will be no Auction House. Rather, raiders will have the strongly incentived option to sell their unneeded drops, farmers sell their farmed goods, to brokers - middlemen - who in turn sell to players who make a full time living selling in the central town square, etc. Where possible these economic functions are handled purely within the guild (guild brokers and mechants and farmers). Solo players and members of non-elite guilds will have a more expensive life, in general.
