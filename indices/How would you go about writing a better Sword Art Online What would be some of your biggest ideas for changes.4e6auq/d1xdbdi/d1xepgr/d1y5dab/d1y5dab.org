  taxes (faction and guild taxes - the faction leader is a player)

If the tax revenue goes to actual players instead of vanishing into the ether (the way WoW's auction house tax does for instance) then it won't really help in any way to prevent inflation. The moment the guild/faction leaders purchase something from the player driven market it's all out there again.

Also, what role exactly will NPCs play in your world and how much will they be people vs being automatons that look like people?
