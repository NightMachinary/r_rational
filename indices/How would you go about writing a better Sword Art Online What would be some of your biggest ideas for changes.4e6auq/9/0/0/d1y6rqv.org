Yeah that's a fair enough reason though Log Horizon spoilers does not end up with death being ignored. If you haven't seen it I don't think my comments will be that intelligible.

I will clarify again that these were spur of the emotion posts though I'm not so unhappy with them that I'm not sharing them.
