There are very good, sequel-related reasons why I'm not willing to go with a LH-type respawn system. Also, a theme I want to push in this world is the bridging of the reality and the virtual. Immersion and suspension of disbelief in this world is supposed to be nearly perfect. LH was too 'gamey' for what I want to make.

That being said, I've only watched the first two episodes of LH. I really should watch it, if only to see if there are any ideas I can use and to be able to intelligently debate with the show's fans. But - yeah, link your post, I'm curious about what you wrote.
