If you want to justify Kirito becoming a player killer without turning him into a sociopath you could play up the abuse low level players suffered at the hands of the more advanced ones in SAO. There was one episode where Kirito and Asuna have to rescue the villagers in a low level village that were forced to pay taxes and serve some high level players that were taking control of the town.

Guilds are powerful entities and having backing and resources from powerful players is a good incentive to join one. Kirito may create his unaligned mercenary group as a response to seeing guilds abusing players to bring a certain level of control and fairness to the game.

That would be like sending a message, "you can organize and deal all you want with petty politics, but step out of line, abuse the weak players and you may get a nightly visit from Laughing Coffin (whatever Kirito's guild name is)".
