Mad AI?

Kayaba and the Nervegear was the weak link of the original SAO for many people, in that never was it explained why nobody was able to hack into SAO, or why the Nervegear was okayed for consumer use if it was even remotely possible to microwave your brain with an off the shelf model, or even where Kayaba was holed up for two years. An AI built to entertain people within the game could logic that the more time a player has logged, the more entertained they are, and if they are no longer playing the game, they are not their problem anymore. Introduce the threat of death, you save on resources when they logout, keep things fresh for the existing players, and don't have a human point of failure when the feds get involved. It makes sense, but I haven't thought too hard about it yet.
