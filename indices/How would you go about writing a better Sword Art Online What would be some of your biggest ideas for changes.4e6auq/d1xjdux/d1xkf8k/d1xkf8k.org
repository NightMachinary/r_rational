A concern of mine is the story's Kayaba Akihiko.

Kayaba is not the type of person who would put in place a multi-faction deathgame, punish the players who don't kill the final boss, etc. When Kayaba created Aincrad, he did it in order to create something of beauty - Aincrad was to him a work of art that could only be properly enjoyed by /living/ it (so obviously to be truly immersed you would have to take the risk of losing that life).

This motivation and mindset is one I really, really want to keep for my story's villain. But I have to figure out how to weigh that angle of altruism-gone-horribly-wrong (in the end burning out the architect himself) against the creation of such an obvious death game/murderfest as this multiple faction Aincrad is shaping up to be.

This world should be something beautiful, something to be enjoyed...I'll have to consider this.
