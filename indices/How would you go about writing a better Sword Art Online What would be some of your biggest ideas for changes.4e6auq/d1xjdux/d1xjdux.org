SAO thematically hits on bridging the divide between the real and the unreal, when it's not Kirito doing OP crap and wooing all the women. One of the worst things about keeping Kirito as the Main Character is that by him being a lone wolf, you can only explore the world through his eyes, and he's too bland to really explore in the original Aincrad run, serving more as a suit for the reader in a power and respect fantasy. Nerf Kirito, and expand the scope to an Anthology, like a tales from Aincrad. How do people adjust to a far less domestic world, and still make it their own? Who becomes a better person and who becomes worse when death hangs over your head by the rules of a mad GM? When the games over, is there anybody who wants to go back?
