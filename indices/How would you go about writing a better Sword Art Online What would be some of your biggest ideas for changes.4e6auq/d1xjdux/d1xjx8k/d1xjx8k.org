/Fantastic post./

I absolutely 100% agree that the main theme of SAO was bridging the gap between the real and the virtual. I need to do that in my own way.

I'm not willing to outright nerf Kirito, he's too useful as a independent, unaligned problem solver. But dramatically changing his story role could work. Elsewhere in the thread the idea was raised of making Kirito the /GM of Laughing Coffin/ - making him the leader of a guild of cleaners, assassins for hire who clean up after broader faction conflicts. I like and am strongly considering. It's a /really/ dark road to take his character down though, I'd have to figure out how to make it work without bogging the story down in PTSD.

Your last three rhetorical questions are all fantastic.
