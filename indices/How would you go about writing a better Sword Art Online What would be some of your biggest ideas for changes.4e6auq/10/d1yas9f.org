Floating castle setting possibilities:

A Hogwarts-like setting where the higher-level enemies are /there/ in the halls, but only care about level-appropriate prey. Occasionally a "major" "villain" "attacks" in a free-for-all crossover event where everyone can help kill minions and the greatest players get to enjoy teaming up against the Big Bad.

The castle is neutral ground; you can only fight training dummies in the designated combat areas. There are "bridges" to other floating locations of varying difficulty, clearly labelled, and possibly requiring the entrant to be of appropriate level (a challenge to a skilled, underleveled protagonist who punches above their weight class.)

There are 100 floors to clear and 100 bosses. Bosses on the ground floors protect players. Bosses on the higher floors attack players; each is more fiendishly difficult than the last. Bosses below ground are weak and ineffectual, and the most ruthless players reign as kings. (EVE Online version.)

There are no posted difficulty settings and no explanations. Players make maps of the explored portions of the unfathomable-large castle, marking areas where no-one has returned, or which contain valuable resources, while others plot to exploit secrets they've discovered. Some use flying machines to travel quickly around the impossibly-small exterior. (Minecraft version.)

There are no enemies. Players construct dungeons filled with fiendish traps and empower themselves with insanely broken magic items. Low-level players must find a patron to survive, in exchange for promises to repay them later. (Ironfell version.)

The castle is under siege from flying demons. The players must specialize and cooperate in order to defeat the ever-more-powerful waves of enemies, using limited tools to enforce compliance. (Social experiment version.)

Fire melts metal. Metal smashes stone. Stone endures/extinguishes fire. The metagame constantly shifts between the pyro/ferro/terra-kinesis being dominant, as players reshape the structure around them in complex duels. (Or some other triad - perhaps archers defeat pikes defeat armoured knights defeat archers.) Weak players jump on board with the powerful faction only to find the tides turn before they've built up enough strength, while the most powerful have amassed enough that even their vulnerable element needs a master to penetrate their defence.
