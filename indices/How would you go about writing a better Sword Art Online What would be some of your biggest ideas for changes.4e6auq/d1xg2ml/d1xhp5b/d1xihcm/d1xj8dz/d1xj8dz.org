I don't actually think it would be that much of a problem because [[#s][spoilers]]

  Heh that'd be a cool Log Horizon fanfic.

Yeah, I think doing a near-future LH fanfic where there's an incredibly expensive per-capita but reliable way to travel between both worlds would be fun. Something that heavily limits the rate of transfer so the author doesn't need to keep track of 30k different adventurers in japan alone, but still gets that societal sci-fi vibe. Unfortunately, the LH fanfiction section is underpopped and I'm an attention whore, so I probably won't write it.
