Are you aware of Wildbow's Weaver Dice system? It's a pen&paper-ish system Ã  la Dungeons & Dragons. But because it's set in the Worm universe, no-one chooses their superpowers; instead, at least the broad strokes of the powers (and their disadvantages etc) are determined entirely by dice rolls.

(Also, it's still work-in-progress.)
