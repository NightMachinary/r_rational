Eh, there was less material available for the second season to cover, so as someone who binge watched the whole thing I'm pretty OK with it.

I get that, if you had watched it as it aired, it would have been tedious, but I liked the kids' arc well enough. The raid arc still stood out more from a storytelling perspective, and the genius arc from a worldbuilding perspective, but I don't agree with all the flak the kids' arc gets.
