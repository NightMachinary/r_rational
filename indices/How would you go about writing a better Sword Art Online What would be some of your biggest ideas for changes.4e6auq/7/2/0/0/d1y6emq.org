Too arbitrary and non-genre-compliant. It's natural and expected for only a certain significant minority of MMO players to be front-line raiders. And /predictably/ removing the starting town/towns on higher levels would play havoc with the economy/housing market. There may be merit in having the /city/ move up with raiding progression, but would have to think further on it.

There is definitely too much safety for the lowbie players, though...

Hm. Right now I'm thinking of what it would be like to have a/the starting town be a safe zone for several months to a year, but then a boss is kited (intentionally or unintentionally) to a faction city and due to mechanics becomes invincible there. I'm imagining what would happen if you had a Doom Lord Kazzak equivalent be kited to a faction capital, with no GM intervention. The city would have to be abandoned...

I'm not quite willing to go full on Endbringer. But this could work. The Endbringers were in any case a mechanic that operated over the course of decades. Only one or two Endbringer-caliber acts of destruction on the playerbase would be needed in the 1-2 year timeframe I have in mind for this story.

For reference - Doom Lord Kazzak was an open world boss in Warcraft that would heal whenever it killed a player or NPC, even ones that weren't in combat with it. If it wasn't killed within 5 minutes, it would also begin continuously spamming a massive radial AOE attack. It was kited to a faction capital and literally broke the city...there is potential in this.
