  The future probably has incorporated women into the hardcore gaming crowd to a greater degree, but there could still be a wide demographic split and I'd love to see how "white knights" and competition for relationships would affect things.

More importantly, how many people will actually be playing their real life gender? In WoW for instance I know that it is much more common for a man to play a female character than for a woman to play a male one. Both happen though and they usually don't reflect the player's real life sexuality in any way.
