  Voting for the faction leaders of each race is to function as a true democratic system

  I'm thinking, say, 7 factions/races that each have combat and crafting strengths and weaknesses.

There's something you should keep in mind here though, and that is faction imbalance. Just look at WoW, where pretty much no server has a Horde/Alliance balance and even if you take all servers in to consideration there's still more of one than the other. This becomes even more extreme if you look at the numbers of players for each race, which are often chosen for aesthetic reasons. Then there's also the thing that if the races/factions give different benefits there's bound to be some power imbalances, simply because such things are never perfect.

Also, if race matters for which faction you belong to in the end of the game, how does betraying/faction changing work? And if faction allegiance is mostly a thing you can freely choose and change, what incentivizes people in a literally alien death world to not all stick together and slowly converge into one faction? Sure there might be crazy outliers but anyone who is sane would join the strongest faction in a heartbeat. I mean even if the leadership is oppressive, as long as it shows results without using people as cannon fodder one always knows that it is the best way to get out alive and after that it doesn't really matter anyway.

Tribalism might be a thing but usually that happens after either separate communities form in earnest or if there's no common outside threat. Assuming that the MMO imprisons everyone the first time they log in, people have pretty good chances to have friends and allegiances all over the various races as long as they chose them on their own instead of coordinating for a shared leveling experience or something.

  prostitution would absolutely be a fairly significant 'profession.'

How developed will NPCs be? Do they have actual personalities at the level of real humans? Because in that case I could see prostitution coming a lot from that source too, as long as PCs have the freedom to "repurpose" NPCs.
