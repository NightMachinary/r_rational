But being fan fiction it would always be ineligible from a publishing standpoint is how I meant it. I suppose technically if someone started a Patreon or similar way of making money and plagiarized fan fiction, it probably would be possible to go after them legally.

That having been said, my guess / hope is that the OP of this thread just meant there are concepts from FDoD they were going to build off of; hopefully they'll credit FDoD's author but from what they posted here today I don't think they'll write a similar story.
