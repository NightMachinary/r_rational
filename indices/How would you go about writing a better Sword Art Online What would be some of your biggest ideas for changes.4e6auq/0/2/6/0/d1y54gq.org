If the game mechanics are hard-coded to function that way then it will probably be that way. I mean imagine if every day/week/month everyone gets a pop-up in their mental eye that asks them to write in some player's name as faction leader or something. No matter how unintuitive in a crisis, they'll still end up electing leaders democratically. How much that actually matters depends on what mechanical powers said faction leader gets. If it is just some administrative guild hall abilities and asset lists or whatever then I could easily see some factions being actually lead by the strongest military guilds that force the technically chosen "faction leader" to do whatever they think he should do.
