  I'm strongly inclining towards a multiple-faction game. Ironic that Alfheim Online could have possibly been a better Death Game than SAO's Aincrad. I'm thinking, say, 7 factions/races that each have combat and crafting strengths and weaknesses. Only the faction/allied factions that defeat the final boss can leave the world. Any players left behind, die. So it's literally a race to the top. Petty grinding is taken care of internally by guild farming teams.

That...

That is going to be a hell of a psychological shitshow.

All the worst parts of tribalism, combined with a fight for your life which you were completely unprepared for, with only one group able to emerge alive at the end?

Betrayal, mass murder, a lot of things start looking like valid tactics in that kind of scenario.

It's even worse, because there is no chance anyone will cooperate cross-lines. If they lose, they will die anyways, so why bother helping them? Only one faction can survive, so why bother making friends or forming connections with someone in another group? Only one of you can survive, or perhaps neither will.

Cooperation was at lest technically possible in Alfheim because the prize was only permaflight. Here the prize is /life./

I can't see a way for that kind of scenario to not end up being very, very dark.

Can you switch factions? If so, the clear and first response by any rational person is to pick one faction and have literally everyone join it. Leave the other 6 empty, so that when someone wins, everyone escapes - but if that's possible, the whole drama is removed.
