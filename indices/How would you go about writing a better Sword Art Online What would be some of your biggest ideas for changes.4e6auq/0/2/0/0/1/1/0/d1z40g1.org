  So, for suspension of belief to actually work, the world would have to be very very internally logically consistent, despite a ridiculous base premise.

What are people suspending their disbelief in?

- Disbelief that Death Games exist?
- Disbelief in strong VR?
- Disbelief in VR MMO existence?
- Disbelief in unbalanced VR MMO mechanics?
- Disbelief in strange Death Game-specific mechanics applied to the VR MMO?
- Disbelief in character reactions to the the Death-Game-specific mechanics of the VR MMO?
- Disbelief in character reactions to the the general mechanics of the VR MMO?

I mean, does TF2 make sense? Does Call of Duty? Does Age of Empires? Does Neko Atsume?

Games don't have to make sense for players to want to play the game.

Sometimes people play games because they specifically /don't/ make sense.

The only suspensions of disbelief that I suspect matter are your reader's disbelief in the world's setting and the player responses and player sociology. Death Games don't make sense.
