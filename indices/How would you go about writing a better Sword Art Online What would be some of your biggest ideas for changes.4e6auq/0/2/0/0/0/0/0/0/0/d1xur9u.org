Hey, this could be a /great/ plot twist if it turns out that players come up with this solution of defecting to the most successful faction near to the end. I know that it wouldn't be too obvious to the reader if I read about this in a book. It'd be an amazing Chekhov's Gun when the ability to switch factions are only mentioned in the beginning, but is only used right before the boss fight.
