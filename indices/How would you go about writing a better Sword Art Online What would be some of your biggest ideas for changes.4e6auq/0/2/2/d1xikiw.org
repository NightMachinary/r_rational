Considering many disadvantages women have compared to men in combat in reality are largely negated by this being a game (unless they are explicitly encoded in game mechanics, (like strength penalty) in which case the game would be condemned by sjw before the trap could be enacted) we can expect them to be frontline raiders too. I would like to see guilds throw (male(?)) prostitutes at them. Bound to be entertaining.
