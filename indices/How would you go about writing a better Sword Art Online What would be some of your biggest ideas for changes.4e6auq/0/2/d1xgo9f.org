Yeah, I'm also a current GM of a Warcraft guild - we've full cleared all of the current content on the highest difficulty. For this story, guilds are to be the main political entity. The loyalties and beliefs of the faction leaders - the heads of player government - are to have a large impact on which guilds can be on top, etc. Voting for the faction leaders of each race is to function as a true democratic system - so clearly the system would be heavily biased in favor of the guild masters of large, popular, well connected guilds.

I absolutely agree that risk minimization and forcing characters into grinding of easier content is a natural consequence of a permadeath penalty. And to an extent, that's fine. In real life, across military history, each active duty combat soldier has been supported by on average 10 support personal, I read that statistic somewhere. In World of Warcraft, cutting edge raiders are only a small minority of the playerbase. But, still, given the permadeath penalty, powerful incentives with a real life impact are needed to get people to play the game as intended, minimizing grinding by elite players.

To get past this issue, I'm strongly inclining towards a multiple-faction game. Ironic that Alfheim Online could have possibly been a better Death Game than SAO's Aincrad. I'm thinking, say, 7 factions/races that each have combat and crafting strengths and weaknesses. Only the faction/allied factions that defeat the final boss can leave the world. Any players left behind, die, including players of a victorious race but who are no longer in that faction or its allied faction races. So it's literally a race to the top. Petty grinding is taken care of internally by guild farming teams. Between this and the American warrior culture/shaming of cowards (see how people thought of WWII draft-dodgers) I think that could be enough to address your concern.

Strong incentives are to be in place for faction betrayals, scheming, etc. Your idea of considering the entire castle as a magnified Opening of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj-type scenario is very good and can potentially play into this. Let's say that important gateway/attunement items are highly limited in availability, but have multiple sources, and that the easier sources, once claimed, never again are available. So second/third place guilds will have to deal with increasingly more difficult challenges. A weaker guild's way around this is by fielding more players, sabotaging the higher ranked guilds, and scheming/treachery. Players can be incentived/bribed/corrupted to betray their guilds and rob from the guild bank and seek refuge with a new guild or faction. Important Main Quest items need to be stored in the guild bank or the Guild Hall and can be stolen with high enough connections. Soulbound gear does not exist and virtual player inventories are limited, so items can be stolen right off people from their corpses, their houses or their guild hall quarters, etc. I've never played EVE Online, but I've been reading on it and its 'Corporations', trying to find inspiration.

To incentivize players being raiders on a more personal level, I'm inclining towards base pleasures and insurance. Food and sleep are important - you get tastier food, more quality and restful sleep, your own house or guild quarters, more secure ways of securing your items/loot, if you are a raider. Raiders will tend to be significantly wealthier than plebeian grinders or merchants. Sex is also a factor - in this world, the full-dive VR (I call it 'synaptic' VR) industry was jumpstarted by the porn industry after it started becoming accessible outside of medical and military functions, so pretty accurate sexual functions are in the game. Cutting edge raiders are absolutely provided with women by their guilds - which will absolutely horrify and fascinate the real world when they begin learning what is going on in the game.

I'm still uncertain about this idea, I have not put in much critical thought yet - in particular I'm not sure what it would mean for gender relations in the game and in top guilds in particular. But I did think it was /ridiculous/ that sex was a possibility in SAO and only briefly elaborated on. In a rational, mature portrayal of such a setting, prostitution would absolutely be a fairly significant 'profession.'

Large, established guilds also provide a salary and life insurance, to take care of a raider's loved ones in the game if the raider dies. This is augmented by solemn promises to carry on the duty in real life after the game is cleared.
