There's an extremely wellwritten SAO AU called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]] that places a lot of focus on politics, altho it's designed differently so it's less "guild politics" and more "race politics". The premise is that Alfheim online is the death game, with 20,000 players, and the race that gets to the top of the world tree first, and two races of the winner's choosing, get to be freed of the game (there are 9 races) Revival magic exists but it's very high level and your remain light only lasts for a minute. Unfortunately tthe story isn't complete yet, nowhere near, but what's there now is epically good. I particularly like how the author approaches racism as that's a big theme since only three races can clear, and also there's other things thathappen that demonstrates how easy it is to stereotype people based on their race
