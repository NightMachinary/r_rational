  How could it go wrong?

You're joking, right? A short-sighted, short-lived being is going to make other people do things that run counter to their own beliefs, with a view to making the world run differently, and you can't see how this could possibly backfire with a vengeance?!

Oh, and you've helpfully mentioned that it wears off in a short time. Tell me, what is the usual reaction when a Dire Charm wears off? How would /you/ react to the realization that someone had been mind-controlling you?
