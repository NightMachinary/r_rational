I certainly would. If control wears off after 12 hours, then that makes it less useful for psychotherapy, but you could probably do very well in some other fields, like personal training.

The problem that I see with implementing any big changes is, as soon as you come near anyone with significant power/influence, they're going to see you as a threat. So, you either have to avoid them, or seek to dominate them long-term. The former option limits the scope for you to achieve anything, and the latter is simply a road to dictatorship. And benevolent dictators are very nice in theory, or on a small scale, but humans are just too flawed to make world domination work out for the best.
