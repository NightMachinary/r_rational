To an extent. It's quite easy to exert influence at the top to make sure that the middle and lower layers are filled with people who either think the same way as you naturally, or don't care and are happy to get paid to implement your policies. Plus you can arrange things so that the paths to power are rigged to favor people who approve of your way of doing things, and sandbag those who don't. By the time anyone gets to a seat of actual power, they either think like you or they're incredibly good at hiding that they don't (and will need to keep doing so in order to remain employed).

That way, you can either get rid of the top layer via attrition and have everyone below them step up, resulting in a complete power structure tuned to your requirements. Or, even if you have to leave earlier, the existing top layer is likely to fall into uncoordination between factions, while having to maintain at least some of your policies so as not to seem like flip-floppers or easily influenced people or conspiracy theorists, and all the time your middle and lower layers still exert a massive pressure to keep things running your way.

And of course you could even set things up so that there was an /actual/ democratic voting system which couldn't be easily corrupted or disassembled, and rely on all those voters who had their lives vastly improved by (as far as they know) local politicians who ran on these new platforms (the ones you designed).
