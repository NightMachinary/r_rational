Honestly? I wouldn't attempt anything for the whole of humanity with that. Way too much scope for a) making a catastrophic error and doing more harm than good; b) getting the wrong people mad and getting hammered; c) if actually successful in some degree, becoming too integral to the functioning of people's lives.

Maybe I'd make a career in psychotherapy or similar, where people actually want to be influenced.
