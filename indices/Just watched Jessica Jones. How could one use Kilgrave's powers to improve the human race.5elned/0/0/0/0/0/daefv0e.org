OK, let's see...just off the top of my head...

You make the Israeli and Palestinian leaders agree to a peaceful settlement. The extremist factions are infuriated, disavow their government(s), and go on a killing spree. ISIS supports them. You try to intervene, and get shot by a sniper.

You use your influence in Congress/Parliament to get legislation passed. Unfortunately you're so persuasive that it doesn't get sufficiently discussed, and it has severe side effects that would have been identified in the usual process.

You work anonymously as a police negotiator, with your face always covered, to stop hostage situations and bridge jumpers. Reporters track you down, and the next group of terrorists incapacitates and drugs you, forcing you to work for them (there are ways to stop you from talking them out of it, like having relatives held hostage in a location unknown to your captors).

The biggest threats, though, are the ones that /I haven't even thought of/, because /I'm not smart enough/ to know how my actions will affect the billions of people in the world.
