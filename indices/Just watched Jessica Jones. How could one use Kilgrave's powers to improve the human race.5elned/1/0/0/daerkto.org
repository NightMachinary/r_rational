It's also possible to instill identification and isolation skills. Most cons, dictators, cult leaders etc prey on people who can't tell what's going on.

I could probably intervene for a few minutes if one of them got completely out of hand, or have a strategy of jail terms incorporating a transfer to some location I could swing by, but generally most low-level stuff should be largely handled by public education, people watching out for each other, and the much-reduced equivalent of police/FBI forces.

I'm not going to pretend that humanity would 100% convert to the gospel of being nice to each other, but the goal is more a push or influence to that end rather than forcing it.

And there's no particular reason I'd walk around in the same identify I used for broadcasts. :)
