From a narrative standpoint, I am not sure it fits. The reason to have a hooded figure whose identity is concealed from the reader is so that they can pull the hood back at some dramatically appropriate moment to reveal that they were really X all along. That doesn't work too well for Acher because no one knows what he looks like. I agree that the Other King is probably someone who has already been introduced, but Acher seems like a reveal that would be somewhat lacking in drama, for a number of reasons.
