So there's a character whose name is "The Other One," who went neither to hell nor to heaven and Uriel isn't sure what happened to him, who rebelled against God for a tiny injustice involving a bird in a chapter titled "For not one sparrow can suffer and not the whole Universe suffer also."

And another character called "The Other King," who "came from nowhere" and "didn't provide an origin story," and when asked who the King was and where he'd come from, the monks prophesied, "How is Rhode Island like a falling bird? There is Providence in both."

And you reject the idea that these two characters are the same?
