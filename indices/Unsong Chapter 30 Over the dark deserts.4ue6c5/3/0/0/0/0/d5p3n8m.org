No, my question is why it would matter at all. Why would an author want to include this plot point? What purpose would it serve to have them be the same person? My argument is about drama, not logic.

Edit: Thinking about it more, I suppose the dramatic purpose might be that Aaron gets captured, makes the connection, and uses that knowledge to escape? Acher is motivated by attempting to break god's laws, which seems like it might be exploitable.
