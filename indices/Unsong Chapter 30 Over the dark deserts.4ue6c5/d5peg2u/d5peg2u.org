I think this should be "Untied".

Also, metaphors aside, the description of Wall Drug here?

#+begin_quote
  But if ever you see a Wall Drug billboard and continue to travel, the land will start looking less and less like where you came from, more and more like the grassy semi-arid plains of South Dakota. Once that happens, you can still turn back. But if you turn back too late, you may find that Wall Drug is in that direction too, that every point of the compass brings you closer to Wall Drug, with no choice but to remain in place forever or go boldly towards that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns.

This actually does sound awfully like the way spacetime behaves around the [[https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f1lgu/what_would_happen_if_the_event_horizons_of_two/c1cuiyw][event horizon of a black hole]] (with Wall Drug itself being the singularity).

(Though if someone ventures far enough that all directions start leading to Wall Drug, it does raise the question of how Aaron--or anyone else--would ever know that.)
