In general from our experience, outsiders who are linked to it often leave quite low quality comments- they ignore rule 1 and agree with OP, leave short jokey comments and violate rule 5, get angry and pick a fight with someone and violate rule 2. I wasn't criticizing you, I was just appealing for any who read your post to read the rules first.
