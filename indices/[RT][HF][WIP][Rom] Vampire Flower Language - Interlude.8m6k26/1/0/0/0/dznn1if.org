It exists in the form of a rough sketch in the form of plenty of roleplayed scenes that are about the quality of fanfiction a sterotypical 14 year old might write, I guess. All the fun and highlights with the stuff in between yadda yadda'd.

It ends up being a sort of ensemble cast with the aforementioned two queer women (a witch and a police officer), an ex-werewolf lawyer, a werewolf prison employee, a handsome doctor, a troubled guy getting his life back together with the power of true love, a half-siren half-gargoyle with a low self esteem, his gargoyle father (he appears in this story!), a psychic who gets migraines, a couple of androids, a murse, and of course William, the /bad guy/.

It... gets kind of complicated.

I've also got a rough plot sketched out for an interquel with the lawyer, resettlement officer, and half-siren half-gargoyle as the main characters. It's a kind of moral relativism sort of thing, I think. Which I might use as a way to introduce a bunch of characters and concepts (our werewolves are /extremely/ weird and basically completely distinct from any other take I've seen).

But time's short, so don't expect any of the above any time soon. Probably rambled a bit too much.
