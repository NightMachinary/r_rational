Another interlude! In case anyone was wondering, the "first weekend of every month" schedule is being fiddled with slightly to an "every second week" schedule for now. Maybe I should change the official schedule note to read "about once a month".

I'm planning on going on a 3 week holiday (hoping to book the flights this weekend), and that will mean we're basically going to have to skip July. Apologies.

[spoilers below, if spoilers for a 500 word interlude are a concern to you]

I'm a bit nervous posting this interlude as it touches on an important part of the whole vampire thing that I don't see discussed much: these people probably were religious in life at some point, but the traditions of the church they followed crumble before their eyes through reformations, schisms, and the regular march of progress.

And yet, these traditions gave them comfort and meant something to them at some point; do they continue them? Do they set them aside when they decide they are demon-animals?

William's theological ideas are something I've thought about in some depth, and I guess this scene is a nod to that. He's not sure on the nature of god or reality; he's not sure if he's dead and his soul is in heaven with his wife-from-when-he-was-human already, or if what he is counts as alive and he's damned his soul ten thousand ways to Sunday through the general things that vampires do.

At the end of the day, like most people, he picks and chooses which parts of his religion he likes and these change based on the day and his mood.

William was born in a christian society, and I was surprised in my research I found that confession has been a part of christian practise since basically for as long as christianity has existed. So, although the branching structure of the church has caused him some consternation, he likes being able to sit down with someone who listens to his most private problems and offers advice and comfort.

Of course, these people are priests of a heretical religion (since all religion is heretical to him at this point), and they know his secrets, so they can't be left alive lest another vampire find them and use that knowledge to ruin him.

In case anyone was worried about this becoming an atheistic screed or a religious screed, apart from a couple of parenthetical remarks by characters, this is the only appearance of religion in the story, and is by far the most detailed.

I will end this post here, because this is threatening to be longer than the interlude it is being written about.
