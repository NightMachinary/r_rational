Thanks for the compliment! Glad you're enjoying it the story so far!

  I'd love to see an F/F story set in this world...

Funnily enough this whole romance story is technically the prequel for a "vampire hunters save the world" story starring two queer women, though I should state they aren't together, don't want to be together, and that there's not /much/ romance in that story. (And William's the antagonist, naturally).
