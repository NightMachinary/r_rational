Copying my comment from the last thread here, because I got there so late:

#+begin_quote
  Death is absolutely necessary. Death is the Great Equalizer. A world without death is a world where the status quo reigns supreme. Where the powerful and wealthy are free to concentrate power and wealth without any check what so ever. Remember: the greatest horrors of the modern age have been wrought by man not nature.

  Imagine if the monarchs of old never died. Imagine if the various dictators of the present and past never left. A world where universities are run by faculty so hidebound by tradition and what they WANT to believe that science stalls. Where capitalists are free to hoard money and influence without bound. What would society look like today if millions upon millions of confederates and kkk members were still alive?

  Death is what makes societies and cultures flexible and dynamic. Death is what allows for progress, indeed, for peace. If societies cannot adapt organically they will be forced to change in violent ways as they approach stagnation or catastrophic failure. For without natural turnover the only avenue for mass change is mass violence.

  Lastly. On deaths relationship with humanity in a broad sense: What makes us human isn't our individuality. It is our society. While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.
