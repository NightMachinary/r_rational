When nations stagnate or approach catastrophic failure, that tends to result in armed conflict. Either because of internal pressures (riots, insurgencies, civil wars), ect) or external pressures (war). In any either case, if a nuclear power is involved, then there is a nonzero chance of a nuclear weapon being used and thus a nonzero chance of extinction.
