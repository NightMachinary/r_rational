  Remember: the greatest horrors of the modern age have been wrought by man not nature.
#+end_quote

Anyone who believes this is implicitly trivialising the literal billions of deaths to "nature" in the last 100 years.

Hitler is very high up on the scale of human evil (depending on how much culpability you ascribe to failed political policy, e.g. Mao's cultural revolution, he could be the pinnacle), but smallpox alone killed hundreds of millions.

So, which is more horrifying? I expect you'd still say Hitler, because you, like the majority of people, ascribe more emotional significance to human action. If that's the case, your heuristic is biased. You aren't objectively evaluating horror, you're evaluating the perception of horror.

To be clear, I'm not judging you for this. In fact, I feel the same. Human action is more horrifying to me because it's intentional, implicitly avoidable; don't do the evil thing, problem solved.

But humanity isn't even in the same league as nature.

Even if humans were responsible for 10% of all deaths (an incredibly high estimate), we'd still be [[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/][less deadly than ischaemic heart disease]].

As for the rest:

  Imagine if the monarchs of old never died. Imagine if the various dictators of the present and past never left.
#+end_quote

Monarchs and dictators still exist but society continues to erode their power. I don't think that tyranny is sustainable in the long term. A benevolent dictator, perhaps, but not a despot.

  A world where universities are run by faculty so hidebound by tradition and what they WANT to believe that science stalls.

Unless they were themselves omnipotent they'd find it very hard to stop people experimenting. Even if you can't get published because of some implausible global conspiracy to ignore the facts, you can still profit off your discovery.

  Where capitalists are free to hoard money and influence without bound.
#+end_quote

Why would a post-death society permit this? How would they enforce their dominance over an ever-growing immortal populace that remembers every injustice, unless they shared their wealth to placate the middle class (as is done now)?

#+begin_quote
  What would society look like today if millions upon millions of confederates and kkk members were still alive?
#+end_quote

Are you suggesting that the only way to reform a population is to wait for the people that hold the offending views to die? If so, we've been wasting our time having political discussions and reforming prisoners.

#+begin_quote
  Lastly. On deaths relationship with humanity in a broad sense: What makes us human isn't our individuality. It is our society. While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.
#+end_quote

Okay then, how about an alternative solution to the 50+ million natural deaths per year: we make humans immortal, then kill those necessary to ensure society progresses. We'll kill, say, 40 million carefully chosen people per year.

Would that be more horrifying, or less horrifying? Certainly it would be more efficient than hoping that the random distribution of death happens to facilitate progress. In fact we may even be able to scale it back after a while.

Which brings up another point: do you have a ballpark figure for the limit of a human lifespan, beyond which society collapses? And if we do eventually approach such a long span, will you be campaigning for the shortening of your own life to prevent catastrophe?
