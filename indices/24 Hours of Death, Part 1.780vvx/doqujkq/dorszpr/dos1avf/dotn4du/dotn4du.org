  Moreover, there is not insignificant tail risk of some truly undesirable (dystopic even) post-death societies.

I think variants on this theme are the most plausible arguments that death isn't that bad, or is even morally necessary, after a certain point. In the past, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56se39/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d8m8xtm/?st=j95s34ew&sh=c77b6002][I've argued that]] there may be a point at which more moral good is done by creating a new person than by continuing to use the same resources for a long-existing person. Society may stagnate when the same people exist for long periods of time, stuck at a local maximum, not exploring all the possibilities of well-being that we might want to exist. And there is always the risk of falling into permanent dystopia.

I'm not necessarily convinced by these arguments. It is easy to reverse immortality if it's not working out well, but not the other way around. I also think that the technology of immortality will also allow us to modify the brain's reward system enough to prevent greed and psychopathy from existing. A periodic randomization mechanism for avoiding stagnation, both on a societal and individual level, is also a good idea.

Immortality is irresponsible without an accompanying change in human psychology and societal organization. My idea of utopia involves radical freedom in a post-scarcity world where no one ever chooses to do evil not because of some totalitarian surveillance, because evil just isn't any fun.
