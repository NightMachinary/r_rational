Hm.

1: Well, in some cases. It's possible to suffer so much that life is not worth living, yes. This is not very common, however, and becomes less so if our ability to keep people healthy and alive longer increases. Because living an eternity as an abused slave would suck worse than dying after a good hundred years of life, I suppose (still debatable) but living for two hundred years as an abused slave and then another two hundred of a good life is better than dying after a hundred years of good life.

The problem with death is not the moment of death, that's a tiny sliver of time with no real weight. It's not the suffering of the ones left behind, that's a side-effect. It's the loss of potential, all the future good that never happened. So the question becomes, is the totality of your future a net positive or not? I'd say in most cases it is, because most experiences are better than nothing.

And, well, infinite life is such a large step, I believe it to be more pertinent to talk about extending life first, and ending aging for example. As a sidenote, that's also my response to all the 'you'd get bored of life' people - maybe I would, maybe I'd choose to die after a few thousand years of life, but I still want that choice, and a hundred years is not even close to reaching that point.

2/3: Well, we get into the problem that humankind is part of nature and lives in the midst of nature and untangling them isn't so easy. Lack of resources is part of nature, and that's one of the big causes of humans heaping suffering upon each other. Or, as you mentioned, the Spanish Flu causing so much death and suffering due to factors both 'human' and 'natural'.

I agree that the end of aging would lead into a very confusing and difficult societal transition which has the potential to end poorly, but I don't think that's a reason to not make the attempt, because the status quo is bad enough that it's worth it to try, and I feel we've a fair chance of ending up on track to a better world. Most worlds would be better if, like me, you believe that in almost all cases life is better than no life. In addition, it feels a bit like trying to stop the development of nuclear power because of the potential of nuclear weapons. It's going to happen eventually anyway, the earlier we get to it the better off everyone'll be and there's no reason to believe we'll be better able to handle the consequences in the future than right now.

Speaking of nuclear war, I don't really know if ending aging would make it more likely, or less. Sure, societal upheaval might ensue. Or more stability. Maybe leaders (and followers) who now have much more to lose would shy away from the button. What I do think is that such a trajectory, wherever it may lead, would happen on the scale of maybe a hundred years or so, and trying to predict a hundred years into the future is thoroughly futile.
