Allow me to more narrow the scope of my argument slightly, strip out some extraneous rhetoric, and more clearly state my thesis: The technical hurdles standing between us and a desirable post-death society are less daunting than the societal hurdles for the same outcome. Moreover, there is not insignificant tail risk of some truly undesirable (dystopic even) post-death societies.

I will note that I am no moral naturalist, although the language I'm using might make it appear that way.

The base premises upon which this argument is built are as follows

1. Suffering in life is worse than the cessation of life (aka death). Consider, if you were given the option between A) spending eternity as a low-status laborer in North Korea, or B) dying instantly, painlessly, and without warning at some point in the next 3 years, which would you chose? *

2. It is easier to tame nature than it is to tame humankind. Harm mitigation involving nature is fundamentally a problem of science and engineering; progress is made with precision and rationality, once progress is made here it rarely vanishes. Harm mitigation involving humankind is fundamentally a problem of politics and culture, progress comes in fits, without precision or regards to rationality, progress is quite vulnerable to regress.

3. While nature causes more cessation of life than man, man causes more suffering in life than nature. At least in the modern age and in developed countries. In many cases where nature does cause harm, it is more because of human failings than nature itself (for example, the truly mindboggling amount of death and suffering from the Spanish Flu was in large part due to the chaos and unsanitary conditions of WW1).

* You might chose A if you thought the knowledge of your upcoming death would be awful, but even that would be suffering in life.

Now on to address more specific grievances.

  Hitler is very high up on the scale of human evil (depending on how much culpability you ascribe to failed political policy, e.g. Mao's cultural revolution, he could be the pinnacle), but smallpox alone killed hundreds of millions.

  So, which is more horrifying? I expect you'd still say Hitler, because you, like the majority of people, ascribe more emotional significance to human action. If that's the case, your heuristic is biased. You aren't objectively evaluating horror, you're evaluating the perception of horror.
#+end_quote

Horror is a fundamentally subjective term, there can be no unbiased and universal assessment of it. That is why I used the word horror instead of death. This fits in to premise 1, in that "horror" or the extra emotional distress caused by human harm (as opposed to natural harm) is responsible for quite a lot of suffering in life.

That said, I kind of which I hadn't made the point in the first place. It was more rhetorical flair than anything else.

  Unless they were themselves omnipotent they'd find it very hard to stop people experimenting. Even if you can't get published because of some implausible global conspiracy to ignore the facts, you can still profit off your discovery.
#+end_quote

The main manifestation of the problem would not be global conspiracies or a concentrated effort, and more a lack of interest and/or funding. Also in the process of getting a PhD, with avent garde PhD candidates receiving less support and unfairly tough dissertation defenses. I will cede that the scientific progress wouldn't stop, but it would slow.

  Monarchs and dictators still exist but society continues to erode their power. I don't think that tyranny is sustainable in the long term. A benevolent dictator, perhaps, but not a despot.
#+end_quote

I think you're ascribing to a more linear view of history than I am. This trend of western liberalism and democracy is fairly recent, with it only gaining global prominence in the last 100 years. On a larger time horizon, it could be nothing more than just another historical fad. Moreover, there are many countries that are supposedly democratic (at least in a representative sense), but are actually controlled by oligarchs or "elected" heads of state that wield dictatorial power. Russia being the prime example.

#+begin_quote
  Why would a post-death society permit this? How would they enforce their dominance over an ever-growing immortal populace that remembers every injustice, unless they shared their wealth to placate the middle class (as is done now)?
#+end_quote

You're right, it is entirely possible that we could achieve a desirable post-death society.

Wealth is a form of power, so I'll stop mentioning it explicitly, but it is one of the main forms of power I have in mind here. Those with power almost always seek to preserve their power, and most seek to gather more power. It is the powerful who have the most capability to enact or block change.

Indeed, there are tons of things going on right now where you could ask "why would a modern society permit this?". The answer being that the powerful don't care enough to change things, or they're actively fighting against change. I'm not speaking of conspiracies, it's more that there's a degree of selection bias and perspective-limiting path dependency involved in the pursuit of power.

Additionally, any anti-aging tech will be expensive as hell for a long time. As such the wealthy will be the first to benefit and will benefit more (from higher quality treatments). If the treatments are expensive for long enough, it's entirely possible a poor person could be born into a world where Mark Zuckerberg is 50 years old and die in a world where Zuckerberg is 130 years old (and still making tons of money and gaining vast influence).

  Are you suggesting that the only way to reform a population is to wait for the people that hold the offending views to die? If so, we've been wasting our time having political discussions and reforming prisoners.
#+end_quote

In the US, at least, we really do not try to reform prisoners. It is also entirely possible, no, extremely likely that most of the time we spend having political debates/arguments is a waste. Now political debates and arguments are different than discussions, but I think they represent the majority of political discourse between people with different views.

Simply put, most people do not use reason to inform their emotions, but rather they use reason to justify their emotions. Look into [[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-article-wont-change-your-mind/519093/][identity protective reasoning]] and the [[https://daily.jstor.org/the-backfire-effect/][backfire]] [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Backfire_effect][effect]] (two separate hyperlinks there).

For this reason modern political campaigns (in the US) are based more around increasing the turnout of one's political base and depressing the turnout of the opponents base, than they are about convincing swing voters. This might be somewhat different outside of a two party system, but I'd wager that's because citizens of such countries have more complex political identities, not because they're less susceptible to identity protective/motivated reasoning.

  Which brings up another point: do you have a ballpark figure for the limit of a human lifespan, beyond which society collapses? And if we do eventually approach such a long span, will you be campaigning for the shortening of your own life to prevent catastrophe?
#+end_quote

That's a good question, and I'm not entirely sure as to the right answer. I don't remember if it was the CGP Grey video, or the companion Kurzgesagt video, but it was mentioned that it's entirely possible anti-aging tech will let us live healthy lives, but only up until we hit the theoretical upperbound of 120. I think that would be great, it would reduce suffering in life by an unimaginable amount and avoid many of the things I'm concerned about.
