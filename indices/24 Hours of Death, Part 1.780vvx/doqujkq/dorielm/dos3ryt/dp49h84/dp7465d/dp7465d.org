On malaria: We could go a long way towards solving the problem of malaria without making people immortal, through CRISPR and gene drives (or some other method). It's also worth considering that those people who die from malaria tend to die because they lack access to proper medical care or preventive methods. They will be some of the last to gain access to anti-aging tech, if they ever do. If it's hard to distribute mosquito netting to improvished and isolated communities, why would you think anti-aging tech will be any easier?

On war: The effects of war are so much worse than just the deaths of the soldiers. In developed countries we're insulated from most everything else, so I can understand why that's what you went to. The full toll war takes on humanity isnt apparent until you look at second and third order effects.

If a country is turned into a war zone it's the civilians who suffer the most. War destroys infrastructure and order, it can decimate civilian supply chains. Shortages become common and crime skyrockets. Famine and disease spread like wildfire. Modern armies are relatively disciplined so it's less of a problem, but in the past widespread rape and war went hand.

I want to stress that we have no real idea of what a non-nuclear war between two major powers would look like. The world's largest economies haven't directly waged war against each other for over 50 years. The toll of such a conflict would be unimaginable, the only real points of comparison would be the world wars. Again, such a hypothetical war would also take place in a future where military tech would likely have advanced just as far as medical tech.

I'm going to stop now before this becomes another 1200 word post, but my main point here is that war causes suffering in life far beyond the deaths it causes. Hell, there was one year where suicide killed more US soldiers than combat (you don't commit suicide unless you're suffering pretty badly in life). Anti-aging tech wouldn't stop either
