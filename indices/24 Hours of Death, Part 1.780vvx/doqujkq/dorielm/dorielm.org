  While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.
#+end_quote

As an individual human, I strongly disagree with this sentiment.

It's not that this isn't a legitimate problem, it is, but you have to ask yourself if the current price we are paying to avoid having to deal with it is worth it. Because that price is unbelievably high: we sacrifice one person to the reaper for every four seconds by which we extend the status quo. Is the problem of stagnating societies really so bad that not having to deal with it for another couple seconds is worth a human life?

You claim that aside from violence and war the only alternative for societal change is hoping that the people in power literally drop dead. I happen to think that this is not true, but even if it was, the death toll of one war per generation cannot possibly be higher than the death toll from ageing, can it?
