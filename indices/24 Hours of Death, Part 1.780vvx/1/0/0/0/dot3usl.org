  Suffering in life is worse than the cessation of life (aka death). Consider, if you were given the option between A) spending eternity as a low-status laborer in North Korea, or B) dying instantly, painlessly, and without warning at some point in the next 3 years, which would you chose? *
#+end_quote

What if you presented these same options to a low-status labourer in North Korea? Live forever with the status quo, or die within 3 years? I think they would choose the former; death has always been an option for them, but eternity has not.

Despite what we would consider terrible living conditions, people in those situations overwhelmingly choose to continue to live. A literal Hell in Biblical style would be a different matter, as would some medical conditions (those that cause significant physical or emotional pain over an indefinite period).

  It is easier to tame nature than it is to tame humankind.
#+end_quote

I agree with this point, but I don't think that taming humankind is made appreciably easier by the existence of death.

  While nature causes more cessation of life than man, man causes more suffering in life than nature.
#+end_quote

This is a tricky thing to quantify. If somebody goes hungry because a warlord steals the donated food then that's a human crime, but the donation was a human gift and the fact of hunger is a natural burden. Presumably we lay the blame at the feet of the warlord, but what about nature, that made their land barren in the first place?

Nature's suffering has been largely curtailed in the developed world. It still recurs in some situations, mostly medical issues or natural disasters, but in general it isn't nearly as extreme as it is in developing nations.

  The main manifestation of the problem would not be global conspiracies or a concentrated effort, and more a lack of interest and/or funding. Also in the process of getting a PhD, with avent garde PhD candidates receiving less support and unfairly tough dissertation defenses. I will cede that the scientific progress wouldn't stop, but it would slow.

The beauty of a post-death society is that it doesn't matter nearly as much if progress slows. Everyone will get to reap the benefits eventually.

By contrast, if somebody in our society discovers a solution for malaria (i.e. a way to eradicate the disease, not cure instances), the difference is about 400,000 lives per year (and many more who suffer from it without dying).

I don't think this is a very likely outcome for academia post-death, anyway.

  I think you're ascribing to a more linear view of history than I am. This trend of western liberalism and democracy is fairly recent, with it only gaining global prominence in the last 100 years.
#+end_quote

Western democracy may be recent, but democracy has been brewing for thousands of years. I'd argue that the global trend is strongly in that direction. Military coups still happen from time to time, but a military coup is a lot less threatening if they can't actually kill anyone. If they /can/ kill people, then the leaders of the coup can in turn be killed.

It seems very unlikely that a world which is able to band together enough to cure death will slide back into tyranny.

  Additionally, any anti-aging tech will be expensive as hell for a long time. As such the wealthy will be the first to benefit and will benefit more (from higher quality treatments). If the treatments are expensive for long enough, it's entirely possible a poor person could be born into a world where Mark Zuckerberg is 50 years old and die in a world where Zuckerberg is 130 years old (and still making tons of money and gaining vast influence).
#+end_quote

It's true, but it's also the status quo. The rich can already afford better treatments than the poor, with correspondingly longer lifespans.

The only way to counter this would be to ensure that people all live the same amount of time. As long as wealth is able to influence this, no finite span will ever be universal (unless you enforce it through other means, e.g. genetic alterations). And given that wealth affects diet, exercise, mental and physical health, etc., you'd have to be in a post-wealth society as well.

  In the US, at least, we really do not try to reform prisoners.
#+end_quote

That's a tragedy which should be remedied independent of any life extension technology. It does support your point about "Why would a modern society permit this?", however.

#+begin_quote
  It is also entirely possible, no, extremely likely that most of the time we spend having political debates/arguments is a waste.
#+end_quote

Yet people do change their opinions. Consider [[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-31/same-sex-marriage-who-supports-it-and-who-doesnt-hilda-data/8856884][the Australian same-sex marriage debate]] (which is our own "Why is this still an issue?" problem). 19% support for same-sex marriage in 2005, 46% in 2015. I don't think that 27% of the population was replaced in the intervening 10 years, which strongly implies that attitudes shifted.

Individual debates may not have much impact, but society trends nonetheless. You don't even need to convince that many people to start snowballing progress.

#+begin_quote
  That's a good question, and I'm not entirely sure as to the right answer. I don't remember if it was the CGP Grey video, or the companion Kurzgesagt video, but it was mentioned that it's entirely possible anti-aging tech will let us live healthy lives, but only up until we hit the theoretical upperbound of 120. I think that would be great, it would reduce suffering in life by an unimaginable amount and avoid many of the things I'm concerned about.
#+end_quote

Assuming for a moment that 120 is the right figure (which I certainly don't have the analytical skills to do): if we ever manage to push the upper limit of a human lifespan beyond 120, will you oppose that, even when it comes to your own life?
