I don't think we should be concerned with minimizing suffering but in maximizing overall utility. If we want to minimize suffering then we should just fire off all our nukes right now and destroy the planet, because life requires suffering.

Death is bad not just because it causes suffering in survivors, or because it's a painful process, but because it prevents people from experiencing things that they'd like to.

I think most of the reasons that deaths in war are bad are also present in deaths from aging. And aging ultimately guarantees the death of everyone, so aging has a lot broader a scope in which to cause suffering or prohibit people from pursuing pleasure. Even if aging's suffering is not necessarily as intense as, say, death by starvation, it's nonetheless going to be a lot more common even in your hypothetical where immortality tech causes social conflict and war.

Your existential risk argument makes some sense, if we should care about the survival of the species much more than the survival of particular members of the species. But for non existential risks, I think it's clear that additional war would be worth the cost of immortality. Unless you're imagining an all encompassing war that includes most of the people on the planet as soldiers or civilian casualties, maybe?
