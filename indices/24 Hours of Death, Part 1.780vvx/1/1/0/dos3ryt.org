See my other comment for a better explanation of my position.

  You claim that aside from violence and war the only alternative for societal change is hoping that the people in power literally drop dead. I happen to think that this is not true, but even if it was, the death toll of one war per generation cannot possibly be higher than the death toll from ageing, can it?

Not the only avenue for change, but they are the main avenues for mass change. Even the quintessential example of peaceful change, the civil rights movement of the 60's (which is itself a total white washing, but whatever) was [[http://www.americansc.org.uk/Online/Vietnam_Civil_Rights.htm][empowered by the backdrop of the Vietnam War]].

We have been lured into a false sense of security in the post-WW2 era, doubly so in the post-Cold War era. The violence and war we see around us today, and imagine as so terrible (because it is) and so vast (which it isn't) is [[https://youtu.be/DwKPFT-RioU?t=14m20s][/nothing/]] compared to the carnage of the world wars. Which themselves pale in comparison to the potential devastation modern great powers can inflict. Much less the great powers of a future in which we have the technological ability to stop aging.

That's just wars /between/ major powers and /without/ nuclear weapons. When nuclear weapons are factored in, any conflict a nuclear power is involved in has a risk of nuclear exchange, including civil wars (no great power has had a civil war in decades). That risk may be lesser or greater, depending on the context, but any step closer to the edge of our extinction (or at least the wholesale destruction of modern advanced societies) is a step that should be made with great great great care.
