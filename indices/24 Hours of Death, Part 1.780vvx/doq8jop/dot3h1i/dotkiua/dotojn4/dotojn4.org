  If you have the power to create such a time loop, then surely you also have the power to fix all the other problems with immortality?
#+end_quote

Possibly, but this seems like a much easier fix. No getting stuck in volcanos or stars or black holes or featureless voids for eons if you keep being brought backwards in time. No accidentally making eternal enemies who make it their sole purpose to give you as much suffering as possible if you keep being brought back in time to before you made them an enemy.

  And just one year?
#+end_quote

Well, it could be longer, but why? I don't want to become a baby all over again. Or becoming a kid that has to deal with mommy and daddy's misguided ideas on parenting and obedience. A year is plenty.

Plus, if it was any longer, I might actually have to work for money instead of just borrowing it from a bank and never returning it. /Shrug/.

  Of your current life and not some idealized scenario?
#+end_quote

What's wrong with my life :x? I like my current life.

Just not its future. It's dark dark future full of disease, poverty, and death.

  You, um, have highly atypical preferences. Please don't build an AI.
#+end_quote

Eh? If an AI traps humanity in a time loop, that's actually one of the better outcomes. I mean, compared to common AI stories where humanity is either wiped out or imprisoned in some kind of utilitarian farm.
