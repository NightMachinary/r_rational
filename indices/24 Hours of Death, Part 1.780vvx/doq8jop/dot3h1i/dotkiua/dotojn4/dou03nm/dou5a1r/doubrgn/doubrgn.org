  You would die relatively quickly

That's why you make lots of backups, and store them in a highly distributed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)][paxos cluster]] with error correcting codes. It's still not perfect, but it increases your expected lifespan by a lot. Or just reside in pure virtuality, which is even better (for safety, at least). Eventually, something will go wrong and you will die anyway, but that was already expected, given heat death and such.

#+begin_quote
  how would this even be implemented?
#+end_quote

If torture is detected, it kills you immediately. Hopefully a) you have a backup or b) people realize that torture doesn't work and stop doing it or c) people have self-modified to the point where no one is evil enough to even think about it or d) you have a police system of incorruptible friendly AIs that makes sure it never happens. It's not guaranteed to work, but then again nothing is. Your time loop thing could go terribly wrong if you forget to specify that your memories are erased each loop, for example.

#+begin_quote
  I can wish now for a time loop and be pretty certain that I won't regret it.
#+end_quote

You won't regret it because your memories will be erased at each starting point. Good for you, I guess?

#+begin_quote
  But if I start specifying the concrete details of a 10000 year ideal life, I could accidentally wish for something that I eventually find out really really sucks, and become trapped in something horrible.
#+end_quote

That's just a fixable design flaw. Give yourself the ability to opt out at any time /before/ permanently looping yourself.

#+begin_quote
  I don't see how this matters.
#+end_quote

Ohhhh, I may have misread what you said. When you said "I might actually have to work for money instead of just borrowing it from a bank and never returning it," I assumed this was what you were already doing with your actual life. Hopefully you just meant to do that within the time loop. Otherwise you're going to be in a lot of debt later on.
