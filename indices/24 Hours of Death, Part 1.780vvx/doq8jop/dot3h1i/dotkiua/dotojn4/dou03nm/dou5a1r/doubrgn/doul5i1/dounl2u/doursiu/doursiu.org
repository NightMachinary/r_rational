  If that's a problem for you, you might as well give up on immortality altogether, because eventually you will run into this problem. Even with unbroken continuity it's hard to argue that "you" and "you 1 million years in the future" are in any sense the same person.

Yeah, the Theseus ship problem is still an issue. A while back there was even a reddit commenter worrying about whether himself 1 second in the future is the same person as his current self. I don't really have a good answer for this one, I just operate on the heuristic that the me in the future is the same person as the me now, just in case it is true.

It's sorta like a Xanatos Gambit for me: either my future self is the same person as me, in which case my plans for my future self's well-being have raised the odds of my well-being, or my future self isn't me, and I just wasted my a large chunk of my existence planning for the well-being of some stranger. But hey, if I'm going to stop existing anyway (since I've been replaced by some stranger), I can't think of a much better way to spend it than by helping someone. So either way, I win.

^{Unless of course, my plans for my future self's well-being fail.}

^{^(Which they probably will.})

^{^(^(Damn it.}))

  Oh boy. You will go insane after a few thousand years.
#+end_quote

I really don't think I will, at least not much more insane than I currently am. Though obviously I can't prove this.

  So I feel like you've been holding a double standard throughout this conversation. I've been throwing out ideas for things that might be, er, somewhat plausible to implement in the real world. Things that require a few thousand conceptual iterations to work out all the bugs and solve all the engineering problems. And you act as if your time loop is a perfect magical construct that wouldn't just be some potentially faulty simulation in a matrioshka brain that could get horribly corrupted if a random neutron star passes through the solar system. Or wouldn't be run by a potentially unfriendly AI.

You're right, I have been acting like the time loop is a perfect magical construct instead of worrying implementation details. I have been holding a double standard because immortality is something I can actually see being implemented, whereas a time loop seems impossible in every way (at least according to our current understanding of physics), and hence I have been thinking of it as a wish for some kind of god to bring about perfectly without thinking about implementation details.

Though I'm definitely excluding the idea of simulating the time loop for my wish, for actually the same reasons you just mentioned: things in the real world screwing up the simulation. I don't want to be stuck in some simulation where I'm completely unaware and unable to deal with any real world threats to my safety.

  Or doesn't contain evil serial killers, drug cartels, and mafiosos who are bound to catch you and torture you into insanity at least some of the iterations due to sheer random chance
#+end_quote

Now this is why I post on this subreddit. That is a good point and I thank you for pointing it out. I suggested a time loop instead of immortality because that puts an upper bound on the duration of torture that a malicious entity can give you. But now that I think about it, a year is plenty of time for someone to torture you into insanity, so maybe a shorter loop is in order. Perhaps only a month or a week. Though I must say I have no idea what my torture-into-insanity threshold is, so even that could be too long. Huh.

But if I made it any shorter I wouldn't really be able to do anything in each iteration of the loop. Ugh X_X.

Maybe a way to control the length of each loop that requires me to make a signal every day? But no, I could be forced into making the signal against my will just like with the "opting" actions for an AI...

Hmm... I must contemplate this further.

  Your idea of eternal fun is... shockingly mundane. Yes, enjoying a good book is fun, and enjoying all the world's books would make a pleasant eternity for a while. Personally, I would want to push the limits of possible experience. Terraform an exoplanet and build a log cabin on it. Create an absurd virtual reality and live in it until I get bored. Et cetera. Which I can't do in a mere year long time loop of 21st century earth.
#+end_quote

Well, yes, admittedly, there are plenty of fun things you couldn't do within a time loop. It's a trade-off between safety and desire. How can I wish to colonize the universe without the risks of strange alien technology operating on alien physics being used to torture me in alien ways? How can I wish for an absurd virtual reality without the risks of being trapped by malicious game masters? There is of course, some minimal amount of happiness required (for me, it is the mundane pleasure of rereading all the world's books and replaying all the world's games over and over for eternity), but otherwise I tend to heavily favor safety on general principles.

And a time loop is one of the safest possible things... as far as I know.

(If you have any insights as to why it wouldn't be safe, please share them with me.)
