  Take the current point in time as the end of the time loop, and let it reset back to 1 year ago, and repeat forever. That would be true bliss for me.

If you have the power to create such a time loop, then surely you also have the power to fix all the other problems with immortality? And just /one/ year? Of your /current/ life and not some idealized scenario? You, um, have highly atypical preferences. Please don't build an AI.
