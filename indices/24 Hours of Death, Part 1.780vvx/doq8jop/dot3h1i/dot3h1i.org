  Suppose you could surpass the heat death of the universe and live for infinite time. What happens to a finite system over infinite time? It repeats itself infinitely often, necessarily, by the Poincare Recurrence Theorem. And now you're at Nietzschean Eternal Return. Sure, maybe you could find a way to randomize the experiences in some way so that the order never repeats itself, like the digits of an irrational number, but in the end you're still repeating every single experience infinitely often.

You know, this is actually my wish. Immortality by itself is quite burdensome, since there's all kinds of dangers where you end up trapped in some eternal void, unable to move or scream.

So rather than just ordinary immortality, I wish for an everlasting time loop. Take the current point in time as the end of the time loop, and let it reset back to 1 year ago, and repeat forever. That would be true bliss for me.
