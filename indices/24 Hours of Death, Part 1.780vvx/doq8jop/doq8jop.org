I guess this is as good of a place as any to weigh-in on the whole death conversation. While I'm totally on board with radical, unbounded life extension (provided that we can [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77lzq9/cgp_grey_about_death_and_the_false_pedestal_it/don1xp7/?st=j92yyr06&sh=1abefe82]["solve life"]] as [[/u/eaturbrainz]] put it), I don't think that death is as bad or even as meaningful as people think it is. Well, to qualify: death is very bad /currently,/ since life is so short, but in the limit of lifespan the badness goes down to zero.

Let me explain.

There is, of course, the heat death of the universe to deal with, which provides a physical upper bound on possible lifespan. The actual upper bound for most people must come sooner, though, since near the end, there won't be enough free energy to sustain previous populations, and the resources of some people will need to be cannibalized to extend the lives of others. You could still probably get in 10^{100} good years though.

But far sooner than that, you'll run into memory limits. You, as you currently exist, cannot survive past much more than a few hundred or a thousand years in any circumstances, simply due to the memory capacity of the human brain. Eventually, you'll forget all your old memories, and your values may drift over time. Compare the you right now to the you in 10,000 years. If the two of you don't share any memories or values, in what sense are you meaningfully the same person? The you of the present has just died slowly and continuously over the course of a few thousand years. In fact, this has already happened to you. Do you remember much about your early childhood? Probably not. And as a child, you certainly valued far different things than you do now, and if asked, would have said that you never wanted to stop valuing them ("I don't wanna grow up!"). Effectively, child-you was murdered by puberty. Should we then medically stunt puberty to prevent child death?

Suppose you can artificially expand your memory capacity. Great, you've delayed the inevitable. After a few billion years, your mind will hog a large amount of physical resources preserving all those memories. You can either continue hogging resources until the entire universe is just you, or you can let the old memories die to allow new people to exist.

But then there are the mathematical limits. Your mind is just a specific type of dynamical system, after all, no matter what laws of physics implement it. Even if you could in principle expand forever, I think it very likely that the dynamical system will become unstable and either bifurcate into multiple entities, or just cease to be conscious in any sense meaningful to original-you. In other words, "you" have a maximum finite size.

Suppose you could surpass the heat death of the universe and live for infinite time. What happens to a finite system over infinite time? It repeats itself infinitely often, necessarily, by the Poincare Recurrence Theorem. And now you're at Nietzschean [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return][Eternal Return]]. Sure, maybe you could find a way to randomize the experiences in some way so that the order never repeats itself, like the digits of an irrational number, but in the end you're still repeating every single experience infinitely often. And if the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time][B theory of time]] is true, then this state of affairs may not be meaningfully distinguishable from living for a long finite time in a block universe where all time-points are equally real. Such as the universe we probably live in now.

Of course, there are a /lot/ of possible experiences to be had before repetition occurs. But maybe not as many as you'd think. After cutting out the undesirable possible experiences, which are either horribly painful, just "meh," or are completely random noise, you're left with a small subset of meaningful and desirable experiences. Many of which are similar enough to be lumped into equivalence classes. At the end of the day, it might just be possible to have every meaningful equivalence class of experience before your 10^{100} years are up. Maybe save storage space by uploading everyone's memories into a single galactic memory database, which individual people can "check out" or contribute to.

--------------

When you take in all these considerations, "death" as a category starts to look rather meaningless in the limit. In once sense it is unavoidable, and in another sense you shouldn't have ever expected otherwise. The induction hypothesis of the "proof by induction" argument for immortality just sort of fizzles out after 10^{n} years of life.

If any of these ideas seems horrifying or painful to think about, I suggest that it is a good idea to re-align your expectations so that you are happy and content with this state of affairs. After all, worrying about what you cannot change is pointless suffering, and as transhumanists we seek to eliminate all pointless suffering.
