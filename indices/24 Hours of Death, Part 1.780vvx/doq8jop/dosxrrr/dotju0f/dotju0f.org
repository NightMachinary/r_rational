I think humanity should certainly investigate all possibilities, including somehow escaping into other universes and self-modifying to grow in complexity unboundedly. I would put the chance that consciousness can grow to arbitrary size without instability, mathematically speaking, at <20%, and the chance that it could do so given whatever the final laws of physics turn out to be at << 1%. Suppose we eventually prove a mathematical theorem limiting us to a maximum finite size. What then? I don't think this is cause for despair. It's like despairing that 2+2=4 ("I want 2+2 to be equal to anything it wants to be! Logic is unjust!") I think despair at the finiteness of existence will just dissolve away in the presence of such a theorem.
