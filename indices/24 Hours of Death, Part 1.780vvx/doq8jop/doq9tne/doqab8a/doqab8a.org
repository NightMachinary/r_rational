  Is it really so ordinary to wind up an intuitively dramatically different person after nothing but puberty?

That depends on how old you are. Right after puberty, you are still very continuous with your child-self, but that fades over time, I think. What you have said mostly describes me as well, though I don't remember much about my childhood before age 10 except in a weird dissociated third-person. My values and concept of fun have drifted with experience as well. But I'm only 23. My parents remember even less, and are presumably much more different than their child selves.

Still, the "child-murder" thing was a bit of a rhetorical exaggeration.
