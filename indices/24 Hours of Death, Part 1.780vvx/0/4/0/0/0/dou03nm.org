  No getting stuck in volcanos or stars or black holes or featureless voids for eons

I've been assuming that immortality doesn't magically violate physics. You could have a robust body that doesn't age, with continuous backups, but a volcano or black hole would still kill your body. I also assume we would modify brain structure so that torture is effectively impossible, in a way that can't be surgically reversed without killing you.

  Well, it could be longer, but why? .... What's wrong with my life :x? I like my current life.

I mean, while we're creating hypotheticals, why not just construct your ideal 10,000 year life full of wonder and adventure, and then loop /that/ for eternity?

  If an AI traps humanity in a time loop, that's actually one of the better outcomes

It's not the worst thing that could happen, but it's just such a waste, when so much more could be achieved. It's like the short story I saw posted on here a long time ago, "Everyone is Todd," where the AI just populates the universe with copies of a happy guy named Todd. I mean, technically this adds a lot of happiness to the universe, but what's the point if it's all the same?

  Plus, if it was any longer, I might actually have to work for money instead of just borrowing it from a bank and never returning it.

How old are you and what are you doing with your life? (Don't feel pressured to answer if you don't want to).
