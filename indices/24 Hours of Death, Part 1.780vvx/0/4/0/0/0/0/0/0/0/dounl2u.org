  This runs into the issue of whether your replicated selves/uploaded selves are actually you
#+end_quote

If that's a problem for you, you might as well give up on immortality altogether, because eventually you will run into this problem. Even with unbroken continuity it's hard to argue that "you" and "you 1 million years in the future" are in any sense the same person.

  When I said time loop, I mean time resets, but my memories don't.

Oh boy. You will go insane after a few thousand years.

  There's a very dangerous loophole

So I feel like you've been holding a double standard throughout this conversation. I've been throwing out ideas for things that /might/ be, er, /somewhat/ plausible to implement in the real world. Things that require a few thousand conceptual iterations to work out all the bugs and solve all the engineering problems. And you act as if your time loop is a perfect magical construct that /wouldn't/ just be some potentially faulty simulation in a matrioshka brain that could get horribly corrupted if a random neutron star passes through the solar system. Or wouldn't be run by a potentially unfriendly AI. Or doesn't make you absurdly lonely because you seem to be the only one looping. Or doesn't contain evil serial killers, drug cartels, and mafiosos who are bound to catch you and torture you into insanity at least /some/ of the iterations due to sheer random chance, since for some reason you seem perfectly content to time loop /the world as it exists today./ And on that topic...

  And then a few thousand iterations later, I forget I ever played the game or read the book and thus can once again enjoy them like they are new.

Your idea of eternal fun is... shockingly mundane. Yes, enjoying a good book is fun, and enjoying all the world's books would make a pleasant eternity for a while. Personally, I would want to push the limits of possible experience. Terraform an exoplanet and build a log cabin on it. Create an absurd virtual reality and live in it until I get bored. Et cetera. Which I can't do in a mere year long time loop of 21st century earth.
