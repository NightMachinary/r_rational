  That is a good point and I thank you for pointing it out.

Glad I could be of service!

  so maybe a shorter loop is in order

It is very odd to me that the first thing you think of to solve this problem is to shorten the time loop. Not kicking violent people out of the loop and also giving yourself instant reset ability like in Mother of Learning. Or giving yourself unstoppable superpowers that activate when you are threatened.

  (If you have any insights as to why it wouldn't be safe, please share them with me.)

To make any sort of immortality truly work, we basically need to solve intelligence. We need a way of accurately predicting what things will enhance our well-being in the long run, and what won't. We need to solve a dozen engineering challenges, like how to permanently cure psychopathy so that no one ever chooses to do evil (and do this /without/ becoming one of a thousand fictional dystopias), how to create a fail-safe system of incorruptible friendly AIs to maintain post-scarcity and be the gods of VRs, et cetera.

The way you were talking about your time loop, it sounded like if a genie materialized in front of you right then and offered you the chance to enter it, you would have said yes. Without having a way out, and without having considered the problem of evil people in the time loop with you. Even if these problems could be solved, I'm not sure you actually last /eternally/ without going insane. You say you "really don't think you will" go insane. That's not a great level of confidence considering the stakes. People are extremely bad at modeling their own preferences. People can change in personality over time.

Here is a possible scenario. It's been 200 years; mentally, you are the oldest person in the time loop by far. You have read tens of thousands of books. And slowly, surely, the books have changed you. They gave you insights you had never before considered. They showed you a beautiful vision of well-being, of what it means to be human. They changed your priorities, which had seemed utterly inviolable when you started out (as priorities tend to seem). (Or maybe you're immune to books, and in one iteration you accidentally drink some orange juice containing a psychoactive drug, which sufficiently changes your neural structure - who knows?) You decide you want to accomplish something great and lasting. You decide you want to connect with people more than you ever have before. So you begin writing a magnum opus, of all the things you have read and seen. You make friends sharing your wisdom with others, looping them into your adventures. And then, just as things are getting good... the time loop resets. Everything you've written is gone. None of your friends remember you. You have to start all over. You try again, get a bit farther - and it ends again. You grow frustrated. You don't have the time to build what you want to build, to connect with others how you want to connect, before it's all wiped away. You become Sisyphus, pushing the boulder up the hill over and over again. You always wish for just one more day, one more hour. You grow to hate your world. You try to kill yourself. You try to kill everyone else. It's all wiped away again at the end of the year. Maybe you become sane again after a thousand years, maybe you don't. This is your eternity now.

The other disturbing thing to me is how much the time loop is just focused on /you/. Not anyone else. I've been taking it as an axiom that immortality should include the whole human race, so that we can all grow and learn together. In your scenario, everyone just keeps living slightly different variants of their miserable 21st century lives, over and over again. The drug cartels will continue torturing people, over and over again, but perhaps different people in slightly different ways, due to the butterfly effect of your presence. You are effectively freezing in place a large amount of suffering for everyone else.

I'll leave with a general set of principles. Any set of changes toward some utopia should be 1) Reversible and fail-safe 2) Implemented slowly enough to give time to evaluate the merits of each change 3) Value-aligned, and provably so, if at all possible.
