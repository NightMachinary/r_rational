  The other disturbing thing to me is how much the time loop is just focused on you. Not anyone else. I've been taking it as an axiom that immortality should include the whole human race, so that we can all grow and learn together. In your scenario, everyone just keeps living slightly different variants of their miserable 21st century lives, over and over again. The drug cartels will continue torturing people, over and over again, but perhaps different people in slightly different ways, due to the butterfly effect of your presence. You are effectively freezing in place a large amount of suffering for everyone else.

*Dream shattered* D:

Wow, I... I really should have thought of that first. I guess on some level I was thinking that since only I was keeping my memories, only I am in the time loop, everyone else just lives through time normally and isn't affected...

...but that isn't really how time loops work is it? I mean, it doesn't really make sense to say that I'm living an infinite amount of time while everyone else is living a finite amount in the same period, even though they are moving through time at the same speed, and have to sapient enough to react to whatever changes my butterfly effects are causing, otherwise all kind of infrastructure would break down.

The other points you raised I could still get around, but this is the final nail in the coffin. I mean, I suppose I could kick everyone else out of the time loop, but then I would have to live like a savage, scavenging for food, having no electricity or Internet or anything that requires other people to maintain...

Now all my wishes are dead. :(
