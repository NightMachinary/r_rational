  I've been assuming that immortality doesn't magically violate physics. You could have a robust body that doesn't age, with continuous backups, but a volcano or black hole would still kill your body.
#+end_quote

In this case, you wouldn't have to worry about life becoming repetitive. You would die relatively quickly (maybe about 1 billion years or so, more if you're cautious), just from sheer random chance. You're not so much immortal in this case, just hardy and healthy.

  I also assume we would modify brain structure so that torture is effectively impossible, in a way that can't be surgically reversed without killing you.
#+end_quote

That would be nice, but how would this even be implemented? You can turn off pain sensors sure, but there's still other kinds of torture. Like torturing your loved ones in front of you, and all other kinds of mental/emotional/social torture. Hell an enemy could just lock you in an empty box until the boredom and sensory deprivation drives you insane.

  why not just construct your ideal 10,000 year life full of wonder and adventure
#+end_quote

Because when it comes down to it, I don't have a concrete example of an ideal life. I can wish now for a time loop and be pretty certain that I won't regret it. But if I start specifying the concrete details of a 10000 year ideal life, I could accidentally wish for something that I eventually find out really really sucks, and become trapped in something horrible.

  "Everyone is Todd," where the AI just populates the universe with copies of a happy guy named Todd. I mean, technically this adds a lot of happiness to the universe, but what's the point if it's all the same?

This actually reminds me of Unsong. [[#s][Spoilers]]

  How old are you and what are you doing with your life? (Don't feel pressured to answer if you don't want to).
#+end_quote

I don't see how this matters. Do older/younger people want to work their asses off? Do they want to live frugally so they can save money for things when they could instead just have that money? Are there things people do with their lives that would cause them to refuse free loans from the bank that they never have to return? :S Who refuses free money?

I mean, suppose that on a whim, I decided to go on a round-the-world tour during one of the loops. I'm not going to want to spend years working to earn money so I can pay for that tour when I can just borrow it from the bank. And if I just borrow it from the bank anyway in a long time loop, I now have to spend the rest of the loop being harassed by debt collectors.
