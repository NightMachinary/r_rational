  That's why you make lots of backups, and store them in a highly distributed paxos cluster with error correcting codes. It's still not perfect, but it increases your expected lifespan by a lot. Or just reside in pure virtuality, which is even better (for safety, at least).
#+end_quote

This runs into the issue of whether your replicated selves/uploaded selves are actually you, instead of something like an identical twin or a split personality. Even if we assume that they are, this actually makes you more vulnerable to torture too, seeing as it is now easier to grab some copy of you and imprison it.

  Eventually, something will go wrong and you will die anyway, but that was already expected, given heat death and such.
#+end_quote

Hence my wish for an eternal time loop, which by definition, wouldn't ever let me die (permanently).

#+begin_quote
  If torture is detected, it kills you immediately.
#+end_quote

/Gulp/.

I would be super worried about false positives and false negatives.

  Your time loop thing could go terribly wrong if you forget to specify that your memories are erased each loop, for example. You won't regret it because your memories will be erased at each starting point.
#+end_quote

Err.. wait, I didn't explain myself well. When I said time loop, I mean time resets, but my memories don't. Like in Mother of Learning or Groundhog Day.

It would be pointless if my memories reset every loop because then I wouldn't know that I am in a time loop. It would just create countless time-copies of me that are all very depressed thinking that they aren't in a time loop, even though they actually are. So you would just end up with a bunch of identical depressed Todds.

Eventually my memories would repeat, sure. But I wouldn't forget I'm in a time loop since I get yearly reminders. And the fact that my memories repeat is great: it means I'm forgetting things, so I can enjoy them again. I can play a game until I'm bored of it, read a book until I'm bored of it, etc, etc. And then a few thousand iterations later, I forget I ever played the game or read the book and thus can once again enjoy them like they are new. Have you ever reread an old book or played an old game that you haven't seen in a long time? That's what it would feel like, which is awesome.

So the fact that I forget stuff means I wouldn't ever have to worry about running out of books to read or games to play in my infinite time, as long as the current pool of them is sufficiently large, which it almost certainly is.

#+begin_quote
  That's just a fixable design flaw. Give yourself the ability to opt out at any time before permanently looping yourself.
#+end_quote

Let me put it this way, have you read all those articles about designing AIs that let you "opt in" or "opt out" of stuff? There's a very dangerous loophole in that those AIs could forcibly prevent you from or push you into the "opting" actions. It's the same issue here: how would I ensure that I can retain this "opting" ability? What if my wish somehow results in my mind being altered into not "opting" correctly, or simply forgetting that I can "opt" at all?

In general, whenever you make a wish or contract of any form, you should definitely include options to get out of it yes, but design it so that you shouldn't ever need to use those options in the first place, since there's a chance you won't be able to when problems come up.

#+begin_quote
  Hopefully you just meant to do that within the time loop. Otherwise you're going to be in a lot of debt later on.
#+end_quote

Hahaha yes, I definitely wouldn't do that outside a time loop.
