If there is a core of memories or values that I can maintain, even allowing other, peripheral memories of values to be lost over time, that core could be considered me. Lifetime preservation technologies might even specifically enable such a core of an individual to be persisted and preserved alongside. While we may observe dramatic personality change over our lifetimes, speculatively we are as likely to reach an asymptotic personality.

Also, a system where we may persist for an infinite time is likely to be so alien, and so disturbing to our current understanding of physical limitations, that it might be worth exploring regardless of the implications, because it is highly likely our explorations will prove it to be impossible. Pragmatically, the speculation regarding infinite recurrence should not dissuade someone from investigating immortality because the search for and arrival at this state is likely to generate fruitful insights about the nature of the universe and existence that will make us rethink the fear of being trapped in an infinite pattern.
