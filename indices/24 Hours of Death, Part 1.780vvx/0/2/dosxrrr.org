My reaction to the 'finite system over infinite time' concept is effectively 'Okay then, so we need to (try to) work out how to make our systems non-finite.'.

Assuming bounds, we get entropic death. From the existence of /anything/ at all rather than Nothing, we postulate something-out-of-nothing and get hope. If the universe has a finite time, maybe we can break out of the universe and get infinite time. If any one physical system has physical size constraints, maybe we can tap into infinite dimensions and become entirely unconstrained, stepping up maybe-infinite steps of higher mathematics and Even Higher Mathematics in all the infinite permutations that can exist, as well as seeing countless civilisations made up of minds of all sorts of intellectual levels.

Maybe we can't. Maybe we'll reach a point of knowing everything meaningful, and know futility and despair. Maybe we'll die then, or earlier, and it will end up being just as final, just as pointless an ending as if we gave up and ended the path right now. But right now, there's still subjective hope. Since we don't know for sure--and even if it looks certain, we can still doubt the completeness of our understanding--there's still a sliver of hope that giving up isn't inevitable. I for one am willing to pursue that infinitesimal possibility of success rather than surrender early to 100% failure.

'think it very likely' (that my success is not possible) is not enough to deter me, not before I've personally wrestled with such issues and done my utmost to resolve them down to the very last quantum unit of available time.

--------------

In the past, on happily fewer occasions than would need a whole hand to count, I've thought I was about to die. My feelings at the time can be summed up as a resigned 'Oh, well.'. The absence of hope is not unnecessary suffering to be prevented, but rather the presence of hope represents more resources to be greedy for, more that can be done, experienced, remembered (even when so much of what is remembered is, for the time being, frustratingly lost as though by a 'tax'). By crippling our ambition, we can be happier, perhaps. By crippling our desire to read new books, we could perhaps be happier in our ignorance, living a simple life in which we never read a single book and never felt the slightest suffering from difficulties in getting new books. I do not fulfil goals in order to become happy, and if I did could use more direct methods. I approve of myself being happy when my happiness is a symptom of /doing what I want to do/, accomplishing things which I want to accomplish, which is fulfilling such goals. Learning, experiencing, remembering, growing (at least where relevant for myself).
