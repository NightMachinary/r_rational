I don't think the finite memory thing is necessarily a problem. If I have a ruler and am trying to draw a straight line longer than the ruler's length, I can just draw the line using the ruler, then line the ruler up with the line I previously drew, and so on ad infinitum. This works even for very small rulers. In a similar way, as long as the trajectory of my actions is always satisfying to me within the range of whatever memory capacity I possess, it seems like I can achieve meaningful personal growth.

The other things you point out are more serious.
