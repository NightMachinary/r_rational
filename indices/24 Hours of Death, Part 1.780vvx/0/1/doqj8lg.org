I think most of us agree, then, that there is a point of diminishing returns. But it's still possible to do immensely better than we can now. I feel like my life is just starting, there's such an enormous amount of basic stuff I haven't been able to do (mostly from lack of financial resources), and I'm in my 30s.

Already, biology has decided to make me less physically attractive and possibly less mentally capable than I was in my 20s. Screwing me over before I ever even get into a financial position where I can enjoy my life. And this life timeline of mine is still far better than the typical experience of most humans who have lived in the last 100 years.

Even if I get things together and have a brief 'golden age', 50 is a little over a decade away for me. 60 just a little over 2 decades. Our lives are actually stupidly short, even if it doesn't necessarily feel that way on a day to day basis.

If my brain were converted to a digital system and sped up a million fold, I could experience far more interesting things by living millions of years in virtual reality, exhaustively exploring the possibility space I cannot explore as a mortal sack of meat.
