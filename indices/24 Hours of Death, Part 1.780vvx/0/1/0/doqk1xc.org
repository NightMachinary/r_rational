Agreed: aging is terrible and minimum lifespan ought to be extended as far as possible. I'm not sure how long I want to or even could live while retaining my current personal identity (could I maintain my sense of self over a billion years? I have no idea), but at least as an immortal I would have the option of changing my mind later.
