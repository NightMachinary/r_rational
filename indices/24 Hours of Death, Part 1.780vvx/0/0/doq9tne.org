  In fact, this has already happened to you. Do you remember much about your early childhood? Probably not. And as a child, you certainly valued far different things than you do now, and if asked, would have said that you never wanted to stop valuing them ("I don't wanna grow up!"). Effectively, child-you was murdered by puberty. Should we then medically stunt puberty to prevent child death?

Ok, so maybe I'm the weird one out here, but...

I remember a fair amount of my early childhood. I have a few isolated memories of infancy and being a toddler, but I've got /plenty/ of being a child, then an adolescent.

I also ended up feeling like my teen years were the "odd years out". Teen me was a horrible person and didn't even /enjoy/ being teen me -- total edgelord loser with no sense of getting off his ass. Adult-me is basically a lot like kid-me, but with more life skills and an interest in sex.

Is it really so ordinary to wind up an intuitively dramatically different person after nothing but /puberty/?
