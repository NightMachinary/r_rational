I mean, I feel continuous in the sense that I don't remember any discontinuities, and I have the same core personality. But child-me had lots of specific beliefs and fantasies, and if you asked him, he would have said that he never wanted to let them go. Now, I've mostly forgotten them, and I don't really care about them any more. As for my memories before age 10, it's not that I have less capacity for remembering my childhood than average so much as I haven't actively reinforced those memories in a long time. If I try, I can sort of access some of them, but they seem very distant and vague. They are more like general emotional impressions and flashes of images that I'm building into narratives about myself.
