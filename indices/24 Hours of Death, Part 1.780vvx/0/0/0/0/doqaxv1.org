I don't care all that much about continuity in the first place, but I remember fairly well back till 2. I know the memories are accurate because I've used them to draw maps of old locations and had them confirmed by adults. I liked it when my loved ones were happy and took pleasure in much the same things I do now...affection, food, fulfilling the preferences of others, dancing, singing, sunlight, striving and achievement, even sex... I haven't changed that much - my basic values seem stable. Everything since then has only been increasingly sophisticated means to achieve this for myself and others.

Of course I am... more ...now than I was then. But I don't think any highly important stuff was lost. In any case, yes, I'd definitely self modify to forget less stuff if I could do so without ruining anything else. You don't need to modify the brain necessarily, you can just make faithful sense-recordings that the brain may revisit.
