The lack of connection to 'material physics' has nothing to do with rationality or lack thereof; give me magic and I'll work with magic.

I agree with you that the work is arational, but that's because none of the mythic characters and few of the mortals have consequentialist desires in the sense of visibly wanting particular future outcomes. To write rationalfic in the setting, you'd either need to insert a human protagonist that wanted the future to have some particular property, or drastically change the character of one of the mythic characters.
