I wouldn't call Sandman a rationalist fiction. However that doesn't mean the work was without merit. The series is an exploration of human nature through the use mythic and occult imagery. It still has a lot to so say even though its not strictly rational.

You should also read Lucifer the spinoff series if you enjoyed Sandman.
