  Assuming that Death cared about long lives.
#+end_quote

No. That's not the assumption being made here. Look deeper.

Death in the /Sandman/ series isn't a fan of people dying. "She" just accepts it. But not because of a love of the process, she appears apathetic to it, but because she doesn't have any real goals of her own. Death regularly becomes human for a day just to remind herself what humans are like, yet afterward she never tries to improve her experiences or those of other intelligent beings.

She is shown to like humans and humanity enough to revel in their culture and care about individual people one by one as they die, but not enough to do anything about their struggles, or even any problems that get in the way of the cultural developments and positive humanist messages she personally claims to enjoy. Developments driven by the same people that pointless, meaningless deaths squash out constantly.

In this system where powerful immortals do and create fuck-all and are impressed by human-scale creations, more, longer sentient lives equals more Mary Poppins-es and shades of black eyeliner to entertain Death. She's not /reacting/ rationally even if she doesn't care about humans living long lives. Even if she were stupid or irrational (for a good reason) about this, she'd act differently if she were a logical being capable of acting on personal goals.

Death in /Sandman/ is presented as just a puppet for natural forces, she sort of is just a natural force, so she doesn't do anything about it--not even justifying her own lack of actions with a vague greater good excuse. That's not very rationally presented, but is rather simply romanticized and anthropomorphized because that's the story; nothing about that is explored or extended one step further than that.

*Positive* afterlives aren't described well enough to judge, but the number of people who would end up going to bad ends by rational inspection of the environment presented are...not good for final moral judgement of a rational immortal being responsible for taking care of everyone and anything that dies anywhere in the universe. If not malevolent or seriously impotent, Death in /Sandman/ can't be a rational process, let alone a rationally-constructed (let alone personally rational) character. Even a consensus reality afterlife smorgasbord screws atheists and other non-easy-infinite-paradise people really, really hard, and for no mechanically logical reason. This doesn't jell with Death as presented.

/Sandman/ examined rationally and canonically, with no other changes and just a focus shift, is pure, inescapable eldritch horror. Uncaring omnipresent beings of unimaginable power ruling over abstract processes that render intelligent beings' goals, and even lives, completely meaningless. Focusing on one listless git's journey amidst all that that is not rational fiction.
