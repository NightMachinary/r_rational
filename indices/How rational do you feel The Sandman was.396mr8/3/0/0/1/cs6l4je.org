The problem with dealing with the Endless in general is that the personality is always a slave to their nature.

Death, no matter how much she likes someone, is always going to be the last one standing in the end.

Destiny is always going to be helpless to change any fate he sees.

Desire is always going to going to be a slave to every whim, pleasant and unpleasant, kind and cruel that occurs to ... (hir? Desire is also always going to be havok to pronouns)

Even Destruction, in denying his nature and embracing creativity is buggered. Every thing he makes during his appearance is effectively useless. The large dinner he makes, no-one eats. The art he makes, has only an uncultured dog to appreciate it...

It's ultimately a story about Dream getting pissed off about it, and changing it in the most direct way he can. (Which isn't direct at all tbh)
