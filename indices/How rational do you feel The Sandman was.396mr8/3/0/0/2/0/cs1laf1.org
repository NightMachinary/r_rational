If taken to the logical conclusion, that devolves the entire story into non-sentient, abstract parts of the universe talking to each other and generally faffing about. Which is...ehh, different I guess. But if anything, that's even less rational a story than more anthropomorphic interpretations.

I think the idea was that their powers and duties were formed as part of some collective reality. Doesn't explain why they wouldn't use those powers to achieve immortal-scale personal goals, so that is still pretty sub-rational.
