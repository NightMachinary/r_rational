Not strictly rationalist, but science-themed: Loquat's "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjFphY1fMBk][Time Bending]]" ([[http://artists.letssingit.com/loquat-lyrics-time-bending-kgm8wls#axzz2tWbltnQJ][lyrics]]).

Several of their other songs have rationalist-friendly lyrics--"Comedown's Worse" and "Harder Hit" are the two I think of--but aren't science-themed.
