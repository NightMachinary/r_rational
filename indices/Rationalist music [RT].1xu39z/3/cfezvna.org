My personal favorite as well. Love the imagery of "Not a sun rise, but a galaxy rise." I think the only 'rationalist' music I've heard besides symphony of science is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtFzV6P4EUs][Nightwish's "Song of Myself"]], and even then, it's kinda iffy. I've heard a decent amount of transhumanist music, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as rational, although I guess it could be classified as a subgenre.

Actually, forgot about [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U][Tim Minchin's "Storm"]], which definitely qualifies.
