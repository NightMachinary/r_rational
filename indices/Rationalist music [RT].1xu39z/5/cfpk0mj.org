I believe our fearless Eliezer himself referenced MUSE's "Butterflies and Hurricanes" at one point. It hits upon rationalist themes quite nicely, especially for a mainstream song:

#+begin_quote
  Change\\
  Everything you are\\
  And everything you were\\
  Your number has been called\\
  [...]\\
  Best\\
  You've got to be the best\\
  You've got to save the world\\
  And use this chance to be\\
     heard\\
  Your time is now
#+end_quote

A bit general, but appropriate--especially since the titular phenomenon is commonly referenced in rationalist fiction. Personally, I hear this song whenever I think of Worm, HPMOR, or Game of Thrones. And there are other MUSE songs which may be similarly applicable: for instance, Madness, which concludes that the traditional romantic ideal of love--i.e., purely emotional/impulsive *and* fully irrational--is literally a form of madness.
