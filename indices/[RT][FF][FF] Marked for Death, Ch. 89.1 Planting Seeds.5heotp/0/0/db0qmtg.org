There was a lot of discussion of this in-thread, and [[/u/EagleJarl][u/EagleJarl]] reminded us that we should base our analysis on Japanese culture rather than western ones. The western reading is something like "Your beauty calls my spirit to persevere in its pure and chivalrous love for you until you welcome me past your cold exterior to begin our lives together in domestic bliss", with extra hints of 'being her defender'.

Japanese symbolism:

Holly: "Looking (Single and "--")"

Hydrangea: Pride

White Lily: Purity/Chastity

Cherry blossoms: Kind/Gentle

Daffodil: Respect

(Just flowering) Cactus: (beginnings of) Lust/Sex

This is basically the flower language equivalent, when combined with Hazou's totally straight-faced delivery, of "I think I like you and you're really pretty and I promise I don't mean anything nasty or dirty but if you tried to kiss me I wouldn't say no and do you maybe like me back?"

Like, third-grader "do you like me circle y / n" - tier shit. Mari is a goddamn genius.
