tl;dr: No, the universe does /not/ revolve around the protagonist, in this case.

The main character of the story is highly competent and through sheer luck has access to the complete life-experience of a high-level cultivator from the past, but it's not the kind of completely broken hax where nothing else can even remotely compare, and its relevance falls off very quickly after, like... chapter 500-ish? I haven't seen it mentioned in a very, very long time. As the story has shifted further and further away from shonen-esque 'beat things, loot the corpses, level up' storytelling, and more towards hard science fiction and conspiracies that wouldn't be out of place in a James Bond movie, the author has correspondingly devoted more and more attention to the protagonist's beliefs and thoughts and less towards painstakingly detailing exactly how powerful the protagonist is now.

This, I think, was an intentional choice by the author to support the premise of 'might does not make right' that constitutes one of the story's main thematic threads. The protagonist's /powers/ aren't important, his /actions/ and /beliefs/ are.

The power-cap of the book is pretty sane as well; the story raises the stakes by expanding the scale of the conflict on an economic and social level, rather than just by multiplying the number of planets the characters can explode with a single pinky-flick by ten or whatever, and the story does a good job of keeping previously introduced figures of power relevant to the story- and, moreso, keeping them relevant in a way that doesn't rely on personal destructive potential. Characters in this book tend to remain salient in the reader's mind as 'the cunning, paranoid, but also somewhat tired head of the magic CIA' or 'the charismatic ideological villain who wants to change the social structure of his culture' rather than 'the level 4 guy with the fire superpowers' or 'the level 28 guy who can summon evil demonic dragons from the nether realm to devour souls' or whatever.

People are /people/ in this story, not walking superpowers plastered on top of the generic murderhobo character archetype. That's one of the things I really like about this story, the fact that the characters are memorable not for /what superpowers they have/ but rather /what they fight for and what they believe in/.

(Though, the protagonist's /girlfriend/, on the other hand, plays the "I am a ridiculously overpowered prodigy who can handily beat everybody else in my age range and level up like it ain't nothing" thing straight, as a de-facto genius prodigy. The novel repeatedly states that, on sheer destructive power and rate of leveling up, the romantic interest beats the protagonist just about every time.

I am pretty sure this is the author poking just a little fun at how xianxia stories usually go, by taking the stereotypical 'beat everybody up forever' shonen protagonist and making them sort of like a 'hey, while our protagonist's story is going on, don't forget that /everybody else/ is also doing things behind the scenes too, it's not like our protagonist is the only active mover and shaker in the whole damn universe' reminder. Because as all xianxia readers go, a lot of xianxia falls into that 'only the protagonist can get anything done, ever, and all the other characters just end up scenery' trap.

It's a nice reminder, I think! The "Slytherin marries Gryffindor" relationship the two of them have is pretty interesting, and it helps set up an implicit tone of egalitarianism. No matter how badass the protagonist gets, he's never so badass that he's the /only/ badass in town. If he ever forgets that, I'm sure his girlfriend will be all too willing to cheerfully beat it into his head in a very literal sense :P

I really like the romantic interest in this novel, if you can't tell. It is literally the only meaningful romance I have ever seen in xianxia, where the characters are actually organically drawn to each other because of mutual respect for each other rather than just because most xianxia writers feel like a protagonist isn't complete without a beautiful flowervase girlfriend.)
