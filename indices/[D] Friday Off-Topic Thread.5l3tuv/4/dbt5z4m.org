I recently came across a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU][piece of music]] claimed to reduce anxiety signs by 65% in a scientific study. There is also a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYnA9wWFHLI][10 hour version]].

Unfortunately, I could not locate the study itself online, just a link to the [[http://themindlab.co.uk/][PR/marketing firm]] that supposedly did it.

Anyway, it is a pretty trippy effect for me. Although I don't know if it's necessarily any better than what you get with brainwave entrainment software e.g. [[http://gnaural.sourceforge.net/][gnaural]].
