Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely keep it in mind! You make good points. That said, I don't believe I have it in me to actually write a webserial. There's no way I could keep to a consistent schedule, to publish unfinished work in parts, to work purely linearly and to be unable to revise backwards. It's not something everyone has in them, and I really admire anyone who does.
