Y'all are great folks, and I'm grateful that this community exists. [[/r/rational]] is why I started using Reddit to begin with, and if it disappeared then, well, I think I'd still use Reddit, but maybe just checking in once a week or so for fanfic recommendations and stuff. I'd probably get everything else from other places or just stop spending time on those things.

It isn't just the good fiction. [[/r/rational]] feels like a community in a bigger way than most subreddits, in part because of these Monday and Friday threads. We've talked about politics, commiserated together, helped each other become more productive or discussed headspace issues. We don't just talk fic, but support each other, is what I'm saying, and I wanted to make sure that I expressed my appreciation of that in this, the year's last off-topic thread.
