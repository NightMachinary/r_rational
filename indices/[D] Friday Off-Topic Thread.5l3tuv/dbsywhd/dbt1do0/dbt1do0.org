For liberal vs conservative, the most successful predictor is probably going to be something along the lines of "Does this seem like something the Red Tribe would like, or does this seem like something The Blue Tribe would like?" The actual positions are all a horrible mishmash that cheerfully flip around based on signalling, countersignalling, being in or out of power and more. Simple tribalism probably has the best predictive power.
