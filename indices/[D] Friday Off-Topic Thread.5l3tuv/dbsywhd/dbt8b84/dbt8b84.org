This is somewhat oversimplified, but perhaps the simplest way to describe liberal/conservative is with the Nolan Chart:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart]]

Conservatives believe that the government should interfere less in economic issues, and more in personal ones (like same-sex marriage) Liberals believe the government should interfere more in economic issues and less in personal ones. And then there are Libertarians who believe it should interfere less in both, and Authoritarians believe it should interfere more in both.

Of course, all of these lie somewhere on a spectrum. Everyone has some collection of opinions which doesn't perfectly match any particular ideology, but it's useful to be able to group together with people who have similar ideas and try to work in a direction closer to what you think is optimal.
