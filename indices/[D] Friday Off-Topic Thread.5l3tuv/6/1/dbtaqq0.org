Epistemic status: I took AP Chem last year, so this should be fairly accurate on the simplest level, but I'm certainly not an expert. Also I have no idea if they actually do it this way, this is just a way that they could.

So the ideal gas law is that temperature of a gas is equal to the volume multiplied by the pressure divided by the number of moles of gas, multiplied by a constant. We know the constant, and we can experimentally find the pressure and number of moles of gas in some volume that we decide. So from those, we know the temperature.

Note that this is a simplified explanation because real gasses aren't ideal gasses, but it's still fairly correct.
