Question: The thermosphere above Earth measures about 2500 degrees celsius. That is, the gas particles up there sit at about that temperature (it actually fluctuates wildly but that's besides the point) But due to the fact that it's near vacuum, the amount of heat transferred there via conduction or convection is minimal. So you wouldn't actually feel the heat if you were able to actually put your hand out into it safely.

However. That means we can't just put a thermometer out there and get a reading of the temperature. So how have we figured out that the heat of the thermosphere? All I can find is a vague conclusion that it has to do with gas densities and formulas. I was hoping for something more concrete than that. And I figured, out of the subs here, one or two of you had to know enough about physics and space to give me a more certain answer :)
