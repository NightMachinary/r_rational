The complication is that the gas can't transfer enough energy to the thermometer. At such low densities, temperature is less a measure of the system's internal energy and more of a statement about how fast the particles are moving. In Earth's thermosphere the particles are moving very quickly but are spread so thin I imagine the thermal conduction timescale is much too long to actually heat up our thermometer. You can actually estimate that timescale from some simple arguments, and I imagien it would be somewhere on the order of a day or a month. Also, not sure what kind of probe thermometers can safely go up to 2500Â° C, but if they exist I'd love to know.
