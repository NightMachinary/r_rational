The radiation heat transfer from the thermosphere (and to it, by conservation of energy) is pretty small. We know this because we can see space, rather than a blinding 2500 C glow.

So with radiative transfer from/to the thermosphere approximated as zero, we can move forwards and note that convective heating, between the rarefied gas and a thermometer, would be in competition with radiative heat transfer between the thermometer and the sun/sun-shielding-enclosure/vast-black-coldness-of-space...

...Assume the thermometer is somehow accurately reading the temperature of the thermosphere as 2800 K. On the in side of the equation, we have a bunch of small terms: the sun gives enough energy to heat it to about 270 K (assuming it is spherical), the umbrella can't be much hotter than 330 K, and can't heat the thermometer hotter than that, and space is like 3 K. Convective heat transfer is assumed to be small because the thermosphere is a near vacuum. And the thermometer, hypothetically at 2800 K, would glow a nice yellow color.

As with the small mass of a lightbulb filiment, the thermometer bulb would cool enough to stop glowing in a couple seconds, so it's not just an issue of "how long would it take".
