  If you think about it, it seems like all of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s most popular stories (or most discussed, at least) are serialized fiction.

If you check [[/r/rational/top/]], with the exception of /Mother of Learning/ (by far the most upvoted thing to this subreddit) there are lots of short stories (and some novella length). And the discussion on them isn't actually that much less than the discussion for serials, especially once you correct for number of commentors (most serials have a pool of "invested" people who do the vast bulk of the commenting).

The big strength of serials is that they can draw people in week after week. If you read a short story, it stays in your head for maybe a few days, eventually fading into "that thing you read one time". But a serial stays in the reader's head pretty much as long as it's running, and new chapters with new discussion that serve as advertisement when they get posted to places or talked about by invested readers. It's not so much the cycle of teasing and payoff (though that does exist) but just the sheer length that acts as a powerful asset.

I'd suggest against front-loading the world-building, though it somewhat depends on what you mean by "front". The first chapter is the most important chapter of any work, especially online, because that's where people are going to decide whether they're going to read or bounce. The first chapter should have only enough worldbuilding to get the actual plot in motion, and if the first chapter needs a lot of worldbuilding for the plot to make sense, pick a different starting plot. The worldbuilding can come after you've sunk your teeth into the reader. (That both /Worm/ and /Mother of Learning/ defied this is a testament to their ability to draw in readers through other means, but you can't count on that unless you can pass a critical threshold of readership, which you might no be able to, and you'll have to write for quite a while to build up steam.)
