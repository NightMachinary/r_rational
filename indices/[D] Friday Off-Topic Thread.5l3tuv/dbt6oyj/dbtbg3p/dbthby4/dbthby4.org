I guess the question doesn't really work how I phrased it, specific to my story. Too subjective.

You're right though, I need to decide what story I want to write, more specifically what story /format./ If you think about it, it seems like all of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s most popular stories (or most discussed, at least) are serialized fiction. From what I've seen, a hallmark of serialized fiction is a continual cycle of teasing and payoff, which is necessary to retain interest through months and years. If you take this place as a guide, you have to front-load world-building, and back-load plot.

Novels don't have to tease so much, though some do. The pace of revelation there tends to be dictated by what can be revealed naturally ("show, don't tell" being the catchword), and what is required to advance the plot.

Most serial fiction I've read have really shitty hooks in the beginning. Worm for example, was pretty mediocre for the first few 10k words. Mother of Learning isn't anything special at the beginning, either. They all get carried off of the strength of their concept: Realistic, grimdark superhero world. DnD timeloop. That, and the fact that everyone finds these stories through recommendations, and there is no buy in, so people can invest more time than they would otherwise.

Sorry for the diggression, thinking out loud, so to say.
