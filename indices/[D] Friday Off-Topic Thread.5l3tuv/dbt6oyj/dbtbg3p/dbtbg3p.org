IANAW but I think if the simulated thing is common knowledge in MC's civilisation, it should be revealed pretty early on. Whereas if it's something that characters learn about when trying things, then you should hint at it but only reveal it when / after the characters find out.

Which one you should go for really depends on what kind of story you want to write
