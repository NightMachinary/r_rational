I've been writing a story where the, er, founding concept(that is, the idea that the whole story revolves around) is that it's set in a simulated reality, and the MC comes from a near-future civilization that discovered this several decades before his birth.

I'm in doubt as to whether I should make this explicit from the beginning as a hook, or to foreshadow it, perhaps reveal it at the end of the first major arc. What does [[/r/rational]] think?
