Preface: I don't want this post to sound condescending or trivialising your problems, but I'm not very good at expressing the right tone over text. The post is very 'take a problem you mentioned and offer a possible thing to try / consider', which might or might not be helpful to you. Apologies for the length and rambling nature.

  I still haven't gotten around to finding a therapist

Have you tried talking to your everyday doctor (GP in the UK; not sure what the US nomenclature is) about this? Depression doesn't necessarily mean you need a therapist; you can just ask a doctor for antidepressants, which are usually inexpensive. If they don't work, you're rarely worse off (side-effects are very minor most of the time) and can try something else; if they do, it helps a /lot/.

That's what I've done about 8 months ago, and 6 months of taking a small dose of SSRI has helped quite a bit. (I've recently stopped taking it to see if it kept, or if i'll return to baseline) No therapist involved, largely because I figured I wouldn't have the time.

I think passion's a bit overrated, and it's talked about waay too much in college. There are /tons/ of people out there who either don't have a particular passion, or they found their passion late and it's more of a hobby. They go to work, hopefully enjoy their job without it being everything, and then build a good and satisfying life outside of work.

(I'm kinda assuming you're fairly young at this point, given that you're finishing a degree and looking for a job)

I have no idea about the job market for physics graduates in particular, but usually STEM graduates have a lot of options. Beside working in jobs directly related to your degree, there's things like analyst positions, or even programming. One friend of mine after finishing an Avionics degree went to work for a wind energy company analysing and modelling the flow of wind over an area; he developed statistical analysis and programming (python) skills there, and took that to his next job where he oversaw an integration of a data analysis project at a cargo shipping (as in huge ships with containers) company. And now he's doing a similar data analysis / project management thing at Palantir.

Another friend went straight from physics degree to a small programming company where he helped make games. He knew some basic programming from college but mostly learned on the job.

Basically I'm trying to say you shouldn't focus too much on the actual 'knowledge' you gained from college; if you're not having much luck finding physics-specific jobs, consider what /skills/ you've gained during the course (data analysis, logical reasoning, etc), and find entry level positions in businesses that value those skills.

It's very hard to know what you want to do before you try things. (this ties into the above, I guess). You're not commited to a 40-year career when you join a particular company, or take a particular role. Don't be afraid to just try a job just because it's available. At worst, if you hate it after 6 months, you can just leave.
