This comment made me want to check out [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters]] (honestly, something I should have done a while ago), and... I guess I don't see it? I'm too tired to make a proper analysis, and I've only read a few posts, but the top answers always seem civil and well thought-out.

Those posts in particular stood out to me as very insightful, and don't seem especially out of place (or lost in a sea of hatred and anti-intellectualism):
