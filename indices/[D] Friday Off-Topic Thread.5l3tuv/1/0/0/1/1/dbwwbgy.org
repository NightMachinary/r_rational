There's also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/5li8bc/why_do_you_think_trump_still_has_not_given_any/][the top comment on this post]] where a supporter is convinced that the media is biased against Trump so he shouldn't hold press conferences. They literally believe that the press should not question the President and report on his responses because leftists can't be trusted, and people agree with them.
