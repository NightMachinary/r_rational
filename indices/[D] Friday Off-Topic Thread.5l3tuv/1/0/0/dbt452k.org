My problem isn't that the guy I didn't like won, but the general trends and values among the supporters I've seen on [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters][r/AskTrumpSupporters]]. I'm so sick of arguing with people who distrust intellectuals and science, hate political correctness so much they tolerate bigotry, think it's acceptable for businesses to discriminate against people like me for religious reasons, and consider it acceptable behavior for a political leader to unironically spout lies and insults in any context. I despise them so much I can barely articulate why.

Edit: Forgot to mention the paranoia over illegal immigrants and Muslims. They treat these people as an existential threat to America's economy and culture but can't formulate viable solutions.

The worst part is that I don't see this extreme political polarization going away any time soon. Political discourse between people who disagree is broken. We used to argue about strawmen, now we can't even agree on what constitutes a strawman because we both think our interpretation of the situation is accurate and the other side is biased and misinformed. I don't see how any good can come of this situation, at least without doing a whole lot of easily preventable harm first.
