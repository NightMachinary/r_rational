I feel compelled to wonder what kinds of people actually populate [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters]]. Given that it's a dedicated subreddit for the purposes of, effectively, having conservatives defend Trump, my prediction for such a place would be that you'd have a heavy bias towards the people most zealously supportive of Trump, and those who associate with him in such a way that attacks on Trump feel like personal attacks. I would expect such people to be more likely to hold extreme opinions and/or be obnoxiously loud and confident about their opinions without having thought through them.

Further, I would expect that this bias towards the zealous would come from a tendency for the zealous to stay and continue debating while the more regular supporters feel uncomfortable between both the zealous and the liberals, and leave the subreddit after a shorter timeframe. In total, I think that the impression you have received from [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters]] risks being representative only of the zealous and more extreme parts of his voterbase.

Remember that half of the country voted for him. Unless I had reason to believe the conservative voterbase was either that bad back in 2012 or has become that bad in those four years, I would be inclined first to expect extreme views to indicate the extreme portion of the voterbase.
