I think that "the political leader I don't like was elected, therefore I'm losing faith in my country / my culture / humanity" is a subtle failure mode of politics; it's a type of failure that's less intense and spectacular than the "my political opponents are inhuman and evil" bias, but comes from the same patterns.

It's pretty intuitive to me that in any system that is somewhat democratic, you're going to end up with leaders you disagree with more often than not. Parties are formed around controversial ideas, and optimize their policies to get as many votes as they can, so most elections are going to be split between a few popular parties (as opposed to a monolithic hyper-popular party); which means that at least some of these popular parties are still not going to be elected.

Combined with the fact that both the media and the parties' supporters (you and me included) have strong but subtle incentives to focus on and amplify the negative aspects of the other parties... and any given political leader is likely to have a sizeable portion of their electorate who thinks they're completely awful and will bring the world to ruin (or keep it ruined). SSC's article "You're still crying wolf" comes to mind.

Of course, I don't know what to make of this. On one hand, I'm pretty sure the pattern I describe does exist, and that people of every political orientation in every democracy have been announcing that the last election that didn't go their way marked the imminent collapse of their country since forever. On the other hand, countries aren't immortal, the economy can be screwed up, minorities can be oppressed, and all of these things do happen all the time, so "relax, politicians aren't dangerous" isn't true either. I don't know. Just... assume that whatever awfulness happens under Trump would probably have happened under Clinton anyway? (as well as whatever awfulness /doesn't/ happen)
