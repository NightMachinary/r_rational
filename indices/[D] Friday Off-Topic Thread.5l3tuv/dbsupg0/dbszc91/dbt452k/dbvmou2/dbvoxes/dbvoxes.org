The top comments don't always represent the majority opinion of Trump supporters because Non-supporters can vote as well. Some supporters are relatively rational, the problem is that many of them aren't. I won't pretend that I haven't based my assessment on anecdotal evidence, but my frustration is based on the fact that I keep seeing bigots and conspiracy theorists whose views are considered acceptable. I also found some polls by The Economist, YouGov, and Public Policy Polling that imply the anecdotes I've seen are not atypical.

- 67% of Trump supporters say unemployment increased during the Obama administration

- 39% of Trump supporters say the stock market declined during the Obama administration, and 19% say they are unsure

- 74% of Trump supporters think the proportion of people without health insurance in the US remained the same or increased over the last five years

- 46% of Trump supporters say that leaked Clinton emails refer to a child sex and pedophilia ring

- 52% of Trump supporters say that President Obama was born in Kenya
