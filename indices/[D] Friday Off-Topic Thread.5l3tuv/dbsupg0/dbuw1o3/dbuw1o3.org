/Find a therapist./ I can force myself, I can kinda force my partner, but I can't force you. But it's still the most help you can give yourself now.

I'm terrified too. And you know what? My faith in humanity broke years ago! Part of really growing up is realizing that human nature is only loosely and over the longest term even slightly moral, and that in the near term everything can and is going wrong. /Fuck/ human nature and /fuck/ faith in humanity. Give up your /faith/, and help /change/ the world and make a /better/ humanity. Be better than human, for to be human is to be more than human!
