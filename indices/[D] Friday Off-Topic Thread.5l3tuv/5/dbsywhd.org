Is there an accurate simple definition of liberal and conservative? I know what positions are considered liberal and which ones are considered conservative but if a new issue with two options came up I'd have no idea how to classify which is which. Change vs no change can't be right because people want things a certain way and when they are that way they want them to stay the same and when they aren't they want them to change to the way they want.

I've been learning Go recently. I'd definitely recommend it. It has a different feel than other turn-based two player board games. It doesn't require looking many moves ahead, which is nice for me because I have bad working memory.

What are some ways I can nudge myself into wasting less time? I often have trouble convincing myself to not just pursue mild/familiar entertainment because it's easy, but it leads to a certain unpleasant long-term equivalent of boredom. I guess by "wasting time" I mean doing things that do not lead to any sort of long-term goal, just wandering around reddit or playing more of whatever computer game I'm feeling nostalgic for, etc. I find that "feeling productive" is more my limiting factor than time availability. If I could reliably be productive without feeling like it (or find ways to reliably make myself feel like it, like my ADHD medication used to) I think my life would improve.

Also I have trouble convincing myself to get organized and make any sort of plans, which is also room for improvement I'm not sure how to exploit. I'm very good at coming up with excuses to be lazy, and it's hard to counter them all.

Sorry for rambling.
