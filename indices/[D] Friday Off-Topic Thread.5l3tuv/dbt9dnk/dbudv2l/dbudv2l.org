I don't know how they do it in practice, but a thermometer should work just fine as long as you leave it there long enough. As humans, how hot we "feel" is a function of both the actual temperature and the exchange rate via conduction, since our own bodies create heat at some rate, environments with lower conduction will feel closer to body temperature than they actually are.

But a thermometer doesn't create heat, and it doesn't measure by feeling, it measures its own internal temperature. If you stick it out there it will start off reading at whatever temperature it was at before, but it will slowly change to match the surroundings and eventually become accurate.
