One of the best ways to measure gas temperatures in low-density fluids in astrophysics is through their EM emission and absorption properties. Emission and absorption produced by specific atomic ions (like the emission lines from catching a free electron) is ideal, because at a given temperature and density [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardine_Wong/publication/254495787/figure/fig1/AS:297956151447553@1448049690335/Figure-1-Argon-ionization-fractions-dependences-on-plasma-electron-temperature-for-atom.png][most atoms are in a single ionization state]]. Luckily, on Earth we don't need to rely on radiation and can go directly to measuring ion concentrations and gas densities to extract the temperature. The hard part in this case would be to pick a good probe element, because it needs to have an ionization temperature of 2500 K which is pretty mild, astronomically. Implied here is that we can also look for atmospheric emission and absorption to corroborate the results
