First off, a request: can you make the text on your site darker? The light grey is hard to read.

I was really interested by the experimentation that you had Naruto doing with the clones in the beginning. If I have it right, each time he summons clones his chakra pool divides evenly between them, and so on down the chain. Therefore, if he starts with 1,000 chakra:

- Summon clone A1, each body now has 500
- Clone A1 then summons 9 clones. Original now has 500, A1-10 each have 50
- Original summons 4 clones (B-E). He and B-E now have 100, A1-10 still have 50.

Is that right?

A couple of questions:

#+begin_quote
  he had no one “real” body, and if ever he had only one body left then that'd be the one that became “real” again,
#+end_quote

Shadow clones vanish if they bite their tongues, normal people don't. So,

- If Naruto has no shadow clones out at the moment and he bites his tongue, does he vanish?\\
- If he had one shadow clone out and his original body bites his tongue, does it vanish?\\
- If the shadow clone then bites its tongue, does /it/ vanish?
- If both bodies are punched at the same time, do they both vanish?

Also:

#+begin_quote
  he took damage in proportion to the number of bodies he had active to spread an injury out over
#+end_quote

So, he has two bodies out (one original, one clone). One of his bodies is stabbed with a knife and vanishes. Does half of the wound appear on the other body? If so, what does "half a wound" look like?

When a clone pops, do its memories go:

- to the original body
- to whoever created it
- to all current bodies?

Do Naruto and his clones constitute a hive mind, or when he "has a clone" do something, is he yelling orders to it?

Last question: you've changed how the kawarimi works -- in canon a ninja can substitute with any inanimate object, but now it sounds like they have to have prepared the object first. Why the change?
