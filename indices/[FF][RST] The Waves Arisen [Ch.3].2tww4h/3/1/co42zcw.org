The amount of chakra might not be quite like that. I didn't calculate anything but I thought there is some fixed or flexible cost too, like 100 or 5% chakra for using the kagebunshin at all. Everything should have a loss methinks.

  If Naruto has no shadow clones out at the moment and he bites his tongue, does he vanish?

Do you? :)

  If he had one shadow clone out and his original body bites his tongue, does it vanish?

Apparently yes, as there is no "original body". I think this fails here when one of the Narutos has the forehead protector and others don't, so clearly there is something like that, or does some clone get that randomly?

  Do Naruto and his clones constitute a hive mind, or when he "has a clone" do something, is he yelling orders to it?
#+end_quote

They think like him and they literally just have thought about whatever he had thought so they totally know what to do even without mental link after the summoning.

  Last question: you've changed how the kawarimi works -- in canon a ninja can substitute with any inanimate object, but now it sounds like they have to have prepared the object first. Why the change?
#+end_quote

Probably because it's overpowered bullshit? :D

edit: Extending on the last bit, it's overpowered because it's not really explained and has no real limits. It's literally the power of the plot protecting people. Ooh you got hit with this killer tech? KAWARIMI!
