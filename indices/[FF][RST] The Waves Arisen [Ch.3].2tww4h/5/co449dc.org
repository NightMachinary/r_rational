What Naruto does in this chapter is a much simpler version of what Naruto does in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4573620/1/A-Drop-of-Poison][A Drop of Poison]]. In that fic, Naruto coordinates multiple clones to get more work done as well. But, he also has several clones henged into unique identities around the village, that build their own reputations over time. He also experiments with the limits of the clone jutsu, and figures out how to have tougher clones that don't dispel as easily. I recommend reading it.
