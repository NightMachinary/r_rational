      If Naruto has no shadow clones out at the moment and he bites his tongue, does he vanish?

  Do you? :)

Nope, and I would be very surprised if Naruto did either. The point I was driving at is that it seems very strange to say "there is no 'real' Naruto."

For that to be true it would need to be the case that all of Naruto's currently existing bodies are the same. The implication of that however, is that you start with one body which is non-poppable, and then you create another body. If there is no 'real' Naruto, then both of these bodies are poppable -- so one of them just lost the 'not-poppable' property. But if both of them are poppable, then you can completely kill Naruto if you have an AoE jutsu that does the same amount of damage as biting your tongue. In other words, using Kage Bunshin makes you /more/ vulnerable. No other technique that I'm aware of is like that -- aside from costing chakra, no other technique has negative effects on the user. (Ok, maybe the Yamanaka "I leave my body undefended while I possess you", but that's really not the same thing.)
