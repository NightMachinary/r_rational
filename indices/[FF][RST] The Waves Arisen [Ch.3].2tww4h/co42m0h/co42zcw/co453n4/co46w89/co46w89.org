Shr√∂dinger's Naruto. Naruto can be observed to be in multiple places at same time. To find out where he really is, you must deal enough damage. This collapses the Naruto to single one.

Each of them is just a potential Naruto. Naruto breaks himself down to potential Narutos and when there is no more chance for him to be anywhere else because all the "clones" are killed, you can kill the actual Naruto.

This looks way cooler than the original.
