A quick note about the forehead protector: Naruto's "original" body was wearing it, then it failed to be duplicated for his clones, but the physical original body (who is now as vulnerable to bursting as any other clone) was still wearing the original item. He doesn't vanish and then reappear in two places, or anything.
