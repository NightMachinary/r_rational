I've changed the wordpress theme to something with darker text, now.

Commenter Kaukamieli has answered most of your questions, but I'll clarify that when a new shadow clone is summoned his consciousness branches off from the original, so he'll be aware of what "he" had been intending to do with himself, but any new decisions thereafter would have to be communicated in speech. There is no special awareness of the thoughts of any other active clones, until they die.

When popped, a shadow clone's memories go to all current bodies, offering another avenue of communication for anyone willing to burst themselves to send a "message" in their thoughts.
