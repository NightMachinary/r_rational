I realized early on the personality changes were obviously your creation and rolled with it as many ff do that, but the history some characters tell is confusing in that it's not explained as actual history from the author we can trust. Whether it's different from canon, or if they're simply lying and we'll never find out they're lying until you specifically reveal what you've changed later on, which makes their lies or manipulations irellivant.

Much like when Kurama lied to Naruto how he couldn't manipulate his legs very well, which could be completely true in your world (not really in canon), but the reader has no clue when you're changing things or not, so any reveals or surprises are simply a reveal or surprise that you decided to keep something or change it, rather than interesting character building or a plot twist.

There's not much hint for rules or what's really going on except that anything can happen. Like a child's daydream, one moment you're sipping tea with dragons and the next you're on Mars where they're really grey aliens feeding you poison. I exaggerate and I'm rambling now, but I hope you see the idea I'm trying to get across. People have expectations and there's no way to tell when you're subverting, fulfilling, or simply ignoring them.

As for the relationships, they seemed to be out of character for both Naruto and Shino to suddenly start liking Hinata ( randomly kissing her and calling her beautiful in Naruto's case) in, what has it been, less than a month or two? You've tried to add some intimacy and forced physical contact between them at times, but it still seems forced to mimic or resemble your creation of Anko's relationships, especially when they're so young and emotionally stunted with no experience in a relationship.

Sorry if this comes across as tons of complaining, but I do like your story. I just get annoyed at instant relationships and hand wavy rules.
