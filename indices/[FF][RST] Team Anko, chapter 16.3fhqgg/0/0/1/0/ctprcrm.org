You are correct. In the canon version of events, Rabbit made a deal with the Ten-Tails to retrieve the chakra from her sons. Instead, he went rampaging off. That sounds like a summoning (demon-style, not animal contract) gone wrong to me, as though Rabbit called up something that she couldn't control / that slipped through a loophole in the summoning agreement.
