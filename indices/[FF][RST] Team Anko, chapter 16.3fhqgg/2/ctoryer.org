Hah, so Kurama was tricking Naruto earlier! Although he didn't have ill intent, which was a bit of a surprise. I'm pretty curious what his imprisonment within Kushina was like, and whether he got staked-in-his-everything as per canon...

The discussion on sexuality was interesting, and something I haven't found touched upon in stories much. People seem to avoid discussing anything related to the topic, from various bodily functions like peeing, pooping and monthly periods in the case of girls to...well, what you covered here, relationships beyond the binary one-guy one-girl partnership. As to why Orochimaru asked Shino to ask Anko about this, though...I admit I have no clue.

Naruto's bumbling attempts at romance are sweet, especially when he puts his foot in it and admits he's mainly doing this because Kurama said so. I wonder what the other tailed beast hosts are like here? Do they get along with their prisoners?
