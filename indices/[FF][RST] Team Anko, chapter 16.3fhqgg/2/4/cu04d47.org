  As to why orochimaru asked shino...

I thought it was just because there is a naru/hina/shino love triangle going on, and it mirrors anko's exactly (unless the boys end up yaoi-ing).

I assumed it was another way to ingratiate himself to shino and maybe disrupt his konoha socialisation with something more trivial than human vivisection.
