The sexuality speech actually went in one ear and out the other with me

It's almost exactly my spiel when people ask me about being polyamorous, albeit with fewer engineering metaphors involving chaotic instability and fixed points. It's far from abnormal for me, so I sometimes forget that that's not true for others.

My initial expectation, especially given that it's to Shino is to cause him to want or expect a polyamorous relationship with Hinata, and muck up the dynamic of the team. However Shino seems like both the only viable candidate for such a tactic, and one of the least likely to fall for it. He's more than reasonable enough to realize that being able to fall in love with multiple people (like most do) means that fixating on one person who doesn't reciprocate is a easy route to unhappiness.

Of course, Orochimaru is probably of the "one level higher than you" archetype.

  I wonder what the other tailed beast hosts are like here? Do they get along with their prisoners?

In canon, doesn't Killer B get along with his biiju?
