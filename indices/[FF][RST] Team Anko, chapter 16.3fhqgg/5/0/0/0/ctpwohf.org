Hm. All right, thank you for that. As far as rules for the magic go, I'm afraid there's probably not much that can be done to satisfy you -- there aren't really any rules in canon, either. I have a set of math underlying my system so it will at least be consistent, but I don't think there is a plausible way for all the details to be revealed.
