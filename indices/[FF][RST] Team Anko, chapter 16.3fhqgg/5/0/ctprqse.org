I added a note in chapter one explaining that two of the characters have had personality transplants to make them more interesting; by now it should be clear that I was talking about Kurama and Orochimaru. The Sannin is a "one level higher than you" type, and the Fox is...well, that's still unfolding.

  This story confuses me often when you bring up past events that aren't canon, yet the reader is supposed to be familiar with it.

If this were a regular novel and not a fanfic, would you be confused? That is, do you feel that things have been unfairly explained, or are you only wondering what is the same as canon? If the latter, I would suggest just rolling with it unless it bothers you so much that you don't want to read any more.

  Are you purposefully changing canon for your story as you go?

In some places, yes. There's a list of the major ones in the Author's Note at the bottom of chapter one. And yes, the Sage did seal the bijuu in my version.

I'm guessing you mean that Shino has developed a crush on Hinata. Do you find it unreasonable for a teenage boy in his situation, or are you simply bothered that it wasn't part of canon?
