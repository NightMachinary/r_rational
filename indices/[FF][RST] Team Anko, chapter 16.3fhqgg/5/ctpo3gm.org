This story confuses me often when you bring up past events that aren't canon, yet the reader is supposed to be familiar with it. Such as the sage putting the tailed beats in hosts, or Kurama wanting to have a civil relationship with his host, since there are many options that could be possible but all have different meanings and consequences.

Are you purposefully changing canon for your story as you go? Did you forget what events actually happened in canon? Are Kurama and other characters purposefully lying about past events, or are /they/ possibly forgetting what actually happened?

As for the relationship stuff, it seems quite arbitrary why some team members suddenly start liking each other except for you to explore love triangles in your own way. Similar to how Naruto likes Sakura in canon but never has a reason except, "she's pretty!"
