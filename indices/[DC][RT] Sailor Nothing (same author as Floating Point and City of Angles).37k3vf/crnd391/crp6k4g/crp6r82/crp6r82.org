It is a genre, yes. Other large entries in the genre: Cardcaptor Sakura, Madoka Magica. The original entry was [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_the_Witch][Sally the Witch]].

Really, though, the tropes (transforming, called shots, etc.) are almost entirely inherited from the "super sentai" genre. Sailor Moon is essentially "Power Rangers for girls."

I would really phrase this story not so much as a fanfic, though, as a rebuttal/deconstruction to the sort of Utopian ideas of the magical girl genre that are epitomized in Sailor Moon. Sailor Nothing is to Sailor Moon as [[http://creative-survivalism.tumblr.com/post/120158176921/theubergrump-i-keep-seeing-stuff-about-lord-of][/Lord of the Flies/ is to /The Coral Island/]].
