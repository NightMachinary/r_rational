tl;dr:

- The setting is "magical girls". Not too much background knowledge of the genre is required, beyond perhaps skimming the TV Tropes pages for Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Kamen, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl from the original /Sailor Moon/ anime, so that you know what you're supposed to be picturing. I first read and enjoyed the story before knowing much of anything about /Sailor Moon/, but I did have a better time on my second read-through, after I'd watched several episodes of the original /Sailor Moon/ anime (free on Hulu).

- Shoutan Himei--made by the mysterious Magnificent Kamen into Sailor Salvation, years ago--has been worn down to the brink of suicide by repelling the incessant onslaught of monsters created out of ordinary people by the Dark Generals. She sees the endless war as pointless, now, despite the remonstrances of Magnificent Kamen and the help and reassurance of her talking cat, Dusty.

- Cobalt is by far the youngest of the Dark Generals created by and subservient to the Dark Queen. The Queen has given to him the special mission of restoring the Dark World to its former glory. He struggles to bring the wayward demons that he creates into line so that they may work on rebuilding the Dark World instead of succumbing to their base instincts and attacking Earth, while the other, older Generals, Xenon and Neon, send their soldiers to die against Magnificent Kamen's Sailors and gloat about how futile Cobalt's mission is.

More characters come into play later on. I've read it twice (and plan to read it for a third time very soon), and like it quite a lot (though I never got into /Floating Point/, /City of Angles/, etc.). I think Cobalt might maybe be slightly more rational than the other characters, but I'm not sure.
