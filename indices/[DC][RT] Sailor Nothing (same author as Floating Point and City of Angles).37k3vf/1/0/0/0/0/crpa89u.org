  Superheroes, Japanese style. The word can be translated as "Task Force" or "Squadron." Usually come in teams, with *color-keyed uniforms* and a range of personalities/roles that usually follows some variation on the Five-Man Band. Known for their synchronized posing; also, a Standard Powerup Pose is often used in many Sentai works during the *Transformation Sequence*. A key concept is that the collective team are more important than the individual, and that more can be achieved by working together.

  Although popular in anime, there have also been innumerable live action Sentai series in Japan, most notably Super Sentai, the series which was re-edited into *Power Rangers* in the United States, and 2003's *Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon*.

  A very western form of Sentai is to feature five teenagers receiving powers, with a transformation, i.e. it doesn't have to involve color-coding, or full body suits. They may not even transform at all, but have powers that combine to make a greater whole.

  Contrary to popular belief, "Sentai" ONLY denotes to shows that have a squad of nigh-identical, color-coded superheroes, not every transforming superhero that comes from Japan (the proper term for that would be Henshin Hero, that belongs in the Tokusatsu genre).

  Do not confuse with Hentai, please. Even though there's definitely some unholy overlap somewhere.
