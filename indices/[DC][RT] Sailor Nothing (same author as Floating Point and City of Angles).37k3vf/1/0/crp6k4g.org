Is "magical girls" a genre aside from Sailor Moon? I haven't seen SM, but from the little I know of it this seems like a fanfic, despite the "this is not a fanfic" notice at the front. Maybe these are all standard tropes, though? (Talking cat, fuku, sailor, transform, calling your shots with things like "Pretty Sailor Transform".)
