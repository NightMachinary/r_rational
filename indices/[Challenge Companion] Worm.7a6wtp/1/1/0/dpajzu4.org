Again, the first bullet point is referring to their decision to ignore natural triggers when looking for answers to Scion. Their evidence to do this was shaky at best (especially given the effectiveness of natural triggers at GM) and the refusal to even consider natural triggers is indefensible.

Here, I'm talking about the truly insane number of vials they have in store and unused. Releasing them all could cause problems, yes. On the other hand, the world is rapidly going to shit, and these vials could buy another three or four years of consistent population growth, while potentially creating another S-tier parahuman. Instead, Cauldron hangs onto them, being (in my opinion) needlessly stingy. You can argue both sides, and I see the reasons for the extreme paranoia. I just think that it's not convincing.

Given that the Number Man was able to aim Blasters at Scion, I assume that it isn't /stopping/ him from trying to hurt the Entities. Additionally, you can just not use PtV to pick the candidates. Look for people who can keep a cool head, people who can't trigger, and with a proven track record of effective decision making. Then draw up a list and follow them with a Stranger to see who's the best, as decided by a panel of humans. Also, I don't think the Warrior actively interprets all the data the shards gives him, nor does he cripple them in a way that would prevent a Thinker from being an effective organizer/recruiter, which is what you would use the Thinker for.

To clarify: I'm not taking about giving humans /no/ seat at the table. But Doctor Mother's power is far and away too broad for a vanilla human, and she is too flawed of a vanilla human. I would accept, say, a Washington-esk figure who went through something that could compare to a trigger event, didn't get powers, and came out of it shaken but healing, who's primary job was to help people get powers from Cauldron and set Cauldron's goals, as well as provide ethical oversight (in the sense that Cauldron appears to be an ethical organization, not actually ethical).
