First, I'd like to see the source of your information that Doctor Mother could trigger. Second, only triggered shards have the conflict drive. Third, parahumans may have a conflict drive, but they can still think better than vanilla humans by /several/ orders of magnitude. Conflict drive is just a bias, and any human running an organization has those. Parahumans have the advantage on that they can also do other things the vanilla human can't.
