  The crowning moment;

  I, a vanilla human, will lead the SUPER SECRET organization. Not the person who's power is “winning,” the competence-porn statistician, the flying brick who could out-argue Socrates for fun, or the man who's superpower is literally making the best plans. I provide something irreplaceable, and that irreplaceable thing is worth more than anything those people could bring to the table.

  Seriously, why the actual Swiss hell is she in charge of Cauldron?

This is the part that confuses me. We know for a fact that Parahumans are driven to conflict. Therefore they are being modified by their powers. Therefore, as soon as it became apparent that Dr Mother could trigger, she should have stepped down and found someone else to lead... who did not have the capability to trigger. And if they became capable? they should have stepped down as well. etc etc.

Doctor Mother leading the group was one thing they (almost) got right.
