See, this I buy. Capes are the most effective weapon against Scion, given that normals no longer have nukes. In that situation, Contessa would probably spend a fair amount of time making sure that normals never started wholesale murdering capes.

And if any cape did become a problem, Number Man and Contessa are the only snipers you need.
