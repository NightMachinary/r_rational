We can list powerful capes all day. I'm not saying they /can't/ make powerful capes, there are plenty of those. What I'm saying is that they disregarded a possibility involving something they didn't fully understand, and that is not a scientific thought.

They still have a criminal number of unused vials. If Scion saw more capes running around, his primary thought would be "oh goody, a Trump shard is getting it's shit together." Maybe optomistic, but you can take a few risks in the interest in making the world less of a shit hole.

THEN HAVE A LOW-LEVEL MASTER THAT MAKES PEOPLE LIKE HIM! THERE ARE 9001 PEOPLE BETTER FOR THE JOB THAN A BAD SCIENTIST!

There's a difference between asking "smart" questions and dedicating at least a year of time away from non-critical threats to maximize question-asking capability. The second pair of useful questions she asks is compounded, so we don't know if it was asking about the Warrior or asking about the equally powerful being was the problem.

"Smart" Questions How do we stop them? Weapons? An Army?

"Better" Questions How do I *understand* the Godlings? With knowledge of the cause comes knowledge of work-arounds. How do I optimize my power while maintaining sanity? If it takes less than, say, a year, you've got a deal.

“Okay,” the Doctor said. “Okay. What if I made the decisions from here on out? You tell me if I'm going down the wrong path, give me direction where it's needed.

The Doctor here assumes the role of leadership. Fine for short periods of time, but as soon as you find a social Thinker you need to replace her. Except it doesn't happen. Ever. Pure arrogance on her part. Never send a human to do a robot's job, and Thinkers can get damn close to a robot.

Also, Dragon is permitted to live. I have a hard time buying everyone seeing her slowly slip her shackles and collectively ignoring the Control Problem. I can't imagine a rational!Thinker permitting that.
