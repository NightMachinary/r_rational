Can someone write Doctor Mother as a scientist? Because canon!DM is not scientific.

Notable moments of idiot balling:

I understand how space whales with a better grasp on physics than Einstein think and deduce that only my experiments can save the world.

My partner went batshit crazy and joined some murder hobos, so I'm not going to let ANYONE touch the vials, even though I can Master a Stranger to sit behind my partner and kill them if the start getting Ziz'y.

Let's be SUPER SECRET because maybe the space whale of doom will understand whatever the hell we're trying to do and wipe out organization. Despite the fact that it can probably see the future any time it wants to.

Let's leave the most powerful precog in the world (who happens to be a child) in the hands of a child molester.

The crowning moment;

I, a vanilla human, will lead the SUPER SECRET organization. Not the person who's power is “winning,” the competence-porn statistician, the flying brick who could out-argue Socrates for fun, or the man who's superpower is literally making the best plans. I provide something irreplaceable, and that irreplaceable thing is worth more than anything those people could bring to the table.

Seriously, why the actual Swiss hell is she in charge of Cauldron?
