  Basically, these things that you call idiot balling keep being because the person whose power is winning approved of the action.

This is my problem with the Path to Victory power; all the author has to do is say "this is the winning path" and it excuses pretty much any plot contrivance whatsoever. People are no longer carrying the idiot ball, they're carrying the prophecy ball. I think that Worm does better with this than it might have, given the sheer scope and strength of its prophecies, but "because prophecy says so" seems like it's the opposite of rational fiction, at least to me, because it's a shortcut for characters not thinking about their actions.
