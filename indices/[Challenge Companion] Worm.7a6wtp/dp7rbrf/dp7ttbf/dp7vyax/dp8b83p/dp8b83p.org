There is another issue with using Contessa this way. These arguments would work if she was Dinah and just saw "If we do this, there is a high chance of failure." Her power is supposed to be "I want this to happen" and then make it happen. When discussing on telling more people her answer should never be "We cannot, they will betray us." It should always be "I have a path of x length to gain trustworthy and useful accomplices"

Going from this to immediately refuting any number of common sense suggestions is extremely counterintuitive. (Near) everything should be possible, if perhaps suboptimal for certain goals. Given that the path already cannot do reliable long-term planning against Scion and crew, and given that Cauldron already PtV as a tool instead of a prophetic leader, what then makes these particular suggestions so problematic that she outright refuses them? Especially compared to other difficult paths, such as "Induce global, decades-lasting learned helplessness in regards to snipers vs parahumans."

Anyway, I myself never got that far. There were already too many things I disbelieved to continue reading long before that.
