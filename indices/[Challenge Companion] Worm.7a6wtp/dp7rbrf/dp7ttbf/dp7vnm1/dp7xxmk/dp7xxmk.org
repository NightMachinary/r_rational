  I'm referring to how Cauldron assumed that natural triggers couldn't harm Scion despite the fact that all the scariest capes in the world (Jack, Sleeper, Contessa, Number Man, etc.) are natural triggers.
#+end_quote

We don't actually know that Sleeper is natural. But we do know that Cauldron produced the Triumvirate, Hero, Grey Boy (and roped natural trigger Glastig Uaine into being a way to channel Grey Boy safely), Shatterbird, Pretender, the first Butcher, Doormaker, Perdition, both N*x's, Siberian... They've got a really good track record, and it's clear from the way they maneuvered Glastig that once the time came to go public, they'd be calling in all the natural triggers who were good enough.

  Either way, Cauldron could be more public and create more capes to combat the truly insane number of villains, but they don't becuase...

Because they operate in a situation where Scion /isn't/ looking ahead. But this dude shows up to major battles on occasion and has hobo man giving him pants. If a public operation came to light, he would hear about it, he'd figure out which Earth Cauldron hung out on, and he would destroy them. Interlude 29 makes this quite clear!

  But she continues to have a role as a decision maker.

Again:

The Doctor nodded. “See? You're doing okay.”

“Easier when someone else takes point.”

Having the Doctor propose courses of action makes it easier for Contessa to chart the path to victory.

  With what frequency does Contessa path to "optimal world-saving committee"?

But she hesitated to carry it out.

There was another question she had to ask. Like the fable of Luisa and the black-furred man, she had to ask very carefully.

Could she do all this, explain to her uncle, find the thing that was at the heart of this chaos, and save her people, and handle the other essential crises she run into on her way?

She definitely takes the time to ask smart questions in her interlude.

#+begin_quote
  I notice you don't refute my points on Dinah and Manton. Is this due to an insufficient number of fucks to give or have I found points we both agree on?
#+end_quote

Closer to the first one - it's easy to pull from Interlude 29 to explain Contessa and Doc Mom. It's harder to pull from the seventy million chapters of Worm to explain everything.
