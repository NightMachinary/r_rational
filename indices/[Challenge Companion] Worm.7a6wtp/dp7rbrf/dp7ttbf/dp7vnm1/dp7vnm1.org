I'm referring to how Cauldron assumed that natural triggers couldn't harm Scion despite the fact that all the scariest capes in the world (Jack, Sleeper, Contessa, Number Man, etc.) are natural triggers.

I'm not talking about going to the government. I'm talking about having more than FIVE people involved in the decision making process. Maybe that's the optimal five. Given that Accord is not a part of it, I find that result unlikely. Either way, Cauldron could be more public and create more capes to combat the truly insane number of villains, but they don't becuase...

But she /continues/ to have a role as a decision maker. By all accounts, she's the head of Cauldron until Gully tears her head off! Once Contessa is old enough to look serious, a vanilla human has no business doing a Thinker 12's job.

A point on Contessa's power: It gives her the path to her objective. Nothing more. It doesn't tell her the best questions to ask (another point: has Contessa ever path'd to 'how do I learn to ask better questions?'). With what frequency does Contessa path to "optimal world-saving committee"? Becuase I'm pretty sure it's not often.

I'm not saying I have a better way. Cauldron did do a damn fine job of keeping S-class threats (save the Endbringers and Sleeper) under control, as well as making sure a few rouge Thinkers didn't destroy the world economy in an afternoon of debauchery. I do /know/ that they could've done it better.

I notice you don't refute my points on Dinah and Manton. Is this due to an insufficient number of fucks to give or have I found points we both agree on?
