I didn't think Contessa counted as a natural trigger. It was my understanding that Path to Victory was scattered when Eden crashed, and it hadn't been packaged for distribution in the same way as the other shards.

The uselessness of natural triggers against Scion is supposed to be canon; Scion comments on having to cripple several shards before distribution in order to prevent their being used against him, Administrator most of all. (I'm confused about why Sting was shared at all. I get that as their oldest natural weapon, the Worms would want it to collect data and evolve, but it seems like a poor risk. Hindsight, etc...)
