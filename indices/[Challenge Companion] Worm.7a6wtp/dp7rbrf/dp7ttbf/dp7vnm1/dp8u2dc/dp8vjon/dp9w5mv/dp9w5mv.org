To add some precision to the discussion, plenty of natural capes were able to do /superficial/ damage to Scion, or make him expend /non-infinitesimal/ amounts of effort to destroy them. Sting was maybe the only true danger, but he had a passive precog effect that negated it in practical terms, under normal circumstances. Cauldron's thinking was that they needed something that broke the rules of the rigged game, and Eden's non-crippled Shards were the only possible source for that. For example, passive precog all the time is probably way more resource intensive than just tagging Sting to ping back a HUD warning if it was ever targeted his way. Eden's unmodified version could easily have lacked that tag, which would have been a potential game winner. The Siberian was also a possible contender, though of course there was no way to test it until the moment of truth.
