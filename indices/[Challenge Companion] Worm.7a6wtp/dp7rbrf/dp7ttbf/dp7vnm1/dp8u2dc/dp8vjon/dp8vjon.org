Contessa is arguable both ways, so I think we can leave that to matter of opinion. Fair point, though.

The thing is Scrub also could hurt the Entities. Marquis canonically was useful at the end, Gavel stood up for a full /minute/ against the FU beam. A dead bee can sting you good as a live one, and the reason the Shark shards were distributed were to increase levels of conflict if I recall correctly.

Basically, in canon Cauldron makes an assumption. No one bothers to disagree with them, and the only way to test it would be to have a natural cape of sufficient power shoot at Scion and see if there was a noticeable effect. The error here is in a failure of imagination/not seeking to disprove something.
