While there are excellent grounds to dispute some of Cauldron's decision-making, I think you have selected some poor examples.

Cauldron knew that they had a unique resource and capability that nobody else could possibly have. They knew that the same sorts powers and resources Zion had to fight with were potentially available for them to harvest and repurpose as weapons to fight back. For all they knew, and remember that with Contessa they knew quite a bit, their plan was the best known chance of preventing the annihilation of vast numbers of parallel earths.

It would be foolish to plan on the basis that someone else was going to show up with a better plan.

  Let's be SUPER SECRET because maybe the space whale of doom will understand whatever the hell we're trying to do and wipe out organization. Despite the fact that it can probably see the future any time it wants to.

They knew that Zion had the power to destroy them if he wanted to. They knew that at some point in the future, he would want to. They didn't know exactly when. So they figured their best chance to have enough time to prepare to fight back would be to minimize the number of traces that could lead Zion back to them. Maybe Zion was just going to use crazy powers to find them regardless. But maybe not. Given the stakes involved, it wouldn't make any sense to gamble with that. I believe they also were aware from trigger visions that Zion and Eden had previously destroyed many, many worlds that had attempted to fight them straight-up. Secrecy was clearly the smarter choice.

  I, a vanilla human, will lead the SUPER SECRET organization. Not the person who's power is “winning,” the competence-porn statistician, the flying brick who could out-argue Socrates for fun, or the man who's superpower is literally making the best plans. I provide something irreplaceable, and that irreplaceable thing is worth more than anything those people could bring to the table.

This is actually one of their smarter moves.

Unlike most of the rest of the world, Cauldron was fully aware that the same powers they hoped to use to fight Zion were in fact parasites created and possibly controlled by him and Eden for purposes inimical to human life. They knew that shards were designed to foment unnecessary conflict by warping the minds of their human hosts. What they were never sure about was the full extent to which the shards could influence their hosts, or the level of intelligence that went into that. Without knowing the strength or capabilities of the mental influences these enemy alien parasites have on their thinkers, it would be extremely dangerous to fully hand over the leadership to them.

For the general populace, that would be paranoia, baseless discrimination, and stupid given the greater capabilties of strong Thinkers. But for Cauldron, it was just plain fact that every Thinker was under some degree of mental influence by the same enemy they hoped to survive eradication from.

Now, here's a better objection and the other side to it:

Objection: Rather than putting the particular humans in charge who just by random chance happened to stumble over Eden's remains, wouldn't it make more sense to use Contessa's powers to locate and recruit the best possible people for the job and put them in charge?

Rebuttal: But what degree of Eden's influences remain in attempting to use Path to Victory to select the best people? Can they be sure? For how long after they started out should they have tested Contessa's powers in order to decide whether to trust Path to Victory for something like this? Could Path to Victory predict that and give them whatever answers would assure them of its safety, in plans to support Eden/Zion in the end? How can they be sure?

I think this one can definitely be argued either way. The paranoia and second-guessing involved in making such high-stakes decisions wouldn't be easy to deal with.
