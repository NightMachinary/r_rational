You know how there is that sentence, that claims you can read words even when the letters in the middle of words are in a random order, as long as the first and the last letter are in the correct places? And the claim itself is written with the middles of the words permuted like that? This story feels a bit like that. Like it makes more sense than any individual piece of it can justify. Illusion? Truth?
