So I'm thinking that ticket winners are people who have a good idea of their core utility function, and give an answer along those lines.

The artist left a blank.

The layabout put something about vaping.

The cultist put something about the ocean.

I'm currently wondering if the candidates will be representative of the perceived sins of the current era in some way, similar to the books.

The only current hole I have in that idea is that I can't figure out what the artist represents. The cultist seems to be small world, extreme ideologies that tend to spread around closed groups. The layabout could be apathetic sentiment or disconnecting from society, but it feels a bit tenuous.
