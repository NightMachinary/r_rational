On the note of ways Praes can cause massive problems for Callow:

  “As the only son of Lord Warlock, I assume you are familiar with what the Calamities refer to as the ‘Dark Day protocol'.”

  Masego frowned.

  “I am,” he said. “It's a classification for workings they use. The best way to describe them would be /kingdom-killers/. Uncle Amadeus has never lifted restriction on their use that I know of, though study is another matter.”

The discussion moved on to Still Water, which Akua used to /very easily/ turn the 100,000 citizens of Liesse into better-than-average necromantic constructs. Dark Day protocol implies Praes has /several/ weapons or weaponizable ideas that operate on at least a similar scale.

Since the end of Book 3, we haven't really seen a lot of collateral damage on Cat's side of things. I wouldn't say the battles have toned down, but they've mostly taken place in Procer or the Everdark, and most of the casualties have been on the enemies' sides. With open war with Praes inching closer, do you think Callow is going to see Praes unleash at least one of these kingdom killers?
