These discussion/planning chapters can be a little halting, slowing down the action a bit, but I actually really enjoy them. They're arguably the most "rational" part of the story, as our characters suss out what they have, what they know, what they want, and how they can get it.

I also like that since EE has never really tried to make the Guide a rationalist story that full weight is given to Cat's emotional concern for Black.
