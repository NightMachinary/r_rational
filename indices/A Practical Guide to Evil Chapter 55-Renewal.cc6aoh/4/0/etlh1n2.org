The Dead King wanted to and succeeded in using Masegos wast abilities and the aspect Witness to see the Bards plan. He got in Masegos head through the Kabbalis Book of Darkness, that Masego used as a spring board for aposteosis in search of power so he could remake one of the fathers he lost in Thalassina, the devil Tikoloshe.
