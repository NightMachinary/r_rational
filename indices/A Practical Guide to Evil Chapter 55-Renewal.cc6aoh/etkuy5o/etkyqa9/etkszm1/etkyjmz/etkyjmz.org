Welp Cat's a well First Prince maker, even if that power might shatter the Principate and doom Calernia. I'm not sure if Cat can afford to sell out Black though, considering he's the defacto leader of all of the Praes legions, granted there's only like three of them anywhere threatening. At the same time well it's hard to say exactly how much influence he still has even in the what half? more of the legion(s) that are made up of both Callowans and Praes folk. And of course there's both Assassin and Scribe who are the remaining Calamities and while we still don't have much to say about Assassin's motivations or anything really, Scribe would destroy both Praes and Callow in retribution or as much as she could.
