  Assassin and Scribe who are the remaining Calamities

You forgot Ranger. Scribe is a honorary member of the Calamities, and wants whatever Black wants. And we don't have any new of Assassin since Akua had him stabbed in Liesse, but the fact that Black had arrangements with Assassin to have himself murdered if he ever became a threat to the empire, makes everything a bit ominous.
