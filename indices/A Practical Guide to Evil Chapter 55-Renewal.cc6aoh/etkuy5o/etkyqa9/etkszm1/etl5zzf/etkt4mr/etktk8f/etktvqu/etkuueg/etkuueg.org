To be honest, Malicia has quite a few ways to cause massive problems for Callow. Her only limiting factors, as always, are going to be internal. Namely, what she can do while also keeping Praes together under her reign. A task made significantly harder recently than it's been in years if not decades.

For example, it seems extremely unlikely that the fiscal issues Ratface was worried about have really in any way been resolved, since we've already heard that at least the vast majority of the dwarven money Cat got was spent on buying goblin munitions rather than buying back devalued currency. But, on the other hand, it also seems less than likely that Malicia's reign could at this time withstand the currency debasement required to put the hurt on Callow
