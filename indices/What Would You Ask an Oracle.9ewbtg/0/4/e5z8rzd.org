Who says it's optimal? [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717691/why-is-the-minimalist-example-haskell-quicksort-not-a-true-quicksort]]. You have to include your specifications of 'optimal' in X, or you'll get something that's short, but doesn't necessarily have a great run time. Like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort][bubble sort]]: short but slow.

That's surprising. I'd have thought you could use brute force; Just run "0", then "1", then "10", etc.

  "Is the first bit of the smallest possible computer program to accomplish X a 1?"

What happens if you ask this question about a task for which there is no computer program?
