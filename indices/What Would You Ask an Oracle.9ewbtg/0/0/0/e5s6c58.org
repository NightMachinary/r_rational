  Also, what would the program run on? Software that run on modern computers are pretty bloated aren't they?

You could make up a virtual machine with arbitrarily small and terse instructions to get around this, then specify an optimal program on said virtual machine. As a first attempt, you might include an algorithmic random number generator that can provably reach a number of arbitrary-length sequences exponential to the length of the seed, then use the oracle to guess the seed of a much longer program.
