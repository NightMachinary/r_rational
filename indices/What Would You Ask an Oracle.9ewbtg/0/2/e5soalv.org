If there's 26 characters in the English alphabet, plus a space, could you not just use your method to create a program to output a textual answer to a question with a non yes/no answer? Like if you asked “If I created a program that outputs the name of the substance that can cure cancer, would the first character of the output message be A?” And repeat every hour, you'd get approximately 11-12 characters a day. Depending on how you frame the question you could probably get full sentence answers in a few days. I also don't understand computers too well so please tell me if this is totally stupid
