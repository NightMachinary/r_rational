The truly optimal approach is to ask the oracle to generate the bits of a piece of compressed text. For example, a very simple form of compression is dictionary compression where the oracle just outputs the offset of the word within a dictionary. In practice we would probably use one of our more sophisticated text compression methods, which can achieve very low bit per word rates.
