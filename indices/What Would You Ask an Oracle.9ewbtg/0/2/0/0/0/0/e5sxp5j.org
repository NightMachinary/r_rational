Also going on, if we ask if FTL travel is possible, and the answer is yes, we could get our program to write a step by step guide on how to achieve it. It could take millennia with this method but we could also ask if humans could possibly achieve FTL autonomously and if so if it would take longer than using the oracle, and if yes the oracle method would be worth it despite taking so long
