I would add a patch: The oracle can only give what the answer to xyz would have been if the oracle did not exist to influence the world. This changes the problem a bit, but it naturally prevents truly random events (eg. gambling) or self-contradictions like you described. I found this patch in one of the biweekly challenge responses.
