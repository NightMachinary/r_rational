This assumes that you can contradict the Oracle's predictions. By nature of the experiment, if the Oracle says "yes" to "would I live to see ten more years?" you cannot kill yourself, and neither can anything else until those ten years are up.

Self fulfilling prophecies do not prevent the Oracle from existing.
