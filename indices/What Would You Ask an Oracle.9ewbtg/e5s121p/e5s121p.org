Scenario (1, a): Since it's natural language, maybe try for some linguistic tricks. "Is the following true: I will win the lottery tomorrow if and only if you answer my question with 'yes'?"

Scenario (2, b): You can probably get pretty far just asking a series of "Is the first bit of the smallest possible computer program to accomplish X a 1?", "Is the second bit of the smallest possible computer program to accomplish X a 1?", etc. This only transfers data to you at 24 bytes per day, but might work depending on how small truly optimal programs are. (We have some reason to suspect they are tiny but unfindable - finding the smallest version of a program is provably uncomputable in general. But the Oracle could know it!)
