(1,a): The oracle wouldn't answer if the question doesn't have a truth value. This isn't a hack but is part of the specification of Oracle machines in general. They can solve every decision problem but not all problems qualify as decision problems. That said, I don't really get the question I guess. Supposing you were going to win the lottery anyway it would answer "yes", and if you were going to lose, the oracle would answer "no"? That sounds too simple a resolution, so I suspect I'm not fully understanding the question.\\

(2,b): I made it a 1h limit to prevent this, but it seems I wasn't sceptical enough. Also, what would the program run on? Software that run on modern computers are pretty bloated aren't they? Can a few KB software usefully run on a modern computer? There's also the fact that payoff would most likely be in years. I think I'll update to a question a day if this is still possible.\\
