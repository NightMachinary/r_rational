So by that logic, if you tried to crack a hash using quantum suicide, the most likely outcome would be that... you'd be dead. Though sure, in the end, the only you that'd be still around would be the one who can savour triumph.

I mean, ok, you can't really "experience non existing", but you can break the continuity of experience forever. Though in general it's hard to wrap one's head about what exactly does this mean. I'm not saying it's perfectly clear to me either, but as a general rule: a) I wouldn't take evidence for MWI as evidence for quantum immortality, and b) I wouldn't trust myself to be objective about judging scenarios promising immortality, because frankly as all of the history of religions teaches us those are /way/ too tempting to think we can easily assess them fairly.
