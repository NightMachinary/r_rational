I don't see how MWI implies quantum suicide. What part of moving from the Copenhagen interpretation ("Superpositions collapse before conscious observation.") to MWI ("There's no reason to believe that.") makes you think that it introduces the rule "I am guranteed to survive."?

If "I am guranteed to survive." is implemented by you ending up in a random timeline where you survived, then deciding to abuse quantum immortality retroactively makes all events from your birth to that point less likely along with whatever events after your decision your abuse intends to make unlikely.
