Assume Many Worlds is true. Connect a macrospic effect to the output of a quantum RNG. If the quantum RNG output wasn't what was desired kill yourself. Suppose you're trying to crack a password for which there are quadrillions of combinations. All you need is a quantum RNG that you can map to each of the inputs. Try each of the outputs of the quantum RNG for the password. Kill yourself if you get the wrong password. Because of Many Worlds, the world in which you survive would be the world in which you got the right password, and you would only ever observe your survival. This can be used to e.g pick the winning ticket for the lottery, game the stock market, etc.
