You only experience only one timeline , I'm just saying that all posible future you are you. You have aprobability of experiencing being whoever of them. Like you basically were saying in the many worlds case. But instead of relying on "continuity" you just consider anything that is like you to be potentially you.

If someone copies you to a computer you have a 50% chance of experiencing being the one on the computer. Not after they copy you , since you already have diferent memories and thoughts , but on the moment they copy you.

The diference in the death thing Is that I divide the subjective probability of being any future self between the ones that keep existing existing , while you assign a probability to being the one that dies.

I'm thinking about some way of dying where you just stop existing , in most other cases there would be versions of you that experience slowly dying . At t0 I exist and at t1 I don't.

Its not that you somehow experience all universes or something like that.

And if you destroyed all copies of me and made a computationally equivalent one in 1000 years , I will consider that I will experience waking up in a 1000 years. I can experience lying on the floor bleeding and slowly loosing consciousnness You can even have half dead versions of me that would be basically like being death for most purposes. but I cannot experience not existing .
