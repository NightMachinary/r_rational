Nah, it doesn't require any special notion of consciousness. What happens is that at the experiment, several copies of you are made. All copies but one died, so the copy that does survive experiences the beneficial outcome. Because the copies were identical before the split, "you" (in this case the copy that survives) would only experience yourself going through the beneficial outcome. Continuity would be unbroken.
