I don't really believe in P-zombies either, but can't discard the idea. But yeah, if you asked me, I think Searle's Chinese room argument and all related ideas are nonsense. It's just weird to accept that "systems" can be conscious even when if you look at their individual information-processing parts they don't look conscious at all. If I had to give my interpretation of it I'd say what makes the whole "I think, therefore I am" thing work for me is a boundary between a very highly integrated information processing system (my brain) and a much lower integrated information processing system (the society at large of which I am part and with which I exchange information). Without this sort of distinction I'd have then to speculate on where does it stop - are countries, or humanity as a whole, "conscious" in the sense that they do experience inner life even though we can't communicate with them? That too sounds like nonsense, but it's hard to put my finger on /why/ is it that I expect it not to be true. Seems too much of a gut feeling.
