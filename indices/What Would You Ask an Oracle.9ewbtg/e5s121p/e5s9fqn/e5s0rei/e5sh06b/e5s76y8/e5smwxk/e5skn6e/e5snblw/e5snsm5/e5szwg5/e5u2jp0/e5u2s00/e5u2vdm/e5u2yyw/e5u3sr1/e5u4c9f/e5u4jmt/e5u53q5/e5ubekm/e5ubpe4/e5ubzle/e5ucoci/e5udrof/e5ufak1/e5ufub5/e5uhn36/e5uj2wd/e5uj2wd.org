I kind of asume that an upload would be conscious , and a P-zombie doesn't sound like somehting that can really exist .I'm not saying I'm not sure how consciousnes works but "imagine if there was a part of the human brain you can zap to turn someone into a perfectly functional P-zombie " this really sounds incoherent in some way .Consciousness is whatever makes me say and think I'm conscious , or it would be really suspicious to have something that says its conscious for no reason that just happens to be the same thing that can host this mysterious consciousness thing.

A teleporter clearly doesn't create P-zombies ,so that case Is pretty much only about continuity , and I think computational continuity is the one that makes more sense( since if you start doing though experiments the concept of "original" becomes weird really fast ,and many worlds already forces you to decide there are more than one entities on the future you can call you).

Btw in the quantum suicide hash thing now that I think of it there is more than a 50% chance you will find yourself to be the version of you that by chance gets a hash that contains "do not mess whith time" or somethng like that and decides to stop if you don't take precautions for that.
