I don't understand your reasoning if quantum suicide worked the very nature of it is such that no one but people aware that a quantum suicide experiment was carried out would know that it worked. E.g (assuming MWI is true) if I do a quantum suicide experiment to say guess the winning lottery ticket, only the people aware of the experiment, and only in the world in which I correctly guessed the winning ticket would evidence be provided for MWI (and strong evidence at that). In all other worlds, I would die, but that would only be extremely weak evidence against many worlds, as everyone except me would expect to observe my death.\\

EY believes in MWI, and as far as (my limited understanding) can tell, MWI implies quantum suicide.
