Yeah I already said that in a comment elsewhere. You are optimizing your experiences , not the universe , soif you care about the universe it (its not even about other people , a paperclip maximizer wouln't quantum suicide) There are also other reasons why quantum suicide is an horrible idea, even if yourutility Like welll the thing I was going to write about a year ago , the fact that optimization proceses like that can be dangerous. maybe I should actually do it now that I'm inspired again. Quantum suicide its a interestinc case that its similar to the tipical time loop thing I like to think about but has other constraints and its optimizing something different (maybe? dependes on the details of the time loop).

Edit: And now I notice that you probably replied ot the wrong post and were saying thins to dragon god who does seem to think quantum suicide is a good idea, sorry
