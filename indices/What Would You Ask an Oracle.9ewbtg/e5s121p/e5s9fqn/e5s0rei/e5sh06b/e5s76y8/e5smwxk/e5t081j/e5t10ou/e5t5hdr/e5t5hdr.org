I think that might be valuable for the "one question per hour" Oracle. But I wouldn't make it my only question ever. Also because, at a difference with knowing that FTL signalling is possible (which at least implies there is something fundamentally wrong with our knowledge of physics), such a cure isn't intrinsically impossible, so knowing that it exists tells us nothing really interesting or that can help us find it.
