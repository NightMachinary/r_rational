Senario (1,a): This one is pretty tough. It shouldn't be too hard to use the question to make a bunch of money via a onetime bet on some future event, but that's about the best I could do with it.

I could use it to satisfy some scientific question, but then the issue is that no one would ever believe me so all it would do is satisfy my curiosity. I could use it to answer some personal question (eg. will I live to be 100) but that would be meaningless given that with a mere 1 bit of information I would be unable to even attempt to change the results in any way.

So honestly, I would probably just use it for making money. I would take out a bunch of loans and heavily overextend myself to make a bunch of money on sports event.

Senario (2,a, b): This one is much more interesting, and far easier to exploit.

The first thing I would do is ask some questions to ensure I don't die in the time leading up to getting my more important questions done. The chance of death over the time it would take for them to be answered to be answered is fairly small but nontrivial, especially when the rewards would eventually end up with me immortal and by far the most powerful person on earth.

After that I would basically just ask it what the best question for me to ask it would be. Doing so would of course have to be changed a bit for the format of a yes/no oracle, but could fairly easily be done with "What is the [xth] bit of the ideal question set for me to ask you under 100 characters done in this same format for me to ask you translated from english into bits with yes being 1 and no being 0?"

Since its omniscent it would logically know what the best question set for me to ask it better then I ever could. Getting the result back of the question it would give me to ask it would take a while but the return would be far better then anything I could think up on my own.
