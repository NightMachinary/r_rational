Without loans yes, the best you are functionally do is doubling your money.

However if you are willing to take what would otherwise be crippling amounts of debt that would otherwise be utterly impossible to repay you could do quite a bit better.

For instance I would take out a mortgage loan for a house that the bank would be barley willing to let me get with my current salary (and that would represent decades worth of my income) and then use it for the bet instead of buying the house. On top of that I would take out tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt and as many other less reputable loans (payday loans, loansharks) as I could.

Finally I would use leverage (which is basically using other people's money to invest in the stock market/bet at a ratio of your own money) to increase my return even further.

Honestly as long as you aren't currently in debt and people are willing to lend to you it shouldn't be all that hard to get a 10-20x return on your current annual income even if you had no hard money on hand.

Plus thanks to the fact that the oracle can tell the future, you don't even need the money or a job now, all you would need is to get it by the time your answer to the question happens.
