I might be naive/wrong, but I don't really understand how an oracle like this could exist even hypothetically.\\
Imagine this contrived situation:

As someone highly worried about existential risk, AI is on your mind. You find this oracle and know immediately what your first question will be:

"Oracle, will I live to see AGI exist?"

If the oracle says yes, you will regretfully take your own life. You don't want to live in a future where humanity does AI wrong, and you think it almost certainly will do AI wrong.

If the oracle says no, you relax and live your life normally. Phew, dodged an existential bullet!

In reality AGI is 10 years out. What could the oracle possibly tell you? If it says yes and you take your own life, it's wrong. You wouldn't have lived to see AGI. If it says no so you live naturally, it's wrong. You would run into AGI 10 years down the road.

What does the oracle do in this kind of situation where it's answer influences the future in a contradictory way?

EDIT: Or, what about situations where asking the oracle itself is a trap? Where something could have been a yes if you hadn't run into the oracle, but getting a no is the only self-consistent answer that lines up with your beliefs and actions so the oracle has to say no, causing a kind of self-fulling prophecy?
