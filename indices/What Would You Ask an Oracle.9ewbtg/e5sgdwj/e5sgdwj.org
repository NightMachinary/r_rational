Scenario 1.a and b

Well, first off I would consult with a whole bunch of people about what I should ask it. And when enough people have come to a consensus I would ask the question we came up with, but since that is kind of the point here, my question would be:

/Is the universe (and by universe, I mean all of existence) infinite?/

Scenario 2.a and b

I'm a bit of philosophy and physics geek, so I would probably continue asking it questions about the universe in general.

In order to earn money from it, I would offer people to ask their questions to me so I can ask the oracle.
