Asking "can cancer be cured" would probably produce a pointless answer. Cancer isn't a single disease, and of course it /can/ be cured - we cure it already, it's just not 100% reliable (but then, what is?). Knowing if FTL signalling is possible would certainly be an interesting constraint to any theories in the future, but it suffers from the problem of many other such questions - it's much more useful if the answer is "yes" than "no". Ideally, I think I'd want to ask one question where knowing is /always/ useful, either way.
