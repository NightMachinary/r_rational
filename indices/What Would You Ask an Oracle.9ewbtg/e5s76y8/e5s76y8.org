"Are you really a perfect Oracle?"

No, seriously. Uhm. Being just a Yes/No question it's kinda hard. You can't crack any serious problems unless you already have a very good hypothesis in version 1), and version 2) still limits you a lot due to the one hour interval. And with a lot of questions ("Is immortality possible?" "Can we travel FTL?") I suspect the answer would be a discouraging and rather bleak "No", which far from being very useful, might in fact be something I'd just rather not know for sure. You can't even use this damned thing to, say, prove Riemann's hypothesis, because it's not like it will give you the demonstration, and no mathematics journal will accept "the Oracle told me" as a viable "Methods" section in a paper.
