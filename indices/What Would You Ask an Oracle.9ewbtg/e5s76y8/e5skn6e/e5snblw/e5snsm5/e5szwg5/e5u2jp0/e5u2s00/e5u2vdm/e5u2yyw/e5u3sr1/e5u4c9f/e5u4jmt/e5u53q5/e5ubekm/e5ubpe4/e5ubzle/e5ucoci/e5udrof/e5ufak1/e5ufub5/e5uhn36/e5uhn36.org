Well, sure, that's why things like that are philosophically very messy. I just don't think the idea behind quantum immortality is sound in the sense that it doesn't really apply to how our qualia /work/. Teleportation and uploading sound like they may work, but perhaps there's actually some yet not discovered principle why they wouldn't. Understanding what is the origin of qualia (imagine if there was a part of the human brain you can zap to turn someone into a perfectly functional P-zombie - ok, no, don't imagine that, that's a /horrifying/ thought) would be a prerequisite to understanding how these things work in any meaningful way.
