A "you" that was teleported or uploaded is indeed tricky IMHO. I think the only way that would keep our notion of uniqueness and continuity consistent is if in some way the "you-ness" property of "you" was tied to a specific quantum state, which then would make "you" subject to the no-cloning theorem: you can't be teleported or uploaded without /also/ being destroyed elsewhere, as a necessary condition. So it's like a spin flip between two particles - you're simply moved around, really, or at least you can be seen as doing that.
