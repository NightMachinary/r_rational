That's not how I conceive of consciousness. I think consciousness is like morality in certain regards, and so feel my notion of consciousness is satisfactory. I'm aware others don't think like that and would not try to persuade them to think like I do. I do not expect to be easily persuaded otherwise (e.g discovering that materialism is false may persuade me otherwise). I think a notion of consciousness that doesn't consider yous in other worlds "you", will not consider a you that underwent teleportation "you" or a you that was uploaded.
