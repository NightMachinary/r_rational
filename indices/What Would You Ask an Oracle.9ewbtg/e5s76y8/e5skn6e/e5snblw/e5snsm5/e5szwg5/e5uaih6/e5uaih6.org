Does that mean that there are philosophical zombies in the other branches?.Why say there is a magical consciousness stuff that behaves differently from everything else , why do you believe what you believe ?

Anyway your idea doesn't work , since if I'm not mistaken the wavefunction is continuous and talking about branches or universes or whatever is just a way to put it in a easy to understand way but it doesn't really work like that .
