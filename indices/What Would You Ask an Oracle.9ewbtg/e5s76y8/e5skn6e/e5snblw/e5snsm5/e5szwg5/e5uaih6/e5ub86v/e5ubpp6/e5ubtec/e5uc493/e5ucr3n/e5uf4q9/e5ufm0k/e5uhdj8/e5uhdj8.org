Well I guess one could be careful.

Actually it is really interenting .The main problem to face would be ensuring you don't try something too unlikely or something you don't want .And actually its basically about optimization processes applied over the universe ad what can go wrong whith that , which I'm really interested in that.In fact I was going to write a blog about things like closed time loops where inconsistent timelines are destroyed , and how the more you try to optimize the more dangerous something like that is.Heuristics about when an optimization process in general is dangerous , optimization daemons etc.

But I haven't started yet because of procrastination.\\
I did write something about it on an off topic thread last year I think .

Using it for figuring out hashes is probably fine (maybe) well unless something goes wrong whith he rng .
