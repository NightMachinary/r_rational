Btw I 'm not saying quantum suicide is a good idea, its a terrible one because you will end up in increasingly weird universes,and nothing prevents your mind to become worse as long as it it keeps existing( if you get Alzheimer you are fucked , the same if you just get hit by a car and your brain is out of oxygen for a while until quantumness saves you )

And it has a lot of negative utility if you care about the universes you leave behind .
