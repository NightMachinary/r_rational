You will survive because in at least one world the quantum RNG outputs the lottery number. The probability of you winning the lottery isn't changed, but you do win the lottery in some world(s) and so you don't kill yourself there. You're not immortal, but you're basically guaranteed to survive quantum suicide in some world.
