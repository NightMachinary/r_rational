Hmmm. You want maximum beneficial effect from a single bit of information - in effect, a single yes/no answer.

So, first of all, let's consider how to maximise the effect. The biggest thing that you can do - the thing that will have the most far-reaching effect - is to completely change the direction of your life.

Therefore, ideally, you need two possible lives. For example, you might consider life as an author, writing inspirational stories that encourage others to action; or you might consider life as a scientist, expanding and exploring the realms of knowledge. There are thousands of potential paths a life can take; so you pick the two options most suited towards your personal talents and abilities.

Of these two potential life paths, pick one. Doesn't matter too much which one. (Let us say that, for example, I pick 'novelist').

Then the question is, "Will it be more beneficial for humanity in general, over the long term, if I were to spend the rest of my life as a novelist?"

If the answer is yes, I become a novelist and attempt to write and publish stories.

If the answer is no, I become a scientist and work on expanding the bounds of what knowledge is known.

Since the oracle can predict even random phenomena directly, the oracle can therefore see which of these two options is more beneficial to humanity in the long term and thus allows me to pick the best option; and the potential scope of the consequences is huge...
