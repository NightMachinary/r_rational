Aah, I consider all copies of "me" to be "me". My notion of consciousness means that any entity who's psyche, mind, experiences and utility function is sufficiently similar to me is me. Also important to that notion is continuity. According to that notion, the copies of me in other worlds (which diverged at the quantum experiment) are all me. I'm a materialist, so I don't have any mystical ideas about consciousness (exactly the same configuration of matter in my brain currently will also be "me" for example.\\

I think subjective consciousness can end, but I choose to treat all copies of me as "me", which is the difference.
