I would't try to hack a hash like that for a lot of reasons of course .But yeah I would consider the most likely outcome that I would end dead , but I would consider savoring the triumph the most likely thing for me to experience .\\
For the purposes of self preservation I think I care about what I experience (and otherwise lots of thought experiments become really weird).\\
For other purposes (like thinking about all the people I'm leaving behind and how my death afects them )I do care.

Quantum suicide is an horrible idea, but if I was teleported I wouldn't consider it death ,and If I was uploaded destructively I wouldn't care as long as the one that dies does it instantly( or at least faster than neurons fire or whatever change in the brain)

A problem in that kind of thing is that personal identity is not fundamental,just a feature of my utility function , that determines If I care about certain computations.
