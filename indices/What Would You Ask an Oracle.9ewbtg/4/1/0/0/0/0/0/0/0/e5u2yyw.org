And that's the assumption on consciousness we're talking about. You treat individual consciousness as a sort of fluid that's hosted in many containers but that, upon one container breaking, is just poured into the remaining working ones. You don't admit the possibility of consciousness simply /ending/, or rather, you don't admit to the possibility of /your/ consciousness ending.

If your idea is right, then everyone's life past 80 years old will get progressively weirder and weirder, because you're basically saying /subjective consciousness can never end, no matter what/.

Sure, somewhere in the infinite branchings of the quantum multiverse (and that's just if we accept Many Worlds), there's going to be /one/ of you that survives against all odds. It just isn't going to necessarily be /you/.
