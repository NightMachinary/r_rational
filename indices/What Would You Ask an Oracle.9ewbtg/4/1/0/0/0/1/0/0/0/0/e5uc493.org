Lets say we go foward a unit of time . Which copy of me is the me-me, the one that was experiencing those things? All my future copies have me as their past , and some of them are dying independently of what I do.

In some of those configurations I just don't exist at all.

Not existing is not something I can experience ,so there aren't going to exist versions of me that die ,they just don't get to exist in the first place.
