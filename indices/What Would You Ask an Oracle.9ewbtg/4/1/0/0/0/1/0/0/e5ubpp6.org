Well yeah I agree whith that interpretation(though I was confused about states ) but then I don't understand why you you disagree whith dragon god and said "Sure, somewhere in the infinite branchings of the quantum multiverse (and that's just if we accept Many Worlds), there's going to be one of you that survives against all odds. It just isn't going to necessarily be you." There is no meaningful concept of youness to be had there. You have to consider all sets of states that are computationaly equivalent to you as you .
