I agree with the weaknesses you've identified with my writing, particularly the rough opening act, various conveniences, and how I've ended up having to navigate my characters through decisions made from a lack of information. Suffice it to say that the stated goals are post-hoc additions I didn't come up with until I was going to upload the completed prologue and first chapter. If you asked me what this fic was about, I would still struggle to explain it, even though the idea for it was in my head well before I started working on it, let alone writing the first chapter that ended up posted.
