  To my surprise, my fastest friend in the Knights was Gilbert
#+end_quote

It's a little unrealistic to have ALL the important knights of Seiros on this single mission, isn't it? Alois was present in canon, and I could buy Shamir coming along because they're now tracking something... I GUESS it would make sense for Catherine to be there since relics are important assets against demonic beasts. Adding Gilbert too strikes me as gratuitous.

#+begin_quote
  I was impressed by the detailed craftsmanship that went into these statues, for the individual rings of riveted mail were visible, and Seiros's long hair flowed down her shoulders like it was truly soft.
#+end_quote

Assuming that in this more rational version, people think Seiros's appearance is different than it actually was...

#+begin_quote
  She ran up to me and hugged me tightly, pressing the side of her face up against mine. I just stood there, unsure of how to react. “All these years, I thought I had lost you, but you're back, here in my arms, safe and sound...”
#+end_quote

Real subtle there, Rhea --

  “Enough, Jeralt. You've brought my grandson back to me
#+end_quote

Oh right. He's also that. Side note: I'm sad you went with male Byleth for this story, as female Byleth makes so much more sense to me.

#+begin_quote
  “Well, if I may make a suggestion, then---in his report, Alois told me of how you'd been teaching one of the Knights the basics of sorcery. How would you like being a teacher?”
#+end_quote

Oooh, nice. This makes way more sense than... whatever the hell the game pulled.

#+begin_quote
  Alois remarked that Jeralt credited you with the plan that let your under-equipped company defeat a demonic beast,” Rhea said.
#+end_quote

This would be more impressive if the plan hadn't been so simple and obvious, tbh

#+begin_quote
  and the Flight instructor.
#+end_quote

Oh phew, classes work somewhat intelligently in this universe, and Byleth isn't on the hook for teaching everything from bows to white magic.

#+begin_quote
  “As a matter of fact, I am as well. I've long come to rely upon magic for waking me. I can cast a similar spell on you, but be warned, it will wake you at the designated time each day without fail for the next thirty days, after which I will need to renew it. When do you want to wake?”
#+end_quote

I don't have enough information on this universe's version of white magic, but it seems like a bad idea to trust this.

#+begin_quote
  Tears started to well in Felix's eyes, and soon, he was sobbing.

  We've got to get him to open up to us. Ingrid, I think you should show romantic interest in him.”
#+end_quote

Oh Sylvain.

As a more general, ficwide note, I think you have a solid grasp of each character's essence, though the dialogue itself is a weak spot...

#+begin_quote
  “Father,” Lorenz Hellman Gloucester said with a bow. “I am ready to depart for Garreg Mach. While attending the Officers' Academy, I promise to bring excellence to the Gloucester name through both words and deeds, to find a wife whose marriage will nurture House Gloucester's prestige, and to discover the measure of our rival house's heir. May the Goddess bless me on this journey.”
#+end_quote

...except in Lorenz's case, as he actually talks like that.

#+begin_quote
  antlers
#+end_quote

I'd imagine there's a shorter slang term for commoners, though Lorenz would still use it. "Bucks" is perhaps too cheeky, but I'd experiment with monosyllabic alternatives :P

#+begin_quote
  “Sorry for the earlier deception. My name's not Nagir, and I'm not a holy man. I'm Lord Claude von Riegan, the duke's grandson.
#+end_quote

Other people have said this already, but you nail Claude.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm afraid Grandfather has found this kind of subterfuge a necessity ever since my uncle died.”
#+end_quote

Of course this is what Claude WOULD say to excuse the fact that he felt like dressing up as a holy man.

#+begin_quote
  “It's a Crest manifestation. Someone who bears a Crest can cause it to manifest with a basic sorcery---it's an easy way to prove someone's a Crest-bearer.
#+end_quote

This seems like a pretty convenient addition to the world. Hanneman's machine seems a lot less necessary now. Is there a difference between a major and a minor manifestation? And do crest heirs without sorcery have a way to prove their blood (I guess they could always demonstrate their increased strength/speed/etc.)

#+begin_quote
  “Excited to head to school, Hilda?” Holst asked.
#+end_quote

I am a little put out that the characters we've seen ingame get described, while Holst gets nothing. Filling in the gaps like that are an important thing for this type of fic to accomplish.

#+begin_quote
  “Wait! My book!” Bernadetta wailed. “Oh Goddess, I'll die if anyone reads that! Don't leave it!”
#+end_quote

Relatable. (Loved those last few vignettes)

#+begin_quote
  “Hey kid, I'm Professor Catherine.
#+end_quote

Of all the people to meet, lol

Okay, seven chapters in and I think I'll save commenting on the rest for another day. Looking forward to chapter 16 :)
