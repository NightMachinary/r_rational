I think you would really like Diane Duane's /Young Wizards/ series, which are my all-time favourite books. (and there's a lot of competition)

Goodness! Altruism! Moral challenges! Helping people! Saving the universe! (same thing, sometimes) physics! Magic, endorsed by HJPEV as "real magic" too...

Also half-off if you want the first nine novels in the next few hours - [[https://ebooks.direct/collections/customer-favorites/products/young-wizards-new-millennium-editions-9-volume-box-set]] - the series has been going since 1983, so no worries about it being rushed out.
