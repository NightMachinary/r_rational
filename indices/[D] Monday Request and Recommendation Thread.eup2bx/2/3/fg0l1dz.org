This is gonna sound weird with your "no religion" restriction, but bear with me:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]] is a very uplifting, inspirational fanfic of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series)][Good Omens]] TV show. The main character, Aubrey Thyme, is a psychotherapist, and her latest client is a bit different from her usual customers.

She is a very driven, empathic person, who is giving her all to help those in her care. I think she's perfect for your request.

Despite the supernaturally-focused source material, it doesn't deal with religion at all until pretty much the end, and even there it takes the original work's rather critical stance.
