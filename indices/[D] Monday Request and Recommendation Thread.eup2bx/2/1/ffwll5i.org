Perhaps Forty Milleniums of Cultivation? The MC always fights for the common people and the continuing existence of humanity and civilization, and is a lot different from other cultivation series where cultivators are only there for themselves. Cultivators in 40 milleniums would sacrifice themselves to protect the common people. Really interesting series.
