I would like to third this anti-recommendation for The Grey Mage. I actually read the original antirec and my reaction was just, "Yeah, that doesn't sound that bad, I'll go for it. In fact, it sounds like the story for me!!! Power fantasy here we goooo~," but it actually /was/ that bad.

The story somehow manages to contain none of the things I like about humanity, or learning, or magic, or even about exploiting timeloop fantasies, while constantly teasing to me that maybe it does, and this utter lack of fulfillment was agony to me as I read.

There was also a singularly extreme casual moment of unjustified brutality that no one in the story ever bothered to reflect upon, and this made me hate the MC instantly, despite having spent a friendly dozen or so chapters with him up to that point, and I never regained that connection.

The total lack of stakes doesn't help anything either. Despite the fact it is regularly updating, there is nothing compelling me to check in on it ever again (especially since there was confirmation from the author that one of the things that I was reading for was never going to be a thing).
