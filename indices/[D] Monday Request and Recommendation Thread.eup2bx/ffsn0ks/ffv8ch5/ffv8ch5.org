I would second the dis-recommendation for The Grey Mage. I would say it's just poorly written. It kinda tries to show instead of tell, which is nice, but doesn't do a great job at showing which makes things jumbled and confusing.

I only read to Ch 8, but he gains magic and time travel off screen in between chapters. I thought it might later backtrack to explain, but nope. One chapter he's going to sleep, next chapter he wakes up a day earlier as a time wizard. Wat.
