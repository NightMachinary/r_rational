Are there any Western Xianxia? I find the ones written in English to be better than the ones translated into English.

I already know about Cradle, but I'm not sure what else is out there. Thanks.

My rec for the week is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1175282/chapters/2394888][Love Pays No Indemnity]]. It's a good Lord of the Ring story for how Bilbo could plausibly enter into a relationship with The One Ring and Sauron. Mostly recommended for the way people actually talk out their issues in an intelligent manner.
