Forge of Destiny originated as a quest on Sufficient Velocity, but is currently being re-released as a novel (i.e., none of the mechanics/decisions/dice rolls are shown) on Royal Road. It focuses on a young girl, Ling Qi, who has been invited to the Sect of Argent Peak, and has boatloads of worldbuilding, cool fight scenes, interesting powers, and more. It's fairly different from Cradle in that it takes place almost entirely within the Sect's confines, but personally I think it has a slightly more mature style than Cradle, and doesn't go as absurdly fast in progression fantasy as Cradle does. The first book has also been finished (at least in quest format) and the sequel, Threads of Destiny, is currently in progress.
