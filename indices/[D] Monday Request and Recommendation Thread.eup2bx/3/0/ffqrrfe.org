You might enjoy John Bierce's Into the Labyrinth, Andrew Rowe's Sufficiently Advanced Magic, and of course Will Wight's other books. (Some of Andrew Rowe's other books feel a bit closer to Cradle - the series starting with Six Sacred Swords - but that's a prequel series to Sufficiently Advanced Magic, and I don't know how much sense it would make read out of order)
