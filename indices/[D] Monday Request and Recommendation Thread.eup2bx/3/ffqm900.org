I blasted through the first two books of the Cradle series this Sunday while sick in bed. I loved it and while I know there are more in the series I would like recommendations of series like it for when I finish the rest of it.

I have read/am reading WTC & MoL.

Additionally, Id like some horror stories in the vein of Cordyceps: Too Clever for their Own Good and The Promised Neverland.

I just watched all of TPN last Saturday and I enjoyed it very much.
