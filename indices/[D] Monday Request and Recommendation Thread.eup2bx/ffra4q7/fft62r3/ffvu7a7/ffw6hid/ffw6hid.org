I agree that conclusion is not the best possible, but TNC can't possibly have satisfying plot conclusion in principle. It's a story of uplifting/ascension into a different level of consciousness/intelligence which is completely alien to ordinary human. There can not be comprehensive plot resolution in that kind of story, because plot resolution would be outside of human comprehension. Author choose type of the ending "Meh, we failed to ascend and we are good with it"

Strugatskie brothers choose tragic end in similarly themed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Wanderers][The Waves Extinguish the Wind]] but it seems to me that type of ending end didn't make story considerably better.
