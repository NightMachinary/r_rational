I second unrecommending Bunkercore, had a feeling of anticipation through the entire first book only to realize it never paid off. Also I agree it's a weird arbitrary litrpg where things are vaguely gamified, in some cases for no reason.

It's a bummer too because I want to enjoy dungeon core storys but Dungeon Keeper Ami is the only one I've liked so far.
