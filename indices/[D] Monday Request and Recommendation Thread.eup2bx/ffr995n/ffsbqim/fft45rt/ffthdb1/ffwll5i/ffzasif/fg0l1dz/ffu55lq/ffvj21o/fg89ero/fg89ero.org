It's so depressing to me that the only way the majority of authors on that sub can think of to make Humanity interesting/inspiring/whatever is to set the bar /so damn low/ with the utter incompetence/cowardice/etc. of their alien races. There are a /very/ few good stories on that sub, but I eventually gave up on it since it wasn't worth wading through the muck to find them.
