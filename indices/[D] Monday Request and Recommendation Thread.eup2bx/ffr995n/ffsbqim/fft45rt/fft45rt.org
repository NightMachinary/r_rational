Is there a fantasy series that are... basically humanism porn? Like main characters with strong ethics and passion/motivation to help others (while also trying to save the world or something, lol) and that being major focus of the story. I really liked the parts of HPMOR with strong humanism messages, and would love to read something with the same vibes. Also, no religion in any shape or forme please.

(If you could recommend some nonfiction "humanism porn", I would gladly take a look)

(I guess a little more precise would be to say "secular humanism"/"transhumanism", but that just a mouthful and little too exclusive)
