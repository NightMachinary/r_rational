Here's something a bit different - the stuff I've /stopped/ reading recently. Some dis-recommendations, I suppose.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28732/the-gray-mage][The Gray Mage]]: (not to be confused with Gray Mage: Alchemist, which is good but on hiatus) Mother of Learning, but as a power fantasy. The main character is basically Zach but slightly smarter. Oh also (at least as far as I got) there's zero other loopers, zero deadline, and the main character has been guaranteed that he'll know if another looper shows up.

There's just no conflict and it's kinda boring. The main character is blind, but obviously that stops being a practical concern as soon as he starts learning to use magic.

There's also sex scenes, which end up being kinda squicky if you take a moment to consider the implications of consent and the power differential a time looping person would have over literally everyone else.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28356/carlfire][carl@fire]]: A sysadmin got isekai'd into his own game (that he doesn't really play), and doesn't realize it yet. It's one of those stories set up in a action / reaction way (some chapters are from Carl's view, others are from everyone else's). It was fun at first, but the thing is just dragging on and on and on - especially since literally every event is shown from at least two angles (and often three or four). I mean, it's at chapter 54ish and just a handful of hours have gone by, if that. It's not even slice-of-life, it's just taking a microscope to a mind-numbing sequence of events.

Oh and also Carl is an /incredibly bad/ sysadmin and that's just never addressed at all.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/17051/bunkercore][Bunkercore]]: It makes me sad because I really loved the rest of this author's works, but I dunno - the first Bunkercore novel was marginal and the current one just isn't doing it for me. The main character is a high-tech dungeon core, but his restrictions are way too arbitrary and game-like for my taste. If he was in an actual game that would make sense, but he's supposed to be out in reality where there's no real reason to have what amount to "perks".
