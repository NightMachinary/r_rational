You might like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters][He Who Fights Monsters]]. (Warning, can get squicky in terms of violence and sex, iirc). Might not really have the...hatefulness?...you would be looking for, but the main character does get pretty twisted up into an brutal, inhuman worldview by his circumstances, which I think is about right.

Better if you've slogged through even a bit of the source material, as it's a bit of a send-up with a rational bent.
