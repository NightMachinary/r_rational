Second this recommendation, in my opinion it hits at the edge of grimdark without tipping over to the other side. (As a side note, this might just be because I came into it without any knowledge of Rosario + Vampire, so I'm not as attached to the characters in their canon forms.)

That being said, there are a couple of moments that I think are just too lucky for the author to get away with, as well as one scene marred by a character being really stupid. Those are minor issues though, and on the whole would highly recommend.
