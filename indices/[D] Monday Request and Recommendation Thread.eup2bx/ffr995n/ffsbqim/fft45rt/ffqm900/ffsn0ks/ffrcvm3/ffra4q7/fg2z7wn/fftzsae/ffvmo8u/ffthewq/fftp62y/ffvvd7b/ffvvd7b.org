[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28360/river-of-fate][River of Fate]] is my current second favorite after Cradle - it's somewhat less rationalistic, but really nails the mysticism.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles]] is also really good, and explores a lot of the high-tech and far future topics that people like in rational sci-fi alongside its cultivation. I'd skip the first 3 chapters tho - just go straight to Girl.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15193/ave-xia-rem-y][Ave Xia Rem Y]] is another excellent xianxia, though what makes this one stand out is how standard it is; it really nails the classic xianxia tropes without feeling cliche. I'd almost believe it was a translation (it's not)

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][Street Cultivation]] is an amazing deconstruction of "what if xianxia, but also capitalism?" (answer: things kinda suck). It's one of those "pull yourself out of debt thru hard work and some unexpected risks" stories.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKGSDDQ][A Thousand Li]] is another bog standard cultivation novel, though this one has fewer cliches (but also doesn't shine quite as brightly as the rest of these recs). It's more of a slice-of-cultivating-life novel.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BJFFXL5][Painting the Mists]] is another good one - I liked the first couple of books better than A Thousand Li, at least. It started to drag on around book three though, so I haven't finished the series.
