I've recommended the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192725-masters-mages][Masters and Mages]] here before, but now its complete AND been released everywhere(regionalization was awful by the publisher), I'm going to reiterate the rec.

It's a pretty good and original series that is fairly rational, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][bildungsroman]]that'll also scratch your progression fantasy itch as well.

The magic system is complex and interesting, and it's tied with their moral/religious system a bit like in star wars, but less dogmatic and more nuanced. Most good people tend to be "grey" rather than light or dark, as being light is a very difficult, and being dark easy but very perilous and apparent if you're not a master. It's a bit like a karmic system, in that everything can affect your alignment, even eating meat (slightly, but it adds up over a long lifetime), and all light and grey side magisters try to avoid it and things like it, if possible.

My least favourite part is that the author has a tendency to use medieval latin or french words for armor or sword moves or army maneuvers (he's a scholar of medieval history and Historical European martial arts) and not properly explain concepts, especially when it comes to magic. It's not as bad in this series (it caused me to drop his last one), but it can be frustrating.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/269818-art-of-the-adept][Art of the Adept series]] is another Bildungsroman/progression fantasy kind of book. Not sophisticated or great by any means, but decent and competently written. It starts out cliched and juvenile but improved enough to maintain my interest and to try the second book, which was also an improvement.

Also, the final book of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49673-lightbringer][Lightbringer series]] came out last year. My feelings about this last book are complicated, but the series as a whole is spectacular and I can still wholeheartedly recommend it.
