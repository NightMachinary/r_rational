Looking for recommendations based on my favorite series:

- Mother of Learning
- Worth the Candle
- Pokemon: Origin of Species

I couldn't stand the big Harry Potter rational one, so please don't recommend that(MC was too much of a know it all, among other things).

I generally stay away from fanfics, but as you can see above I made an exception for Pokemon as it was so well written.

Thanks for your time.
