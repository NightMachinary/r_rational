Far from rational, but The Invisibles (comic) is a lot of fun, full of new age woo and four dimensional whatsits. If you get into it, be advised that volume three has its issues numbered in reverse order.

More rationally, Primer (movie) has a reputation for tying people's heads in knots.

Edit: Game recs: Fez. And seconding Baba Is You
