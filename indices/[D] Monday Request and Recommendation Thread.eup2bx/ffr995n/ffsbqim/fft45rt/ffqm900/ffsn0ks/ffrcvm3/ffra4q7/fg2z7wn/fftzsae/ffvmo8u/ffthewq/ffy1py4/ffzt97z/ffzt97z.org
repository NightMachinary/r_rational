I just realized I like stories where the main character slowly progresses in power and becomes nearly godlike in the end. This is partly why I enjoyed The Games We Play so much, as well as the two Naruto fics, The Waves Arisen and Time Braid. The characters get so powerful by the end. Can anyone recommend a well-written story (preferably Western, as I know Xianxia is basically this) where the MC starts out weak and becomes mega powerful by the end?
