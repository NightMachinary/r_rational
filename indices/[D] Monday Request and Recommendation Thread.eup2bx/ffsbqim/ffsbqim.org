In honor of season 3 finally being announced, I'm going to re-reccomend the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon][Log Horizon]]. For those of you who haven't heard of it, it's your standard "stuck in a video game" isekai, except it's not standard at all because instead of being about one un/lucky soul, all 30,000 people in the japanese server (plus hundreds of thousands more worldwide) get brought along. And this is no on-rails death game; people resurrected after being killed, and yet there's no obvious way to get home.

So instead of following your standard OP, powerleveling protagonist, its main protagonists (and antagonists) are already high-level players that understand the game, or at least what the game was like before the isekai. While there are plenty of battle scenes, Log Horizon instead focuses on interpersonal conflict on the scale of small societies; politics, economy, diplomacy, warfare, and discovery. And there are not just one, but several level 2 intelligent characters.

There's also this pretty famous [[https://imgur.com/a/AkeYt][analysis]] (a little spoilery) demonstrating how a particular battle in log horizon was the author adapting and optimizing the tactics used at agincourt for MMO players, which should give you an idea of how much thought went into the world of Log Horizon.
