  [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/269818-art-of-the-adept][Art of the Adept series]] is another Bildungsroman/progression fantasy kind of book. Not sophisticated or great by any means, but decent and competently written.

I'm 80% of the way through the second book. I really like the concept, but a word of warning to anyone else looking to pick this up: the MC continually makes horrible and irrational decisions. I'm debating whether or not to even finish the rest of the book.
