Hey I like your recommendations!

I'm on book 3 of the Masters and Mages trilogy and I'm sort of... less enamored by it? The first book was wonderful, and the second book was pretty good, but I feel like as it goes the series gets off the track of self-discovery and development and more epic action, which can be good in its own right but it's not really what I was looking for in the series I guess. I might still finish it someday but for now it's on hold.

I've got a few series similar to what you're recommending.

The Cycle of Arawn (and the Cycle of Galand after it) is about Dante's improvement from learning necromancy to actually using it competently (and he does get very competent). What I liked about it is that it has a powerful protagonist and his sidekick, but instead of showing us how they dominate their enemies it's them being swindled and outmaneuvered time and time until they wisen up. The worldbuilding is pretty good, and the lore is really good. It starts somewhat weak but gets better after book one. The best part is the friendship and banter between Dante and Blays.

Paragon of Destruction starts off like a normal cultivation story with a protagonist going into magic school to discover that he has special magic, but slowly evolves into something great. The magic is of course great and powerful, but what I like about it is the amount of traveling that the protagonist does. He almost never settles anywhere for more than a few years, and so we get to see a big part of the world with him. I also liked how there are periods where he is better at magic than melee and vice versa, as well as periods where he is better at magic A and then periods where he's better at magic B. It starts kind of weak but gets very good.

Reborn: Apocalypse is one of the most addictive books I've read in a while. The premise is that one person gets sent back in time to save humanity from extinction, in a cultivation world, so he uses his future knowledge to thoroughly set humanity on track to survive. The protagonist is meticulous like Light from Death Note, and watching his plans get fulfilled in slow motion is addictive as /heck./ That is, if you can suspend disbelief enough. Characterization can be better but it's fine, the series achieves what it sets out to be, a supersonic hype train.
