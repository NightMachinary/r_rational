Yes, I also didn't fully appreciate the tonal shift in the Masters and Mages series. It goes from a very intimate story of Aranthur and his schooling and relationships and sword lessons, almost slice of life-like, to a hard transition to epic fantasy in the second and (particularly) the third book. I still enjoyed it, but I'm always going to be searching for more of that feeling from the first book.

If you want a rec with a similar feel, try [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25451852-dawn-of-wonder][Dawn of Wonder]]. It's got its own problems, but it's good and long and the sequel should be out this year.

As to your recs, I think I gave Cycle of Arawn a shot a few times, but dropped it. Don't remember why.

And Reborn: Apocalypse was a surprise for me, I did not expect to like it as much as I did. In the beginning I almost dropped it because the writing was so rough, but the pacing and plot was so tight that I got fully immersed.

I also read the sequel, and it was not as good, mostly due to the slower pacing and worldbuilding problems(the "system" is a mess). Also, it's very hard to write a magnificent bastard/[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero][Guile Hero]] character as a single POV MC. Most writers can't do it. That's why Light and Sherlock Homes and so on are typically antagonists or foils to the MC.

I'll definitely give the the other one a try.
