I'm currently obsessed with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4]] and I don't really know why; I've probably read it three or four times already, and I read each update twice. I think it's because it really speaks to the imposter syndrome in me.

That being said the author's warning of "I love coincidences" in the first chapter holds true, so don't expect a hyper-logical chain of events in the story. Fortunately the coincidences tend to make trouble for the MC as much as they pull him out of it, so it just feels chaotic (instead of like a continual Deus Ex).

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28360/river-of-fate][River of Fate]] is probably my second-favorite Western xianxia story ever (after Cradle). It's definitely the best novel I've read in terms of expressing the mysticism and wonder I would expect from a realistic cultivation process, but that means the mechanics of the MC's abilities are a lot more flexible than I'd like (since they're literally based on his understanding of reality).

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside][Castle Kingside]] is going great as well - the basic premise is a modern surgeon gets pulled into a grimdark fantasy world, and goes from there. Up until recently he's mostly been mired in the suck, but now the novel is showing a bit of a hint of uplift (what with him introducing the scientific method plus his own advanced knowledge).
