It gets a little bit less irreverent - the MC eventually gets down to his goon re-education program and starts taking a proactive approach to MC detection after the auction arc, but that's relatively recent.

Castle Kingside has a really rocky start, especially because the MC is basically dying slowly for something like the first ten chapters. It is very grim, but gets a bit better.

River of Fate is a lot more consistent (though it has longer chapters). If you're not in to it by the time they make it to the city, it's probably not for you.
