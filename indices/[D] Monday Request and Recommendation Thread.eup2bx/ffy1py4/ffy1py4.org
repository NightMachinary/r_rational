I am looking for any rational fantasy or rational adjacent audiobook series on audible. I consumed everything on hpmorpodcast already. I listened to stormlight archive, kingkiller, dresden, and first law. I have to say the first law is the most rational adjacent out of the bunch and I highly recommend it. Is there anything on audible you guys recommend to listen to?
