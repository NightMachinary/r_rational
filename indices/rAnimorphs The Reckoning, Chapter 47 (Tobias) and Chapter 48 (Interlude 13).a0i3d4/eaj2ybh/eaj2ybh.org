There's a question I meant to ask for a while, completely unrelated to this chapter. In the AMA post, one of the bits you added was:

#+begin_quote
  You ever had a friend who you knew for years and years until you found out they did something super fucked up, once? And then you suddenly called into question everything you knew about them and their character?
#+end_quote

And then a speech about how people are still the same after you discover something disturbing about them.

Was that speech inspired by the controversy about Orson Scott Card's homophobia?
