Okay, stream of consciousness thoughts on the chapter and the interlude:

â€‹

1.  Quality chapter. Not my favorite so far, but good.

2.  The dolphin thing ... well, it's logical that this would happen to someone eventually, and it was handled well, but it's weird for me to think about.

3.  Wait, the Animorphs don't seem to know that David was a traitor, but they aren't trying to bring him back with a cancer patient... did no one left alive from before have his morph? Has anyone checked through his mind lately if they had it?

4.  I like all the layers to Tobias's psychology in this chapter: his competing motivations, his attempts to get past all the whispers of habit/fear/desire tugging him in different directions, only to realize later with Temrash in his head that there was an entire set of reckless and suicidal motivations still in his blindspot. By the end of the chapter, he's made the choice to be a controller. I wonder how the other Animorphs will feel about this.

5.  Okay, so here's the part that makes the least sense to me: when Tobias wrenches back control from Temrash, I can't figure out the mechanics of the situation. Temrash, in Tobias's head, has made Tobias put on morph armor. Tobias switches on his morph version, and the two Tobiases prevent Temrash from taking control. Then Temrash crawls out Tobias's ear. Problem: Tobias has not yet demorphed, so Temrash should be in Z-space. But okay, assume that Temrash somehow caused Tobias to put on morph armor around himself without getting sucked into Z-space. Then Temrash should have no control over the Z-space Tobias, and should not be able to hear his thoughts. Z-space tobias should then just be able to threaten to demorph and kill Temrash.

6.  The Chee have given Tobias something. I wonder if it's a device that can disable the Chee's violence censors and unleash their full power, like in the original series? Also, given that the one Chee had to blow his cover in order to stop violence, I'm forced to ask something that one of the characters asked a long time ago: what /were/ the Chee doing during the Holocaust and various other conflicts in history? Surely some of them would have had to blow their cover to stop the violence?

7.  Yeerks can morph now, and for long periods of time too, which is actually pretty cool and changes a lot. If morphing ability can remain even after the sharing, then yeerks would no longer need hosts at all to experience the world - they could just morph whenever they wanted to leave the yeerk pool.

8.  Visser Three has used a virus to genetically modified humans to produce Kandrona. That's not good.

9.  I'm interested to see where the plot with the new yeerk coalescion Terra goes. Can Terra become powerful enough to overthrow Visser 3 in 5 weeks? I doubt it. But if the Chee can be unleashed - maybe. Or maybe just give the morphing power to every Yeerk in Terra to accelerate Terra's ability to do things.

10. Oh hey, Crayak is going to use Visser 3 to create the Howlers. My guess is that V3 will use the Howlers as hosts for his clones. I wonder if Crayak is breaking the rules of the game here. Maybe Ellimist will catch on and have the arbiter kill him? Or maybe Visser 3 will figure out how to use the arbiter to kill them both.
