Only Tom was left alive in his original body after the near-total-party-kill, and he didn't have David's DNA. Also, only Tom and Tobias had extensive memories of David, and they didn't really care to bring him back, and the other resurrectees have no strong motivation to just based off the stories Tom told them.

My guess is that the Chee were straight-up hiding. In a world before internet and camera surveillance, I imagine they could and /did/ intervene from time to time, due to on-the-spot compulsion, and generally got away with just seeming like very strong, very fast humans.

The Yeerks-can-morph thing is going to end up being fragile. They can only keep the morphing power if they maintain approximately the same body; significant changes during the sharing disorganizes the necessary hardware too much. So giving individual shards of Terra morphing power isn't really a way out, except for small edge cases (like, Terra spawns off a shard that doesn't have any desire to return to the coalescion and is comfortable being its own person independent of the pool WAIT NO---)
