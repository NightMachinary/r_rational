A few questions that you might have answered elsewhere:

1. When was this genetic modification virus introduced?

I was under the impression that the morph tech would have prevented genetic modification, since you morph back into a copy of yourself stored on the z-space computer. Or did we lose that when we retained injuries on the original bodies (re: ax)?

​

1. Tobias was talking about ear plugs, but I'm assuming that was just for the person he was talking to? Clearly he doesn't have earplugs at the time, since otherwise Temrash would have been shredded (which would have been a hilarious bit of anticlimax).
