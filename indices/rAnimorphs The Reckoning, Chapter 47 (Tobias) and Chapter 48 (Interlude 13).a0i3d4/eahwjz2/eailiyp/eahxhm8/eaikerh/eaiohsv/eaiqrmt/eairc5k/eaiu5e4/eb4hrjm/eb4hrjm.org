What I don't get is why Tobias would trust Temrash to leave once he demorphed. I'd expect Temrash, based on what we just learned about him, to reassert control and lock Tobias away once there was only one of him, and then keep a closer eye on him in future morphs.

I don't get why Tobias wouldn't think this is the likely outcome, and why Temrash would then keep his word.

Assuming everyone is running on timeless decision theory and would cooperate in /real/ prisoners dilemmas seems wrong to me.
