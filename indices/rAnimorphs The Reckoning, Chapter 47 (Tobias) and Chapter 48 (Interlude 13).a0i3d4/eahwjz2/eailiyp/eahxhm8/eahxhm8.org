Re: Dolphins, in his first canon pov book, Tobias seemed awfully close to doing stuff with a female hawk. I got the impression that it would have happened if she hadn't been draconed in half. Assuming I wasn't mistaken (I haven't read that one since I was 8). Not sure if this was a semi-callback to that or not, but it being Tobias seems to fit.
