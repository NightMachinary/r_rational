I'm guessing that you're using reddit's new editor, which automatically puts in the extra linebreak on return; your comment has double linebreaks, which makes all of the numbers on the numbered list be 1 (since they're interpreted as separate lists each of length 1). If you take out the extra carriage return, the numbers will be accurate.
