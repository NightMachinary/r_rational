It doesn't look fixed. Did you add the line " The tingle of transformation began to pass over me as Temrash moved to demorph." ? But immediately afterward Tobias is able to use thoughtspeak, and a little while later he explicitly says that he is demorphing out of his morph armor. Perhaps he re-morphed immediately when Temrash left his head?
