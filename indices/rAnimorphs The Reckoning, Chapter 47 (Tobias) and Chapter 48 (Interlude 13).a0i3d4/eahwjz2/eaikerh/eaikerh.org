  Okay, so here's the part that makes the least sense to me: when Tobias wrenches back control from Temrash, I can't figure out the mechanics of the situation. Temrash, in Tobias's head, has made Tobias put on morph armor. Tobias switches on his morph version, and the two Tobiases prevent Temrash from taking control. Then Temrash crawls out Tobias's ear. Problem: Tobias has not yet demorphed, so Temrash should be in Z-space. But okay, assume that Temrash somehow caused Tobias to put on morph armor around himself without getting sucked into Z-space. Then Temrash should have no control over the Z-space Tobias, and should not be able to hear his thoughts. Z-space tobias should then just be able to threaten to demorph and kill Temrash.

Small mistake; thanks for catching. Fixed. They demorph before Temrash drains out.
