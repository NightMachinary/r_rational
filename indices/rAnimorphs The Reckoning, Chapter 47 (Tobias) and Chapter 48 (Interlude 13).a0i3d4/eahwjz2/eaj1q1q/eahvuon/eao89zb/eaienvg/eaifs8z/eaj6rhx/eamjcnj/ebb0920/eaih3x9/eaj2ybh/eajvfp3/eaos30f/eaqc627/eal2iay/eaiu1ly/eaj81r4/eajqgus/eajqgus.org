On a more serious note tho wow that is some shit from Temrash. Would I be right in assuming there is no 'anti morphing ray' and Temrash planned from the start to play off Tobias's better nature to get a host?? Is that spoilers??

I also on reflection like that within the one chapter we have Tobias' disgust at how inhuman and alien the yeerks truly are, to the decision to join with them - given that Tobias' own history and heritage isn't exactly human through and through.

On that note, I assume Loren perished in Ventura in this reality? Or is that a spoiler too?

Finally... It's definitely A Choice now that we're on people's 2nd and 3rd incarnations of themselves that nobody has brought back Cassie, right? We have her DNA, unless I'm missing something...
