We saw the anti-morphing ray in the previous Marco chapter, in an encounter with Visser Three. It's possible that Temrash was just lying, but it's also possible that the same tech was in play here.

I ended up folding most of canon Loren into Marco's mom Eva; I've left the door open to Loren possibly being around but it's unlikely at this point that she'll play a serious role.

It's not a choice that no one brought back Cassie. We saw in the previous Jake chapter that it isn't possible: only Ax, Tom, and a Garrett-morphed Tobias-in-a-coma made it out of the last few chapters. None of those three had Cassie's DNA.
