I don't want to harp on the dolphin sex thing too much, but if Tobias had participated in the Animorphs' post-Ventura mind-meld, he'd have already seen and shared equally embarrassing things. Did they never loop him in on their epiphany about working together better by doing that? Did Ax and Tom discontinue that practice once nobody else remembered it? Tobias seems resentful that Marco broke into Ax's memories and speaks as if he hasn't done the same.
