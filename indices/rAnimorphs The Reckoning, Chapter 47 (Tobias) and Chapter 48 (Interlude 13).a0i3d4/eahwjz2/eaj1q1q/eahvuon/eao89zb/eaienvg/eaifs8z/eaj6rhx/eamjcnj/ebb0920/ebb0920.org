My interpretation of Temrash turning into a self-interestdd asshole was not that he had been hiding his nature from Ax, but that (as has been more or less confirmed) Yeerks aren't complete people outside of the sharing or a host, with the notable exception of Visser Three who was specifically made to be that at a high cost to his original coalescion.

Temrash turned lone wolf asshole because Tobias is a lone wolf asshole. He became kind of mean and disdainful to Tobias because Tobias is mean and disdainful to himself. He walked off with no hard feelings at the end because once he left Tobias he stopped really understanding Tobias or being the way he was inside of Tobias.

Tobias' interpretation of “Yeerks are alien” is right, but he doesn't get that what makes Temrash so alien is that he became a blending of Temrash and Tobias and acted like that once he was in Tobias, then stopped being that way once he left Tobias almost instantly.
