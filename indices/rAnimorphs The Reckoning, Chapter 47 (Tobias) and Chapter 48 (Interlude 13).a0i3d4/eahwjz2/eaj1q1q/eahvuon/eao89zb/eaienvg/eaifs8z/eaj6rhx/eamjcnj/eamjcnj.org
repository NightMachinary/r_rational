Normally I don't do this sort of thing but I also know that the illustrious's [[/u/TK17Studios]] operates on a steady diet of our love and attention, and who am I to deny him a well-earned meal?

So, live-redditing reading this chapter:

--------------

- the stuff about beauty is interesting, i wonder what the payoff is

- that mica thing sounds so cool i will have to see the thread to see if this is something that actually happened to someone IRL

- all this talk about garret i feel i am missing context - what happened last chapter again? oh well i will find out!

- oh right! the animorphs were all resurrected by people morphing into them. and garrett- tobias? oh no. that's sad. i need to re-read this.

- emo!tobias as a dolphin laughing gives me feels

- the part about dolphin!tobias and the original dolphin facing each other and the dolphin recognising him gave me goosebumps, very emotive in so few words

- tobias is so happy i am so happy

- dolphins are moving oh shit something bad is happening nooo

- wait what the dolphin wants to fuck him lololol

- omg please fuck the dolphin

- come on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! did he???? (headcanon: of course he does)

accidentally clicked submit when I wasn't done reading (got to the first * * *), but i'll put the rest of my live redditing in the next reply i guess
