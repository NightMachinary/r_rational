We know that a coalescion can commit more or less of itself to a yeerk shard, which affects its power over its eventual host. Esplin is a super-duper shard made to take an Andalite, which are known to be neurologically rather extraordinary. Cirran probably made the first and only Andallite-controlling yeerk to be stronger than strictly necessary. Human-controlling yeerks are made lesser, and as we saw with Ax are unable to dominate an Andalite's brain, their interaction with it must be much more passive (unless that's a long-con by Temrash).

The description of the human-collaborating yeerk is of a much smaller shard that the controlling from, such that the effect on a human brain is the same as that which a human-controlling shard has on an Andalite brain. Unless, again, it is a long-con by Terra.

Curious that Terra specifically produces yeerks that can /only/ collaborate, rather than controller-capable shards that then /choose/ to collaborate. Though given the distinction or lack thereof between the individuality of the coalescence and of the shard, there may be no difference between the two, such that producing collaboration-only shards /is/ the choice.
