Hmm, I see your point about it being difficult to show every dot. I do think they can be more directly mentioned though, in a way that still keeps the story down to a reasonable size - for example, Tobias could have simply said 'Temrash of Aftran...in morph' when introducing himself to Terra. For the meet-up, which is less obvious than the relatively nitpicky Temrash-in-morph point, it's clouded by this:

/<Look at my thoughts! I won't hurt you. I'll let you acquire me. We can go our separate ways, meet back up with the others.>/

This indicates to the reader that Tobias goes back to the others (with Ruhak?!) before going to Terra. It may be better to change this to 'meet at the rendevous point' instead. Alternatively, Temrash can bring that up here: /<Goodbye, Tobias,> said Temrash's voice in the back of my head./

Is Tobias going to have a chat with Ax about what Temrash did to him?
