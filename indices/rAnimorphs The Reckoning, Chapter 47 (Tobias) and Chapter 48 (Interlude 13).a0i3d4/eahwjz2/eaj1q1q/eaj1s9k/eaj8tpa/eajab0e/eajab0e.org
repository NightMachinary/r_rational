I know the chapter repeats for a while that Tobias doesn't want to listen to anybody, but it still feels like something the others would have pointed out. At the very least, he could have used make-up and/or dyed his hair (I don't know if that would fool modern facial recognition software).

  and that's set up a feedback loop that's made me want to loop in more authentic on-the-ground culture about the places they end up hiding.

That's awesome!

Yeah, the worldbuilding in this chapter was great. The bits like the shopkeeper wanting to learn english or Terra recruiting tribesmen. It reminds me of a spy thriller, or late-stage MCU movies, where things just happen /anywhere/.
