re: memory: The way we've been doing this, long-term memory carries over, short-term doesn't, and the boundary is usually "did they sleep on it before being acquired?" Here, I'm playing around with the gray area of "could he have deja vu for something that he talked about before getting acquired, but which wasn't fully encoded in memory." It's plausibly a mistake, as an author, but I felt like I could fall back on "Tobias was thinking about talking about this stuff before he actually talked about it, so the deja vu could come from there instead."

Garrett morphed Tobias, stayed past the limit, and then was Tobias-in-a-coma. Tom was indeed dragging around a comatose Tobias and an injured (though often morphed and doing okay as a result) Ax. It was an extremely stressful time, off-camera, like the time Rachel decided to sacrifice her whole family to save the cube instead. I sometimes can't bring myself to dive into the pathos of the worst, hardest stuff (and I've heard multiple requests to avoid a Tom viewpoint chapter if possible).

Intended interpretation re: Tobias is going in as himself is that he's just /real fuckin' dumb,/ and that a Chee sentry on the outside recognized him /immediately/ as he approached the facility. They do, in fact, not have any records on Tobias (V3 does, but he doesn't share all his toys), so it's either that or the Chee was holoing him on the fly. The latter was a little too crazy to write in explicitly, especially since there wasn't really a way for Tobias himself to find out that it had happened, so I left it as a possible implication.

<3 that you picked up on the Portuguese. I've appreciated your previous appreciations about it not being entirely a US-centric story, and that's set up a feedback loop that's made me want to loop in more authentic on-the-ground culture about the places they end up hiding. I had fun doing the Malagasy translation for this chapter, too.

Intended interpretation is that it's Silat keeping Telor under guard.

The pool /complex/ is open to air, but as you saw later in the chapter, the pool itself has an additional layer of roof/protection.

re: Temrash's doublecross ... yeah, it's sort of like if a toddler had you locked in a trunk, and then you got out and there was a car chase ... I figure most of us would put the toddler in the passenger seat, despite its objections.
