Oh, also, one Q I missed:

Tobias woke up first, and that was what /caused/ Tom (and Tobias) to go looking for cancer patients in the first place. For a while, Tom wasn't sure if Tobias would ever wake up without a Chee to help the process along, and was just hauling his comatose body around with very little hope.
