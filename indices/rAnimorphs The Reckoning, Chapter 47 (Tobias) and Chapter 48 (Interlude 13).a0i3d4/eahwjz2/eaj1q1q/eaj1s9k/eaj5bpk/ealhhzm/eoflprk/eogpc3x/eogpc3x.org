It depends how you define "enslaving". Yeerks in this fic have flexible personalities, so they could probably be okay with an arrangement where they had very little power, if you put a gun to their head.

On the other hand, a government that wants to go full dystopia with yeerks as commodities that can be traded without any regard for their wishes and be killed when they outlive their usefulness would have to deal with the fact that yeerks live inside your brian, which where the interesting stuff happens, so humans would have fairly strong incentives to keep them happy.
