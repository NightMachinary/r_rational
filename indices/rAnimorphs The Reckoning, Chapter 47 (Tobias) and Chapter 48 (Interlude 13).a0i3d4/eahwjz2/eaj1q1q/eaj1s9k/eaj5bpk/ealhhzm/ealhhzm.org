Yeah, Marco's not going to like this.

"Now, Tobias, stay in this room for three days to prove you're not a Controller!"

"Aaaaabout that..."

Put the Yeerks in a situation where their survival is tied to humanity's survival, and hope the coalescions have enough of a grasp on iterated prisoner's dilemmas not to try anything clever.

Overall, remember that the Yeerks are mostly fighting for safety, and Earth has the potential to be the most powerful power in the war once it gets up to speed on the technology curve. If enough industrialized countries build space fleets, and safeguard them against theft in ways Yeerk infiltrators can't easily bypass, then Terra has a long-term incentive to integrate into these countries and earn their trust. "Empires are made of trade routes" and all that.

Once peace starts to look durable, you have to worry about subversion on a societal scale. People right now theorize about politics being secretly manipulated by conspiracies of rich jewish bankers; once Yeerks start to integrate into society, conspiracy theories will be on everyone's mind all the time. Everyone will debate about what roles Collaborators should be allowed in society; people will point out the possibility of a slippery slope where Yeerks make themselves more and more indispensable to society until they... enact some sort of evil plan, to plunge everyone in a slave society like in one of the canon bad futures or something.

Basically, every worry people have about Facebook, or far-right extremists have about immigrants, or leftists have about technocrats, except a hundred times stronger because the Yeerks /do/ have the ability (and probably the inclination) to coordinate and subtly influence the world around them. That goes triple in any country that allows Collaborators to run for office.

So you probably end up with scandals where it turns out that e.g. the London coalescion has been secretly coordinating political attacks against an anti-integration Spanish presidential candidate, 2016-US-election-style, using only hosts it trusted were loyal enough not to spill the beans. Computer security experts discover the attack, people get super mad, maybe the British Parliament considers passing stricter surveillance laws on Collaborators and former Collaborators, and meanwhile, the London hive is confused; (some of) its hosts and supporters claim "We were just doing politics. Isn't that what everybody does?".
