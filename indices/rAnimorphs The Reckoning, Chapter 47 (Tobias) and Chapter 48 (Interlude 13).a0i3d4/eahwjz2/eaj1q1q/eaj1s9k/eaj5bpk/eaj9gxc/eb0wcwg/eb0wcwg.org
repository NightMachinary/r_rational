I suspect that Temrash became more of an asshole as a consequence of his joining with Tobias. Remember that Yeerks in this fic aren't quite complete people unless they're in the sharing or in a host, and Tobias has a deep-in-his-marrow self-interested defense mechanism. He's been trying to be better, but to the extent that he cares about anybody else at all, it's mostly only Garrett. Temrash might have been fully intending to be an ally until the exact instant he entered Tobias' head.
