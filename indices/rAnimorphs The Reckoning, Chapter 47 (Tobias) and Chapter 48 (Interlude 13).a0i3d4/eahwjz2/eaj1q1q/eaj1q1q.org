Booooooh! After all this time waiting, I thought we'd have the best chapter in the world, instead all we had was an action-packed, character-driven mini-arc full of worldbuilding, mind-blowing character moments, and quiet insights on the nature of transhumanism and ethics, followed by another interlude giving us a window into the working of Ellimist/Crayak, that were all absolutely worth the wait! Booh!

--------------

- Aaand /The Recknoning/ is now forever known as "that fic where Tobias maybe has gay sex with a dolphin". The journey is finally complete.

#+begin_quote
  “So what?” I said, rising to my feet. “You'll just bring me back again.”
#+end_quote

- I mean, I get where you're coming from, but maybe don't treat cancer patients like they're disposable fuel you can burn through to make up for a lack of conservation instinct?

- I don't get what's happening the moment when Tobias argues with Ax and has flashbacks about his chat with Garrett. His body was saved during this conversation, so there's no way he remembers it, right. Or did the morphing process somehow give him fragments of Garrett's memory? That seems a little too science-fantasy for this fic.

#+begin_quote
  Was it all just---empty? Me trying to live up to Garrett, and Garrett trying to live up to me, each of us following the other one around in circles, and all of it based on absolutely nothing, just smoke and mirrors---
#+end_quote

- Yes, Tobias, you're very smart for figuring out your own character arc. Now go and shoot things already.

- I'm a little confused by what happened to Tobias. Garrett morphed into him, then stayed past the morph limit. Did Tobias stay conscious then? Or did Tom have to stash a catatonic body with him through airport customs and everything? If that's the case, why did Tobias wake up first, and how did he know about the extra cancer patients?

- I'm not sure how much sense Tobias's plan to register for infestation makes. Tobias is white, and according to Wikipedia virtually all white people in Madagascar are descendant of colons. The odds that the lottery winner in Madagascar happens be an /undocumented/ white kid seem low enough to be suspicious. Then again, maybe the yeerks did little to no background checks on the applicants, since they have physical security against weapons, and they can just scan their minds for long-term problems.

- Also, he's going in as himself. Given the security at the pool, it /has/ to have facial recognition. Don't the yeerks know his face? Come to think of it, they might not: he doesn't have a driver license, he probably never used Facebook, and Ventura was destroyed. I don't know how centralized ID databases are in California (and besides, the yeerks don't have easy access to those anymore), so it's possible all records of Tobias's existence were destroyed. On the other hand, the yeerks figured out their identities pretty early, so they might have sent a photo to the mothership.

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile, I would maintain control of the Yeerk in my own head by threatening to demorph it away if it attempted to raise the alarm
#+end_quote

- Yeah, I can see why Marco didn't like that plan. It has about has many holes as an anthill under machine-gun fire.

- (although Tobias could always unlock construct!Tobias's memories, use them to prove Temrash's existence (but hide the fact he's here) and tell the yeerk "if I die, the last shard of Aftran dies with me")

#+begin_quote
  Visser Three tended to go big, not small. Giants, monsters, the most powerful and frightening species from all across the galaxy. Like the creature he'd turned into when he killed Elfangor.
#+end_quote

- Yay for canon nods!

#+begin_quote
  “As long as we're wishing, I'd love an ATV and an Oculus,” Marco had grumbled.
#+end_quote

- Eh. VR is overrated.

- Wait, Oculus has only one 'c'? Mind blown.

#+begin_quote
  We all knew it wasn't a great plan. And even if it worked, getting through Marco's safety protocol for getting back in touch with the group would take days.
#+end_quote

- At least they're learning from their mistakes!

#+begin_quote
  "Obrigado pela su participação. Thank you for your participation."
#+end_quote

- Oh, I just realized! It's not Tobias giving us diegetic translation. The announcers are actually saying everything in two languages, like in an airport! Oh man, that's amazing writing right there :D

#+begin_quote
  The room was a brightly lit cube, maybe fifty or sixty feet on each side, with walls and floor and ceiling made of large, square panels of shiny red metal. There was no obvious exit---now that it had shut, it was impossible to tell the door apart from any of the other panels.
#+end_quote

- An alien face appeared. It looked at us in turn, and grinned. "Welcome", he proclaimed, "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENF23NZJ8kM&t=20s][to the Box]]. My name is Moralo Eval."

#+begin_quote
  "For this test, we ask that you please find a comfortable place to sit on the floor, at least one meter away from each other person."
#+end_quote

- "Do not mind the guards currently pointing machine guns at you. For your own safety, please don't make any sudden move, or sneeze in a threatening manner."

#+begin_quote
  Had they---did they have an anti morphing ray?
#+end_quote

- Of course they /oooooh/... none of them knows what happened because nobody made it back from Visser 3's trap!

- Oh. Oh wow. We're doing this then? /Awesome/. Controller chapters are the best!

#+begin_quote
  /You're stronger than that!/ Temrash laughed again.
#+end_quote

- Well, you can take the asshole alien slug out of the innocent human head, but you can't take the asshole out of the alien slug.

- So we're getting a glimpse into what Tom's life was like for all these weeks, uh? Makes you wonder why he's even willing to put up with Ax at all.

#+begin_quote
  “Help me,” Temrash said, with my voice.
#+end_quote

- Aaaaand you fucked it up. Tobias's dumb plan was going /almost/ smoothly, and you fucked it up by fucking with Tobias and making dolphin jokes instead of going back to mite form.

- Speaking of which, you have to wonder what the effects of putting a morph-capable yeerk in a coalescion will be. If morphing really is nanobot-based, there's a possibility that the entire coalescion will get the power-up after some time, right? (or die horribly because of morph-tumors because we're kind of using this technology in ways it /really/ wasn't meant for)

- I wonder who was controlling the guards. It could be Visserbots, but Esplin does love his disposable nameless minions, and probably wouldn't be too comfortable giving a bunch of Visserbots free range for too long. It's probably Silat (the other coalescion Visser made off-planet).

- Which either way, raises the question: how does Visser 3 even have Controller agents in the dome? Everyone who gets in and out is controlled, and you'd think people would get suspicious if everyone on security duty was routed through a different pool with no government oversight. Plus, given what we know about Silat and how the agents react in this chapter, I don't quite think they'd be able to sell the whole "we totally believe in the power of love" spin that Telor is banking on.

#+begin_quote
  Instead, we had emerged into a war zone.
#+end_quote

- Oh wow, I did /not/ see that coming. Very "City 17".

#+begin_quote
  A black smear of smoke and oil on the surface of the dome-shaped force field, trailing behind the flaming wreck of a helicopter as it tumbled downward.
#+end_quote

- Wait, I thought they were going to the pool? Is it open-air? I guess it /would/ feel more natural to the yeerks. Plus, they're in Brazil, winters probably aren't that harsh.

#+begin_quote
  Or not. Everything we'd just thought of might be completely wrong.
#+end_quote

- Yeah, the middle of a full-scale assault isn't the moment to play Light Yagami, Tobias.

#+begin_quote
  <There's an argument to be made that it's more important to preserve my cooperative relationship with an Andalite than to rescue one random coalescion,> Temrash said, in a tone that was almost dry. <And let's not forget who's actually in charge, here.>
#+end_quote

- You asshole!

#+begin_quote
  The taste of chocolate chip cookies flooded my mouth.
#+end_quote

- I don't get it.

- Oh, wait, I get it, he's saying "Have a cookie". That's mean.

#+begin_quote
  The swift and casual betrayal, the absolute disrespect for anything like my wants, my priorities, my personal sovereignty---and then the almost nonchalant reversal, as if it hadn't even been a big deal, as if it wasn't even afraid that I might carry a grudge---
#+end_quote

- I like this part. Temrash's kind-of-betrayal makes a lot of sense to me. He wasn't consciously thinking he would double-cross Tobias, he wasn't trying to enact some master plan, he just had an opportunity to take control and did, and he just /didn't care/ how it would end for Tobias or what the long-terms consequences would be, because he doesn't even /understand/ the notion that consequences are something that apply to him.
