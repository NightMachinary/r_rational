  I'm forced to ask something that one of the characters asked a long time ago: what were the Chee doing during the Holocaust and various other conflicts in history? Surely some of them would have had to blow their cover to stop the violence?

I think the Chee are only forced to stop violence in their immediate area, not to police the world for faraway violence they know about. So when they saw the writing on the wall before WWII, but while it was still just a "feeling" and not a big enough certainty to trigger the Censor, they had time to get out of Europe or go into sleep mode.

I think they would do this because they calculated that the exposure of alien robots on earth may constitute a real existential threat to dogs, while a Nazi takeover of civilization would not.
