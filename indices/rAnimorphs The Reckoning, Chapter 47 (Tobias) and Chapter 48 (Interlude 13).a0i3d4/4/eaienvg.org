When Tobias goes to see Terra bringing along Ruhak and Temrash, was Temrash in morph on him? Can't imagine that Tobias would've been happy to let Temrash back into his head.

Honestly Tobias' reasoning for choosing to become a Collaborator is not entirely clear to me. Is it because he's become keenly aware of his flaws and thinks that becoming a Collaborator would help keep them in check?
