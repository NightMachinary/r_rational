I think there are quite a few things a Controller can casually do that would require years or decades of training for regular humans.

  Temrash threw my body aside, a convulsive jerk that would've pulled a muscle if I'd tried it myself.

  It was odd, but the first thing I noticed was how clumsy my body felt---my steps heavy and uncoordinated, my heart thudding too fast and my breath coming too slow. It was like getting out of a new car and into an old clunker, or crossing the line from buzzed to drunk. It suddenly made sense---not just intellectually but on a visceral level---that Ax had only been able to pull through thanks to Temrash's help.

  I remembered the way that Temrash had piloted my body---the smooth, effortless control, the way my heart and lungs and limbs had worked together in perfect harmony. And Ruhak, offering the same help during my escape from the pool. Without them, I never would have made it out alive.
