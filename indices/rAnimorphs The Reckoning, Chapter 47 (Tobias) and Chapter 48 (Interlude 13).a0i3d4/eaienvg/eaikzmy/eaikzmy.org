  was Temrash in morph on him?

That's the intended interpretation, yeah. It's getting harder and harder to get through the story in a reasonable amount of time and connect every single dot, so more and more things are being left up to "what's the obvious way they'd do this?" As someone else noted below, I also didn't explain how Tobias and Temrash met back up after the pool.

#+begin_quote
  reasoning not entirely clear to me
#+end_quote

Intended interpretation is that it's not entirely clear to Tobias, either.
