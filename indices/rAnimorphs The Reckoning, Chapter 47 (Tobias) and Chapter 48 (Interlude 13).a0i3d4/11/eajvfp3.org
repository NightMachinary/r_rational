Hooray for Emohawk! The brooding, the spaciness, the self-hatred, the acid tongue! The animal thing! It was odd to me at first that your early series Tobias was so much more like late-cannon Tobias, but I really love his chapters. (Is Jake the only one who has visions when he resurrects?)

/The Capture/ was the first Animorphs book I read as a child and it's always a delight when someone gets Temrash right. I hate that fucker.

/Was it all just---empty? Me trying to live up to Garrett, and Garrett trying to live up to me, each of us following the other one around in circles, and all of it based on absolutely nothing, just smoke and mirrors---/

If only Tobias was a fan of Theatre of the Absurd, he would be comfortable with the idea that identity is an every-shifting reflection of other people. Alas, he preferred paper-back sci-fi novels about dinosaurs, which is why Crayak is laughing his ass off now.
