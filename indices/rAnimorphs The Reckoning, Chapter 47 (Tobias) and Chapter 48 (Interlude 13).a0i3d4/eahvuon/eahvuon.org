I think the Tobias chapter has everything litfic needs while not being litfic. As in, I could see it being assigned in a Freshman-Sophomore Short Fiction class. If not for all the missing context, anyway - and this chapter summarizes enough that an attentive reader could fill in several of the blanks. Not all, but still, it stands pretty well on its own.
