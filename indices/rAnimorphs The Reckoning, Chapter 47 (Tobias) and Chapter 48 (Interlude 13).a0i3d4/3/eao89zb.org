Tobias was my favorite character in canon, and I love the way his "lone wolf" status has been reinforced in this story, even with the inclusion of Garrett. Without Garrett that final tie is gone, and we see his mental state align even more with that of his canon self... All while being much more self aware...

...while still not noticing the dangerous turn he's taking right away. One of the things I love most about this story is the way each character embodies a different personality and perspective, all while being rational in their own ways. That's hard to do, and you're pulling it off beautifully with... 8? So here we see what someone who /knows better/ and would obviously recognize the danger of what he's doing and how he feels if he observed it in someone else, but doesn't recognize it as it's happening to him. Which is one of the most common failure modes for even the most self-aware.

Tobias choosing a yeerk so quickly after having such an otherwise traumatizing experience with one would be surprising in most situations, but you set it up wonderfully. In general the way the character's experience and thoughts early on culminate in the later scenes was well done.

Also part of what made me enjoy the chapter was probably the way the themes echoed themes of advice you've given me in the past, which was nice to see modified for the setting :)

I'm glad there are yeerks that are turning out to not just be "good" by human standards, but increasingly look like they'll be an important part of the actual resistance. I really got a video-gamey vibe from the way they said "give us these resources and as much time as you can, and we'll be that much more capable of helping when the chips are down." And not in a bad way: it's a good way to set up the value of forming alliances and extending trust, in an even more structured way than the random empowerment of resistance cells (which was also just felt like such a Tobias thing to do).

Looking forward to how it pays off, and his next chapter with a yeerk in his head. However long that takes <3
