re: Yeerk gender ... I used female and male pretty early on, with the assumption being that it was a combination of humans projecting their own preconceptions and Yeerks mirroring the host psychology. I think any shard or pool can at any time "switch gender," but often particular identity threads will hang on to one personality cluster or another for a while. Thus, Aftran (the singular, from the interlude) was female, Essak and Temrash were male, Visser Three is male, Visser One is female, etc. There will be plenty of Yeerks that don't have any strong gendered association, we just haven't referred to many of those by pronouns yet.

Heh. This would be your /second/ cameo, don't forget.

re: "Terra," I /wanted/ to have the embezzled pool on Ōkunoshima Island in Japan, but when it came right down to it, I couldn't justify the local voluntary Controllers successfully sneaking away enough to handle those logistics, and it also seemed like Brazil was going to be under less constant satellite surveillance than Japan anyway. But yeah, in that case it would've been Ts'kyu or however you would type 地球.

re: Terra industrializing ... note that Telor would have prioritized sending along as much high-technology knowledge as possible, and also that they were initially supplied from orbit by a Telor ship piloted by Essak/Marco's dad. They're not going to outcompete any of the Visser's projects, but they're going to be able to get some decent stuff built in fairly short order, especially by taking advantage of the power of building robots that build robots that build robots that build spaceships/weapons.

re: evacuation, yeah ... the geopolitical/diplomatic situation is fucked.

The Animorphs bring the Chee.

I dunno if this would count as a complete arc. I'm thinking no ... to me, this arc begins with Jake waking up and the reader realizing that everybody /isn't/ permadead, and it ends with ... well, spoilers.

Also I love you 5ever for the long comment, as I love [[/u/LieGroupE8][u/LieGroupE8]] and everyone else who leaves me precious precious words
