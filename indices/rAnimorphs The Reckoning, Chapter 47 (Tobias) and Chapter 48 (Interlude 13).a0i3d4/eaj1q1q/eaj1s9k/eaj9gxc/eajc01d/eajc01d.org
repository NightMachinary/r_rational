  re: "Terra," I wanted to have the embezzled pool on ÅŒkunoshima Island in Japan, but when it came right down to it, I couldn't justify the local voluntary Controllers successfully sneaking away enough to handle those logistics, and it also seemed like Brazil was going to be under less constant satellite surveillance than Japan anyway.

DEW IT

When you think about it, you only need a single military (or even civilian, I dunno) plane to carry Terra to any given place. Well, transoceanic flights are more complicated, you'd probably need some government to help.

  but they're going to be able to get some decent stuff built in fairly short order, especially by taking advantage of the power of building robots that build robots that build robots that build spaceships/weapons.

If it were so easy, the yeerks wouldn't need humans.

Besides, what they need most is raw materials. Aerospace-grade steel doesn't grow on trees.

Terra is going to need someone to supply it with energy, steel, nuclear fuel, electronics (or rare earths to make them), food and accommodations for its hosts and employees, etc. Shamus Young [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=30943][puts it pretty well]]. Basically, to have the kind of infrastructure we're talking about, you need a complicit government with an established military-industrial complex that can discreetly swap its fighter jet factories for space fighter factories. Private interests won't cut it: as Shamus points out, corporations can't move the money and materials they'd need for a space armada without getting noticed by a ton of people with incentives to watch them.

If you want to avoid the US because they're compromised, you want, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#World's_largest_arms_exporters][in that order]], Russia, China, France, Germany or the UK. Although Russia's government is probably still mad about Vladimir Putin's death. Probably pick Germany: they're a liberal democracy, with the decent transparency and human's rights record that implies, it's got nice symbolism, they're in the EU which gives them a lot of trade opportunities (and on the long term, gives you access to volunteers in any EU country), etc. Plus if you convince Angela Merkel to help, chances are you get France as well (depending on the current president).

Actually giving them incentives to give you hosts and freedom and internet access might be tricky, given that V3 already gave them blueprints, but you can probably provide/enhance workers with high technical skills that can help building the factories faster and better.
