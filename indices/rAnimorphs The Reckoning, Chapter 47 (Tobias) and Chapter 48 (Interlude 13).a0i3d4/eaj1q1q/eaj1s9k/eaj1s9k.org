- We're getting into Master-Strange protocol nonsense and I love it.

- Using magic ghostbuster things to capture Telor is a clever move. It allows the Resistance to have Telor as a hostage, without having to cooperate with any government that might get pressured by the Yeerks, while still leaving Telor alive to not piss off the rest of the fleet when they arrive.

  <Anyway. I know this sounds nuts, but I think if---if you let her---you know. If I can get to you, if you can get out---she says it's super important.>

- That's interesting. Canon was a little vague on the subject of yeerk genders, but their reproduction mechanism seemed to be genderless, and usually yeerks were described with their hosts' genders. But here Ruhak is consistently described as female; and yet Ryen and Tobias are male.

  “No. Telor is what we left behind. We are Terra, Earth. The first native coalescion.”
#+end_quote

- That's a /little/ rude to all the people on Earth whose language doesn't have indo-european roots.

- An interesting question this raises is "How sincere is Telor/Terra's reformation?". Yeerks are perfect actors, after all, and it's perfectly possible Telor would have created Terra with instructions to pretend to care about human interests until the time comes to strike.

- Another possibility is that Telor could have created Terra to hedge its bets. Telor takes any opportunity to take over the world that presents itself, while Terra genuinely cares about human interests. They may even end up fighting each other; it doesn't matter as long as at least one of them survives.

  “What are you building?” I asked. “Ships,” she answered. “And weapons. And the tools to build more tools. We are preparing for the coming storm.”

- I'm... kind of skeptical of the industrial capacity of a few hundred people hiding in the rainforest, very few of which would have relevant skills.

  Two months ago, a sickness had passed through the country. It was swift, and gentle---a few hours of coughing, a night of dizzy weakness. After it passed, there were no complications---nothing left in the bloodstream, no other symptoms. But everyone who got it was subtly changed.

- Am I the only one worried the disease might have left some sort of deadman-switch for V3 to trigger?

#+begin_quote
  There were still thousands of shards inside human hosts, but the Visser had evacuated all of those into space, citing the urgent need for them to feed. Officially, there was no Yeerk presence on the planet surface anymore.
#+end_quote

- I'm sure that evacuation went peacefully and without generous amounts of collateral damage!

  “This will no longer be Temrash as you remember him,” she said. “Not quite. He will have changed in the sharing. I do not know if he will still retain the power to morph, or if that will have been lost when he dissolved.”

- Ooh, /someone/ got a stern talking-to-and-personality-rewrite from his aunt!

  “De fato,” she replied. “Do you need anything for your journey? Food, perhaps, or money?”

  “Ah,” said the woman. Kneeling again, she dipped her hands into the water, traced her fingers across the mass that was Terra. It shivered, and trembled, and again reached out a long, thin appendage---

- Omagosh omagosh yes yes yes yes yes!

- I love how much this feels like a scene from a heroic fantasy book. The high priestess in her temple, counseling the young unwinding hero, offering him advice and supplies and maybe their goddess's blessing... All while surrounded by holograms projectors and anti-aircraft guns.

- And I love how informal this is. Tobias doesn't need to sign any papers or go through a waiting period or a ritual. The lady just pokes the big gray sludge, "Hey, we have a people, cough it up", and bam, free yeerk.

- Ellimist aside, I'm not sure I understand why Telor wanted the Animorphs to meet Terra so desperately. They already have access to a morph-capable host and a clone of Tyagi, there's not much the Animorphs bring to the table, from Telor's point of view.

#+begin_quote
  “Would you like to join the Sharing?” she asked.
#+end_quote

- You know, in any other Animorphs fic, when a kind old lady asks you that question, you're supposed to say "No!" and then shoot her in the face.

--------------

Something this fic gets amazingly right, is that right now I'm thinking "I wish every chapter was a Tobias chapter", but then the next Rachel chapter will come out and I'm going to think "I wish every chapter was a Rachel chapter", and so on. These characters are all great (though Tobias and Rachel are my favorite; they just don't fuck around).

Although I would like it if every single chapter from now on was a Controller chapter.

  and ask that people who repost these stories elsewhere put a note somewhere like "Not a complete arc" or something.
#+end_quote

So, does this arc count as "complete"? It has a logical beginning and end, a ton of things happening, and probably thrice the wordcount of an average Worm chapter.
