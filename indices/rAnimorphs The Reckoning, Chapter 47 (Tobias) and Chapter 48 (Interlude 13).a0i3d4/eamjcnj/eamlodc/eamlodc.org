- damnit we will never know about the dolphin (headcanon is confirmed by the XD emoticon tho)

- what's this letter

- so... meeting friends again?

- oh right! tobias remembers everything, marco and jake are more naive

- oh! he already knew all his friends, he just got the letter for some program

- and ax is sick, right.

- andalite culture moment "needing-to-find". i love stuff like this

- saving temrash is interesting.

three stars break point here * * *

- the plan for getting into the pool is clever, and surely going to be complete disaster in practice

- is tobias posing as a white madagascan boy or is he morphed?

three stars break point here * * *

- i love how they've somehow managed to rustle up an intergalactic airport in a few months

- for some reason this is reminding me of 3%, probably the portugese and the weird room and the talk of their being a test (probably a different type of test)

- omg the infestation is written very viscerally i feel violated on tobias's behalf

- [[/r/yeerksbeingbros]] at temrash being horrified about how suicidal tobias is

- wait is temrash being evil? what is his motivation

- SEE he did sex the dolphin!!!!! (note: i know it is deliberately ambiguous but in case you cna't tell i have a vested interest)

- everyone's freezing - ellimist?!?

- the chee? what are they doing? are they our friends still?

- i am not sure what's happening with these auxiliary animorphs - wait they gave morphing power to literally everyone they could think of, didn't they? so probably some of them

- IT'S AN INISDE JOB no no no no no

- Tamrash is so sarcastic i love it

- getting morphed!tobias to help fight temrash was cool

- tobias going into the pool to what, save part of telor? that's interesting to see how that goes

- talking to telor. very clever

- the people are sucking up telor right? or not? i don't get it either

- yes ryen tell me what's up thx

- omg the plan sounds awesome i hope it works i hope telor is good yerky friemb

- temrash AND a telor person? did temrash come back?

- omg they have a kandrona and a free yerk colony?!

  - nope no kandrona, a human illness

- humans who make their own kandrona are a GAME CHANGER i have no idea the implications of this but I am super super excited to read the thread and participate in the discussion

- omg tobias joining the sharing I LOVE THIS chills
