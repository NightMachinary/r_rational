They had rendezvous plans made in advance, as the Animorphs always do by this point. I just didn't bother to show them meeting back up. Now that these chapters are like 20K words and 7+ distinct scenes, I'm finding it harder and harder to bring myself to show every single detail, and am leaving more dots to be connected by the reader.

Presumably, Temrash waited somewhere for a few hours, and if Tobias hadn't shown, would have proceeded back to meet up with the others on his own.
