I was also confused by this. Mainly, it wasn't clear to me that Temrash's priorities still lay with the Animorphs; his betrayal threw everything up in the air. Even if he did act consistently with staying on the Animorphs' side after splitting up at the pool, I don't understand why Tobias trusts him enough to take him with to the new Terra (slash Chikyuu, as a student of Japanese I was very amused to see your earlier comment about the new pool maybe being in Japan) pool, especially if Temrash wasn't in danger of dying anymore. It was a bit large of a jump for me.

I did very much like the pacing of that last bit otherwise, and the "would you like to join the Sharing" ending, oh man was that good. Thanks so much for your wonderful writing, as always!
