  re: memory: The way we've been doing this, long-term memory carries over, short-term doesn't, and the boundary is usually "did they sleep on it before being acquired?" Here, I'm playing around with the gray area of "could he have deja vu for something that he talked about before getting acquired, but which wasn't fully encoded in memory." It's plausibly a mistake, as an author, but I felt like I could fall back on "Tobias was thinking about talking about this stuff before he actually talked about it, so the deja vu could come from there instead."

I interpreted it as being the sort of thing he would have said. A view he had once held expressed using the sort of phrasing that he would have used.

I have been in a situation where someone I speak to and teach a lot has shown that influence by independently reaching a conclusion I have also reached, and informed me using what seemed like my precise style. It was weird and noticeable.

Much more often I've said things to people that I don't remember talking about, usually by not paying the least bit of attention when I was telling them things (such as while playing videogames with them, and being somewhat excitable due to the rare interlude of pleasant social interaction, so my attention is elsewhere yet I'm also unusually chatty). Then later they repeat something back to me that they may have agreed with and I do a double-take. /They're inside my head!/

So the idea that a true amnesiac would recognise their own words without actually remembering them seems perfectly straightforward to me.
