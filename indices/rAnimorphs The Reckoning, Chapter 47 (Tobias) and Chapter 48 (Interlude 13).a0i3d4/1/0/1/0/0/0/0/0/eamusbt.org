I don't think Germany or France are particularly xenophobic? I'm not familiar with the other ones.

Keeping in mind that I'm not a NGO researcher, and that Terra would have a lot more time than "me during my lunch break" to shop for countries, here are the metrics I'd go for if I were a nascent coalescion:

- A strong military-industrial complex, for reasons exposed above.

- A strong aerospace industry.

- A high score on the Corruption Perceptions Index, which will be correlated with high public transparency.

- A high score on other independent human's rights indices, so I don't end up in a country that will keep me hostage by locking me up in a dungeon where nobody hears from me for decades. (I mean, realistically, that's going to happen anyway at first, but I want a country that's more likely to let me go once the war is over)

Given these factors, I'd definitely recommend Germany:

- World's 5th largest arms exporter, closely behind China and France.

- World's [[http://www.worldstopexports.com/aerospace-exports-by-country/][3rd largest aerospace exporter]], with 10 times the exports of Japan or Israel.

- Has the world's 10th highest CPI, 5th highest Human Development Index, 13th highest Democracy Index, etc.

Basically, it's one of the three countries at the intersection of the Venn diagram of "builds craptons of fighter jets" and "but otherwise cares a lot about human rights", the other two being France and the US. We've already written the US off. France has a 10% larger aerospace industry, but is non-negligibly lower on all human's rights indices. (Thailand is /a lot/ lower, if you're wondering). The UK is close to Germany on human's rights indices, but has a twice-smaller aerospace industry. Israel is about on par with France on human development and human's rights, but has a /way/ smaller aerospace industry. Same thing for Japan.

More abstract considerations: Germany has no nuclear weapons and almost no nuclear power. Not sure how that impacts industrial production. While France has already been featured in the story, Germany hasn't*, which would bring additional "international points". Although then Japan and Israel would bring even more of those, since they're in continental regions we haven't seen yet. Germany is one of the most influential powers in the EU, and has a pretty good international standing (I think), with very few other countries hating their guts (again, I think).

*Except for the off-mention of secret self-replicating spaceship factories, whose problems I've already gone on about in details.
