  Temrash's kind-of-betrayal makes a lot of sense to me. He wasn't consciously thinking he would double-cross Tobias, he wasn't trying to enact some master plan, he just had an opportunity to take control and did, and he just didn't care how it would end for Tobias or what the long-terms consequences would be, because he doesn't even understand the notion that consequences are something that apply to him.

So we have the above and the below:

  An interesting question this raises is "How sincere is Telor/Terra's reformation?". Yeerks are perfect actors, after all, and it's perfectly possible Telor would have created Terra with instructions to pretend to care about human interests until the time comes to strike.

Now that Temrash has joined with Terra, I think that risk becomes a lot more real. Worse, we now know that the coalescion can implant instructions into their shards that even the shards aren't aware of. And since Yeerks are unmorphable, they can't be morph-checked either - not that that's a foolproof strategy as shown with David. Wat do?
