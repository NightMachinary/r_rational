You know, I've been thinking about, what if the reverse happened? Humans enslaved Yeerks, by breeding them, regulating them, and reaping all the keep-your-heart-beating-while-you're-in-shock, cure-depression benefits at the yeerks' expense? They could be sold, and even forced to live in one host for the rest of their lives (killed when the human dies, if their life spans are longer, or swapped out when they die of old age if their life is shorter). Humans could maybe even forget that Yeerks are sentient. Or even breed the sentience out of them. (They're so small, how can they be intelligent? They need a host to be intelligent.) (Our premium Yeerks have been painstakingly bred to save your child's life and enhance their abilities!)

It would be interesting to read a dystopian story from a Yeerk's point of view.
