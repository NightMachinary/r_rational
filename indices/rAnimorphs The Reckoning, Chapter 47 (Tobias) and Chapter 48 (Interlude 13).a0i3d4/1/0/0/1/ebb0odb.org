I've said this in a few other sub threads, but my interpretation of Temrash's behavior is that he became a lot more like Tobias once he entered Tobias. Doing what he did was a combination of being a Yeerk and being lone wolf Tobias thinking on his feet and making what he considers “hard choices”.

If that interpretation is correct, the biggest danger for Terra is the people they choose to join with. Especially because there will be less Yeerk and more human in the coalescion in general due to how they've split up.
