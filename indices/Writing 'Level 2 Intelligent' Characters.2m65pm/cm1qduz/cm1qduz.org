I am currently considering a new method to do this with the fic I am writing once it gets off the ground: crowdsourcing.

I will write out at least a reasonable method for characters to solve certain problems, but I will encourage my readers to suggest better solutions. If someone gives me a brilliant idea I will use it; adapt my storyline, which is flexible; and credit them. Apply 500 munchkins to a one munchkin task and you have good odds of getting SOMETHING decent.

This is why the audience in jeopardy on average does better than the most brilliant jeopardy player at leaning toward the correct answer.

Problems I anticipate with this method are...

1. I need to build my audience before using this technique. I originally hope to do a few specific sections with the help of this subreddit. I have already done a trial run of this to test the waters and it worked well.

2. I will have to fit the idea into my plot, which means I can't draft exhaustively on problems I plan to get reader input on, or I can, but must rewrite it.

3. I have to go over massive amounts of spam. (I am afraid of this)

Anyone have any thoughts, criticisms of this?
