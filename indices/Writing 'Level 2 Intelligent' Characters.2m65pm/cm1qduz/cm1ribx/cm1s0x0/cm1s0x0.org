I am doing a rational version of Supernatural.

The world building is not the problem. If anything it is my best current feature. I have got the consistent world down pretty well at the moment. I am confident I can consistently say whether any particular munchkinry works or not because my universe does actually run on rules. (Time travel being a notable exception. I cannot deal with it and it is driving me crazy. I am so mad at the writers of Supernatural about that part.) The problem being that I can't tell the reader these rules until the end, so there will be a lot of "good idea but that doesn't work here."

I do think it will be hard to get two levels of response. That is a good point. It may help that the characters will generally be doing single encounters. (It is a rational version of Supernatural) I also have a reason some of the monsters are physically incapable of bypassing their flaws. A bit like Yudkowsky's "do not mess with time", or Worm's Contessa excuse for coincidences. I have several bypasses like this that should help, such as a primary rational "villain" having set a plan in motion at the start of the plot and then gone incommunicado, leaving it to its minions. This was a rational thing for the villain to do under the circumstances.

By the way, I loved metropolitan man. That was a wonderful read! I Just wanted to say so. (I especially liked how you handled the aliens themselves-trying not to spoil it for new readers here)
