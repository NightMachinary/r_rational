Adapting based on audience input is great - I think I'd almost say that it's one of the primary reasons to write serial fiction.

One of the things you'll really have to focus on is making sure that the audience actually understands all of the pieces. If you say that a character can go invisible for short periods of time (for example), you need to be fairly rigid in what the limitations of that power are - can thermal imaging pierce it, does it mask sound, what happens to objects that are held/worn, etc. Otherwise, the audience is going to come up with a lot of solutions that simply don't work.

The other major problem is in the world-building, if you're doing science fiction and fantasy. If it's possible to go invisible, and other people know that it's possible to go invisible, then those people will develop counter-measures against invisibility, and the people who go invisible will develop counter-measures to those counter-measures, and so on and so forth.

One of my favorite stories of human ingenuity: during the Troubles in Ireland, the IRA would throw grenades into the backs of military convoys. The military responded by putting a wire mesh around the convoys, which would cause the grenades to bounce off. The IRA responded to /that/ by attaching hooks to the grenades, which would allow them to catch on the wire mesh.

The point being, if you want to write /two/ characters as intelligent, you need them to be able to react to and model each other. I think that would be hard to do with audience feedback, since most people are only going to suggest one level - throwing grenades into the convoy - instead of two or three levels of interplay.

And yes, getting an audience is difficult, and getting more than a few people to read - let alone comment - is one of the hardest (and most discouraging) parts of publishing online.
