Although they are both not quite up there with the best, I quite liked /Raising Steam/ (which felt a bit like /Moving Pictures/ at times) and /Snuff/.

/Unseen Academicals/ I've tried to read twice and lost heart inside the first 50 pages. First Pratchett I've left unfinished since /Carpe Jugulum/.
