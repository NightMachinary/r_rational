While I entirely agree about his /main/ characters, I was actually referring to Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobby Nobbs. Neither of those two is /intelligent/, per se, but they both have the sheer Genre Savvy of decades of actual experience. They /know damn well/ that almost surely, if you see some poor lost soul in a place where everyone knows a poor lost soul would get completely torn to pieces, it's a trap.

AFAICR, I've not yet read /Raising Steam/ because its opening made it seemed like another overstuffed novel in the spirit of /Snuff/, and /Science of Discworld IV/ is a bit of a revamp, but other than those two I've read the entire Discworld series, the first two of the /Long Earth/ series, and had a peek at /The Unadulterated Cat/.

(Note on /Science of Discworld IV/: it's the old Reason vs Religion debate /again/. I really wish pop-sci and pop-skeptic writers could just declare victory for Reason and move on to the tougher, more substantial matter of Science vs Philosophy, where genuinely Traditionally Rational people are still getting tripped-up.)
