I am not sure I personally would have used Ender's Game as a source of Level 2 Intelligent writing without also mentioning some of the failures of level 2 intelligent writing OSC was guilty of in that book. Perhaps it's merely because I tried to reread the book not long ago due to the recent film, and I remember the failures as vividly or more than the successes (though before the reread I think I only remembered the successes that EY cited here - there's a lot of poorly thought out bits but OSC manages to skim over them fast enough that you might forget about them).

For example, look at the *other* examples of Ender's 'innovations' to the field of Zero-g Laser Tag than the ones mentioned by EY - the army he was with came up with the marvellous tactic that revolutionized the field Zero-g Laser Tag of "attacking the enemy before they are prepared", in the battle against Centipede Army, only when Ender joined and showed attacking before the enemy had a chance to prepare was an effective tactic. To quote OSC:

  From now on no one could take five or ten ar fifteen seconds in the corridor to size things up. The game had changed.

(From Ender's Game, Ch. 8).

He literally calls it out as a revolutionary tactic in the narration, going directly against what EY says about praising the intellect of the characters

  And so after Ender is done saying “The enemy's gate is down!”, nobody in Ender's troops calls out “That's brilliant!” Ender doesn't think himself about how smart it is. Nobody has to say an explicit word about intelligence, nor should they.

Seriously, "What if we attack them before they are ready for us?" is *not* a sophisticated level 2 intelligent idea appropriate to a military genius, it's the sort of idea I and approximately a million others came up with when playing Starcraft as a teen (where it was called a 4-pool and made the newest of players very angry indeed, before they learned to handle it). 'Attacking before they are ready' is presented as such an amazingly genius strategy that a school full of genius kids being trained in tactics to lead the armies of the future in combat never thought of it in years or decades of zero-g laser tag; for comparison, consider the far more cunning and sophisticated (NSFW:extremely crude language) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl_6q557AkY][Destiny's Magnet]] plan of baiting enemies out of a fortified position by showing a helpless and valuable target that seems to be out of position, only to ambush with a force that has superior mobility and strength but little ability to assault prepared positions. That is a tactic itself like ten times more complicated and difficult to conceive of and react appropriately to than 'attack before they're ready', and is still noted for only working on opponents who are idiots.

The most amazing failure of writing competent characters presented as geniuses in their fields was in the Left Behind books. As [[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2003/10/21/lb-meet-the-girat/][deconstructed by Fred Clark]]:

  It's a dangerous thing for a writer to introduce a fictional character who is, the reader is told, the Greatest Investigative Reporter of All Time. The pitfall here is the same as if you introduce a character by telling readers he is "the absolute funniest person who ever lived."

  You can get away with this, somewhat, if you're writing about a great painter or musician. There you can get away with simply piling on the superlatives, perhaps describing the reaction of others to the artist's work. Readers do not expect you to actually show them a painting or play for them a symphony.

  But if you introduce a character, as L&J do with Buck Williams, as a great writer and reporter, the reader has a right to expect that you will provide more than overheated adjectives. Readers want to read what the GIRAT has written.

  ...

  Anyway, here's how the GIRAT reported, firsthand, from the scene of an all-out nuclear surprise attack:

  /To say the Israelis were caught off guard, Cameron Williams had written, was like saying the Great Wall of China was long./
