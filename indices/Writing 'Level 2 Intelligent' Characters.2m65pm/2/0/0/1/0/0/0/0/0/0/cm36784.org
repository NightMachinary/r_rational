  the usual time for calculating subjective probabilities.
#+end_quote

I'm using pseudo-formal language to describe informal processes. Most poker players don't form explicit subjective probabilities in their minds, but they manage on "gut feelings" which can be nearly as accurate. Humans don't "assign greater than 99% probability", they "are certain". Meta-uncertainty provides object uncertainty.

Yes, there is variance and there is uncertainty, but that means that there's simply a distribution of how much punishment you expect people would be able to take before they croak, and/or equivalently a distribution of how much punishment you think you will deliver. Making a decision to hurt someone directly implies accepting /some/ probability that the person will die because of your actions. What probability you are willing to accept for a certain reward determines how much you value their life versus your reward. Even if you don't calculate the probabilities explicitly, there is still an implicit value judgment in your actions as surely as there is an implicit value judgment in being willing to pay $x for some candy. (implicit because dollars aren't a terminal value).

I am saying that given Ender's capabilities, he is accurate enough that the death of the bullies was probably predictable to him in advance with, say, P>0.001, if he had chosen to take the effort of estimating it, and that he had the time to calculate it with such certainty. And that choosing an action which has P>0.001 of you murdering someone to avoid their bullying is morally unacceptable.
