I like writing comments and I dislike reading opinion pieces I see obvious fault with (or don't understand) but don't have the opportunity to call the author out on (or ask for clarification). For better or for worse, the bad premise (or unknown reasoning) keeps gnawing at my brain every time I read stuff that derives from it. Reading the rest of the text would be stressful, rather than merely time-consuming.

With regards to your edit: You don't need to lose your cool to perform mental gymnastics. (If we are to trust him,) Ender simply avoided thinking about the negative consequences to the bully, like one might avoid thinking about health issues after spotting some freshly prepared bacon. This rendered death an unknown unknown to his later decisions, and thus he "didn't mean to kill them", like overweight people don't mean to get fat or people who text while driving don't mean to crash their cars.
