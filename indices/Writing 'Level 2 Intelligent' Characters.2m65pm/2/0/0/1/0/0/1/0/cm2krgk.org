Also having read the conclusion, it doesn't seem like he does more to argue the premise, so no.

  Do you really think that the murder of the bullies is the right decision especially with as little thought as he puts into it?

    Ender IMO is guilty of the murder of both bullies

If you must make a decision based on "option 1: Hurt the bullies. The bullies will probably leave you alone afterward. Option 2: Do not hurt the bullies. They will hurt or kill me" and nothing else, then I would not consider it immoral to choose option 1, as a heuristic for children of his type. The expectedly very rare cases where option 1 leads to permanent injury or death measure up against the fact that bullying will be reduced in almost all cases, and to some extent in advance.

Precisely because he put as little thought into it can he say that he didn't mean to kill them, and even be right about it. It means that the choice that caused the bullies' death was the choice not to think about the consequences of his actions too much, if that choice existed. For not particularly intelligent young children the choice might not exist; they're not expected to have the self-awareness or basic ability to recognise their own [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/km/motivated_stopping_and_motivated_continuation/][motivated stopping]].

Ender does not have the excuse of lacking adult-level self-awareness, so (barring bad luck) he made a choice (within his realm of responsibility) with the implicit expected consequence of his bullies being killed (by him), making him morally guilty of voluntary manslaughter. If at any point the bullies' death became explicit in his reasoning, it would be second degree murder. If that point was during a moment of emotional calm, it would be first degree murder.
