Ender managed to gain dominance in both fights easily. He knew human psychology pretty darn well, and he probably has basic awareness of human physical ability. That theoretical knowledge should be enough to form a reasonable estimate of how hurt someone can get before they die.

I am saying that Ender was smart enough that if he had put in a reasonably expectable amount of effort, he could have gotten high enough subjective probability of the bully dying in both cases that it qualifies as deliberate killing, and that he's smart enough that he could have found a less lethal method to prove his point if he had not simply [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/km/motivated_stopping_and_motivated_continuation/][stopped]] thinking.

Yes, for average schoolchildren Ender might just be a child bad at knowing his own limits and the frailty of a human body, or a child afraid of his life. But his internal dialogue does not show incompetence or fear. He does exactly what he sets out to do, and the bullies die.

Motivated cognition is a strong enough force however that I can believe he didn't explicitly intend to kill them.
