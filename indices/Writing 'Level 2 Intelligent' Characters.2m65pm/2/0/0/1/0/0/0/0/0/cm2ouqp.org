First fight: he was /six years old/ and had /never been in a fight before/.

People can vary widely in how much punishment they can take. Look at two boxers who slug each other in the head for thirty minutes straight. I was surprised that the damage Ender dealt to Bonzo was enough to kill him. Also, he was ganged up on in a bathroom and fighting for his life, not the usual time for calculating subjective probabilities.
