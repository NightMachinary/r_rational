I think the real ethical foundation is "Guilt and Innocence are not Useful Concepts". If someone is /dangerous/, stop them. If enforcing laws gets you a safer society, go ahead. But don't condemn. Don't hurt someone just because they deserve it. There but for the grace of IF manipulators go thee.

Is that what you consider repugnant?
