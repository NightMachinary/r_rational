A common and effective way of showing a character's intelligence is to show them excelling at something everyone understands: conversation. Have a character who speaks quickly, responds immediately to the comments of others with witty remarks of their own, and generally seems to dominate the conversation with energy and creativity, and we know they are smart. The point is that it is an intellectual feat the reader can understand for themselves as such. This is much of how HJPEV's intelligence is established, along with knowing lots of research. In Draco's case we know he's smart when he keeps up with Harry and quickly understands what he needs to do when McGonagall and Lucius show up. It's all about the conversation.

Another way to do it would be to show the character having a great memory. Anyone can tell that a girl who memorizes her textbooks must be very bright.

I think it's unfair to say screenwriters for depicting genius in a way that requires none. It's probably more accurate to say they probably correctly expect that general audiences are more interested in intelligence as a superpower than the reality of it. Card says somewhere in his book on character and viewpoint that people fear intelligence, and that's why the main character will talk like, "You'll never get away with it, bub," and the villain responds in a clipped Oxford accent, "I rather think I indubitably have, you imbecilious fool." Good guy smart people have the magic power to invent stuff and play chess. Bad guy smart people are more often actually smart in some recognizable way, even if as the plot proceeds they are hardly rational. (Card explains that this intelligence is different from a character who can think on their feet, like Indiana Jones, a sort of useful, grounded smarts audiences respect and admire rather than fear.) It's worth noting that Orson Scott Card set out to write a story about smart kids saving the world and ended up with a story some people think is an apologia for Hitler. That's quite a miss! And HPMOR has attracted its own hate, much of which centers around HJPEV, that smartass little bastard.

Watching chess genius depicted in movies is always painful. In the recent film on Bobby Fischer, for example, someone is amazed by a very common move he plays as a youngster on move four or five in a common opening. Even I can keep up with a grandmaster four or five moves into a common opening. It's the forty moves afterward that make trouble.
