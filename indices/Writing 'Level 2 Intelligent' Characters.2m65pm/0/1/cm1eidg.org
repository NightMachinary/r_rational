It's impossible, of course, for any one person no matter how smart to come up with the tactics that would be created by dozens or hundreds of geniuses over many years of testing. Card does try to justify some of it by the military nature of the institution that stifles innovation and the hierarchical nature of things that encourages soldiers to try to succeed within the system rather than change it. For example, when Ender wins against two armies, Anderson immediately announces a change of rules so the tactic no longer works. Such an environment is not conducive to innovation. Or how Ender's training of his army as being composed of relatively self-reliant pieces as opposed to a single centralized whole is described as the real core of his success rather than any particular tactic.
