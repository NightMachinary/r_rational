Ah, his postscript, where he says intentions do matter. Glad he cleared that up. Still, he says: "Card sets up Ender to be the sincere, abused innocent, and rigs the game to make us accept that he does no wrong."

I didn't accept that he did no wrong, and I didn't really feel pressured to accept it either.

"But in the real world genocide is not committed by accident." Yeah, but I'm pretty sure Card isn't apologizing for real-world genocide. I'm pretty sure Card made clear destroying the buggers was WRONG, but that the people that did it intentionally bore the brunt of the responsibility, and that Ender, who was unintentionally part of the causal chain, bore LESS responsibility than they did.

How much he bears is left as an exercise for the reader.

Kessler says intentions matter, but he still seems to dismiss Ender's as being relevant.
