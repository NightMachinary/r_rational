"The novel repeatedly tells us that Ender is morally spotless."

That's not what I got from Ender's Game. I got that the novel repeatedly told us that Ender was /sympathetic/, but I didn't get that the story wanted us to think he was completely innocent.

Ender feels tremendous guilt for the destruction he caused to so many lives. Graff argues he is innocent, because he was manipulated, but the story specifically says that Ender had his own opinion about that, but nobody asked him.

Granted, in Speaker for the Dead, Card has Ender (over 20 years later) say that morality is only in the intention, and not at all in the act. Which I don't agree with, by the way. But that's another book, and just because Ender says it, doesn't make it true, Ender makes lots of mistakes. I also don't think intention is irrelevant, I think it is highly relevant, just that "I was trying to help!" doesn't excuse everything...

"Card thus labors long and hard in Ender's Game to create a situation where we are not allowed to judge any of his defined-as-good characters' morality by their actions."

I felt perfectly free to judge them though. In contrast to, say, Hilda from Heinlein's "The Number of the Beast" which I also judge (I'm a free agent after all) but where Heinlein REALLY wanted me not to.

Intention does matter quite a lot. I mean, if you are on the street and someone says "can you take my picture?" and you press the button on the camera but it is really a remote detonator and you blow up a school, are you a murderer? Our legal system has at its basis something called mens rea, the intent to commit a crime.

Now, Ender is actually /not/ in such a situation. He wasn't tricked into just pressing a button. But neither did he know he was really killing people by blowing up a planet. So I don't think he is innocent, but neither is he just simplistically "guilty of genocide."

The vibe I got from Ender's Game was that it was about presenting complex questions, not about saying "here's the answer."
