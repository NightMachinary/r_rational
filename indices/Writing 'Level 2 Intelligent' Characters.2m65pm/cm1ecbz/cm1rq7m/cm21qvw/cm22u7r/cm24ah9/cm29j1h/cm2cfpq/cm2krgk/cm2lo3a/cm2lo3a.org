I swear reading the full article takes less effort than the three paragraphs you just wrote. Even if the rest doesn't change your opinion you don't do anyone favors by reading the beginning and the end, possibly skimming the rest.

How much time do you really save yourself?

EDIT: I also feel it's pretty clear authorial meddling that death doesn't enter into consideration, and from Ender's perspective, as far as I recall, he is level-headed for the entire fight.
