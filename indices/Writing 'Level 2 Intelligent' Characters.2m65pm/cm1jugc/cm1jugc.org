  Seventeen languages, amazing gidgets, beating a chessmaster at chess, being bad at romance? What all of these have in common is that you can write them without any unusual cognitive labor.

This feels like such a strawman, especially given all the ways that there are to "cheat" with intelligence (many of which are explicitly mentioned in the post itself). Mostly, it feels like it's taking examples of bad writing and conflating that with low cognitive labor in an effort to paint low cognitive effort as bad writing - which I don't think it always has to be. I mean, if your life is roughly average, you understood that Benjamin Franklin or Isaac Newton were smart far before you were capable of understanding what it is that made them smart. You just heard things like:

- Benajmin Franklin discovered electricity.
- Isaac Newton published the definitive guide to optics.
- Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.

Which seems to me to be equivalent to something like:

- The Great Wizard Manjoo discovered the nature of the multiple planes of reality.
- Lisa Tutty wrote the definitive guide to quantum cryptography.
- Zefram Cochrane invented the warp drive.

If your writing is good, you can have someone be immediately known to the audience as intelligent without having to actually have them do anything intelligent (and for some stories, I would contend that this is the right choice - but it takes a specific kind of story where it's important that the character is established as intelligent but not important to show any actual intelligence at work).
