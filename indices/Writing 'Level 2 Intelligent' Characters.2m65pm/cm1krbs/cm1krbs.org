I have three tips for writing really genuinely clever characters:

- Put a lot of your thought, by the real-world clock, into very little of their thought, by the in-story clock.

- Show that they are able to integrate new evidence quickly, up and down their hierarchy of knowledge and concepts.

- Show that they think /accurately/, that their mind is preserving all or most of the information that goes in.

Processing speed, depth/height of hierarchical inference, and accuracy of approximation are, at the very least, actually relevant to how cognitive science and neuroscience actually work. They are also easy tricks for authors to pull by investing authorial brainpower at the rate of its actual availability to get a return in the form of apparent cleverness by the character.
