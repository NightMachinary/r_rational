I'll second [[/u/DataPacRat]]'s suggestions, and add that the Very Hard series had one of the scarier villains I've seen in fiction, if only for the fact that someone very like him might be operating right now, and we'd never know. Also some of his short stories have really neat ideas to play around with post-read, including my favorite short of all time, [[http://www.spiderrobinson.com/melancholyelephants.html][Melancholy Elephants.]] Oh, and he's (as far as I know) currently working on the sequel to Variable Star.
