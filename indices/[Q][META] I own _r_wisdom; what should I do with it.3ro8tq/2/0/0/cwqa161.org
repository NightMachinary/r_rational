I'm tempted to say '[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_Robinson#Novels_and_collections_of_linked_stories][all of them]]', but to focus a bit: I think of the Callahan's/Lady Sally's/Jake Stonebender's series of stories and novels as classic; Telempath and the Deathkiller books shaped some of my pre-rationalist ideas about how final death had to be; and I still find myself using some memes about mental adaptability from the Stardance books.
