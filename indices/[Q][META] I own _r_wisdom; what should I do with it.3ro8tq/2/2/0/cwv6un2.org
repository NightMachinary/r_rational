He's a classic hippie, a guitar player, and one of the main themes of his work is that it's worth getting telepathic with each other if we can, especially if the way we try is by being kind.

A typical example of the way he thinks was when he wrote of the internet becoming sentient for a while: someone named it by picking two words which, on their own, meant being on your own, but together, meant being together: "Sol" and "Ace", to "Solace".

I'm not entirely sure I'd want him in charge of a project involving existential risks, but for just about anything on the scale of human-to-human interactions, there are plenty worse people to pay attention to.
