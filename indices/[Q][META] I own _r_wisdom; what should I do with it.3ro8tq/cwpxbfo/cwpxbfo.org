You know, I was going to post something like: "If you find a good person, I'd love to help out!" but I'll just be honest. This is an opportunity that has me brimming with excitement, I've wanted to start a community focused on making people awesome for a good while now.

I'm not the strongest rationalist here, but I am incredibly dedicated. If no one better wants to help you out I would love to. If you'd like, I could develop a plan for the community and see if it's what you had in mind.
