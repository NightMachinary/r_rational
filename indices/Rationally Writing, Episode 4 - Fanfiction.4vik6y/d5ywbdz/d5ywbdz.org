This is an odd episode for me because I liked what you said even though I disagreed with a lot of it. I would've liked The Metropolitan Man more if it had gone the Irredeemable route and replaced the characters with expys, but I also liked A Bluer Shade of White even though it also ignored what I liked about Frozen. I also REALLY like magical realism, but I can't deny any of your criticisms of it so...shrug?

If you like what Irredeemable did with expy characters you'd probably like the comic book Astro City, which is all about exploring the world and people's lives in a superhero setting without focusing on heroic adventures. It's not very rational, but it does a lot of the kind of analysis and reimagining you often see in rational fiction so at worst it's a gold mine of ideas.
