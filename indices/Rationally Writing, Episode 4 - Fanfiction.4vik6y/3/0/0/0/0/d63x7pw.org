I think we can plausibly posit that Harmony suffers primarily from internalized bias against blonde women, possibly with a minor learning disability as an early catalyst. (As a vampire she's also hampered by a lack of empathy.)

The running joke is that Harmony survives incidents that would kill any "extra" on the show. While she frequently makes poor decisions, she seems aware of her shortcomings and is consistently shown studying self-help books. Late in Angel s5 she's abandoned the traditional vampire lifestyle to work at a high-power law firm and even does the research on the cultural differences of demon clients. I'd call her a plausible candidate for bootstrapping.
