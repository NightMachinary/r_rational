Gotcha. My guess is the main problem with it is it requires modelling an unintelligent person well, which can be difficult, and doubly so when you need to model them as unintelligent but still interested, motivated, and capable of making themselves smarter, which begs the question of what made them unintelligent in the first place.

"Smart but ignorant" leveling themselves up is understandable, as is "dumb but educated," but "dumb and ignorant" is a kind of black-hole of personality that rarely has the ability to recognize or care about boosting their rationality if portrayed realistically.
