In a non-rational fic, you'd get some stupid teenagers who simply waltz in and somehow become powerful ninja wizards capable of fighting the soulless monsters where no-one else can.

Remember, a non-rational fic isn't just a rational fic with non-rational characters. In non-rational fics, characters that consistently do stupid things can still end up saving the day, because it's operating on a very different set of rules to reality (e.g. "a group of plucky young kids can overcome their dysfunction to become true heroes").
