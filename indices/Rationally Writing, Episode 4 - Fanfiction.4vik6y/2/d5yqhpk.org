Is rational fic harder to write than irrational fic?

The simplest thought process is thinking about the "consequence" of X.

Let take an example from a recent rational fic:

A portal opened up in Canada linking them to a new world called Remnant(where the death monsters don't attack immediately because they're repelled by the portal).

What happens?

- It gets reported to the police by not-stupid teenagers who happens to be hiking near the portal, which after some inspection, gets reported to the higher-ups.
- Article five gets invoked by the Canadians. The Canadian military gets mobilized, and so do the rest of NATO.
- The militaries of other nations start mobilizing.
- President Obama talks to Putin to ensure that the nuclear apocalypse won't go up.
- News crew flood the vicinity of the portal, held back by the military and policemen. Social media traffic spike.
- Some government officials start sending radio waves for Remnans to hear as to start first contact.

In a non-rational fic, you got some stupid teenagers who simply waltz in and get killed by soulless monsters on the other side, or something like that.
