/It's all stuff that wouldn't need to be done in an irrational story where the teenagers just walk in and die and give no warning for Canada or the rest of the world to be able to respond before shit hits the fan./

On second thought, some complicated chain of events would still happen if the teenagers never bother to give any warning to Canada on the account of being dead because they were stupid.

It would still be a military sci-fi story, just in a worse situation.

In an irrational story however, what we might see is a lack of communication, people doing stupid things for stupid reason, and unrealistic responses like in Gates, another portal fic, in which nations other than Japan acts like buffoons.
