There might be some metrics I'm not thinking of at the moment, but for now my answer is unequivocally yes.

To go off at least one purely objective metric, the more in depth you have to think about something, or the wider the scope of the story, the more elements come into play, and the more data you need to have as a writer to write the story.

So while research isn't necessarily the only metric for how "hard" it is to write a story, a rational fiction will pretty much always be harder in that respect than the same story told irrationally. Knowing about Article Five, researching police and military and government protocols, exploring how radio waves work, things like that.

It's all stuff that wouldn't need to be done in an irrational story where the teenagers just walk in and die and give no warning for Canada or the rest of the world to be able to respond before shit hits the fan.
