Personally I was actually hoping to keep most everything besides the asteroid belt as a Historical Origins of Peoplekind Museum. For one thing, the limitation would help get us focused on colonization rather than on going oil-crazy and consuming our resources like locusts (/again/).

It's also important to keep the ecosystem of Earth intact, especially: without it, where will people come up with ideas for new body-shapes?
