  You do realize that most of humanity associates Nature with ultimate goodness rather than with blind, gibbering idiocy?

We care about it because we evolved in that kind of environment. But if you started extrapolating people's values, I don't think they'd really value what nature's about. Nature is chaos, subsistence living, mostly suffering and death with regular extinctions. The balance of nature is just an illusion and only appears on human time frames. See the blue graph on the top of this page: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event]]. Does that look like balance to you?

I think most animals' lives have negative utility, do you disagree with that? On what basis?

Many people have a romanticised idea of the natural world that probably has little to do with the reality; they appreciate the polished, TV-friendly aesthetics of nature documentaries without actually spending much time beyond their urban boundaries.
