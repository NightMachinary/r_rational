On [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Charlie's site]] you can read it for free (though it wouldn't kill you to buy a copy to give to a friend).

There's also the [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Accelerando_Technical_Companion][Accelerando Technical Companion]] which is woefully incomplete, but still helpful.

And of course if you still have questions, you can ask guys like me who can probably explain anything confusing.
