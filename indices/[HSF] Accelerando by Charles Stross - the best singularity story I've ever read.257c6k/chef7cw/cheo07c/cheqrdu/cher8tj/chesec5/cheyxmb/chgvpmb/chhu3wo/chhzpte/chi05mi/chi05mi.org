It's my way of dealing with the fact that I find it intolerable to destroy Nature, and intolerable to enslave Nature to my own values and desires, but simultaneously feel that Nature is morally abhorrent most of the time.

Conclusion: damn that Nature stuff is creepy; leave it alone until it can speak well enough to /ask/ for my help.
