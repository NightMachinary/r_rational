  Ehhhhhh. What've you got against dismantling the solar system? Want to keep the planets as a tourist attraction?

Well, Earth has value as a tourist attraction. We can predict total solar eclipses far enough in advance to make sublight tourism to come see one possible if physical travel is required and agreeable if lightspeed transmission of personality is acceptable as a form of transportation.

Total solar and lunar eclipses should not be common features of most planetary systems. We get them here only during this period of time because of a quirk of diameter and distance involving the moon and sun. If technological life has arisen in other star systems, and the quirks of our star system are not absolute requirements for such to arise, then people will want to see the strange beauty of eclipseworld.
