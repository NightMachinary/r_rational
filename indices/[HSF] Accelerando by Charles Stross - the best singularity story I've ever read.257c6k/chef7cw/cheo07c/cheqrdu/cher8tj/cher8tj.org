Nobody said we're gonna make you die. Why would we do that?

No, we're mostly just not gonna let hostile and alien superintelligences dismantle half the solar system.

I think. One time [[/u/michaelkeenan]] of CFAR told me over dinner that we're gonna dismantle the solar system. I objected rather adamantly.

But at least, if our lot go around dismantling planets, it's because someone came up with an ethical argument in favor of doing such?
