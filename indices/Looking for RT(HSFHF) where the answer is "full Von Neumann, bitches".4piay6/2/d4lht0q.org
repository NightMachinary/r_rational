  Any Worm fic where Taylor (optionally through teaming up with Amy) builds better monsters (and preferably monster-production facilities---let's go Zerg on that shit)

It sounds like you have heard of it already... [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/][Amelia]]. Jack Slash succeeds in getting Amelia to break her limits... and her and Taylor team and go all out. We are talking multiple Endbringer fights, multiple original Endbringer, literally inventing the zerg, recruiting enough Tinkers to out tinker Toybox, and enough plotting to out plot Cauldron (well not exactly that last one). The fights are pretty epic. On the other hand, in between the fights, there is a ton of slice of life antics that kind of drag on, especially towards the later half of the story, and a few original characters, one of which I think is moderately annoying, some of which really irritated some readers. Also, the author intentionally plays with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror][Fridge Horror]] with the way some of the characters use their powers. Not quite this bad, but imagine if Perfect Lionheart had the self awareness to realize what sociopaths his characters were and then gradually left hints to the audience. Finally, the author also mimics Wildbow's shtick of portraying complex scenes from biased character's viewpoint, there are several parts that may seem like bashing, even if you later realize the context and that the other character had a good point. It's super long, but I would say it was fun and had a satisfying climax, even if it dragged in some places.

For a non worm fanfic... Have you seen Neon Genesis Evangelion? To grimderp for you? Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k][Shinji and the Warhammer 40K]]. The author claims the premise is what if Shinji just got a warhammer 40k miniature set and books before canon, although its more like Shinji teaches himself borderline precog levels of planning and observation. It avoids turning into a stomp fic because the Angels adapt to him using the AT field in diverse ways, and several other factions are changed as well. Its an illustration of how "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, give Sauron the Deathstar" can both drive an awesome story, and the limitations of this concept as the story and plot gets drowned out under the sheer weight of mecha-sized chainsaw swords and mad science and psychic powers bullshit and multiple diablos ex machinas showing up to keep things even. Be warned also that the story is unfinished, at near the climax, and the author has only posted one or two additional snippets over the past 4 years. Also, the over-the-topness I think makes the author kind of regret writing some of it, so it may never get revised or finished...

Edit: One more I forgot... not so much von neumann in the story, but rather a flashback piece as the Doctor tries to explain to a companion the sheer scale of the time war. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/471497/chapters/815855]]
