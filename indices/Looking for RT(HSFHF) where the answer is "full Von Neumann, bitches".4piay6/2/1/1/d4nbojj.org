Since you mentioned Planetary Annihilation Commander fiction in your OP, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11175498/1/On-Some-Backwater-Planet][here's]] a link to a story like that (just Total Annihilation instead of PA) by the author of the Shinji & WH40k story.

It's usually more silly comedy than a rational fanfic, though.
