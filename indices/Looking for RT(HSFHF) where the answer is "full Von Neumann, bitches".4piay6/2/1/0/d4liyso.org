  I've never seen NGE. How is it? A little on the grimderp side, rather than just grimdark?

Without spoilers (I will spoil if you want though)... For the original series we don't actually see a lot of stuff going on off screen, we just see things from the Shinji's (the mecha pilot) perspective. So possible interpretations in fanfic and fanon of some key characters behind the scenes range from rational, but utterly ruthless and with some metaphysical bizarre goals; to somewhat irrational but actually reasonably ethical in their long-term goals given the circumstances humanity was in, to irrational in both their goals and their methods, to pants on their head retarded how did they even get a conspiracy started in the first place levels of stupid.

As for the show itself, it actually has a very clever justification for a humaniod shape to their mecha and several clever justifications for why they need kids as their pilots (1 or 2 of them were only partially true/in-universe misinformation). The main characters are actually realistic for a bystander thrown into the cockpit, an ace pilot wannabe, and a aloof emotionless girl (as in they are all deeply traumatized and damaged in unique ways relating to their characters). On the other hand, a lot of things are unoptimal from the perspectives we get, and might be irrational even given the informatino the behind the scenes players have... I think only one or two wallbangers though.

I will say that from what I've heard of the remake (? possible sequels via time-loop or such) movies there are some seriously stupid things once they diverge from canon. They main character, Shinji, gets the cathartic going-all-out moment that all the fanfic writers want to give him and it goes horribly for reasons outside his control. Then several reasonably intelligent characters all blame him and refuse to give him critical information for really stupid reasons.
