Pity the Shinji story isn't finished; I really prefer things that either are finished, or have a decent chance of becoming so. And, yeah, Amelia is a favorite of mine -- to the point that I'm considering pushing things partially in that direction when I pass through Worm on a jumpchain I'm planning to write.

I've never seen NGE. How is it? A little on the grimderp side, rather than just grimdark?
