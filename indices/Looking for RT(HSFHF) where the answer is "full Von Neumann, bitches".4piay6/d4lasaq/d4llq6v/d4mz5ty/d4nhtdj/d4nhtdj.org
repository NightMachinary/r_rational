Not really. Warlock lets him never roll his UMD skill for anything ever, but otherwise the abilities inherent to the character are mostly superfluous.

The characters were not really built to maximize brokenness, so much as to highlight places where the D&D rules were broken and needed to be patched badly. The Word was highlighting the fact that if you stuck a bunch of classes that were intended to make spellcaster prestige classing work by looking at the levels of other spellcaster classes you have, then the game would break; and also that repeated losing and gaining of levels from most sources also has very bad rules that cause the game to break. The Wish was highlighting that in the 3.5 rules edition, the writers changed the rules of the Wish spell in a way that explicitly allowed arbitrarily powerful magic items.
