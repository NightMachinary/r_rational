Thought of another one.. are you a Stargate fan, or a fan of the original X-com games? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3631062/1/XSGCOM-Mirror-Image][XSGCOM]]. It takes the already fast in-game reversing engineering times of the original XCOM games, and gives them Stargate tech.... Lots of awesome feel good curbstompage. Potassium-naqaudah hand-grenades, staff canon mounted in gatling configuration, and more. The enemies don't start escalating fast enough to keep up the tension, so the story has more of the lighthearted SG1 feel than the desperate XCOM feel. The first book finishes at a good place, but the next story ends on a cliffhanger.

Not quite full Von-nuemann so much as fully exploiting a sci-fi universe with lots of exploitable tech, but close to what you want... (asteroid mining using Tokra tunneling crystals and similar exploits)
