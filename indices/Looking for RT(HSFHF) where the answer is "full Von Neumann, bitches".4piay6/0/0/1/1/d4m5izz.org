If you are on a desktop browser, text appears blacked out and you can hover your mouse over to see it. This acts as a way of hiding spoiler. If you are on a mobile browser, it just shows up as a link. Reddit has not implemented a single common way of implementing spoiler protected text, so every subreddit uses their own method which may or may not work properly across all browsers. In [[/r/rational]]'s case, they manipulate some of the way text gets linked in order to create spoiler text.
