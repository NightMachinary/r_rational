One more, a long running web-comic, [[https://www.schlockmercenary.com/][Schlock Mercenary]]. It covers a band of mercenaries in the future. The technology used is pretty consistent in its physics (still soft-scifi, but consistent soft scifi) and its application by the characters while still having room for them to innovate. In particular, one of the main characters invents a new type of FTL that sets off much of the conflict that dominates the rest of the story.

The characters are also smart about using their resources. Fabricators and advanced by limited AI are present on every ship. When the main characters salvage a massive derelict warship, they use its fabricators to churn out a bunch of smaller ships that they still use even after the lose the warship. Mass fabricated missile/sensor/drone arrays are standard (innovated as the new FTL made them practical). When the characters get ahold of advanced military nanobot projects, they eventually put it towards a project to make humans immortal [[#s][spoiler]]. A powerful AI [[#s][spoiler]] One clever scientist abuses [[#s][spoiler]] The one time time travel is used it gets exploited to its fullest while simultaneously having a good justification to prevent further time travel plots.

So yeah, its a long read from years of daily updates (the author like never misses), but it has a lot of high points in terms of "Brutally Efficient Self-Replicating Mechanism of War" and lots of clever munchkinry by the characters.
