No, it really wouldn't; you just ingest a cross-section of their spinal cord. Or, with greater medical expertise, you could target smaller and thus faster critical nerves. As a bonus, start extruding random nerve material as you go, to short-circuit things before they're fully severed.

I've often wondered why more villains don't break the limbs or spines of their prisoners.

If you can strike without being seen, you also have lots of ways to surreptitiously poison the target.

  Eat a bunch of mass, take it up high, drop it, and collect the energy from its fall? Something like that?

Attach weights to a flywheel, use computerised timing to consume at the bottom and extrude at the top. Just off the top of my head. No doubt there are endless better ways.

But that cannot be irreplaceable, because aara are non-sentient, barely alive, suspected to communicate via electromagnetism or similar. Therefore, whatever controls them can be artificially simulated. Therefore, you can design a computer to do it. Bam, self-replicating nanotech.

And if one aara can give orders to multiple others, then you don't even need to solve the mysteries of inter-aara communication to get astronomical force multipliers.
