Er...how, exactly, would one defend against aara? I mean, it would be ludicrously easy to assassinate someone when you can command 100,000 particles inside their body to wreak havoc.

What impact do ingestion and extrusion have on conservation of momentum? If the consumed matter ceases to have inertial effects (apparently the case, since "Careful study has shown that materials ingested by the aara simply vanish"), then it's very easy to build a perpetual motion machine. If, on the other hand, the mass and momentum are transferred to the consuming aara, then it sounds like you have an efficient way to create black holes.

What constraints are there on the scope of aara control? Can a mage order them to consume a planet? A star? If not, then what is the limiting factor?
