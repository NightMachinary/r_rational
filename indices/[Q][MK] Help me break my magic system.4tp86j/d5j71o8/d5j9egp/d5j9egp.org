Yes, you can make a computer. This is definitely something I wanted to be possible when I first came up with the magic system. However, there is /some/ inbuilt balancing, and it /seems/ like enough, but it might not be. I don't know enough about ground up basic computing and programming to know how exactly you would do that though, which might be a problem.

The short of it is that aara essentially [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia][lacks ontological inertia]], it takes a constant focus from the mage to keep the aara doing stuff. A mage could create a computer out of Aara, but it would take a certain amount of mental concentration to control the computer the aara is made out of. If they for instance, passed out, their computer might evaporate.
