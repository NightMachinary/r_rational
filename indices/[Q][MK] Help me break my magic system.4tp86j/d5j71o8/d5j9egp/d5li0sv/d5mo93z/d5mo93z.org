That in particular is something I'm not sure if I should change or not.

I like the idea of it since it opens up the development of magical items that could be used by a non-mage. This wouldn't be done in the story at the start for cultural reasons (that would be like, sinful and stuff), but I want it to be a possibility.

However, it also might let you have self replicating superswarms of aara, which is not good for balancing. Any way to balance so I can have one but not the other?
