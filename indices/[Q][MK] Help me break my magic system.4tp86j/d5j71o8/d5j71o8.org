  Aara can be given five basic commands, on which the foundations of Amat constructive and destructive magic are built. These five commands are: move along a specified path, accelerate at a specified rate, respond to a specific instruction from another specified aara or set of aara, consume a specified material, and extrude a specified material.

It'd take me an afternoon to start walking the path to godhood. The first question for breaking a magic system is always "Can you make a computer" or, more generally, "Can you automate the magic?"

In your system, not only is the automation built into the base level, but so is material manipulation, granting nanotechnology.

It'd take anyone with a decent amount of math-related knowledge a week to ruin the local economy, but worse, only a few hours to come up with some recursive world-eating grey goo. You need some hard, hard limits on the capabilities of Amat.
