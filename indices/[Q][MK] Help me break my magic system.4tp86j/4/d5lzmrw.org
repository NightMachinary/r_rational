The description of magic is very vague. The healing and listening magic imply that either magic particles had hardcoded information about structure/functioning of human body and format of human senses or they actually analyse mage brain signals, deduce his intentions and after that analyse subject body for healing . The former imply that magic is in fact sock puppet for some higher power, this power tailor magic specifically for human and specifically for some functions. The latter imply some kind of near-sentience for magic particle swarm and immensely exploitable.
