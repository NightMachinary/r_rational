The problem of that explanation is that if it's true no healing should be possible at all. Human can't possibly "move tiny tiny particles around through layers of bone and muscle and telling them to deposit stuff in specific places". Human don't have enough processing power for it even if we assume some form of clairvoyance into human body on microscopic level. No amount of biology knowledge would help. You need Taylor Hebert with Queen Administrator shard for that kind of multitasking.
