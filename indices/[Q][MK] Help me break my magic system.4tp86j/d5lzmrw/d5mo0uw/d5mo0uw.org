  The healing and listening magic imply that either magic particles had hardcoded information about structure/functioning of human body and format of human senses or they actually analyse mage brain signals, deduce his intentions and after that analyse subject body for healing

Its a lot more complex then that. The way with which a mage controls aara is not fully understood for one. The theory that it analyses brain signals for the controlling mage and interprets it kind of must be happening at some point, but /how/ that happens is a mystery. This is a victorian era level civilisation without the foundation in neuroscience to really puts a damper on that sort of higher level research.

The problem with healing magic is that the aara is only as useful as the mage's knowledge of biology. With perfect knowledge of the human body, you could do some impressive stuff, but again, victorian era level of science, medical science included. You're moving tiny tiny particles around through layers of bone and muscle and telling them to deposit stuff in specific places or pick stuff up from specific places. If the mage makes a mistake, you could end up...for instance...scooping up all the red blood cells instead of all the bacterial cells if you're trying to treat an infection.
