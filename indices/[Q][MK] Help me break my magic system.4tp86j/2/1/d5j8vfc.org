  Er...how, exactly, would one defend against aara? I mean, it would be ludicrously easy to assassinate someone when you can command 100,000 particles inside their body to wreak havoc.
#+end_quote

Its very hard. However going for those 100,000 already present particles would not be a good idea in combat. Aara are very small, they're effecting a cell-width cross section. It would take a while to kill someone with the Aara in their body, and doing so would actually take a good bit of focus on the part of the mage.

  What impact do ingestion and extrusion have on conservation of momentum? If the consumed matter ceases to have inertial effects (apparently the case, since "Careful study has shown that materials ingested by the aara simply vanish"), then it's very easy to build a perpetual motion machine. If, on the other hand, the mass and momentum are transferred to the consuming aara, then it sounds like you have an efficient way to create black holes.

Eat a bunch of mass, take it up high, drop it, and collect the energy from its fall? Something like that? This is the sort of thing I hadn't thoroughly considered, however, there are easier, more mechanical ways of creating an over unity engine/thruster in this setting. Those haven't actually been discovered yet either, but that's really a matter of certain other fields of engineering catching up, and there are likely rudimentary designs for non Aaara-based over unity engines floating around, its just that the level of industrialisation required to make the parts for the designs haven't caught up with the tech base.

Aara is a physical object, but things passing through its centre go away and lose all previous properties until later ejected. It can also not do that. In truly massive swarms you could get some powerful stuff out of it, but that would take more aara then most armies could usually control.

  What constraints are there on the scope of aara control? Can a mage order them to consume a planet? A star? If not, then what is the limiting factor?
#+end_quote

The limiting factor is the focus of the mage.

For starters, a single mote has an upper limit of material it can ingest of about a gram, so doing anything involving moving large amounts of mass around, you need quite a lot of aara.

But here's the thing. Each aara, and I mean /every single one/ that a mage is exerting influence on require a small quantity of focus. You could tell Aara to make more of themselves, but you couldn't control all of them, so they would sit inert. I haven't done much from the perspective of an Amat character which is part of the problem, but roughly speaking, most amat don't fly, that would take more concentration then they'd be capable of without specialist training.

I imagine the absolute upper limit that a god level mage could control at once would be a sphere of pure aara .25 meters in diameter. This would contain something on the order of 500 quadrillion aara. Even that number is probably too high for story balancing purposes, and it might be better to have it lower, I'm not sure yet. I don't have numbers put to the amount of kinetic energy that an individual aara can exert, which I really need to calculate so I can reverse derive how many it would take to lift a given amount of mass without consuming it.
