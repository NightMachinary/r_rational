  This seems pretty similar to the "Twelve Words of Death" in the Inheritance cycle, except that if aara control currently requires concentration, then there doesn't seem to be any real possibility of warding (at least not anything that would stop an ambush).

Absolutely. The Offense/Defense balance heavily /heavily/ skews towards offense, similar to our world. There aren't usually sieges in Aeria, the battles either culminate quickly with shock and awe tactics devastating an enemy quickly, or it bogs down into something approximating WWI style trench warfare.

Point taken regarding the ease of killing someone. It might be best to balance that by giving the aara a very simple sort of log that could be interrogated later by a mage. Still undetectable to a non magic user, but not completely invisible either.

The problem I have regarding wards and persistent effects is the same problem I have with magic items. I want them, but if aara are allowed to 'save instructions for later' then you can make a self replicating swarm of manites.

Not sure how to get around that one yet.
