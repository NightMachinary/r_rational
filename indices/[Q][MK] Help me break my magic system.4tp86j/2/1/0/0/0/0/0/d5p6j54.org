For /healing/, yes, you would need quite a bit. If you're going to remove a tumor or set a broken bone, you need a fair bit of manipulation. But to kill someone is much quicker and easier.

This seems pretty similar to the "Twelve Words of Death" in the Inheritance cycle, except that if aara control currently requires concentration, then there doesn't seem to be any real possibility of warding (at least not anything that would stop an ambush).
