  No, it really wouldn't; you just ingest a cross-section of their spinal cord

That would mean moving all of the Aara in the person's body to their spinal cord, and I still don't think that few aara would be able to sever it quickly.

  But that cannot be irreplaceable, because aara are non-sentient, barely alive, suspected to communicate via electromagnetism or similar. Therefore, whatever controls them can be artificially simulated. Therefore, you can design a computer to do it. Bam, self-replicating nanotech.

Hypothetically yes. But a lower hanging fruit would first be to figure out how aara communicate at all. Electromagnetism is the prevailing theory, but converting that into even a simpler device then an 'order giving machine' but a 'spelljammer' has yet to be done.

#+begin_quote
  And if one aara can give orders to multiple others, then you don't even need to solve the mysteries of inter-aara communication to get astronomical force multipliers.

that middle command might just end up being too powerful to fit in the story, not sure yet, but I really like the idea of a turing complete magic system, and the idea of doing things like 'programming' with magic. I'm just not sure how to have that /and/ also keep the setting and not instantly causing a hard takeoff.
