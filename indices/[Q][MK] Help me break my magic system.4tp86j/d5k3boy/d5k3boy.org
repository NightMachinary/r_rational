Could you use Healing/Constructive magic to copy an organism? Anyone who succeeds in copying himself achieves global victory in O(log n). Similarly, brain modification. At the least, the results of making a newborn's head gradually bigger (evolution did it too!) should tell our aspiring dark lord how to do better with the next baby. Can you implant personality/skills? Somewhere there's bound to be a cult of a guy who's managed to copy himself into other brains.
