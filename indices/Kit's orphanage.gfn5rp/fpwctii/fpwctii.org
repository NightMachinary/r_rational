Good rec. I think I'd tell the mice that I'd trade a dollar for knowledge about whether I could make a pareto efficient trade with them given perfect information and no coercion. If they accepted the trade, I'd immediatelly find out whether it was worth dealing with the. If they didn't, that would be because one dollar is less than the value they'd get from engaging in trade with me given that I'd know the answer to that question, meaning it wouldn't be worth trading with them.

Assuming it is possible to make trades for mutual net benefit, I'd trade physical objects for utility positive but economic net value negative items or information.
