The question I want answered is about the utility function of the mice. If it's opposed to mine, then for them even a properly executed 'fair' trade always results in some net negative for myself. That is to say, they wouldn't trade me a dollar for a dollar, because me having fun in dealing with the occult would be a net negative to them.
