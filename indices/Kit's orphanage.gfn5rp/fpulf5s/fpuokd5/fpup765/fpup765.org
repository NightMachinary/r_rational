I'm not sure yet, it's still early. I tried to start this in the most interesting/representative place in the 65 pages that exist so far, because frankly I found it started pretty slow. Or course when I first tried to read it there wasn't very much of it, so it finished slow too.

There are mice that you can make faustian bargains with, but those bargains take the form of economic trades. Trade a lamp for a donut, trade all the silverware in the orphanage for knowledge of life and death, perhaps trade your soul for deeper knowledge...

The story follows Benny, as he inherits the family +curse+ contract with the mice, allowing him to be a trading partner.

There's not a lot to go over yet, so I'd recommend giving a few pages a try and if you like what you see it will probably keep up with those expectation. It's by a creator known to this community, "dawn somewhere". This looks like it's shaping up to be a lot more relevant to this community than the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g5rklw/gym_of_the_romantic_journey/][last time their works were recommended]].

I think like 10 pages should let you know if it's worth following.
