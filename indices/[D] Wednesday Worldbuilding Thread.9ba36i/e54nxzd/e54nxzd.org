(Posting in the Wednesday Thread on a Friday, because I'm an absolute madman)

Inspired by the next biweekly challenge and my previous struggles with making DnD Gods rational, I had an idea which I like, but don't really have the time or confidence to write a challenge entry for, so I'm just dumping it here (holy run-on sentence Batman).

The Gods are really magically powerful intelligences with weird utility functions. Some have wide reaching, simple, intuitive goals (destroy all life, ensure the survival of the Dwarven race, etc), while others have more localised, weirdly specific goals (Ensure no one over 6 feet tall steps foot on this island, ensure the population of this town stays between 300-350 at all times, etc). As a general rule, the more specific the God, the less powerful they are.

Naturally, the Gods frequently have mutually exclusive goals, but for whatever reason (I'm leading towards MAD), the Gods cannot or will not fight each other directly. Instead, they have settled on a system of making pacts with mortals, wherein a part of the God's soul is implanted in the mortal's, granting them a fraction of the God's power, but also converting them to the God's ideals. While the mortal retains all their memories and pre-existing goals and desires, carrying out their God's mission becomes an unignorable moral imperative, which they truly believe in, even if they can't quite communicate its importance to non-converts. These people are Clerics and Paladins.

The stronger a God is, the more people they can make a pact with, eg, the aforementioned God of Dwarves would have thousands of Clerics, while the God of the Island of People Who Are Not Tall would have maybe a dozen at most. A pact cannot be made without explicit agreement from both parties, (ie, the mortal cannot be tricked into signing away their life (but can be coerced, threatened, etc), while the God cannot be forced into accepting a bunch of useless followers). Pacts can be ended, though this actually happening is rare.

Another idea I had was that there are some Gods who are so tiny and specific (ensure this one tree is within 5 feet of a drop of water during all solar eclipses that fall on a Tuesday, unless it's a leap year), that they cannot make a pact by themselves, but can join together in large groups to make a pact with a single human, who has to try and satisfy a more diverse set of goals, with the advantage of not having to satisfy any particular one. (These would be Druids)

Stuff I need to work out includes

- How much are the Gods allowed to communicate with mortals (both their converts and others) Could a God be used for instant communication, or would this be considered a breach of the MAD rules?

- Where do Gods come from, and can they die?

- More consistent rules for the relationship between a God's strength and their goals (can a God become more or less powerful depending on the scope of their goal changing? Eg, if 99% of Dwarves died, protecting them would suddenly be a much smaller, more specific goal. Would this result in a loss of power for the God of Dwarves?
