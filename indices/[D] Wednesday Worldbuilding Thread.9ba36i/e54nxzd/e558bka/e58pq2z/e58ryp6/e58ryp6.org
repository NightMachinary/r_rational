Yep. Making a pact with a deity is a deliberate ritual. For the big Gods, there's normally more people willing to serve than the Gods can handle, meaning they get to be selective about who they grant their powers to. The smaller Gods are often stuck with people who want power, but aren't really up to the other Gods' standards
