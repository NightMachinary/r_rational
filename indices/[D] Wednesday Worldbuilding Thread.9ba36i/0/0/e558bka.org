Here's a possible extension on that thought.

The gods are /ideals/. They draw their power from the number of living beings that hold to that same ideal; for example, most Dwarves are at least partially in agreement with the ideal that all Dwarves should be protected, so there's a strong Ideal that says 'protect all dwarves'. Many psychopaths are strongly in agreement with the idea that everything should be destroyed, so there's an Ideal for "destroy everything". The inhabitants of a small island might dislike outsiders, so there would be a (far weaker) Ideal for "keep outsiders off this island".

So. Each Ideal has a driving principle, and a certain amount of power drawn from the collective latent magic of everyone who believes in that Ideal. However, for all their power, these Ideals have no /intelligence/ - no ability to know how to direct or use that power. This, then, is where the Clerics and Paladins come in. They invite an Ideal to share their mind - and thus to share their intelligence, their brainpower. The intelligence of an Ideal is equal to the collective intelligence of all the clerics and/or paladins of that Ideal; and the Ideal also tends to take on other personality traits from its clerics and paladins. (Thus, for example, and Ideal for "protect all Dwarves" would get a lot of Dwarven clerics, most of which enjoy the taste of ale; therefore, the Ideal in question would soon decide that it enjoyed the taste of ale). In this way, the Ideals can begin to develop complex personalities in line with their worshippers (and these personalities would change over time). At the same time, though, a cleric's personality would slowly change to better match that of the Ideal; it's a two-way process.

The Ideal does, however, have its own memories, which it can communicate to its paladins and clerics at will. Normally, however, it doesn't; it'll generally only communicate in order to better serve its central purpose.

With this basis, it's clear to see that an Ideal can die, but only if no-one anywhere agrees with the idea anymore, so for popular Ideals it's virtually impossible. It also gives a reasonable relationship between the strength of the Ideal and its goals (killing 99% of Dwarves will weaken the Ideal of "protect all Dwarves", but not by anywhere near 99% as the remaining 1% of dwarves will suddenly be in much stronger agreement with the Ideal than before).
