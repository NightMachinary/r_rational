I thought about that panel from Order of the Stick: [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0858.html]]

For context, it happens after Tarquin (the guy in the helmet) repeatedly catches the arrows Haley shoots at him and stabs other heroes with them (like here: [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0851.html]]).
