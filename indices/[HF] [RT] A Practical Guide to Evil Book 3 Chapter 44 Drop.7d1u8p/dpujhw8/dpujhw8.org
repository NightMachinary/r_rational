(I'm not going to pretend the following verse is any good, but the song is what I was thinking of after reading)

#+begin_quote
  Time has worn the soldiers down, marched for many miles...\\
  In the lands of Sun so cursed,\\
  Time to make a stand!\\
  Baron has scorched this nation's life,\\
  Nothing to be left,\\
  Anger grasps the soldiers' hearts,\\
  Mere six hundred strong!

  * LISTEN, YOU EXCUSE FOR A DUCHESS!

  * TRUST ME, THIS FIGHT HAS NO SUCCESS!

  (By Summer)\\
  WENT TO CERTAIN DEATH AND PAIN,\\
  CATHERINE'S SOLDIERS SAW THEIR BANE.\\
  SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES IN VAIN,\\
  BY SUMMER!
