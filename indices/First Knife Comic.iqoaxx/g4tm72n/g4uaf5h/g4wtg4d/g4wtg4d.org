Aw, thanks! Pre-ordering the book would be the most help to us, but that might be to expensive. The individual issues are cheaper. And if you'd like to donate time instead of money, what we really need are people spreading the word. If you like First Knife, tell you friends about it. Simon, Artyom, and I also do text and voice interviews, if you know someone who has a podcast.

But just a review would mean a lot. Hell, just this positive reply means a lot. I was a bit scared posting my request here.

Thanks again. If you send me a PM, I can give you the drop-box link to the comic.
