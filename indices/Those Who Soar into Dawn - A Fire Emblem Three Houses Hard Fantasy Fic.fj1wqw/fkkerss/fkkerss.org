This is the Three Houses fic I've been working on a while... I wanted to wait to post it here until I'd written enough of it that readers could solidly understand what the story was like. Now that it's over 55k, I can't really claim it's just getting started, even though it's still very much in its early stages. Anyway, I really appreciate any sort of feedback, so please don't hesitate to sing its praises or write a livid takedown of my incompetence as a writer.

Also, I'm not 100% sure whether it really counts as rational fiction? Please tell me what you think on that. I didn't set out with the intent of making it rational fiction, but my own tastes are so informed by ratfic that I think it may have ended up being ratfic anyway.
