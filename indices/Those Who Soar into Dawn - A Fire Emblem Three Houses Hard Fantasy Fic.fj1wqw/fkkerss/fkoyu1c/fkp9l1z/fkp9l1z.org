I like it! You've gotten Claude right. He is a very specific mix of obviously lying and probably still trustworthy wrapped in a deep layer of flirtatiousness and friendliness that has been captured pretty well here.

Also, I disagree with Hubert's animal being a snake. Snake's are liars. Hubert is many things, but he is not a liar. He never pretends to want anything besides Edelgard's success. He might have your throat slit in the middle of the night, but you knew what you were getting into when you got in Edelgard's way. IMO, a spider is more fitting. A spider can be useful and peaceful, but will never be mistaken for friendly, or entirely benign.
