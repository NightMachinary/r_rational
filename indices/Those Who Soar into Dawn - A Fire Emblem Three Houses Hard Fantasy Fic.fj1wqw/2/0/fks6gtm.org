You got the animals backwards. Spiders use trickery and deceit (ie. Webbing) to ensare their foes while they hide in the shadows waiting for the food to come to them. Snakes hunt their food and use fast lethal bites to quickly end the fight. Also many use bright colors (or loud noises) to warn others of their dangerousness.
