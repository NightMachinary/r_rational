You can set your QQ account up to email you when there's activity in the thread. I don't think there's any way to get an RSS feed, sorry.

I don't think you can restrict it to OP posts or threadmarks, so sometimes it'll email you about discussion. When there's a big gap between updates, the discussion dies down too, so overall it works.
