Ask them. Asking me about their motivations would hardly get you an objective answer, will it now?

But if you want my opinion it's because when you have a sufficient mass of people sneering at something strongly enough, then more people start sneering at it just to fit in, even if they've never read any of it.

In a thread dedicated to HPMOR I noticed that many people's primary objection was something that was just plainly factually wrong, which made me wonder if they'd even read the fucking thing. When I corrected their factual errors, I was called names, accused of 'bad faith debating' for daring to correct them, and then the mods locked the thread.
