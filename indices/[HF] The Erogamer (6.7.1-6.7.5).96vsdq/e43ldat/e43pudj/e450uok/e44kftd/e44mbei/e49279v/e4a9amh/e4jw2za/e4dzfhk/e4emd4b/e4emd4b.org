Say on Sufficient Velocity, unapologetically, that you like HPMOR or rational fiction in general, and you're sure to be called a 'Big Yud cultist' or something. And the mods will refuse to infract the other people for such insults.

You may get away with liking rational fiction if you are apologetic about it. E.g. possible tactics (1) describe it as a guilty pleasure, (2) say that you know rational fiction objectively sucks but you enjoy it anyway, (3) perhaps heap abuse on the rest of the rationalist community while saying you like rational fiction anyway.
