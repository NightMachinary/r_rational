  If that does happen again,

If I ever comment on anything on SV ever again. Which right now doesn't seem likely, since it has gone to use up all my goodwill piece by piece.

Here's the first infraction I received in SV: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8012871/]]

Do please explain to me how my post merited a "Bad faith debating and Rule 3 breach." infraction? Where's the 'Bad faith debating' or the uncivility in that post?

Nowhere. But I dared defend rational fiction in that thread, so the asshole moderator ManusDomine just wanted to find anything to infract me for, while also patting himself on the back for how gracious and generous he is. His moderator post is /hilarious/, accusing me of all sorts of stuff I never did and which correspond to my attackers much more than to me.

Also note, how everyone /else/ in that thread is allowed to freely insult, insinuate, slur, sneer, misconstrue, throw hatred and bigotry at whole groups of people (not just rational fiction fans, but also e.g. MLP fans), and none of them ever gets infracted. It's not a Rule 2 violation if you're hateful at MLP fans, or hateful at rational fiction fans. It's not being disruptive (a Rule 4 violation) if you openly say you're a sneer-clubist there to sneer. It's not Bad Faith debating or uncivil if you insinuate that if you like Fallout:Equestria it must be because you're getting off on pony rape.

  well, please talk to advocates like me (QTesseract on SV) about that. It's our job to help users overturn bad mod decisions.

(1) Really? Okay, when someone abuses me, I report them to the mod, and the mod rejects my report, what can you do? You can't actually do anything, because you can only advocate in favour of lifting infractions, not in favor of placing ones, right?

So even if you successfully advocate for me in every given occasion, I'll still be getting fucking abused every time I dare speak an opinion about anything in SV, and I'll have to be unfailingly polite in response for me to not get banned.

(2) Well, the most /recent/ infraction I received was in "Let's watch Jojo" thread, which also got me perma-threadbanned from there. I did briefly consider contacting an advocate like you, but then I saw you personally had done a 'like' to the mod decision that perma-banned me from the thread for daring to call out the abuse I was receiving, so I scrapped that plan.

It's been gradually made clear to me that nobody who abuses me in SV will ever get infracted, unless a more severe punishment falls at the same time on me, which lets them get the 'victory'. If I'm so absolutely proper and polite and rule-following that they can't possibly justify an infraction, then they'll just rather lock the thread, rather than infract my abusers.
