You can click "Threadmarks" > "Reader Mode", and then you'll have just the chapters with none of the intervening discussion. [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/reader]]

Or you could just click ">>" at the end of each chapter, but make sure it's the ">>" of an actual chapter, not the ">>" of a stats post, because that would take you to the /next/ stats post.
