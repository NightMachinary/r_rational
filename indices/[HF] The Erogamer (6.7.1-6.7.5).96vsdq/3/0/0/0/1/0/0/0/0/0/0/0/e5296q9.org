Isn't it a bit strange that the post that ManusDomine issues a warning against is also the very same post that he has himself put a "Funny" tag on, and which he hadn't objected to two days earlier?

Doesn't that seem a tiny bit strange to you? Like sending mixed messages?

I don't know what the deal is with ManusDomine suddenly finding the same comment objectionable two days later, but I have a set of uncharitable pet theories about it. (And yeah, I may be biased against him, but none of those theories is that he's actually interested in fairness, or would actually ever infract people making infraction-worthy comments against rational fiction fans.)
