Thanks for posting this here as well, Groon! I definitely feel it belongs here.

I'd like to note that the /previous/ arc (6.4.2-6.6.d with 6.4.1 serving more as connecting material) not ONLY had a aspiring rationalist character in it, but it explicitly had a reader of rational/rationalist fiction in it -- which uh, may be a global first? Has any other fiction had a rational fiction /reader/ as a character in it? :-) I was actually thinking of making a thread here about it, but the new arc beat me to it.

Anyway Lavelle/Ziquan (character introduced properly in 6.4.2 and being one of the two most prominent characters in the arc) is a reader of HPMOR and makes a couple of references to it, and mentions Unsong as well.
