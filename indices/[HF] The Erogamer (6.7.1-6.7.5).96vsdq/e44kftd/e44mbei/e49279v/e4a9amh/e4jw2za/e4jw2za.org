A) It actually was. I asked about that on the administrative discord, and the directors are fans of it; they consider it to have enough artistic merit to get an exemption under that clause.

B) It's not. Well, maybe it's because of the banner I have under my name, so I suppose I'm not entirely representative, but it isn't that bad at all. Furthermore, Not all the staff is positive about ratfic in general, but The Erogamer in specific had universal approval from staff and CC. Furthermore, Marked for death is a fairly major thing on SV, and many other, rational adjacent works are very popular as well. I would't say it's anywhere near as supportive of RatFic as here is, but I most of the vitriol that does occur is from a the subset of users that will go into a debate thread about ratfic. It's very much a recipe for sampling bias, because the only people who will be joining such a debate thread are the virulent haters from any population and counterjoiners from ardent defenders, which leaves very little room for conversation.
