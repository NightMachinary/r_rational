Within that first thread? [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8028365/]]. As for your infraction? No, thaat post had nothign in it. Some of the other posts he quoted were borderline, but it was nothing that Blazinghand or I wouldn't have considered a open and shut appeal. Staff do make mistaken posts, and the arbitrator staff is generally a rather separate entity; I have an over 60% success rate on overturning moderator actions, and this would have been one of the easier ones I believe.

There isn't a direct step aside from "additional report from someone not in the conversation," but in practice both CC members and Advocates have a much greater ability to influence staff decisions since we have direct lines of communication. If we ask for explanations, or justifications, etc. we tend to get them and can engage with them. It's definitely not as strong as I'd like it to be, though.

I liked that post because it was threadbanning "no." who really, really pissed me off. I honestly didn't think about how that would affect you given that you were also infracted there. Even if this conversation doesn't lead to anything else, I'd like to personally thank you for pointing out what other affects doing so could have so I can improve myself; this isn't sarcastic at all, I just genuinely hadn't thought about it even though it should have been obvious if I had for more than a few seconds. I apologize for how this affected you in specific here, and will use this as an impetus to do better.
