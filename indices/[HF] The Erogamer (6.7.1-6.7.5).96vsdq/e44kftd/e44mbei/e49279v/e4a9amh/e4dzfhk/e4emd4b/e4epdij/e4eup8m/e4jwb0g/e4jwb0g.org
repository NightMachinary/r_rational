That's not supposed to happen. If that does happen again, well, please talk to advocates like me (QTesseract on SV) about that. It's our job to help users overturn bad mod decisions. I don't know the incident in specific, so I can't comment on it, but if allowing that kind of thing happens it's not a policy decision.
