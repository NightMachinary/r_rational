I'm partial to siding with pilots because they always hold the life of the ship in their hands.

The argument that the colony cannot survive on its own is very significant: if true, then the balance isn't 200 000 000 × 0.001 vs 3 000 × (1−ε), but 200 000 000 × 1:999 vs loss of all humanity forever.

Is the captain right? Could the colony survive on its own? Or is the pilot right? That's the question.

The captain should have overruled the pilot immediately, as proper captains do, or should have not interfered at all. In killing the pilot after the maneuver was begun, the captain doomed the ship.

Shoot first, or don't shoot at all.
