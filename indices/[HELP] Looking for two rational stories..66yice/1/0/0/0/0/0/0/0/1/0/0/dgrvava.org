I briefly considered you meant it in context; wasn't certain though. I think it was the way that statement had its own line thst made me think you were making a general statement. My apologies.

Also I think I side with the Captain here. We can't know the odds but she IS gambling against humanity's survival. And the argument that the colony can't survive without the resources of Earth (assuming the planet they're going to is sufficiently Earth-like) is bad reasoning. We survived and grew with nothing but ourselves and tools crafted out of sticks. I'm sure the thousands of people with future age tech can manage.

Edit: obviously some will die. But if even a quarter of the remaining populace lives to a reproductive age, we can hope. And actually, in hindsight, if they have enough tech to create new bodies for the 250 billion, there should be enough tech to do that for anyone who's current body is too sickly.
