  The argument that the colony cannot survive on its own is very significant: if true
#+end_quote

It's extremely significant if true. If true, it completely knocks the legs out from under the Captain's argument.

But is it true?

  The captain should have overruled the pilot immediately, as proper captains do, or should have not interfered at all. In killing the pilot after the maneuver was begun, the captain doomed the ship.

She tried, and the Pilot promptly rejected her authority. But yes, proper discipline between the two of them would have increased the probability of a successful outcome. (The ability to seal off an empty fuel tank and then cut a hole in the side would also have allowed them to bypass pretty much the entire problem and save /everyone/).

Both Captain and Pilot had extremely poor problem-solving methodologies, which were made distinctly worse by the interference of each other.
