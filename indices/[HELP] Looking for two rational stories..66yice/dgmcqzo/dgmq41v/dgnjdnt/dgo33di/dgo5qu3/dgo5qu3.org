No, I mean an argument based on reality. Let me show you.

The pilot says that there are two hundred billion lives on the line. Even if she has only a one in a thousand chance of success, making the attempt is equivalent of saving two hundred million lives, and well worth it, right? Especially compared to the mere three thousand people on board.

But the Captain points out that those three thousand people are all that's left of humanity. The Captain isn't just counting the three thousand in their hold; she's also counting all their /descendants/, throughout time. If those three thousand die, there will be no more humanity ever; if they live, you could have a whole lot more than two hundred billion people given time. The pilot sees a one in a thousand chance of saving two hundred billion people; the Captain sees a nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thousand chance of losing the /last/ of humanity.
