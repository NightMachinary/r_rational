The next chapter has also dropped just now, make sure to check it out if you haven't.

Is this the payoff for the plan from Interlude 13? Get V3 hivemind capability a little bit sooner than he would, so V3 gets the message from Player Two a little sooner than he would, so V3 makes an oopsie he definitely would not have made otherwise? Does the other Player have a reverse Uno card ready to go or did Player Two just score a massive win and invalidate all of the other Player's planning?

Damn it what are these characters supposed to do? Andalites don't take the threat of super intelligence seriously, so V3 doesn't, so Player Two gets to run simulations until he finds the way to have V3 look at his new shiny and say "what's the worst that could happen?"

If they don't all immediately die, then getting out from under the gods' control might depend on abusing whatever has changed because Rachel is here when she shouldn't be. Crayak and Ellimist can account for her after the fact, but its possible that her being around opens up a line of play that was supposed to be impossible. Not sure how they could find that option though, or even recognize that looking for it is a possibility, since no one else should realize that Rachel wasn't planned for.

Whatever weird thing that's going on with Rachel has also been accounted for, but, somehow, maybe that can help anyway? The best theory I could bullshit together was that Rachel has secretly been a Chee since shortly after the Chee got a copy of Rachel.exe but you /really/ have to stretch to get there. And even if that were right I don't see how it helps.

Maybe Elfangor's speech will be relevant way sooner than I thought it would. The Chee will know that they could have destroyed the Howlers but didn't, and decide that puppy maximizing is a dick move?

ETA: ...hold up.

(Spoilers for Chapter 48, just in case)

The given chapter order from the note in 44 was 45: Garrett, 46: Cassie, Interlude, 47: Tobias, Interlude, *48: Rachel*

Chee!Rachel standing up, +confirmed+

Worth a shot!
