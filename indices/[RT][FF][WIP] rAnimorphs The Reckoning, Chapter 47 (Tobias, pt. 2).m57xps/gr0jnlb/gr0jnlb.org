  â€œShortly after you finish assimilating this memory, you will be called upon to weigh in on a question of strategy. You will, of course, immediately perceive the obvious danger of the proposed course of action, but I would ask that you endorse it anyway, saying nothing of your concern, and deflecting concern if another raises any. Consider it a personal favor to me.

THAT CHEATING BASTARD.

Also, this feels like we're finally in the endgame. Everything before that was people thinking about what to do and setting up possibilities and learning relevant information and whatever; where the protagonists could barely do /anything/ since they took over the yeerk fleet and the Howlers came.

Now's the point where they get their agency back and their decisions /actually/ impact how the story ends, hopefully.

(also, if the story has a "travel back in time an do the Thanos fight all over again" moment in store, it's probably coming in the next few chapters)
