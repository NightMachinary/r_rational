  One of the two sides wants more death, horror, destruction, etc.

I'm not so sure. TK17 has said that the Players are allowed to manipulate and deceive, as long as they don't actually lie. When the avatar gestured at everything around them and said "this", it could have been referring to the entire planet or life and civilization, as easily as the carnage at the pool.

We saw in a Crayak interlude that Its first memories are of starving for energy on a dead planet and having to use every tiny scrap of negentropy perfectly to get Its solar panels in range of the closest star, and It /still/ lost half Its soul in the process.

My guess is that Crayak, as OUS, wants the destruction of all non-Howler life (just like in cannon) and to snuff out every star to make the universe last longer (also just like V3, actually...), and the Ellimist, as CHN, values the Chaos of trillions of different lifeforms evolving and growing, and the Harmony of them learning how to trust each other and collaborate.
