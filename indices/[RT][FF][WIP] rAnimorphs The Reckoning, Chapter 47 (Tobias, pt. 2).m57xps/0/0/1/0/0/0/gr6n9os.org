This is complete speculation, but I'm pretty sure that memory is from both the Ellimist and Crayak.

Like, the "lost half its soul" part is when the entity splits in two and sends half its body away to course-correct.

So the half that did the sending might be the Ellimist, while the half that was sent away would be Crayak; and it wants to destroy all life out of revenge / bitterness / "next time I need to escape the galaxy I want all the resources I can carry and I don't care about the aliens living on the piles of resources".
