The one thing I could never figure out about this theory is how did the half that was cut off land /anywhere/, instead of drifting through the void forever, space being as big as it is? The Narrator says there was no margin for error to reach the nearest star. So if the jettisoned Half /also/ made it to a star, that means the rock must have been on an incredibly precise, specific trajectory, one that not even the combined proto-gods could calculate. Whatever set that rock in motion did so with probably the only combination of speed and direction that would end up creating Crayak and the Ellimist.
