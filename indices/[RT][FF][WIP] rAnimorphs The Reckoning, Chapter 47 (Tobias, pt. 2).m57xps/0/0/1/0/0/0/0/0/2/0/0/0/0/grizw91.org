For sure. I was mostly being cheeky to imply that the gods we know were created by the Mega-Ellimist.

But then again...maybe Crayak and the Ellimist are themselves avatars of the real gods (or of avatars of the real gods), that They use as inputs to manipulate game pieces too small to bother with Themselves, like all the way down at the level of individual galaxies, planets, and species?
