The Chee

Of /course/ it was the Chee

They were unlockable in canon they're unlockable here

And player two is obviously Crayak when Chee do their thing everyone freezes unless the Chee allow them to move this is order unity silence not chaos harmony noise

But the other option is to let the Howlers run free so that has to be the Ellimist's plan the Howlers generate so much chaos harmony noise

The Ellimists' Howlers and Crayak's Chee

I was tricked! In canon the Ellimist is just /good/ but here neither god is good they're different flavors of bad one of them wants the Howlers to enjoy destroying things forever the other wants unboxed AI Chee to puppy maximize forever

I'm writing this up instead of going to sleep because aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh this is so much this is so good how will I wait up to two weeks for the next chapter I am going to be on the edge of my seat this entire time you can tell from the stream of consciousness way I'm writing up this comment even! New paragraphs for every thought and minimal punctuation!

Also, I just wanted to say how much I loved the line

  The Visser sighed theatrically. “Why are you here, descendent-of-Telor-who-is-genetically-identical-and-also-possessed-of-all-the-same-memories-and-personality-traits-but-is-definitely-a-different-person?”

I have never related to the Visser so much as in this moment.
