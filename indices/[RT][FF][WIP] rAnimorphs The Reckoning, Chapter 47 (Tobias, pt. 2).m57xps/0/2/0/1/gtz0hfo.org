I wanted to respond to this comment but was postponing it!

  I'm going to claim that the avatar would be lying if it described your Ellimist quote as no vision at all or the anti-vision.
#+end_quote

I'd see "no vision at all" as a way put to the vision down - like "no vision to look up to" or "no vision worth talking about," for two reasons, I'd guess: it's a phrase we could use in English about X to put an existing X down, and also "chaos, harmony and noise" is already a description of a kind of a vision - so "no vision at all" probably isn't literal, so it might be used to things that are actually very much visions, even to visions that people (and everyone else except V3) would find good - if it's a value judgment, it might be allowed.

"The anti-vision" is true if the E/C agree to let the avatar color that particular answer in Crayak's favor ("the anti-vision" sounds like "the opposite of C's vision and also bad," and the latter is a value judgement so it might not qualify as a lie).

  Crayak could still be going for the extinction of all life everywhere I suppose, but idk if it's fair to describe that as valuing unity.

If he's going for one strongest race governed by him, that's unity, but a dark kind.

But maybe I'm completely wrong...

Anyway, it sounds like we're really close to the finale!
