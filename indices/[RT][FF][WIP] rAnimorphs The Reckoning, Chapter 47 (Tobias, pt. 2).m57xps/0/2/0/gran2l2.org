I'm going to claim that the avatar would be lying if it described your Ellimist quote as no vision at all or the anti-vision. That to me seems like a very succinct description of a vision of the universe that aims for something along the lines of maximal flourishing. Crayak could still be going for the extinction of all life everywhere I suppose, but idk if it's fair to describe that as valuing unity.
