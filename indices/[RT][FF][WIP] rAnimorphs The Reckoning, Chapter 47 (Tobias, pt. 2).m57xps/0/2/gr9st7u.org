Warning: Here the avatar seems to be deliberately deceptive without lying:

#+begin_quote
  "What does anyone want?" the creature replied easily. "Resources. Freedom. The ability to enact one's will upon the universe---to reshape one's surroundings to be more in accordance with one's preferences. Crayak---Crayak has a vision for the future. It would like to see things arranged just so. And the Ellimist---"

  The creature shrugged again. "The Ellimist disagrees."

  "What's the Ellimist's vision?"

  "No vision at all. The anti-vision. Chaos, to Crayak's order. Harmony, to Crayak's unity. Noise, to Crayak's silence."

By cross-referencing with Seerowpedia ([[https://animorphs.fandom.com/wiki/Ellimist][the E]], [[https://animorphs.fandom.com/wiki/Crayak][C]])

This is the Ellimist:

#+begin_quote
  "I would intrude with exquisite sensitivity and the purest motivations. I would create harmonies. Boldness allied with restraint and a minimalist aesthetic, all in the service of moral certainties: that peace was better than war, that freedom was better than slavery, that knowledge was better than ignorance. Oh, yes, the galaxy would be a wonderful place under my guidance.["]
#+end_quote

This is Crayak:

#+begin_quote
  "He is a strange perfectionist, in a way. He wants a galaxy cleansed of creation. His goal, I soon realized, is to destroy life. His method is to use one species against another, strong destroying weak, and then strong in turn being destroyed by the stronger still. He believes that there should be only one species. A single sentient race, which would be subjugated by him." ... "He wants to be able to control the strands of space-time itself."
#+end_quote

So the E's plan is life and harmony, while C's intention is realize the order, unity and silence through killing everyone but one race and subjugating it, and also rule over everything, while the Avatar is deceptively presenting it as the E being the bad guy and C sort of maybe the good one.

Their intents might be different in the fanfiction, but they seem to match to the idea of the Avatar being allowed to mislead while technically speaking the truth.

Important questions:

Could the Ellimist claim to be player 2 to deceive Visser? (Visser would assume "player 2" would be evil, and therefore on his side.) Or would that count as a lie? (Probably not.)

This would fit the good ending (the good guys free, the Howlers killed on Earth but redeemable everywhere else).

If "player 2" is C after all, I wonder in what way it's destructive to release the Chee. Could they be an unfriendly AI (caring only about dogs)?

Really looking forward to the next chapter.

Edit:

  Also, I just wanted to say how much I loved the line
#+end_quote

I loved it too - it drives home how V3 is the adult in the room (despite being a selfish/sociopathic genius/pure evil), /so done/ with the game everyone else is playing, and who just wants to go home.
