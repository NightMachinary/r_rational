I'm trying to decipher this 'gift'.

"It may take you some time to fully appreciate, but it is exactly what it appears to be---you may verify the authenticity of its contents in any way you choose. Hopefully they will be of use to you in your future endeavors."

It appears to be exactly what it is, yet may take time to determine the use of it. And the /contents/ are what will be useful. I think that rules out another blue box, or a time matrix - neither of those really have contents. So, a container that V3 can identify immediately, filled with something (information?) he can eventually make use of?
