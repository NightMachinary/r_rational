  This isn't like a real life war where both sides have legitimate grievances, and where there are conscripts, civilians, etc. this is an entire race that just goes around committing genocide.

I think the point was that if each of these races can prove themselves unwilling to commit genocide in this scenario, they can trust each other to never commit genocide, and thus they don't have to worry about any of the other races committing genocide in the future.

If, on the other hand, humanity (for example) is willing to commit genocide "as a last resort," then you always have to worry what constitutes a "last resort," and if it might apply to you.
