So one plan was to kill all the Howlers with a quantum virus while the other was to unleash the chee to wipe out only these Howlers (and do who knows what else.) This story rules, top five chapter. My guess is that the gift left for the Visser is a copy of the morphing cube but I don't know

Edit: I have to say I still don't agree at all with the Elfangor/Cassie viewpoint. This isn't like a real life war where both sides have legitimate grievances, and where there are conscripts, civilians, etc. this is an entire race that just goes around committing genocide. And nobody would even know who triggered the quantum virus or if that's even what it was. But I'm glad unleashing the Chee is what happened because that's more interesting. I was actually expecting them to just use a Leeran on the Howlers
