My personal take as author is that Marco is more risk as a vector than the Tobias group; the Tobias group got out before Howlers were ever close and it takes a while for stuff in the upper atmosphere to fall down.

Also, my headcanon on Howlers is that they're all, like, "eh, upper atmospheric plague? Been there, done that, give us something new to try."
