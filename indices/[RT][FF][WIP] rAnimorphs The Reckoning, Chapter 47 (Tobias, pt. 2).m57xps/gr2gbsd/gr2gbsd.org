By the way, I don't know if anyone noticed, but, from last chapter:

#+begin_quote
  The problem was, why two fleets?

  If we were playing along---and it seemed, for the moment, that we were---if we were going to take seriously the idea that all of this had been prepared for us, laid out for us---that none of the details were random---

  There wouldn't be two entirely independent arks unless we were going to need two entirely independent arks.

  Or unless one of the arks wasn't an ark at all.

And from Erek's description of the Pemalite genocide:

#+begin_quote
  “Yes. It had been the Howlers' first move, as it turned out---they'd seeded the atmosphere with a plague that took weeks to incubate. The rest of it---the burning, the killing, the torture---that was just because they liked it.”

Chee singularity notwithstanding, Tobias's colony is doomed, right? They're probably all infected with the same plague.

The only potential colony that can be saved is the one with the... hum, /extremely/ traumatized teenagers in the Mars base.
