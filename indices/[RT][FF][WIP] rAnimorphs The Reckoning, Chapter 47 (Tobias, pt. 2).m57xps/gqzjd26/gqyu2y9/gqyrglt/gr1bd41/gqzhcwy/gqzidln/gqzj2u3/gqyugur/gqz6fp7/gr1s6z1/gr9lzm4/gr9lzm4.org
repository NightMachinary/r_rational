  This isn't like a real life war where both sides have legitimate grievances, and where there are conscripts, civilians, etc. this is an entire race that just goes around committing genocide. And nobody would even know who triggered the quantum virus or if that's even what it was.

The Howlers are sufficiently psychologically distinct from humans that they're not necessarily beyond saving. (Even if they were humans, with the technology at the protagonists' disposal, they could potentially still be saved.) While you wouldn't sacrifice one innocent human to avoid having to kill /one/ Howler, there are so many Howlers that finding an alternate solution to a complete genocide is worth it.
