Well. Chapter 48. That sounds about right for an AI unboxing scenario.

Is there any reason why Tobias couldn't say, not disable the strategy limiter? The censor, refresh cycle, and nonviolence autopilot all seem pretty important to letting them effectively fight the Howlers, but letting them do the human thing and ignore stuff that'd be in the future would be effective at stopping them from performing preemptive retaliation and the like.

Then again, working on very limited timeframes, I suppose "disable everything" is more reliable. Smart to disable all Chee inside the ship though, which is likely how the Chee are going to be prevented from spreading (Assuming Player Two is telling the truth to the Visser)
