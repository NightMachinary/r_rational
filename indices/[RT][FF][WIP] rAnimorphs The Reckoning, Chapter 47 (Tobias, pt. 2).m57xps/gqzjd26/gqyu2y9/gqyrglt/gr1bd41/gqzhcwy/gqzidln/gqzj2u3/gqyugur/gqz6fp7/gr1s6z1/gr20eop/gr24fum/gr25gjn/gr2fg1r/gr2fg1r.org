Eeeh... If I had a "genocide all yeerks" button, I would be /extremely/ tempted to press it at basically any point in the story, one-boxing thought experiments or not. Press it before V3 starts his cloning spree, bam, one billion humans saved.

(actually, more if we assume that V3 making his howlers experiments is what drew them here, none at all if the arrive anyway)

Maybe they don't deserve it, maybe peace is possible, but these questions become a lot less relevant when the other guys have already proved they have both the means and the willingness to kill/enslave large numbers of humans unprovoked.

You can't have diplomacy when one side has complete spatial superiority over you and also every incentive to fuck you over. If the other side wants diplomacy, they need to give up one of those. Otherwise, kill or be killed.
