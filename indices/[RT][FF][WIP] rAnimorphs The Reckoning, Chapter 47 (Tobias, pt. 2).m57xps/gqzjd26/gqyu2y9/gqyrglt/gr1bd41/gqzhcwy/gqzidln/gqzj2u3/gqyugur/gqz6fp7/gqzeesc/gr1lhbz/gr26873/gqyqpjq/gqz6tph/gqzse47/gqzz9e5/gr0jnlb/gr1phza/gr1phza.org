Um...huh. In a chapter which contained an explicit reminder/lesson on what an idiom is, I wonder what we are to make of the alien god's use of a human idiom in a message that was not intended to pass through any human minds... I'm looking at you, "Player Two."

I'm really looking forward to the next chapter/hoping that we will get more details of Chee uprising somehow- your previous action-heavy chapters (Marclones v. Arn planet monsters and Marclones v. Howlers spring to mind) have been really gripping, so I'm just greedy for more :) :) :)
