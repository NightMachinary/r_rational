It's all very vague and unclear at the moment. We knew that Elfangor had spent years on Earth in human morph from the very first chapter, but also the war with the Yeerks had only been going on for a few years, and also Elfangor had /participated/ in that war.

Also there was the fact he had some weird memory block that they couldn't get around even when they morphed him.

Then later, when they ran into Marco's mom, she reported having been a Controller for several years /prior/ to her disappearance, yet Yeerks only discovered Earth a couple of years ago (thanks to her??).

The chapter you'd be most interested in is Chapter 39 (Jake).
