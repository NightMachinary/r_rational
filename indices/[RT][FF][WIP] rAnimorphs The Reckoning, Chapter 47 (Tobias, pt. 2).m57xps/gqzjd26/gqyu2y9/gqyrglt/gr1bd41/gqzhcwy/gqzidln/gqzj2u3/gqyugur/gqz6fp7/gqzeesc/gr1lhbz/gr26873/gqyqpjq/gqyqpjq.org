Crayak, you bastard.

Did you just pull a "What if we did the exact opposite of book 26?"? Because now I'm feeling like Elfangor's speech is going to be the deciding factor on how this ends. And this ends soon.

I like the counsil getting to be both 7 and 13. Did the 24 have any significance? How about the 36 at the end (3Ã—12?)?

Also, "Crayak, you bastard" <3
