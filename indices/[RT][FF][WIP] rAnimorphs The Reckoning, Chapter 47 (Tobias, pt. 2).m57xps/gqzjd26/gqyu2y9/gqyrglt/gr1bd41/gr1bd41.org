Upon a far and distant land in the ancient days of old, a strange race set its hand to make new men of metal cold.

When the noise of a loud howl rained down in anger on our ears, holograms grimaced in a scowl, we created light to show our tears.

We hid away for many a year, tending to imitations of our friends, and looking ahead still to peer at thoughts of vengeance as our end.

We ask you make us gods, not logs, to now avenge our friends the dogs.
