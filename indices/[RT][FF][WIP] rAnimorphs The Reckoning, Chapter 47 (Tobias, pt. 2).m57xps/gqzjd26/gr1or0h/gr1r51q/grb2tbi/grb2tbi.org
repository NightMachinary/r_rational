I think of the Harmony vs. Unity axis in terms of prisoner's dilemma strategies, or different outlooks on the problems of trust/competition/Mad Queen Races.

Visser Three represents one solution: eliminate the problem by Uniting all matter and energy in the universe except for the Arn and the dogs under the will of a single agent.

Terra and Helium represent the way harder solution of actually getting everyone to cooperate, Harmonizing the trillion trillion voices of the universe while letting each of them keep their unique values and identities.

In canon the Ellimist ascended to godhood before Crayak, which in a rational universe would make him the more powerful AGI, and so it makes sense that he would agree to the game if his vision of the universe was more delicate/fragile/harder to bring about.
