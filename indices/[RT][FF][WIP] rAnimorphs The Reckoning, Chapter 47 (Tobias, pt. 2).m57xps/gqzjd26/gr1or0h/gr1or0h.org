  And player two is obviously Crayak when Chee do their thing everyone freezes unless the Chee allow them to move this is order unity silence not chaos harmony noise

  But the other option is to let the Howlers run free so that has to be the Ellimist's plan the Howlers generate so much chaos harmony noise

  The Ellimists' Howlers and Crayak's Chee

  I was tricked! In canon the Ellimist is just /good/ but here neither god is good they're different flavors of bad one of them wants the Howlers to enjoy destroying things forever the other wants unboxed AI Chee to puppy maximize forever

I don't think this is quite right. I agree that it's an oversimplification to say "Ellimist good, Crayak evil," but I don't think letting the Howlers run rampant fits as an Ellimist endgame. If he's all about promoting a diversity of life (i.e. chaos harmony noise), then letting one species genocide all the others is antithetical to that, regardless of how happy they are. The Howlers being a hivemind makes it even worse, since if they're the only sentient race left in the galaxy then that makes every sentient being identical.

Regardless of their disposition, successful Howlers seem more "order unity silence" than "chaos harmony noise" to me, since there'd be no one left but the Howler hivemind.

I think it's more likely that, much like the "Ellimist" avatar, neither the Chee nor the Howlers belong entirely to one god or the other. The Ellimist can use the Howlers as an external threat to encourage disparate species to cooperate while Crayak can use them for genocide, the Ellimist can use the Chee to promote peace and discourage violence while Crayak can unlock them to have a scary robo-pocalypse of puppy fanatics, etc.
