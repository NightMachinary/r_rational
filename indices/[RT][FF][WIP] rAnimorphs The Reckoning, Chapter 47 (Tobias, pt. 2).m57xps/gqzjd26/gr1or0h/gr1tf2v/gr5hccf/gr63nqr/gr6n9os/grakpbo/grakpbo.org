Hmm. I hadn't considered the idea that both Ellimist and Crayak were "cut from the same cloth" so to speak. There's another chapter where we see memories that suggest an Ellimist origin story similar to canon, but that might not be incompatible with your theory.

I think the part that became Crayak is the one that did the splitting. I'm guessing that half kept as much ambition and will to survive as it could have, while sending away things like passiveness and lack of ambition in the other half. The ambitious part eventually got close enough to a star to grow and spread and became the OUS god we know and "love".

As for the other half, maybe it eventually crashed into an ocean world and became /Father/, a largely unintelligent assimilator with little will or drive of its own. Then it eventually ensnares the Ketrans and Toobin along with it. Toobin counter-assimilates Father along with everything else it had taken into its web, becomes the Ellimist, and the rest is history.
