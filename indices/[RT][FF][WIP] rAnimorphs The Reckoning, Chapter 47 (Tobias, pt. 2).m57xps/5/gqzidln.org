When the Chee gave Tobias the key all those chapters ago, I thought, "Hmm, Pemalite crystal?"

And then it turned out to just be the key to the Pemalite ship, so I stopped thinking about it.

Aaaaand then it turned out to be the Pemalite crystal after all, and now stuff's about to get really horrifying.

I'm, uh... Nervous? Is that the word? I don't know what I am.

How does this tie back to The One Who Is Remembered? If the Chee are able to dodge their pacifist programming by, like, starting to execute unsigned code in the first frame of their boot sequence, and then forwarding it to another Chee before the boot sequence can properly initialize, how would one Chee have broken through the Howler line by itself back on the Pemalite homeworld? Maybe they did this same hack to cook up a "dive-bomb the Howlers" command and then one unlucky Chee got the finished code on the first frame of boot, or something? I suppose that's all you would need if you were just trying to punch one hole in their blockade...

Also, bit of a personal note here, but I'm kinda - very much - hoping this series doesn't cross over with the canon Animorphs books in any way, shape, or form. Like, if it turns out that Elfangor hopped over to the r!Animorphs universe from the Scholastic book series universe, somehow that would feel - er - enormously cheesy to me. I'm not saying I /think/ that's where it's going, buuuuut we haven't seen any super duper hard evidence to the contrary, and I'm startin' to get kiiiinda uncomfy. That Loren thing definitely made me sweat a little. But I'm sure it's fine, right? Surely r!Animorphs takes place in a great big multiverse where it just so happens that Elfangor came from a universe where he, um, hooked up with Tobias's mom, coincidentally like he did in canon, and she coincidentally happens to have the same name as Tobias's mom in canon. Or like, it's all Ellimist trickery, it's not a multiverse at all, and the Ellimist had very good reasons for renaming Loren to Laura or - or something.

/Hoo/.

Alright. Ready to see what happens next. Can't even express how much I love this story.
