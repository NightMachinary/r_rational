This was intense.

  Wait. Peter /Levy/?

That was so long ago I kind of expect it to be background knowledge by now, but I guess Tobias has been out of the loop for a long time.

  It couldn't properly be called a voice. It came from every direction at once, seeming like it ought to be thunderous---but it was also porous, insubstantial, the gaps between the scraps of sound somehow still palpable, like the constant flicker of a fluorescent light.

Each Chee, I take it, emitting a fraction of a second of audio, then getting wiped, but the next one in the cycle continues the speech.

  A long-term consequences inhibitor! Makes it so they can't think more than six steps ahead!
#+end_quote

Hunh. Not at all? This is the kind of thing that makes me want to reread all the previous Chee bits and see if it explains any mysteries.

  Ten thousand light-years away, an Andalite screamed as his mind was torn open, his most precious memories laid bare---

Feel slightly embarrassed I didn't wonder this earlier, but would this have worked with a human? Like, I sometimes watch subtitled anime and I wouldn't have a chance of reciting most of the sounds a minute later, even just in my head, even if I heard the same sounds three times ever over a period of years. If a Japanese-speaking yeerk slides into my brain, will it be able to watch anime through my memory and understand the dialog? Or (as I currently guess) is this another case of andalite brains being really impressive in some ways?

  I slid the last item to the top of the list, and sent my confirmation to the computer.

Can Tobias release the Chee for, like, a minute at a time? I feel like they'd be able to do some pretty serious damage in a minute, but... even without the gods' interference, /probably/ not set things up to tile the universe with puppies? At least not in ways that they wouldn't be able to undo with their inhibitor chips restored. I mean, I wouldn't normally want to bet on that, maybe I wouldn't even bet on it now

(...which means if it was me, the stakes would presumably have been made even higher, the time pressure even more urgent, to get me to do it. Like, assuming I even made it to this point without collapsing in a gibbering heap.)

but it still seems safer than /not/ putting on the time limit.
