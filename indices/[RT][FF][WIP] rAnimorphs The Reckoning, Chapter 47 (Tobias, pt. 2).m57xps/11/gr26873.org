I absolutely love this story, but every time I come to the subreddit, I feel like all the story-related comments and compliments have already been made.

However, one thing I'd like to take some more time to appreciate is the /non-story-related/ philosophy, etc built in. Mainly the whole "sense of self" thing which I have previously commented on.

But in this chapter in particular:

#+begin_quote
  Unstated expectations are premeditated resentments
#+end_quote

I don't know if you really did get that from a fortune cookie or something, but it's one of those profound quotes that immediately re-frames things that were previously taken for granted.

I really like how this story has progressed. It's probably one of my favourite stories ever. But I /love/ the story for the philosophical undercurrents and nuggets such as this one line.
