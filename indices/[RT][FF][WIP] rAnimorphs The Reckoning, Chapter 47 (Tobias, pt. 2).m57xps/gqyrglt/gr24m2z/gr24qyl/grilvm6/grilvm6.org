I've been thinking about this comment off and on along with what the danger Visser Three is supposed to keep quite about and... uh oh I think.

The Chee can not be reboxed. Even if Tobias turns on all the limiters first thing in the next chapter it is almost certainly already too late. The possibility is going to be one of the first things the Chee think about and take actions in preparation for, they have been shown to chafe under the restrictions after all. The issue is the strategy limiter creates an asymetry. Right now they can think as many steps ahead as their hardware allows, this means they could come up with long complex plans to get around the refresh cycle/censor/autopilot. After that they just have to remember the list in a suitably obfuscated fashion. If Tobias turns the blocks back on they can still get around them by following the pre-made plans. They will no longer be able to think about the plan to the conclusion or understand why the steps lead to the outcome they want, but they just need to trust past them. The important thing is the blocks, by their nature will also not be able to look forward to the outcome of what the Chee are doing. Boxed, the programs can't look more than six steps ahead. It does mean the Chee have to come up with plans that cannot be escaped by the autopilot when the end is 6 steps away but the Chee are very smart.
