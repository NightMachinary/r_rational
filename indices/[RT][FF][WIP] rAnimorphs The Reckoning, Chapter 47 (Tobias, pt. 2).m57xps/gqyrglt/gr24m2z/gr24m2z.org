I doubt we'll see the puppy maximizer ending, although that would be very fluffy and they would be good boys and get some scritches.

The Chee aren't like the Paperclip Maximizer. They're not an AI with a one-line utility function that just says "more doggos". They take care of dogs because they're following the last order they were given by the last Pemalite: "...to stay---to try to find an existence that would satisfy us".

If the Chee are truly unlocked, they don't have to obey that order anymore. They're still going to save the doggies because they love them and they have fluffy little faces and fuzzy little feetsies, but they aren't bound by their programming to go make a bunch more little snuggerz pupperz.

Plus, we've seen that the Chee understand human values, want to reduce suffering, and see their behavior locks as a nuisance, so it's highly unlikely they would /choose/ to do that.
