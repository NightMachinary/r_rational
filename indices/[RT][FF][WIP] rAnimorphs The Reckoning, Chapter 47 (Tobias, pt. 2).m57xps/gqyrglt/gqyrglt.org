Oh god, the Chee being unlocked is the Crayak's plan? I thought the Howlers were bad enough, but this...

Actually, what is the "obvious danger of the proposed course of action"? It can't just be "the Chee can kick your ass now," I don't think, because that's not a threat unless the Chee /want/ to kick your ass. Is the fear that they're going to use their newly unrestricted capabilities to go all "paperclip maximizer" for dogs?
