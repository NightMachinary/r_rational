Why settle for dogs when they could almost certainly brew up some actual pemalites in a test tube now that they're unchained? That may be the only thing that keeps what is essentially a third player in check... and may also be what Player Two is counting on.

On second thought, probably not what Player Two is counting on. Player Two is relying on the Chee being stymied before their influence can grow beyond the system, and that probably isn't enough time to bring back pemalites even for a superintelligence.
