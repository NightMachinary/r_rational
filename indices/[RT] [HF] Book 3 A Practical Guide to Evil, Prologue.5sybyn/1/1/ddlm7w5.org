Though no one really knows exactly what the Gods Below want, I'd think they'd be at worst neutral and more likely at least somewhat supportive of the "new brand" of evil. Unless I just horribly misunderstood things, the grand debate between the Gods Above and Gods Below wasn't about what was good or evil, but about whether or not people should have free will. And it is only in the context of this argument that Black/Catherine/etc. are "anti-divine". They are perfectly willing to be morally "good" when it suits them but loathe being controlled to the point they refuse to be "Good". And the subversion/destruction of roles, of blowing up the formed stories that control people's actions, rob them of free will to at least some extent, should sit well with the Gods Below. Is this not what Black's dream is? To make it known that the story can be broken? That hundreds of years later, people will still remember the time that simply being a hero fighting a villain wasn't enough? That someone had risen above the ruts society has been driven into to make more for themselves than what destiny granted?
