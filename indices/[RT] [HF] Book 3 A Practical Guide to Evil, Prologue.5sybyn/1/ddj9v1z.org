An ever growing possibility is that Squire and her supporters, and possibly the calamities , are going to end up as the anti-divine-game faction. As evidence I point out: Masego's ambition, a new kind of evil in Praes which judging by the Tyrants statements in this chapter is not to the gods below's liking, the involment of the keeper of stories whose title and abilities suggest that she's there to keep the story (which seems to be the meat of the gods' "game"). With all of this I can't help but think that there's a significant possibilty that a lot of characters will go this route or at least be involved with it in some way.
