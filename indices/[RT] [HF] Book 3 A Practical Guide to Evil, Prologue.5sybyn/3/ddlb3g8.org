That's an interesting point about demons and angels operating in creation with different constraints. I wonder if we'll find out more about those differences in this book. Given where Heiress is holed up, I'm pretty sure we will.

I agree with your second point. Apprentice is going to discover some important laws that he and Catherine will exploit the hell out of.
