On possible power ups:

1. I don't think that any sort of fate gaming is going to work since IRC, demons are exempt so I'd wager that god's are too -- even if angels aren't.
2. A possible angle seems to be the fundamental laws, particularly because the gods to humans, thing is possibly implied to be similar to humans to their own creation, creations which I would think could go out of control and maul them horribly.

As for the name the game breakers works, though we could be silly and go for an acronym like the ADGF.
