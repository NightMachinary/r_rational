Graphene is not only very far from anything you can call "cheap", it's also incredibly hard to mass-produce and hard to work with. Because it's so incredibly thin, it loses its cool properties even when you lay it on a perfectly smooth silicon surface.

Until its price point and versatility improve by a couple of magnitudes, this is just a novelty finding.
