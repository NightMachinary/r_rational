I did say probably. There are several levels of motivational speaking as well. The skills required to speak motivationally to six-year-olds is different from what one would use to speak to career-established engineers. Something that would bore me to tears might be thrilling to a high energy physicist. Just explaining what you did, and how you did it could be enough for the right crowd.
