You're right, I had not considered the implication that having discovered this technology I must logically have a significant amount of knowledge not available to my current self. I had previously assumed a blueprints falling into my lap scenario. I still don't think I could justify putting limits on access to such a game changing technology, we're talking lives saved on a massive scale. There is no reason however I shouldn't make very clear my own role in this technology's development which has to be worth at least an exceptionally high paying job in a field I'm implicitly quite gifted in.
