Basically this. I'm not particularly interested in money, though of course having more to donate would not be a bad thing. I'd do some thinking first and ask suitably smart and trustworthy people, but it feels like giving it to a single actor, corporation or whatnot, is probably not going to be very efficient at improving the quality of life of as many people as possible.

In addition, in a case where something like this is discovered, I am highly more likely to be one of the people who don't discover it rather than the one who does, and so in that position I would most likely wish for whoever is in the position to make this decision to choose to open source it.
