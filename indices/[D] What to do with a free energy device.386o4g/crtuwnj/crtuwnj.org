  The first generation of the technology puts out 0.25 watts/m^{3.}

For comparison, a solar panel (1m^{2,} 20% efficient, in Colorado) can produce enough to power a 50 watt lightbulb 24 hours/day 365 days/year, which provides a useful floor to how good the free energy machine has to be before it gets used for things.

  You expect that further research and development will exponentially increase the power output per volume until some unknown, far-off conceptual limit is hit, similar to the development of faster and more information-dense computers.

Let's say that it follows Moore's Law exactly, and doubles every 18 months. It will take quite a while to be valuable as a product instead of as a technology. In three years, it will reach 1W/m^{3.} In another 9 years, it will reach 64W/m^{3,} still well below a solar panel + battery in a sunny climate, but kind of useful. Another 7.5 years will have it at 1kW/m^{3,} and finally reaching the level of solar power for power density (assuming 1 m^{3} = 20 m^{2).} Almost 20 years after discovery, it finally has widespread commercial uses.

Another 6 years, and it can beat gasoline generators (16kW/m^{3),} and then it can beat practically anything soon after that.
