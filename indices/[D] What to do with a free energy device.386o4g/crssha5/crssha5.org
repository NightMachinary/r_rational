Much like DCarrier, I patent it in the United States only, reserve the right to distribute one license per year after the third year for free, and sell it. If the sales price is ludicrous, I start donating part of my income stream to charity.

Patenting it in the US only and reserving the right to donate one license per year after the third year will make sure the patent doesn't get bought and buried.
