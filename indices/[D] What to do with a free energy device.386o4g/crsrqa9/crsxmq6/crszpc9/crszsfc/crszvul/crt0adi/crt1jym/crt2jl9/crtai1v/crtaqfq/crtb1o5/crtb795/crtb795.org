Because I was under the impression you were arguing from a position where you thought patents were worth anything since again you were arguing in a thread whose premise was that patents were valuable.

At no point during your initial points (which is where it would be reasonable to include such a diverged premise) did you even remotely mention that.

Edit: For reference I still maintain that in a patent respected environment a bid for a patent that allows for costless production of something will be bought out by a company that is a shell for the interests of those who wouldn't want another highest bidder to undercut them, this shell will be jointly owned so and would obviously need a board vote to license their only asset (the patent), and so locking the patent away.
