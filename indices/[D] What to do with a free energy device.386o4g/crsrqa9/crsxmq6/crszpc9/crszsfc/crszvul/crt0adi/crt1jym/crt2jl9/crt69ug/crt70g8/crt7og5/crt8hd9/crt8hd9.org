Hold on, he starts being rude to me and you jump on my back about being rude to him? (Did you PM him and respond to me publicly, or did you only reply to me?) I totally agree that I thought this was a community of friendly people, but if people are willing to start low blows I don't have any issue with responding in kind.

Also it's a real stretch to go from having insulting language to being like the YouTube comment section. If YouTube comments were like any other discourse except that they were all shaded by a negative tone they would be 1000% better than they are.
