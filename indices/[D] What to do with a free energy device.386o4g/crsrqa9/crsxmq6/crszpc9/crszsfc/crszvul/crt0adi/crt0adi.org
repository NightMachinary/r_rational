Obviously they would sell the energy, clearly I have to make this clearer for you.

Let's go with your scenario where they all buy access to the patent, they then compete with each other and since it's free money it's a race to the bottom. Soon the companies will be "hey if you join with us you get free power also we have a theme park" , where you don't even try to sell the power but have it as a loss leader. EDIT: THIS MEANS THEY'RE MAKING LESS MONEY THAN BEFORE

The alternative is that the market leader would buy this license only for themselves, in which case they would undercut all competition and supply power to the world for huge profits. This is called a monopoly.

Obviously the rest of the power companies don't want that which is why they conglomerate against the market leader to buy the license and then not use it.
