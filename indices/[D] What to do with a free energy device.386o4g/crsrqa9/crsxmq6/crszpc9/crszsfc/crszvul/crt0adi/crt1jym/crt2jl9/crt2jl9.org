  It's conspiracy-theory levels of insane to say they wouldn't, as it would give them an enormous leg up on both the market leader and their fellow colluders.

You are so dumb it's unreal.

If the company decides to use the patent (which the group of companies will only buy in a way that makes it illegal to use for any of them, eg buying a company that they all share ownership in that owns the patent, denying any of them license or access to it), then the other companies will do it too.

This will cause the issue that I literally just explained where if a product that you sell is now free to produce then you can't profit from the sale of that product unless you are the only person who can sell it for free.

Which as I said is the monopoly position which is what the other companies would band together TO STOP not TO LET ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS DO IT??!??!

HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY ARRIVE AT THAT CONCLUSION

Also you need to reread redditque.
