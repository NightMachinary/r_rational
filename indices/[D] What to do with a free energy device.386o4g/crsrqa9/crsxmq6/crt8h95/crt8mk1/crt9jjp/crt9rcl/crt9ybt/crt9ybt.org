  Can you use an improvement that relies on earlier patents?

Yes, as long as the change is big enough to patent in and of itself. If someone patented the transistor, someone else can patent the microchip. If you want to produce a microchip, you'd now need permission from both of them. And when the transistor patent runs out, the microchip patent is still good.
