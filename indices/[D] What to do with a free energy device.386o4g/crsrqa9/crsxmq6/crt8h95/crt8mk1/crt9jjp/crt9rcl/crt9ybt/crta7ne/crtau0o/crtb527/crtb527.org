If you can create an improvement of your device that doesn't impeach the original patent then your patent isn't worth very much.

Since the product itself isn't great initially (as in the OP this will have an affect on the components market when you produce enough energy to bother) in terms of raw energy production there's no reason to switch to the product when you could use an improved version.
