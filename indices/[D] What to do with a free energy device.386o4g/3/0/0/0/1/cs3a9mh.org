I /love/ my pocket-sized supercomputer.

And I'm sure we'll find a use for all that energy. I bet there are lots of potential useful household products that aren't common because they're not energy cost-effective. First, I'd stop setting my thermostat to "tolerable" and instead put it on "ideal". Then I'll take my ~$60 energy bill per month and give it to charity. Then I'd get an oven that preheats more rapidly, or maybe just stays at 375 all the time. Then I'd enter my house in a Tacky Light Show competition.

And one day, when they get really tiny, I'll use it to power my /laptop/.
