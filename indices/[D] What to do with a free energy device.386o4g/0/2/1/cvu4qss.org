Look into Dr. Greer - his organization currently has a $100K for whoever can produce a working prototype of such a device, but their stipulation is that the donor of such a device cannot bring it forth for patent or license. It has to be simply for the good of humanity. This is supposedly because they have already seen many such devices but the inventors have either been bought off or bumped off, before they could reproduce their tech.
