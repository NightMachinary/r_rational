I would like to point out that you were smart enough to come up with the idea. That makes me think that you might be smart enough to come up with other ideas. Failing that, you're probably smart enough to go on a motivational speaking circuit to encourage others to do what you did. Becoming wealthy would allow you to use your brains or your experience to encourage the development of others, even if you never have another good idea again.
