  First of all, you're assuming that the companies care about the patent.

Uh, no the original post assumed this, and I continued from this premise. I don't think the patent is worth much of anything.

  Moving on, now that we know that companies can dodge the patent by either producing new and more efficient designs, or simply not caring about the patent at all...

I'm not responding to this paragraph because I agree with it all, the premise that the patent matters in this scenario was taken from being able to sell the patent to the highest bidder. No one would buy a patent that isn't worth anything.

My principle argument relies on companies obeying patent law and so completely collapses without it. There is no reasons for a cabal of companies to buy a patent to be unused if people will use the patent regardless, indeed that should have been so incredibly apparent by the fact that I was replying to a guy who was explicitly selling the patent that I wonder why you didn't just respond with this point in the first place.

As it is I agree with everything you've said a lack of business confidence in the global patent system would devalue the concept and so the original concept to sell it would result in pittances. If anything.

Edit: I don't know what you changed in your edit but as far as I'm aware I don't believe in any major conspiracy theories that rely on mutually destructive behaviour that is also against human psychology, the only conspiracy theory that comes to mind is the Enron conspiracy which I think everyone knows was a conspiracy, pretty much the most major one I can think of.
