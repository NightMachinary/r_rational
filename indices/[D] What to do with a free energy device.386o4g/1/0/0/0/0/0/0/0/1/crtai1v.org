Let me comprehensively explain to you why you're wrong, then.

First of all, you're assuming that the companies care about the patent. Even if they did, however, it is only the original design that is patented, or otherwise the entire mechanism that enables free energy would have to be officially publicized in the patent. So either the mechanism leaks out some other way, the mechanism itself is not what is patented, or the colluding companies don't care about the patent in the first place. The first option is not plausible (in the real world, at least, as we would see evidence of this) since that would result in the cabal losing their monopoly on the free energy mechanism. (and note that filing a suit related to the patent will result in the details of the mechanism being released to the public, or otherwise the mechanism itself wouldn't be protected at all) Moving on, now that we know that companies can dodge the patent by either producing new and more efficient designs, or simply not caring about the patent at all...

Having a usable design will inevitably result in one or more of the companies using it. This is a collapse to a more stable equilibrium than before, as companies both have means and motive to use the technology: outcompeting all of their competitors, including the companies they're colluding with, and gaining massive profits from the massive drop in costs. Since their partners are defecting, there are two options for the cooperating members of the cabal: either defect themselves, and gain as much profit as possible from the race to the bottom that will follow, or punish the defectors, by racing to the bottom even faster. Except wait, they can't punish the defectors, because any revenues that are non-zero will result in profits anyway. So the result of /any/ defection will either be not keeping up with the race to the bottom, and being outcompeted even in the short run, racing to the bottom via defecting, or racing to the bottom via punishment. And at that point the government becomes very suspicious as to the origin of this energy and would then investigate, but only after some /very/ interesting market activity.

The "issue" that you literally just explained, "where if a product that you sell is now free to produce then you can't profit from the sale of that product unless you are the only person who can sell it for free," is exactly right. Energy will collapse as an industry as a result of the device becoming available to more than one company, and it would probably collapse even when available to /only/ one company, simply because it's so hard to keep a secret. That is the Nash equilibrium. And simply put, I say it is conspiracy-theory levels of insane because that is /exactly/ what several major conspiracy theories are about, and if I were being less charitable I would assume you yourself held to them, considering your position in this argument.
