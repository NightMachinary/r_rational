I don't think it being patented would stop them doing R&D, the importance is whether they could sell their own products of R&D right? Since patents are rights for production of products they don't need to produce it to do lots of theoretical R&D, in that it's a possibility they could come up with a product that is different enough it doesn't infringe.

Probably be better for you not to tell anyone about it until you yourself have improved it dramatically.
