0.25W/mÂ³ really isn't that great. In comparison, 0.25W can be produced with a $2 solar panel. This thing is obviously too weak to have any real-world benefits. To tap that exponential potential, it wouldn't be sufficient to put it on Youtube or something - there's too many posts that scream "free energy"; your invention wouldn't be noticed.

I also don't think that a patent wouldn't be useful for anything. It would also be too expensive for me to build.

So, I'd convince my wife to help me flesh out the theoretical physics, and visit the local university with the draft of a theoretical paper. With their help, I'd get it published in a small but good Physics journal. No proposed applications, just theory. No need to get the press interested. The electricity industry doesn't have to know about this invention until it's ready to disrupt it.
