I swear I read a short story on this subject that I was going to post here for people to read, but I can't find it. It was about someone who found a book called "you will never die", and he met an old man (?) in a book store who was telling him all about quantum immortality (actually, I feel like the viewpoint character was a woman, but that could just be because I'm a woman and the viewpoint character was bland).

It felt like it was written in the 70s but I'm not sure if that's true or not. I read it probably about 10 years ago, and almost certainly on the internet (though I have read paperback anthologies on very rare occasions).

FWIW, I recall not finding it terribly good (watch it turn out to be a Heinlein masterpiece...) and I'm not even sure if I finished it as I don't remember what the punchline was.
