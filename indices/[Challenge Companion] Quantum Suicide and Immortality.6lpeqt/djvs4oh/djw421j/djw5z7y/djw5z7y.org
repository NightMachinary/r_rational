I did google it, but I think I have the worst google luck in history because I never seem to be able to find stuff like that by googling it. (Seriously, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/ixd2m/book_crashed_spaceship_becomes_friends_with_an/][in this thread]] years ago, I even knew the book's title and the names of a few characters, and still didn't manage to find it!)

Looking at your link, I'm 99% sure that's the right one. My heartiest congratulations for finding it!
