Have you tried googling it? Because I didn't even know the story, and I found it on the first page for "book called you will never die". [[http://www.tor.com/2010/08/05/divided-by-infinity/][Here it is]]. Unless it's a different story about a character being given a book titled /You Will Never Die/.
