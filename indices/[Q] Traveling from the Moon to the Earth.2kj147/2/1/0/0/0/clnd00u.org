I haven't yet looked into the consistencies of bodily fluids and how you can extract anything from it. But dependent on your answer you either have infinite liquids or at the very least can lower your own weight considerably, both of which make the whole endeavor a tad easier. And in the best case scenario you have infinite indestructible materials. Building a small vessel out of guts and coagulated blood would make the required fuel to launch much less. And I'm sure /something/ in our body can be used as fuel as long as we find a way to produce oxygen from the water.

But mostly these questions are there to give ideas to the more scientifically literate than me. And to refine the questions [[/u/capsless]] already stated.
