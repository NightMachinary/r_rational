  the maximum speed at which the edge (the boulders) of something spinning can stay intact is equal to the square-root of its specific tensile strength

Isn't this only if you have a solid bar extending from the center to the edge, such as for building a centrifuge?

It's probably far too much acceleration anyways, but let's find out. A calculator says that the system reaches accelerations of about 40 000 g, and let's call the ultimate tensile strength of meteoric iron 200 MPa (the same as cast iron), with a density of 8 g/cm^{3.} 200 MPa means it can hold against 20kN per cm^{2.} At our acceleration, 50g exerts 20kN of force due to the acceleration. A 1cm square piece of iron is about 6cm long when it weighs 50g, so that's the max thickness of a piece of iron before it rips itself off.

It's still too much force to work as I described it, but it's possible with some minor modifications.
