i have no idea whether the energy is sufficient, but i do know that it's impossible for the rocks to stay intact (!!!) at those speeds. the maximum speed at which the edge (the boulders) of something spinning can stay intact is equal to the square-root of its specific tensile strength; for impure iron, this is ~ 200 m/s. with tight enough hair weave it's certainly possible to keep them in place for a few seconds, but eight thousand years is out of the picture.
