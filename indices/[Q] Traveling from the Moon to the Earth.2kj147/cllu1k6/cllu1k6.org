Polish moonrocks on my immortal butt to make a huge parabolic solar concentrator to melt stone with. Since I'm invincible, I can just melt stone and shape it in my hands to make containers.

Apparently there is a fair amount of iron on the moon as free metal (if mostly as tiny grains). Into the solar death ray with you!

There's also water on the moon, as ice. So a steel rocket powered by O-H seems like a good goal to aim for. But there are so many intermediate technical challenges.

Alternately, maybe I could use the iron to make absolutely monster-sized capacitor banks, and charge them up by, you guessed it, rubbing my immortal butt. ("Dear Randall Munroe. How long does it take to charge up a 20 MWh capacitor bank by static electricity using only your butt and a metal plate?") Then take a quick railgun ride to earth and I'm done.
