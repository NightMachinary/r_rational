I'm not sure if this could actually work or not, but here goes:

First, exercise and get into at least as good of shape as the best pro athletes.

Next, dig a hole through the center of the moon, to give yourself a good runway.

Lastly, gather a large amount of baseball-sized rocks, bind them together (somehow) and get the entire thing falling back and forth through the hole (with no air resistance, it shouldn't stop).

During one of the passes next to an entrance, hop onto the back of the conglomerate boulder, and throw a rock as hard as you can backwards, increasing your velocity a tiny bit.

Repeat as needed, making sure not to block off the borehole in the process.

With any luck, you have transferred enough kinetic energy to yourself (and a small fraction of the remaining rocks) to escape the moon's gravity. Then it is a simple matter of forcing your orbit to degrade into the Earth's atmosphere.
