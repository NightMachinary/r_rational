the problem with digging through the center is that you've got pretty insane pressures. while you don't have to deal with gravity at the point you're digging, you do have to worry about the gravity effecting every /other/ point -- that is, pressures of > millions of pascals. and part of the stuff you have to dig through is /liquid/.

idk if its possible (probably, given enough time) but it'd certainly require materials that aren't available.
