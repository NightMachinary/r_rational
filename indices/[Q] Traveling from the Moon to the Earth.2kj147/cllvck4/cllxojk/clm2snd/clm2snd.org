2600m/s is actually a little too much. the gravitational potential of a 50kg object on the surface of the moon is something like -141MJ; adding energy from the "maneuver" (which is close to impulse, so we don't have to worry about gravity drag) leaves roughly 28MJ at arbitrary distance from the moon. transfer that to velocity and you get ~1062m/s; since the speed of the moon at apogee is (iirc) 999.6 m/s, that's more than enough to get to earth.

on friction: normal force is a reaction to any (contact) force, not just gravity. this means that centripetal force (which is obviously pretty extreme at the peak of the arc) also contributes to friction and such. not only that, but rock simply doesn't have the tensile strength to stay intact at rotational speeds of more than a few hundred m/s, so you'll need to use invincible materials (hair) for the last leg of the contraption.

still doable.
