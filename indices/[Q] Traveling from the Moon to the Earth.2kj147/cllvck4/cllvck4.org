y'all're scrubs. i, too, spent like twenty minutes trying to figure out how to split minerals without any chemically reactive compounds, or how to transform the energy from a giant solar array into explosives -- but actually, there's a far simpler solution. you only need to apply, at apogee, something like 2600m/s of dv (to a small projectile, too); why bother with anything fancy? a giant trebuchet ought to do the trick. sure, it'll be a hell of an engineering nightmare, especially since you're working with materials that are flimsy and dense, but it shouldn't take more than a few decades.

also possible: predicting meteor strikes, positioning self so that you will be struck mostly upwards by the resulting explosion. from cursory research, impacts of that size happen every few millenia.

i will do the requisite calculations in the morning. in the meantime, if you can clarify a few things i'd deeply appreciate it:

-can you self-modify? to what degree? what's the mechanism of the invunerability?

-can things that are a part of your body leave your body? do those parts also remain in your body? (eg, can you produce saliva indefinitely, can you use blood and so on)

-does "current science" extend to trivia? do you have, say, a topographical map of the moon?

-what time are you placed on the moon? at formation, nowish, or something else?

-what happens to material that enters/exits your body?
