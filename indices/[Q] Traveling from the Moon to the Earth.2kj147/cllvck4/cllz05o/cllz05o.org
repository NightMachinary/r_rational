1) Hadn't thought about it, but if you can do it with just moon materials and modern science/tech, I don't see why not. The invulnerability is mostly so you can survive in vacuum and Earth reentry, so if I had to explicitly define it, you cannot get hurt if you don't wish it. As for biological functions, you are magically kept alive with "life force".

2) I feel like it's against the spirit of the thought experiment to use yourself as unlimited raw materials. You're probably not consuming any water or nutrients, so you'd be limited to however much raw material is in your person at t=0, and no more than that (with the caveat that you don't cripple yourself from draining all of your blood or whatever.)

3) Yes, you know everything about the moon that is currently known.

4) Now-ish.

5) It stays in existence.
