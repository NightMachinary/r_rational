Okay, I think I have one that would work now.

First, collect two rocks made of the strongest material you can find (iron meteorites are a good candidate).

Make sure that they are the same mass (ideally ~20kg), and drill a hole through each of them.

Next, wait for about 10 years. In this time, your (indestructible) hair will grow to about 2m in length.

Separate your hair in half, left and right. Loop the left half through the hole in one rock, and tie the end securely to your left arm. Loop the right half through the hole in the other rock, and tie the end to your right arm, making sure that you can later untie it.

Stand on top of a mountain, and start spinning clockwise like a top. You've had time to practice, so I'm assuming you match the human record of 300 rpm. Each 20kg rock is traveling 5 full revolutions around a 1m radius circle per second, for a speed of ~30m/s, and it has 600 kgm/s of momentum.

We need about 240 000 kgm/s, to escape with 100 kg of yourself + one of the rocks, which translates into a 20 kg mass at 12km/s. This is equal to traveling around a 400m radius circle at 300 rpm.

Keep spinning for 8000 years, maintaining the same rotation speed. You will need to constantly add small amounts of energy to the system as your hair grows and the rocks get further away (and their speed increases). You are now spinning two rocks, each 400m away from you.

Wait until you are facing Earth, and then untie your left hand rock. It will slip off your hair and fly away from the earth at 12km/s, carrying 1.44 * 10^{9} J of kinetic energy, about the same as 1/3 of a ton of TNT. Your right hand rock, with nothing counterbalancing it, will try to go straight at the earth, yanking you along for the ride. This should be enough to break lunar orbit and eventually crash to earth.
