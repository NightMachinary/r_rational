dig a pit next to a cliff, and make rope out of hair. tie the rope to a big weight near the cliff and polish the contact surfaces of your pit and where the rope will slide. make sure to have a release knot so the rock doesn't drag you to the bottom of the cliff. stand at the bottom of the hole release the counterweight and fling yourself to earth.
