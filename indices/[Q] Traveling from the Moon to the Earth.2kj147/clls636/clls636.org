That's a tough one. I'm actually not sure that it's even possible. The escape velocity of the Moon is 2.4 km/s. We have no real fuels - no trees, no organic matter, nothing that we can really burn, and no oxygen to burn anything anyway. That also means that refining metals is going to be nearly impossible.

The best bet is probably to dig down to the molten core and use that energy somehow, but it seems like even if you were invincible you'd run the risk of a tunnel collapse and getting trapped miles below the surface until the sun burns out.
