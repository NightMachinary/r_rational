  Being able to heal back a spirit web seems potentially useful. Can they tap a goldmind while someone is doing hemalurgy to them to increase survivability? Or would that prevent hemalurgy from working at all?
#+end_quote

We don't know what it is about hemalurgy that actually kills you except that it's not just physical trauma (though the physical trauma would typically be enough to kill you anyway), so no clue.

  From that link it seems that the only thing they can't potentially heal is having their gold feruchemy spiked out?
#+end_quote

There's no reason you couldn't just insert the spike back into the feruchemist and have them heal the damage before removing the spike again. Other than that, if they are a gold compounder their previously created metalminds are still keyed to them, so they should be able to burn them for a burst of healing power.
