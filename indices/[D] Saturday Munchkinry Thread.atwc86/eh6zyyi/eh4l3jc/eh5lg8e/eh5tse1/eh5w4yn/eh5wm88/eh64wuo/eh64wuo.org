Being able to heal back a spirit web seems potentially useful. Can they tap a goldmind while someone is doing hemalurgy to them to increase survivability? Or would that prevent hemalurgy from working at all?

From that link it seems that the only thing they can't potentially heal is having their gold feruchemy spiked out?
