You have the ability to create and instantly move a 4m diameter spherical area, within 30m of your center of mass, that has the following effects.

1) You can control the direction of the force of weight inside the area. If the stuff inside the ares experiences a force of 10N towards the ground due to gravity you could make it so those 10N of force were pointed upward or any direction you like. (EDIT:The direciton change has to be constant though out the whole area)

2) You can slectively make objects the area intangible to gas and liquid as well as solid items that fit into a 2cm in diameter area. A object is anything you mentally consider a single item or being that is completely inside your area. You cannot cause an object to become intangible to the liquids or gases that make it up. You can't stop people from breathing with this for example. If a object (EDIT: changed person to object) loses intangibility the matter inside it is safely displaced.

3) You have a mental list of objects in the area and know where their center of mass is.

4) The area, when viewed with biological eyes has a slight purple tint. Otherwise it is invisible.

In addition to this you have enough durability to survive a fall from terminal velocity with little injury and instinctive knack for 3d spatial movement.

How would you use this in the real world to benefit humanity.

Or

How would you use this in a super hero style setting as a hero or villan.
