Great idea! Now go convince others to pick the ability you think they should pick instead of whatever they had in mind.

The power to copy powers would have too much raw power to be approved if there are no strings attached. Maybe if you slap on a condition that's somewhat difficult to achieve before you can copy it(like having to kill/research them first).
