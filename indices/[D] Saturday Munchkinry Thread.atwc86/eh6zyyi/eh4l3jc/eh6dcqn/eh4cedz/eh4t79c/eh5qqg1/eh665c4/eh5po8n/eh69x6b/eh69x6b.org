The power to know what powers people should pick in order to achieve your goal seems like the obvious one. Failing in that, something to boost effective intelligence (slow down perception of time, talk to alternate universes versions of yourself, be able to send messages to the past) so you can better instruct people on what powers to pick.

I think the ability to copy powers would also work. It technically fits the criteria of not being able to take over the world without any other powers because it's worthless without people copy from.
