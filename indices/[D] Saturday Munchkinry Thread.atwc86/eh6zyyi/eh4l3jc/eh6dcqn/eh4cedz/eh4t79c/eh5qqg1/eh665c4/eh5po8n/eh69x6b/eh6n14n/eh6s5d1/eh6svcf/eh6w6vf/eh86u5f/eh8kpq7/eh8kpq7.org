I think your right about that. I have been thinking that I would have the same bonds of as trust I do with those close to me, with other versions of myself, but I have no evidence for that. I have never had the opportunity to betray myself before and so have never built up any trust. Even now I am planing how to mind cotrol or power steal from the rest of the group and each of the me's would probable be doing the same.

I think the first option where I get people I do trust to do the power combo might be the better option.
