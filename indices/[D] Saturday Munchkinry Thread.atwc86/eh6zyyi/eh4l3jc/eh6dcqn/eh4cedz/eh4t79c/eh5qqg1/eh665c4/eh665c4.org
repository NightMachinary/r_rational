What 'productive' means in the context of this future is important. Clearly raw labour (i.e. mindless, repetitive tasks) are not what they want - rather, it seems they're interested in creative labour, i.e. imagination.

So. On that basis, here's my first idea for a power:

The ability to turn into any fictional character, with full access to the powers and abilities of that character, up to an energy limit.

Caveats:

- A 'fictional character' is defined as a character whose name, abilities, and identity are known to at least ten thousand humans, but who is not and never was a genuine person (example: Harry Potter, Superman) The fictional character's abilities are to be taken as the average, as known by every who knows of the character.
- The energy limit may reduce the abilities of the character; however, those abilities are still there, albeit in a reduced form. If I turn into Superman, then I still can't lift the Empire State Building, but I can still fly, juggle anvils, and travel through space. (I just have to avoid anything that glows green, and krypton gas).

The second caveat should take care of balance (though my ability to swiftly /change/ my power set is incredibly useful - even there, the requirement that ten thousand people must know of the character limits a number of abuses (though, with sufficient planning time, I can probably get an arbitrary character published and widely read)). As far as creative talent goes, such a power multi-set will reward creativity; it can certainly be used for good or evil (I could be Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader); and I imagine that it will be most entertaining to watch.
