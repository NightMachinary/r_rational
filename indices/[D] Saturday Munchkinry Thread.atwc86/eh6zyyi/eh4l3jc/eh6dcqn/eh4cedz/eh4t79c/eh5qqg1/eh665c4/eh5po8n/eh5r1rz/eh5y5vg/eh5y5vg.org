It depends on whether the reviewers judges the choice of power based on the 4 criteria you had given or whether something else plays in. Criteria 1 is very specific in that raw munchkinery cap is only defined for a world without supers.

I was also treating the aliens as an unknown entity that bestows power rather than actual people and so didn't consider your suggestion. I would add that rather than figuring out what the aliens want I would figure out what the reviewer specifically wants to get things past him.

Aside from powers that only works by interacting with other powers and thus can go arbitrarily high in munchkinnery(such as copying, changing, stealing powers etc.) I would probably go with a power that can create permanent self-sustaining magical/superadvanced stuff, since the allows me to get around the 1 megawatt cap and constantly increase my overall power.

Edit: Similar to that would be the ability to instantly comprehend with perfect recollection the knowledge stored in any knowledge container(including paper, electronic and biological). With a little cleverness you can get the knowledge of alien technology and such. It's an interesting power in stories because it requires the character to do stuff for their power to be useful.
