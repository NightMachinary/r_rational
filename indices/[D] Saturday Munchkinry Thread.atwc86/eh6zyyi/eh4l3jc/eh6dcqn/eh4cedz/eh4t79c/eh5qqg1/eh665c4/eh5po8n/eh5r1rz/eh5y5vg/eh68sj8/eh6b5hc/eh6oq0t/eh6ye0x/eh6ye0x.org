I mean, only taking the information from the reviewer probably won't reveal critical technology information. But chances are that there are trivia that alien people are taught in elementary schools that would revolutionize science. Or that the alien knows of a way to stay on the ship. Or knows how to touch an alien guard that knows how to fight aliens whose knowlege you can assimilate. Or a way to tap into some fundemental previously unknown force. Or a way to create a 'I'm lost in space-please save me' beacon that another group of traveling aliens can respond to, get you on board and let them talk whatever devices they have on ship. Or just touch the reviewers wrist, if they have like an advanced on their wrist like we have with the watch computers.

Or just pile a bunch of ebooks on your PC and become an instant expert in all things science and combine your knowledge.
