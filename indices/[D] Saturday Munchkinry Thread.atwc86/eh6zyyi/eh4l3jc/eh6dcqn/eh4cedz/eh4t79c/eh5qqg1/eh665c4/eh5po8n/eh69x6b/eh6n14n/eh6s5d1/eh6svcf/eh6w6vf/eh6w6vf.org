The way I see it this is a race between all of humanity to get the power combo that let's you rule the world. Time travel is a simple, single person power that would let me get a head start in that race. I could gather those I trust the most, plan out what powers we should pick and how to combo them, before the aliens even show up.

What I was thinking was a time travel power that created another me. So I would travel back in time and tell past me what was about to happen. They would pick the power to use the power of anyone they are currently touching and use that to travel back in time createing yet another me who can choose another power. I don't know if the aliens would allow that though.
