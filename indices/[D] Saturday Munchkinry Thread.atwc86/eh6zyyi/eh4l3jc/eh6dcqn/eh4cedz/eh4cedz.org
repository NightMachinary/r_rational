The Earth is contacted by aliens. They're very advanced compared to humans and offers to uplift us. But they decide to first give human superpowers for a 'trial period' of 50 years to see what humans will do with it to simulate the culture shock of suddenly being able to do things beyond their imagination. They will uplift everyone after 50 years is up regardless, but do mention that labor is still useful for them. Your goal is to get as many human to be productive for their eventual new society as possible.

The rules to superpowers are as follows:

One power can be gained by designing it, then contacting an alien reviewer for review at any point during a person's life. You only need to think about it start a session. You can have any number of sessions with the reviewer to discuss your power before it is accepted as long as you have free time. You gain intuitive command of the power you earned.

The reviewer prioritizes, in descending order:

1. Being balanced. This includes raw power and maximum munchkinry potential. For raw power, the general upper limit is 1 megawatt, although if you make significant enough drawbacks or rate highly in other categories you can get more. Non-energy dependent powers get reviewed case-by-case. For munchkinry, the rule is if you can achieve world domination with this power in an Earth without other powers then it's not allowed.

2. Searching for talent. If your designed power can put into question how productive the user and other people will be when they are uplifted then it is more likely to be accepted. A Green Lantern ring ripoff is more likely to be accepted than plain super strength.

3. Judging morality. If you can demonstrate the power have both good and evil applications then it is more likely to be accepted(using values of 2019 average human with secondary education or above). An instadeath power can be used to murder as the obviously evil application and destruction of diseased cells as a good application.

4. Entertainment. A power that can evoke humanlike joy for the reviewer is more likely to be accepted. Capped-power toon physics is an example.

Your goal is to maximize the number of humans that is productive for the new society by finding out what qualities they need and maximize the number of humans that satisfy those criteria.
