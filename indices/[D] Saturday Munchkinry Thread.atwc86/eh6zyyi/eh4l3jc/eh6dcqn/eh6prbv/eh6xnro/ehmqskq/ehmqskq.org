I had a similar power in mind:

- You can move an object within two inches of the surface of your skin provided it is entirely within that range to any other space within said range.

- No additional ability to remember what objects are in range or where but if you concentrate on an object and where you remember it should be you can get a "lock" on where it is.

- objects in motion stay in motion, objects at rest stay at rest. You cannot change, with the ability, the direction of motion. Meaning you cannot drop a ball bearing from your shoulders to your lower back over and over (vertically) until terminal velocity and then shoot it from your hand at a 90 degree angle (horizontally) away from you.
