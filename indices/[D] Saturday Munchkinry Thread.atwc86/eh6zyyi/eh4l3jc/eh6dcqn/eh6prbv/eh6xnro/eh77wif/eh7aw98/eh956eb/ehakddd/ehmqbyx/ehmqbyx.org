It had its moments, great and bad. The worst, in my opinion, was the ending. Like the author decided "this is the end, I can make it as stupid as I want now since I don't have to justify anything." An then *SPOILERS* Hermione comes back from the dead empowered by unicorn and other items making her super strong, capable of flight or levitation, and have perfect hair. Once she (quickly) acclimates to this new state, She (or Harry, I forget) wonders aloud about being given a rocket launcher to fight baddies or trolls.
