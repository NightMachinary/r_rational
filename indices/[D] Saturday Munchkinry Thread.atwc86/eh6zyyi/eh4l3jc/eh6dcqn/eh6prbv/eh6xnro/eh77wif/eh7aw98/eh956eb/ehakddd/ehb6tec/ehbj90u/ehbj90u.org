I think part of my confusion here is that the formulation "make an area intangible to =X=" is not one that I have experienced before, especially where the given =X= is not a sentient being.

Can you, without using the word "intangible", please explain how this power would be used on an object, what the effects on the object would be, and how the object would subsequently interact with gases, liquids, and things smaller than a 2cm sphere?
