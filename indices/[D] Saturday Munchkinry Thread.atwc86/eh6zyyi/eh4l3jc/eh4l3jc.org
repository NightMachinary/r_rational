*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 11: Gold*

Ok, week ten of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 10 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/][7]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ak1kjr/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ef0o7jj/][8]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ametuf/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eflf195/][9]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ar9jrc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eglnl2s/][10]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This week we have gold, the first of the temporal metals. As always we're interested in what a gold twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, gold is perhaps the strangest of the 16 metals. When burning gold you experience a vivid halucination in which you interact with another version of yourself called a gold shadow. The gold shadow is a version of you that you would have been if certain major events or decisions in your life had gone differently. For as long as you keep burning gold you are inhabiting both your mind and that of the gold shadow; You see the shadow through your eyes and yourself through the shadows eyes, you know both sets of personalities and experience both your reaction to what kind of person the shadow has become and the shadows reaction to the kind of person you have become.

You become aware of the personality of the shadow and acquire a very vague notion of the general path through life they took, but you don't gain any specific knowledge that the gold shadow would have obtained. You can't, say, ask a version of you that broke up with your boyfriend/girlfriend what person they ended up dating (though you will know whether they ended up with someone else) or ask a version of you that went on to study physics to help you out on a physics problem you are struggling with.

You also do not have any control over which gold shadow you get to see when you start burning gold. The branching point in your life is selected randomly from all the moments where your life could have taken a different turn, but it is heavily weighted towards events and decision points that were meaningful to you.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, gold stores health. When storing health, the feruchemist stops healing from injuries, their immune system takes a nosedive and they start feeling generally crappy. When tapping the resulting metalmind, the feruchemist ability to recover from injuries is increased spectacularly.

As long as a feruchemist has sufficient health stored and any part of their body is still touching the goldmind, they can survive just about any physical injury. We've seen gold feruchemists that were impaled, set on fire, decapitated and had a stick of dynamite explode in their hands without suffering any lasting damage. One gold compounder even routinely fires a shotgun at his own face to demonstrate his healing ability.

It's worth noting that that this ability does not provide any increased pain tolerance beyond what the feruchemist builds up naturally through repeatedly surviving injuries that would kill a normal person (gold feruchemists have a tendency to get hurt a lot).

Feruchemic gold always heals a person back to their Spiritual Ideal, this is a sort of metaphysical blueprint of what that person is supposed to look like. Your spiritual ideal is build up as you go through life and is largely based on how you subconsiously view yourself. For instance, if you tap a goldmind right after getting a tattoo, the magic will force the ink out of your skin, but if you've had the tattoo for a while and you've come to internalize it as part of your body the magic will leave it untouched (and will even heal it back if the arm gets severed). Similarly, if two gold feruchemists lost an arm early in life, before they knew their powers and one has accepted and internalized the injury as part of who they are and for the other it remains a constant struggle, then once they get familiar with their abilities the latter will be able to heal back their arm while the former will not. Also, as an interesting side effect, transgender feruchemists that tap enough health will find that their bodies slowly start to transform to match their preferred gender.

Another notable thing here is that your spiritual ideal ages, which means this is on of the rare cases where magical healing does not automatically translate to immortality. You still can't really die as long as you have enough health stored up, but as age related damage starts adding up, "enough health" becomes infeasible even with compounding.

Please keep in mind for any munchkinry that involves hacking your spiritual ideal that people can't just wilfully start to believe things they know are untrue. If you're 40 years old, you can't just decide to believe that you are 20 years old. True, people are pretty good at self-deception, but spiritual ideals don't care about what you profess to believe, what you tell yourself you believe or even what you believe you believe, it cares about how you actually, deep down, view yourself. Self deception at that level, if it is even possible, is very difficult to achieve intentionally.
