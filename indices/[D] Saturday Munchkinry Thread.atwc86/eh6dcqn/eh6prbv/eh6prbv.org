For starters, I could be a reactionless drive. Point the gravity mass in front of me away from me and behind me into me. Go on space exploration.

I can also attempt nuclear fusion by pointing deuterium and tritium into their own center of mass then phase them into each other. That should accelerate research on those fields. Make loads of money and be a philanthropist.
