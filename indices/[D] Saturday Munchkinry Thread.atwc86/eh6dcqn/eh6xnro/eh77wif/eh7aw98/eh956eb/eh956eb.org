I stoped reading HPMOR after Quirrell shows Harry that spell that let's him see space. It's a shame too becuse I found the book really interesting but I just wasn't enjoying it as a story.

  A single atom has no state; it is not gas, air, or solid. Those states of matter are defined by the relationship of the atom to other atoms.

If you were to see the world that way, wouldn't you just not be able to activate the intangibility since the things you can make intangible don't actually exist.
