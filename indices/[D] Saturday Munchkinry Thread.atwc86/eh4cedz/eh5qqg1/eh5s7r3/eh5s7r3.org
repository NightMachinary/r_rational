The goal is part of the prompt.

And no, human labor don't really matter to them, (they can supply 7*10^{15} watts as a side project after all) but the aliens do want to contribute to the society in some way and would like humans to do the same. While scientific advancements and resource creation is automated, culture advancement can only be automated as much as hiring a bunch of people to write poetry can be called automation.

So the answer the humans would find is that aliens would value qualities such as creativity and perceptiveness over hardworking and resourcefulness.
