Consider either the HPMOR or Rowling's Harry Potter approach to Hogwarts, with the following modification: the broom-based sport of Quidditch has been replaced with the magical mecha sport of Magical Soccer. Mech Soccer is played with magically-powered suits of armor that come in different sizes; standardization has created the Junior and Pro sizes:

- Junior-size Magical Soccer Mechs are up to six feet tall, with a torso that fits within a four-foot cube and containing a maximum of two humans. Junior-size mechs have four limbs, and are limited to a common list of spells and materials laid out by the Magical Soccer Mech regulatory body. Their simplicity compared to Pro-size mechs means that compliance with regulations can be verified with a handful of standard spells before a Magical Soccer Match. There are several mass-produced designs. These mechs cannot fly in a sport-compliant configuration, but hobbyists have been known to use broom enchantments to allow them to fly. Like with broom flight, mech flight over Muggle areas is strongly discouraged.
- Pro-size Magical Soccer Mechs must fit within a 60-foot cube when standing upright. Pro-size Magical Soccer Mechs are limited to at most 6 limbs, and have a larger common list of spells and materials laid out by the Magical Soccer Mech regulatory body. Because of the increased possible complexity of construction, verification of regulatory compliance cannot be easily undertaken. In order to verify compliance, a given mech must be assembled from raw materials (the list of approved materials includes nonmagical pre-shaped materials of any shape, subject to size, cost, and materials restrictions) in front of a judge within a time limit. Judges perform a spell ritual that notes the magical signature of the mech, which can be verified remotely. Repairs and other modifications affect the magical signature, and a mech with abnormal signature can be disqualified. Magical Soccer Mech teams are allowed a number of backup mechs on the roster, but can only replace two mechs during a game. Generally speaking, resource constraints on team composition and mech construction, and the rules of the game as played, favor non-flying mech designs in regulation play.

Hogwarts teaches children to play Magical Soccer using Junior-size mechs, because Junior-size mechs are commonplace in Magical society. There are a number of spells for automating Junior-size mechs, and as such they are often employed as grunt labor in tasks that would be magically exhausting for witches and wizards to complete. When the Wizarding community last subjugated the goblins, Junior-size mechs were the Wizarding army's swarm fighters; mechs of all sizes are designed to be resistant to spells coming from outside of the mech's armor.

What mayhem would you get up to at Hogwarts with Junior-size mechs? How would you prevent that mayhem as Hogwarts' administration?
