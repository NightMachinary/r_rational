Yeah, one of the best things about writing this series is all the little titbits I find out about while looking for WoB's describing how something actually works.

Definitely agreed that people not knowing about hemalurgy is probably for the better, but it /is/ theoretically possible to survive hemalurgy and if a gold feruchemist did survive the process they would probably [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/102/#e983][be able to heal back the damage hemalurgy did to their spiritweb]], which is one hell of an exploit if you can somehow make hemalurgy consistently survivable.

  two races of hemalurgic abominations, and also the Kandra, who are at least working for Harmony now.

To be fair, all three hemalurgic races got better after the catacendre. There are good Koloss now and the one remaining Steel Inquisitor also seems to be a good guy (even if he is pretending to be the grim reaper).
