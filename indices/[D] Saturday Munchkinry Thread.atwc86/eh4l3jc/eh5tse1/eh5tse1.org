Warning to anyone who has not read any of the Mistborn books, massive spoilers ahead. Do not read.

Did not know about the transgender thing. This gives Scadrial two ways to cure transfolks. Unlocked goldminds are the most moral method, but this would require a full feruchemist, very few of whom exist by the second era. The second one is definitely doable, but of questionable morality. A Hemalurgic spike storing gold feruchemy could be used to give the transperson gold feruchemy. This would require the spike to exist, which requires murder, but each spike could help several transpeople before losing too much charge to be useful, especially if the spike was "stored" in someone between uses. Capital punishment on Scadrial is marginally more moral than it is here because superpowers make it hard to contain some criminals, so a government which knew about hemalurgy might use it to get the most benefit out of putting someone dangerous down. However, this would require a /government/ to know about /hemalurgy./ The last time that happened we got a genocidal, immortal emperor who successfully pretended to be a demigod for 1,000 years and created two races of hemalurgic abominations, and also the Kandra, who are at least working for Harmony now. The downsides far outweigh the benefits.
