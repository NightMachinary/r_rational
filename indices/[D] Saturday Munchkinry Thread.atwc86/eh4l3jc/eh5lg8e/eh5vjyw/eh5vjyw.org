  Just to double check: spiritual ideal is seperate from a person's spirit web, although I assume they effect each other indirectly?
#+end_quote

Correct.

  The allomancy is very odd and useless for my understanding. It proves they many worlds theory for their universe?
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. Gold shadows aren't (considered to be) real. They're not people from timelines that have actually happened, just perfect predictions about timelines that could have happened. I suppose in a way that's weak evidence in favor of many worlds (because making such a prediction would be "easier" if the universe is already doing all the calculations in the background and the magic just has to peek into another universe to see what would have happpened), but gold allomancy is not incompatible with the copenhagen interpretation or even just with a straight up deterministic universe.

  They would probably all believe in moral relativism
#+end_quote

Apparently most gold allomancers tend to not use there abilities much because of how disconcerting the process is, but yeah, I expect those that do to be much more introspective and self-aware at least. For what it's worth, the two people we know that canonically burned a lot of gold were both pretty horrible people with big ideas about what means justify what ends. So I don't know about moral relativism, but it certainly seems to be somewhat unhealthy (though both of them were at least somewhat unhinged to begin with, so there's that).

  copper and gold feruchemist
#+end_quote

Ooh, that's very cool. It would require you to be at least a full feruchemist (and ideally also a gold allomancer in order for the process not to take forever), but yeah, that could work. There is probably some limit to what you can convince even a blank slate copper feruchemist of, but for the right person that limit could be pretty high.

  If you can change a gold feruchemist's spiritual ideal you can mutate them or prevent healing. Extreme zinc allomancy causing self loathing or depression might do it
#+end_quote

I don't know about this one. Spiritual Ideals don't change over night, so you'd have to be close enough to burn zinc over a long period of time without them catching on. It's probably not impossible, but it's definitely going to be tricky.
