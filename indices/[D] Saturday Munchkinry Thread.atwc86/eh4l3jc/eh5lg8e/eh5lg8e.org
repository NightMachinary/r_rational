Just to double check: spiritual ideal is seperate from a person's spirit web, although I assume they effect each other indirectly?

The allomancy is very odd and useless for my understanding. It proves the many worlds theory for their universe? They would probably all believe in moral relativism, since they can look at how different they could have been based on decisions in the past. Seems especially bad since it burns a metal I assume is pretty valuable in their world, for no physical or informational gain?

Feruchemy: Goldmind Bodybuilder: with knowledge of how muscle building and how the body can adapt to stress works your can become the ultimate muscle monster. Even if the healing actually prevents normal muscle growth working out a ton should change your mental image of yourself and eventually your spiritual image. Or just be born/raised/brainwashed into thinking you should be super muscular and you will gradually shift that way every healing.

Requires you to be a copper and gold feruchemist: (Age)Immortality: store any memories that make you believe you should be older in order to truly change your spiritual ideal. I think you could limit the memory loss needed by using self deception then forget the deception techniques. Worst case scenario is that you have to store literally all of your memories after your target age, then heal yourself to that age before tapping your memories back. Then your biggest threat is any healing without the full storage will rapidly age you.

Shapeshifting: using the store memories and heal method you can turn your ideal into basically anything and then heal into that form. This would likely require a ideal/memory creating ally and storage of the vast majority of your memories. Store everything except how to tap gold and copper, your ally then convinces blank slate you that you are or should be X with Y physical traits, then to tap gold to heal to that form before copper to regain memories.

Gold feruchemy seems phenomenal if you have a bank to pull from which seems pretty doable. Suppressing your immune system most of the time isn't as big a deal when you can always tap to instantly cure yourself if you catch anything bad.

A gold feruchemist and pewter allomancer would be a monster. Any time you are burning pewter just for strength and speed you can store health to avoid wasting it and any excess pewter you have can be converted into stored health also.

Anti-Gold: if you can change a gold feruchemist's spiritual ideal you can mutate them or prevent healing. Extreme zinc allomancy causing self loathing or depression might do it, even if it's only short term you just have to time it so it happens when they are doing a big healing. Rioting apathy might make them just accept their wounds preventing healing also?
