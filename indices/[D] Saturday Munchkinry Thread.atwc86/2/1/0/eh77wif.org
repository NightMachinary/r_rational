#+begin_quote
  What counts as an object?
#+end_quote

A object is anything you mentally consider a single item or being that is completely inside your area. So if you would normaly perceive a wallet and the money it contains as all one item the it is only a single object but if you think they are separate each bit on mony would be it's own object.

I know that definion is a little vague but it is mainly there to stop people makeing a small object intangible to it self.

#+begin_quote
  How specific is this list of objects?
#+end_quote

The only info you get is the location. The list would look like this.

| Object | coordinates (x,y,z) |
|--------+---------------------|
| 0001   | (1,2,0)             |
| 0002   | (2,2,0)             |
| 0003   | (1,2,1)             |
| 0004   | (1,2,2)             |
| 0005   | (2,2,2)             |
| 0006   | (5,3,3)             |

An object being destroyed or leaveing the area casues it to be deleated from the list and object being create or entering in the area are apended to the list.
