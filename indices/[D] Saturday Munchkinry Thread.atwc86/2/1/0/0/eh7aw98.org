Have you read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, specifically the portions regarding Harry's developed technique of so-called "partial transfiguration"? If I consider each elementary particle as a separate object, I gain a complete listing of all matter in the region as well as information about several force-transmitting fields. Sufficiently abstraction-free frames of mind could in turn result in the magic-user conceiving of reality as a single object, which of course cannot be contained within a 4m sphere, and so the magic-user would receive no information at all.

  You can selectively make objects the area intangible to gas and liquid as well as solid items that fit into a 2cm in diameter area

A single atom has no state; it is not gas, air, or solid. Those states of matter are defined by the relationship of the atom to other atoms. No atoms may enter this area, but atoms are just combinations of elementary particles. No elementary particles may transit the barrier: I have just created the perfect forcefield.

Alternately: reality is just clouds of amplitude in the wavefunction that is reality. No wave within the function may cross this boundary: this boundary enforces separate causalities on each side. An /improved/ perfect forcefield.
