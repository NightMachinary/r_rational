...Why? Is there a reason I should care about this, or is it just a part of the prompt?

If your goal is to maximize "productivity", then your biggest threat might be humans pinging alien reviewers just to study their psychology to figure out how they screwed up so badly that human labor could possibly matter to them. You're not going to be able to integrate into their markets if someone triggers a communist revolution.
