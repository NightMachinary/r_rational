Think a Dungeon Master that take in suggestions for custom powers for your characters, except there they only judge a character's power based on the above 4 criteria.

The reviewer specifically values the ability to produce artistic creation because that's the only thing worth doing just chatting with the reviewer gives you that information.

Trying to get alien technology seems like the right thing to do but how are you contacting the aliens after getting the power? But yes, that power gets a pass at all the criteria.
