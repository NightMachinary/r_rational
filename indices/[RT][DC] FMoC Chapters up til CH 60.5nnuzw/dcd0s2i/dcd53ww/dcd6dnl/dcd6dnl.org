Hi SvalbardCaretaker, I can understand your willingness not to click on obscure titles.

Forty Milenniums is a regular feature here, though, and as it's got a fairly long title, it tends to be abbreviated in chapter posts / discussion. I assumed most people had seen prior chapters and did this link on a quick whim; no one's posted the updates to here in a while.

But I also see your general-level point of steering away from abbreviations in general for good communication, which I agree with.
