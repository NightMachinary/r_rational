My understanding is that Squibs /have/ magic, just not enough of it to do anything useful. There's a lot of Squibs -- far more than there are actual wizards. Take a drop of magic from a million people, it adds up.

As to the crates, that scene was about showing that mundanes could now do magic given appropriate prosthetics. The funkiness with the crates was just to add some interest.
