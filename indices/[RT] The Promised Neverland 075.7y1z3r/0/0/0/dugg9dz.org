We do know. The beginning of chapter 75 was a flashback but chapter 74 was not - notice the black borders present in every flashback in the series so far. That coupled with the date - Jan 29th - in chapter 74 which adds up to the same time Emma is in Goldy Pond, Norman's still at a loss of what to do and he doesn't even know about Adam's existence.
