It's such a simple thing, but so counter intuitive. Blindly giving really isn't the way to maximize your investment, despite how it makes us feel. Society in general favors charities that make the giver feel things (whether it's guilt at not helping, or a sense of community) and bad marketing combined with that can really just make us inefficient overall.
