  One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in your lifetime. A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation. US politics is much more polarized than it used to be. Culturally we have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful of happy cities, abandoning the rest. And increasing economic inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too. I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances of the same phenomenon. *And moreover, that the cause is not some force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces that had been pushing us together.*

Emphasis mine. I am not old, which is why I like to read things written by people who are old enough to have seen enough periodic change to take an outside view but energetic enough think about it clearly and at length. This piece seems to give me some insight I did not get in history class, and I am curious for what [[/r/rational]] makes of it.
