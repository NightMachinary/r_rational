Thanks! I recognize that there's a lot of exposition to go along with any constructed fantasy world, so I wanted to introduce everything pretty quickly. You are correct to assume that, yes, there will at least be a short period of calm in order to establish background, context, etc.

Thanks for reading, I'm glad you enjoyed!
