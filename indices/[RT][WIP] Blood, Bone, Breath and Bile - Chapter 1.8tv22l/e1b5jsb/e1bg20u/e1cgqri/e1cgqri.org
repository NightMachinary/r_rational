Perhaps you should consider getting a beta reader well versed in biology, or maybe starting some kind of chat room (are chat rooms still a thing these days) with a few biologists to brainstorm biologically plausible ideas? There are probably plenty of biologists kicking around this sub-reddit; I can´t be the only one! Edit: Also, it was pretty clever of you to pick a bone wizard as the main character then; that´s probably the most interesting specialization that can do the most fun things with limited author expertise.
