Oh, sorry, that's probably something I should have made clear - the damage I was referring to was mainly a broken nose/skull - the whole brain-hitting-the-skull thing still happens, he still sees stars and can be knocked unconscious and such when hit on the head. I'll go back and make that clearer at another point.

Thank you for the advice though! I think it's already come in handy for a point I was considering in this next chapter. Thanks for reading.
