I'm curious. It's mentioned that the protagonist (and mostly likely many others) strengthened their bones, but does that translate to strengthened bodies. Does having a strong skull mean the protagonist is protected from brain damage? Assuming that this world follows the natural rules of our world (see NFL players and brain damage) it doesn't.

Whatever the case is, it might be something for you to consider if you haven't while you continue to expand your world building/characters. Either it's something that we as the readers shouldn't worry about (suspension of disbelief or adequate explanation for why that's a non-concern) or it's something we should worry about but that the character is unaware of (a flaw in the character's assessment of the dangers they could face).

I'm aware this is only the first chapter and am looking forward to how you continue the development of this world.
