Ok, I like this. The in medias res opening is a little confusing at first, but it works and it gets the attention of the reader.

I can tel that our protagonist is at least slightly paranoid, but I'm not sure how confused he is at his predicament. Am I right to anticipate that the next chapter will start with a look in the mirror and some more background? (Or failing that, then directly after contactingthe police?)
