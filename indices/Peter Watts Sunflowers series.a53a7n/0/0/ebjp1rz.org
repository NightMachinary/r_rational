I'll take a look. I strongly disagree with you on Echopraxia, he took the Cthulu of Blindsight and implemented it in small obvious steps along my favored primrose path of transhumanity, and even after reminding me why I only want third generation tech I can explain and build myself, he still hit me with an eldritch horror that is the type of logical conclusion I'd build if I decided to be less sporting or forgot to value lesser intelligences across deep time, but still remembered some of my manners.
