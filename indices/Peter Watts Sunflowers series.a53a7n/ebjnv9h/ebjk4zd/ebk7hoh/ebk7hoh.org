I really enjoyed the freeze frame revolution, so few books are willing to give deep time all the weight and existential force it can have.

As a standalone story though, I found it had a really bland resolution, even if it was a good example of an uncommon ending type.

The book would have been stronger it it had been published with the other three stories bundled into it, but even then the part that really holds me is the teaser for the next story in the universe, where there's homes of actual answers and real resolutions outside of "the crew are slaves to an insane ai doing a pointless job for eternity".
