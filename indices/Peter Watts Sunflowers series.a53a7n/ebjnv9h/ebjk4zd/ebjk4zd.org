Something I found after I ran out of new things to listen to on audible and went digging. Watts, our eminent lord of evolution as Cthulhu, has a series of short stories about spam in a can human spawning wormholes for humanity's progeny/successors through deep time. It is very in line with both Accelerando and Blindsight/Echopraxia, just taken from the original assumption that a sufficiently paranoid NASA planner having read the aforementioned, and the Bobiverse, went about designing a black-hole powered von-neumann wormhole generator, with the desire for it to survive until heat death, and chose primates in a can as a fallback intelligence to boost to a generally sub-human but narrowly focused mission AI.

​

Edit: I found this thought provoking, and as existentially terrifying as you would expect from Watts. Feel free to comment on the series, or recommend things similar ( In addition to the above I've read Glasshouse, Saturn's Children, Neptune's Brood, Aurora, Diaspora, Methuselah's Children, Orphans of the Sky, Seven Eves, Passages through the void and the Prime Intelligence Series; and find them similar enough to not want them as recommendations, but do suggest them as points of comparison)
