Double posting but I want to posit a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8omjxm/spoilers_discussion_of_the_freezeframe_revolution/e07i7ks][theory on the big reveal]] the drift is because the singularity drive has the fast AI and it's a aside effect of the uncompensated (spin?) effect of its processing . I'm weak on the various singularity processor models, but I'd bet it was an update via the gates, maybe the soap bubbles or something published via a gravity anomaly of a gremlin pointing it's fangs at the ship and I bet there is a breadcrumb in the specific phenomenon/numbers based on watts biblo, but I dont have the time or energy to dig for it at the moment.
