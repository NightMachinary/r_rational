My apologies the proper title is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1tgho0/the_metamorphosis_of_prime_intellect_bear_in_mind/][Metamorphosis of the Prime Intelligence]]. I've linked the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] thread because there's a lot of icky (snuff play, wireheading, ect) you get in an otherwise Wargames level (low fidelity, but good insight) story about a hard takeoff by a dumb AI making everyone immortal. Additional warning: it is strongly in the realist camp.
