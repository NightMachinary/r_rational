So... I just wanna point this out:

- In the English localization, the technique is called Mist.
- In the original Japanese, the technique is called White Mist.
- But in meteorology... condensed water vapour at ground level is called "fog" when visibility is reduced to <1 km, and "mist" when visibility is between 1 and 10 km.

Meteorology is cool, guys!
