Well, fuck. How long do we have, lore wise, until the events of Sinnoh? Official sources place them 3 years after the Hoenn and Kanto games, so the clock is ticking. Cyrus trying to rewrite the universe seems like exactly the tear needed to speed up this “mad god”'s bridge to reality. Which would line up, assuming that was Giratina Mewtwo witnessed, a being which lore wise breaks into reality at the climax of Platinum version. Sinnoh seems out of scope, but I wonder if Turnback cave is the focal point of the unknown activities. It's not terribly separated from the solaceon ruins either.

On an unrelated note, I wonder if Mewtwo‘s human parent is related to Red. Probably not his parents, I can't see a connection to Giovanni there, but maybe extended family? It's probably silly, but their reliance on multiple aspects of themselves seems intentionally similar.
