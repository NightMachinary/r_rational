There's a lot of parallels between Red's and Mewtwo's powers- they way they both make and switch between multiple personalities separated by partitions. Mewtwo is also specifically the same age as Red/Blue/Leaf, and Red's dad probably fits the compassionate requirements considering his line of work and how he died. It just makes a lot of sense that the parallels between Red and Mewtwo have a deeper meaning.
