Not really? I mean, I can't recall anyone claiming that they should be allowed to own African-American slaves on the basis that the slaves are really just pieces of their own mind and body that have been made semi-independent.

I suppose if there was evidence that a tulpa could grow to take on a completely independent existence, then there would be an argument to be made. Even then, that doesn't guarantee that any of Mewtwo's tulpas had reached a point where they would qualify.
