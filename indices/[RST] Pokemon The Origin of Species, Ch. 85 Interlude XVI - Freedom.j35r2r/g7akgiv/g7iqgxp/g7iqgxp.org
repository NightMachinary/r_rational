Might be the weird hive mind crystal thing from one of the movies instead, Giratina isn't associated with unown and I feel like Mewtwo would have noticed if it was a ghost since they do weird stuff to psychics.

Still if this is Giratina I wonder what Palkia and Dialga will do, since they canonically have the power to literally destroy and remake the universe and legendaries seem to be getting power boosts in this story.
