The Legendaries in this story aren't really any stronger than they are said to be in cannon (except maybe for Pressure), its just that their power is actually expressed in a realistic way instead of in-game mechanics. You can't beat one with a Rattata just because you overleveled it. The Stormbringers are supposed to be able to summon huge storms, the Weather trio is supposed to be able to alter the planet's climate, and here we see them doing so. Dialga and Palkia shouldn't behave any differently than they do in the games; they will have absurd power but won't want to actually use it unless a human messes with them. The Spear Pillar stuff will likely be handled human vs human
