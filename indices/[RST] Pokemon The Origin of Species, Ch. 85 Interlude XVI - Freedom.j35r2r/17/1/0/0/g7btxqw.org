The way I see it, if the legendaries in question had been ones people already were regularly harassed by, people would have been celebrating. But what ended up happening is that entirely new massive threats appeared, killed lots of people, caused unprecedented destruction, and then were barely held off while other legendaries killed them.

AND unleashed new permanent legendaries.

AND made people aware that further ancient threats might be lurking.

So yeah... not exactly something I imagine most people would be celebrating.
