The fact that the titans awaking in Hoenn meant it would never be peaceful again, plus other regions now had to worry about similar circumstances (namely, Unova has its own set of dormant titans, Kalos could have some stormbringers, and Johto may even have more hoenn legendaries depending on how the embedded tower works) would put quite the damper on things. Plus, it took other, equal or stronger legendaries to beat Kyogre and Groudon. Giratina should have other methods of getting in, it didn't use the unknown in the games (though it wasn't malicious there)
