  ... I can barely focus my senses on any surrounding minds.

  ... The loneliness overwhelms me, and before I can make any conscious decision I find that I am already shaping a new tulpa.

  ... The thought of relearning how to walk is not in itself daunting, but what weighs on my thoughts instead is the feeling of failure.

  ... As I foraged, every unexpected noise made me jump, every shifting shadow sped my pulse. Once a flock of murkrow flew overhead, causing me to instinctively send a wave of force up at them... which, of course, did nothing.

  The thought that Giovanni may have been right to keep me confined and safe in the lab is humiliating, but impossible to entirely dismiss.
