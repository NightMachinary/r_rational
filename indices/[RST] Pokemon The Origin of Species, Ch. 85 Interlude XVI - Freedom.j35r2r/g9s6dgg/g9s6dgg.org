Quick question, which I wasn't sure whether to post here or in the main group. Is Origin of Species almost done? Not in a “man, I wish it was over,” way, but I'm going to have to reread a significant portion to catch up because it's been a while and I need the refresher. If it's due to be completed in the next year or so, I'll probably wait and read it all as a whole. If it's going to be ongoing for years, I'll just catch up and read it as it comes out.
