They do have subs dedicated to it on Reddit - [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]] seems to be the main one, and [[/r/tulpa][r/tulpa]] the alt. There's also a Wikipedia page, though it doesn't feature any comment from psychologists, which is what I'd be most interested in.

My impression of them after not-that-deep scrutiny as an outsider is that tulpas seem useful enough as an attempt for companionship. (Maybe overly so. Try sorting [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]] by top of past week.) I don't think I've seen anyone on those subs who created tulpas for strictly constructive purposes, but I don't see how it's impossible to do so, if the tulpa is created with discipline. That said, it's not like there's much scientific research on it (that I saw), so it may be the case that it's not possible for some people to actually form tulpas without a mind that needs companionship (and thus is willing to force the brain into creating a companion), or is hyperactive (and thus has the brain processing to spare), or possess some fictional mind superpower. And then there's the possibility of something like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/j2wv5z/is_it_possible_to_bring_back_an_old_tulpa_that_i/g796uyy/][this]], where even if you succeed in forming a tulpa you're just that unlucky person whose tulpas don't actually stick around 24/7.
