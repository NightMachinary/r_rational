Technically we saw Mewtwo demonstrate Pressure (or an equivalent functionality) in this chapter, when he drove the local ocean Pokemon into a frenzy so they would attack and delay his captors. It's just not active continuously the way it is for others with that ability, although it probably could be if he chose to do so.
