I took it to mean the Sinjoh Ruins (from HGSS), which are stated to be somewhat north of Kanto/Jhoto but still south of Sinnoh, and pretty far away from any other civilization. Being in 'the wilderness north of Kanto' would make sense - and it's a focal point for unown and Arceus in general (along with the creation trio).
