Well, my immediate thought is Ultra Beasts, but I don't think Ultra Beasts want to consume reality. Though I never played SM, so IDK.

Secondary option is one of the Sinnoh legendaries, but same problem. Giratina, /maybe/ depending on how you interpret his history (supposedly banished from our reality).
