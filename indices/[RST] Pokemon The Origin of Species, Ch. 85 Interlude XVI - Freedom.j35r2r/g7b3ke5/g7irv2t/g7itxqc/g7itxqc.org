Yeah, so far no Legendary has been killed without the help of another Legendary. Which rather validates Giovanni's plan with Mewtwo.

I'm also curious as to what will happen with Latios and Latias. So far they're the only natural, nonhostile Legendaries we've seen. In theory Rayquaza might also be nonhostile, but we don't really have a good impression of its behavior (seems like it fucked off after killing Groudon?), while the Lati twins were actively cooperating with May and Brendan.
