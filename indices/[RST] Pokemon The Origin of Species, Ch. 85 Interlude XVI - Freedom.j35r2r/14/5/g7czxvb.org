Some missing italics when Prime speaks to Survive: “Yes, that seems sensible as well.” (I was sure there was another location, but can't find it, so maybe you fixed it already?)

And missing brackets around Survive saying “Yes, Prime. But it would be safer not to pursue.”

Also “I am about to leave when Survive speaks for the first time;” may be better ended with a colon; and may be more clear with an addendum like “for the first time since I entered the market”
