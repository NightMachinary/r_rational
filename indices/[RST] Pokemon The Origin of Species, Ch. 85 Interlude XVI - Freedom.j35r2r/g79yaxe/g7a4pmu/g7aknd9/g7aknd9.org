Interesting. Victory let himself be destroyed, since his goal was the satisfaction of M2's goals, which would be thwarted by trying to defend himself from M2. Survival was explicitly created with separation from M2's consciousness, and his goal is not to aid M2, but to "Survive". Perhaps he will attempt to take over M2's brain when M2 grows tired of him?
