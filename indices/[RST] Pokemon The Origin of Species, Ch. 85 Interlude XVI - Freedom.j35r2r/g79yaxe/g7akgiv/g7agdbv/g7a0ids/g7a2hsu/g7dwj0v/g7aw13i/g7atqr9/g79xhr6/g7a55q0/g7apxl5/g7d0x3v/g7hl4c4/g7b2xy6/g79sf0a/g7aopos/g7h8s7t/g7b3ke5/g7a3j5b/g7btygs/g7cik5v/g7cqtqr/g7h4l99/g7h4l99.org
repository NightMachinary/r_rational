I believe the "internal family system" thing is a recognized psychological tool. I often use something similar when deciding on what I want to do in any given moment. It's more helpful for aligning my actions with my priorities, rather than producing novel solutions to problems or multitasking (and when I say more helpful, I mean I've never gotten better problem solving abilities or abilities to multitask from it, and only use it for action prioritization). I've also found it helpful for increasing focus, thinking "ok, for this hour I will spend my time furthering goal X, so X-focused D0TheMath is in control right now". Overall, I'd say experiment with it for a few days, as with any new cognitive tool, to see if it produces good results for you.
