"they would be on as soon as" -> "they would be on *us* as soon as"

"choppy wave" -> "choppy wave*s*"

"but do not begin undoing" -> "but *I* do not begin undoing"

Inconsistent use of us/me and our/my in the first section. Not sure if this is intentional. As far as I can see, there should be no "me" or "my" before the first section break ("... almost..."

"should I succeed?*.*" -> "should I succeed?"

"Of pain, or fear, of desperate loneliness" - not sure about this one. Should the "or" be "of", or the second "of" be "or"?
