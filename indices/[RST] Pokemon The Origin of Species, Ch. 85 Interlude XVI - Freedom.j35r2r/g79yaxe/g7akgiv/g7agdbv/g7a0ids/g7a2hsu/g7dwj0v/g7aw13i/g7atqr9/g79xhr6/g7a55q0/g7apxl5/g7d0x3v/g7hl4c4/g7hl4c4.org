Yeah as soon as I read of Mewtwo relaxing in the ocean without particular mention of avoiding Dark pokemon I thought, "Sharpedo." Even then, I gave it a fifty-fifty chance on whether he'd be able to leave before getting attacked, but then uh...Sharpedo. Probably. Carvanha would be extra humiliating. (And he really should have known better too, didn't his pursuers have Dark pokemon that were chasing him underwater?)

Bye-bye Victory, you will...only be missed when practically speaking. And hopefully won't be coming back. Survive's shaped up to be a much better pal.

I'm curious about Mewtwo's aversion of capturing others in Pokeballs. He's portrayed to be somewhat parallel to Red (e.g. development of tulpas), but on this case, in contrast, Red is actually rather enthusiastic in entering a Pokeball himself if the brain-death aspect of it can be engineered away, for its potential benefits (training programs, prolonging life). I wonder what could be the cause of the aversion in Mewtwo.

...A thought occurs. Could one of Mewtwo's human genetic parents have been /N/? Because he's the one person I just thought of who would feel so strongly against enslaving pokemon...although this might be a bit of a stretch. It's not like personality traits can reliably pass from parent to child.

Finally, my favourite part...the unown's secret. Whoo boy. I actually didn't expect this story to jump in scale so high, not too long ago - in an earlier chapter Aiko and Leaf were even discussing the "realistic" power levels of mythical pokemon ("Celebi probably can't /actually/ travel back in time, Jirachi probably can't /actually/ grant wishes"...) - but escalating events to world-level repercussions (competently) is pretty much my favourite thing in stories, so here I am, grinning like an idiot in gleeful anticipation. So while this probably isn't a thread that's going to be picked up anytime soon (Mewtwo only encountered the unown some weeks after Groudon/Kyogre, Red/Blue/Leaf's timeline as of last chapter was only two days after the event), I'll be eagerly waiting for it in future updates. With best wishes to the protagonists, assuming they're gonna have to be involved with it eventually.

Back to the point though - at first I thought the "mad god" was a reinterpreted Arceus - that was my assumption as well for the god that Wally influenced through his unown - but the discussion on this page convinced me Giratina fits much better. Still, if it was Giratina both times, that brings up an entirely new concern of Giratina's influence on Rayquaza that I wouldn't have if it was Arceus. Arceus is pretty much God, so I could accept his influence on Rayquaza to be a simple, and literal, divine intervention - but Giratina, "ruler of anti-matter" Giratina, I would question on both the "how" and "why".

I'm thinking one answer that satisfies both is that in this verse, Giratina already controls some of the legendaries (the how) and sending them around to actively hamper humanity is, in some way, letting it progress towards its goal of consuming that reality (the why). This /seems/ like a leap in logic, but somehow doesn't feel that way to me. I already wondered before if there was something actually intelligent in the way that the Storm Gods consistently harass the Kanto region, for one. And when I think about how, in the original games, Mewtwo's main Ability is Pressure, which in this fic he doesn't have yet...suddenly I see a connection between the way Mewtwo's mind was scrambled just by glimpsing the mad god, and the way Pressure, well, pressures all minds in its area of effect, and from there it's only a short jump to assuming how Pressure actually works: some kind of connection that exposes the minds around the legendary to the influence/presence of some eldritch god.

Well, in the end I can only call this a wild guess. I can already see a counter-argument starting with how some of the legendaries that I'm implying are under the influence of Giratina (the regis and Rayquaza) don't actually have Pressure, for one. Future chapters may prove me wrong entirely.

I don't know if Mewtwo would go straight back to Giovanni for help, or to some other humans - Giovanni definitely has the resources, but trust might be a bit harder to maintain. Either way, here's hoping Mewtwo's next encounter with humans go better.
