Really cool to get a Mewtwo interlude! We're finally in the middle stage of the story, and our main man (Pokeman?) is free!

I was honestly relieved when he took Victory down. There was always that sort of doubt that Victory would absorb the other tulpas, and I'm glad it was stopped quickly after. Survive seems interesting, since it's basically a fusion of the others. Also, now both Mewtwo and Red have one other /personality/ with them. Wonder how that will play out.

Mewtwo's human parent seems like a very interesting topic. The description might fit anyone really, but I was thinking someone like Professor Oak. I know it won't be the case here, but something like how Superboy has 2 parents in Superman and Lex Luthor would have been a cool idea to run with here. In that case, Giovanni and Oak.

Distorted you say? And a mad god? /Giratina intensifies/
