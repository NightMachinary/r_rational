Interesting, the new legendary threat is to the Hoenn Legendaries as they are to the Kanto Stormbringers.

So a legendary Pok√©mon's destructiveness are proportional to how easy it is to kill them.\\
Noone can touch the Stormbringers, but the far more dangerous Kyogre and Groudon were killed in a couple hours after making an appearance.

And now this new threat apparently wants to eat reality wholesale, but you probably just have to exterminate the Unown species to get rid off it.

Btw, I don't quite get why chapter 84 was entirely sombre in tone. Nobody was dancing on the street that humanity finally killed some legendaries (admittedly with the help of some other legendaries, but still).
