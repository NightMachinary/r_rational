Kyogre and Groudon aren't easier to kill, at least outside of the lack of pressure.

Kyogre only went down because Groudon is its equal and Groudon had help, then Groudon was beaten only because Rayquaza came and crushed him.

I imagine Rayquaza could take any of the stormbringers and making one stormbringers fight another would probably work fairly well too (especially as they're probably not quite so evenly matched), but neither of those two things are really doable, Rayquaza doesn't care about stormbringers and they appear at different times of year so getting two to fight is unlikely.
