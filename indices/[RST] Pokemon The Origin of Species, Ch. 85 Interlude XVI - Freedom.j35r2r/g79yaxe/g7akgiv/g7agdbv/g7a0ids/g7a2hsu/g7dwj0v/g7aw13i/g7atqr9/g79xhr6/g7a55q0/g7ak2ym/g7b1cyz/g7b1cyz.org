He mentioned going to the northern island, which would be Hokkaido in our world. In-universe the equivalent would be Sinnoh.

Sinnoh has Giratina of course. The creation trio is almost certainly a level above the weather trio. Giratina is in another dimension and is an equivelent to Satan in their mythology. I believe pokedex entries from the games even mention it's desire to consume our reality.

But biggest clue is the Unown. Sinnoh has the Solaceon ruins.
