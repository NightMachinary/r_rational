I love this chapter. I was kinda glad when Victory was destroyed, although it bit him back later, quite literally. Man, I felt so bad for Mazda when his tail was bit off just like that. I couldn't have imagined the great Mewtwo being an amputee. I just wish so much for him to see the good in humanity.
