Books 3 and especially 4 didn't fit the "progression" category as much, but book 5 very much did. (I don't think it's a criticism either way, though, just a categorization.)

I would also call it rational fic for several reasons, though: - Lots of active exploration of "what would the political implications of this magic system actually be?" - Long-term goals based on that, e.g. Kanderon sponsoring Liches because they encourage stability. - The parts of magic that don't seem to make sense (affinities for human-made categories like "fire", "stone", "dreams", etc.) are also puzzling to the characters for the same reasons. - Characters with seemingly weak affinities like paper being powerful mostly because they figure out clever ways to use them.
