Do be aware that while there are lots of rational elements (and I quite enjoyed the series), its not written as "rationalist fiction". There are definitely some dumb or impulsive decisions made, its just that those mistakes tend to be the kind that real people make. There's also some mild teen romance, which is by nature as far from rational as it gets.
