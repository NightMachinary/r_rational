It definitely has rational elements.

The approach the main characters take to magic is actually fairly scientific. Most of their improvements are incremental through practice, with occasional breakthroughs. New spells are generally learned and practiced before being used in combat instead of made up on the fly. The major upgrades that occurred in book 5 were all products of research. The whole magic system and how it's partially related to language and human understanding/belief is also quite rational compared to many systems. Magic also follows a scientific progression, where new discoveries are built on previous ones (think Loarna talking about how wards have improved).

Even more importantly, its not just the main characters who find creative ways to use their powers. Most of the notable archmages/great powers have actually explored their powers and found ways to abuse them. Artur's "breathless" spell, Alustin's whole style (and the silk mage he based it on), Heliothrax's body mods, Kanderon's planar/crystal armor, Clan Castis, etc. Pretty much everyone whose abilities we get any detail on has their own creative way to use their powers, and lots of the enemies who we don't get details on have "they have some method to do X, but its a secret our POV doesn't know". There are very few named characters whose powers are "this guy can throw fireballs". Big difference from many books where only the MC ever does anything to abuse his powers.

Finally, the characters generally act rationally (except when it's teenagers acting like teenagers over romantic issues). The political system is extremely believable, to the point where it's hard to imagine it working any other way or how the MCs can change it. Character's reactions to the system are also quite realistic.
