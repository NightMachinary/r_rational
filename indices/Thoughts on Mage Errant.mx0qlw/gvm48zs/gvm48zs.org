  So I was curious if the people here who have read those novels considered it rational fiction or not, and am interested in the general thoughts on the series by those who have read it.

It's good, I liked it, waiting for the next book to come out. Kind of wish the characters suffered some reasonable costs for doing the crazy stuff they do and taking the risks they take. i.e losing a limb or at least some fingers, or an eye, or some teeth, anything permanent really, it stretches my disbelief to see people (specially children) in combat that often and still not have suffered any kind of permanent damage..

​

Also, I like the fact that children aren't saving the world or doing anything like it. I tend to dislike seeing children doing that type of thing because it's quite silly.
