^{^{WARNING:}} ^{^{AMATEUR}} ^{^{STATISTICS}}

I have some interesting statistics about [[/r/rational]]; about our regular threads such as this one, to be specific.

First, sources. [[/r/rational]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/][wiki]] has articles with convenient links to every previous weekly thread (thank [[/u/ToaKraka][u/ToaKraka]] for keeping them up-to-date). I've used them to gather the following information about each thread: date, upvotes, number of comments, number of top-level comments. (In ideal, I should've also gathered number of unique usernames for each thread, but that is too much work.)

You can access the result here: *([[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfpw8x2pu1smmjt/Weekly%20Thread%20Statistics.ods?dl=0][.ods]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/jAQeuIE.png][.png]])*.

*Conclusion:* the most popular weekly thread by far is Friday Off-Topic Thread (8190 comments across 101 threads); Monday General Rationality is the second (4388 and 91 respectively), Wednesday Worldbuilding (2180 across 54) and Saturday Munchkinry (1644 across 39) share the third place, and Sunday Writing Skills (156 across 14, discontinued) is the last.

Amusingly enough, it doesn't quite fit with the results of the recent [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/67kiqb/how_old_are_the_members_of_the_rrational/][survey]]: according to it, General Rationality should be far ahead (301), Munchkinry a distant second (54), Off-Topic and Worldbuilding far behind (34 and 26 respectively).

But enough fun.

I regret to inform you that we are in a decline. I put the data points onto a graph, with thread number as X-coordinate and upvotes/comments/top_comments as Y-coordinates, then plotted lines of best fit for each combination.

Result: [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/qrid2jq4e7cv0b7/Weekly%20Thread%20Statistics.grf?dl=0][.grf]], created using free [[https://www.padowan.dk/download/][Graph]] application.

Some illustrations of choice: *[[https://i.imgur.com/tsi2LQn.png][Monday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/JN5syNr.png][Wednesday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/AuIQgnT.png][Friday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/LIp2FoG.png][Saturday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/sgoJ5B9.png][Sunday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/nay4PY9.png][Lines for Comments]]*.

As you can see, the number of upvotes was rising for Monday and Friday's threads and decreasing for the rest, top comments stayed more-or-less constant, while the number of comments in total for each weekly thread has been steadily decreasing.

Which is concerning.

I don't actually know what to do about it; thought I would share.

*Edit:* [[/u/blazinghand][u/blazinghand]] voiced the possibility that number of comments in each type of thread was decreasing because with time, new types of threads /appeared/, and the discussions were split between them. He appears to be right: I summed upvotes/comments/top_comments for each week across all threads, and the numbers indeed increase *([[http://i.imgur.com/zr0eMov.png][graph]] | [[http://i.imgur.com/3zZS2Tj.png][table]])*.

I hope someone with better statistics skills could get more information out of this. Maybe try to find correlation with seasons? Or important world events?

Speaking of more statistics, [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]], [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]], [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]], do you have access to data regarding the subreddit's number of subscribers over time, and posts/links statistics? It would be a helpful addition.
