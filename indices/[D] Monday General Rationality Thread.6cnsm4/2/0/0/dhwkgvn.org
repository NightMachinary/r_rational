I know, right?!

I'm tentatively excited. I know it's not going to play out in any of the ways we've expected - that pretty much never happens - but it seems like it'll play out at least as far as expected within my lifetime. I'd even bet on human-equivalent* within 20 years.

- I doubt it'll resemble a human - current trends, I'd expected the A in AI to be "augmented" rather than "artificial" - but something roughly (but again, extremely differently) as capable as a human.
