  the research hasn't changed the story, so far it's been to verify that wasn't doing something totally preposterous.

Yeah, that's pretty much where the majority of research comes in for me :P And I /still/ manage to miss things, like the "[[https://forum.kingdomcomerpg.com/t/dead-mans-ten-realism-of-deadly-injury/21771][dead man's ten]]" rule that a reader recently pointed out.

It's hard to give any specific advice without knowing the story or what you're researching for, but it kind of sounds like you're expanding the chapter based on the more you're researching? Which may be a bad sign that you're including too much of the research itself, which could be a bit info-dumpy depending on how you're doing it.

If the research isn't changing the story, where are those extra 3k words coming from?
