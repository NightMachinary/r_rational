Not necessarily: you can and should mention things that aren't explained on the spot, because to explain every single thing that comes up as it comes up is what weighs narrative down, particularly in sci-fi and fantasy. If it's important to the plot, then yes, you should explain it at some point soon, but you don't have to do it right away unless it's immediately relevant.

People go into fantasy and sci-fi accepting that there will be some jargon that won't be immediately understood, whether they're proper nouns specific to the fictional world, techno/magic babble, or just generally concepts that start out mysterious but are explained later.

On the far side of things, HPMOR has the line "Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling!" in the second chapter, and never explains what any of that means, leaving it as an exercise to the reader to research what that means on their own if they want to. That's because it's not necessary for the plot at all, so it's just there to signal that Harry is intelligent and hint toward what kind of story this is. (This may not be the /best/ example to follow because I know quite a lot of new readers who found that line off-putting, but the point is that you shouldn't worry about dropping science terms without explanation if the explanation isn't /needed/ yet.)
