I think the big diminishing return on research is how much of the audience you're working for. Basic research satisfies 90% of the audience, advanced research satisfies another 9% of the audience, and exhaustive research /might/ satisfy that last 1%. So at a certain point, I just pretend to run the numbers and find that it's not worth it except in the sense that I get a warm feeling from both research and getting things right.

Research does have other story benefits, like uncovering interesting directions for the story to take, or being able to edify readers, but that probably has diminishing returns as well.
