[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6aruc6/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dhh8eq9/][Last week]] I said I would start posting a story. This turned out to be untrue, after receiving feedback and also learning of the [[http://www.armscontrolwonk.com][Arms Control Wonk]] blog (an enjoyable read for this kind of stuff). I expected the chapter to only be 7k words, but it's at 10k and counting at the time of this writing.

Maybe I'm overdoing it. I have to ask: how much research is even worthwhile when writing rational fiction? I haven't hit a point of diminishing returns yet, but the research hasn't /changed/ the story, so far it's been to verify that wasn't doing something totally preposterous. It's still more than I've done for any other paper. There's a saying that "work expands to fill time allotted." Is there an equivalent for writers, that "story expands to fill information known"?
