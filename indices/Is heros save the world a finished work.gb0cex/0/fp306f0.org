Indefinite hiatus. I was terribly sick, my landlord was quite likely connected to Ukrainian organized crime and was as nice to live with as you might expect from that, and shortly after publishing the last chapter, I was homeless for a semester and trying to not let that or my migraines affect my grades.

And ever since then, I don't know, picking the story up again has felt like a monumental challenge. It's 20% done, it was spinning out of control by the time that I set it down, and I'm not sure whether it was actually /good/ vs. "it had some individual components which were good."
