Hmm. Are spirits an analogy for intuitions? Is the process of turning them into magical items an analogy for sublimation? Essentially... Sophia has control over the mind (world) because she respects the remnants of the old world (spirits) that it was built from. This mirrors the process of maturation a person undergoes as they understand the context and purpose of their instincts and learn to move with them instead of against them.

Super cool if true. Though I often question the value of veiled analogies... I'd bet we'd have more of an impact on people if we'd just come out and say things. Hard to judge though. The maturation process is slow and mysterious and most of us don't get to watch them unfold from start to finish, very often.
