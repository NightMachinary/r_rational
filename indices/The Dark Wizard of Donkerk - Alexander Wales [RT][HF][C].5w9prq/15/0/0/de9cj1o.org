Jones in general I feel lacks the popularity she rightly deserves -- I only encountered her as a result of Ghibli's adaptation of Howl's Moving Castle, but after that quickly made my way through the rest of her works. I always liked her tendency to wrap things up nicely by the end of the book, where all the plot threads come together and characters re-meet (or are revealed). Similar to Gaiman's /Stardust/ in that way (who she was good friends with). The sequel to DLoD, /Year of the Griffin/, is a solid read, too! (the Moving Castle series probably being tied for the two Derkholm books, with the Chrestomanci series in second, and Dalemark/Magids third)
