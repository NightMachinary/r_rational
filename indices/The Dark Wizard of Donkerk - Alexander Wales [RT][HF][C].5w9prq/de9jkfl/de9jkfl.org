Speculation on the other magic mentioned:

Each magic seems to encourage a particular kind of philosophy. Denialism is Kantian virtue ethics, right down to the contrast of duty and inclination. Ritualism is pretty clearly utilitarianism, that's the whole point of the story. There's even a digression on how denialism can be understood as a subset of ritualism based on the presence of an ends - bodily power - just as the argument that virtue ethics can be understood as a subset of utilitarianism with the ends of living a righteous life (or something like that, I can't recall). Both influential ideas in the enlightenment, heading into the industrial revolution.

So what is Eloism? Competition among equals - is that a reflection of market forces, the Invisible Hand? And elementalism - is that an allegory for the romantic movement? Submitting your will to the sublimity of nature? I really don't have much backing this up, but I'm really curious whether the analogy continues in the rest of the world.
