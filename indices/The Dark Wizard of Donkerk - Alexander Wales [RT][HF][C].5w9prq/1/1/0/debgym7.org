It's pretty great, in my opinion. Less polished than Limelight, but much more engaging than Glimwarden. It does the rarest of things, and manages to communicate a thematic message about being smarter without being particularly preachy, as well. The arguments in favour of virtue ethics are a little straw-manny, but maybe the author will fix that up in subsequent drafts.
