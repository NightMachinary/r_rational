Dammit. I just started some new books, and my next chapter is due soon. Saw this and thought "I'll just read the prologue."

Now I'm hooked. Great writing, as usual. The two magic systems are intriguing. The characters too. I'll have to resist reading more until next month at least.

Minor typo at the end of the prologue: "is reasoning" should be "his reasoning."
