As fair warning, this is /super/ rough. It was written Nov 2014, Nov 2015, and Nov-Dec 2016, at a pace of roughly 2,000 words per day throughout (edit: that math doesn't work out). There was never any beta reading, nor any editing beyond what I did in the course of rereading sections, so there are whole chapters there that have only had a single pass through my brain at high speed.
