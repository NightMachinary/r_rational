Spirits exist in three forms: living in the world in spirit form, existing as a magic item which can go beyond the domain of the spirit, and living in the spirit realm. Ulf comes out of the spirit realm and into the physical realm when Sofia is around 10 years old (IIRC, still haven't reread it), which makes him one of the first to appear. Sofia comes into her power more as she gets older (and spends more time with spirits), so they come to her more easily.

There's this little subplot where she's known to be a spirit caller at five years old and then that get repressed by Hirrush, but I don't think I actually ended up doing too much with that - it was meant as a false-start or false-awakening or something?

(Ulf is also solitary and taciturn as far as spirits go.)
