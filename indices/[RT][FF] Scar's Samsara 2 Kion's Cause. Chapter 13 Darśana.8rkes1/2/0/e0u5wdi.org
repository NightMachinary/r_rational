It's a throwback to the naming convention of the original story, in which every chapter was related in some way to the Buddhist concept of Samsara. It's supposed to highlight the fact that Scar is back to the drawing board, he realizes he hasn't won after all, and he's been lying to himself. The scene itself is also very similar to when it was Scar and Zira in the same cave using the red fruit for the first time, and of course 'spirit vision' is literally what the fruit gives you.
