  /Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?/

  The story basically has 3 arcs, and I only finished one so far as of chapter 26. So nowhere near the end, basically.

  /Q: I love your spiders, by the way. No idea if they're from your own head or inspired by something. If they're inspired by something, I'd loove to hear what they're from./

  They're from my head, mostly, but they were inspired by the GIFTS (Giant Intelligent Friendly Talking Spiders) and Aranea from Exile/Avernum series of computer games. I sort of combined them into one species, changed the type of spider into jumping spiders (because they're cute), gave them psychic powers instead of simple magical prowess and then built a society around the concept. They have a lot of worldbuilding behind them, and I'm not sure how much I'll end up showing in the story proper, but I'll try to do them justice. I tried not to make them into a 'race of hats' like non-human species usually end up being in fantasy stories, but still make them relatable and understandable to humans.

  Generally speaking, Exile/Avernum games are a big influence on this story. Other influential inspirations are D&D (of course) and Fullmetal ALchemist (the Alteration discipline is basically FMA Alchemy and watching it made me aware I dislike medieval tech levels and prefer higher technology settings). Harry Potter and Naruto fandoms are a minor inspiration as well, as are a whole bunch of other works that I won't bother listing.
