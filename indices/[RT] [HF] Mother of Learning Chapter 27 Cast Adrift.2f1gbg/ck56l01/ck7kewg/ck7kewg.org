I thought Novelty felt a lot like Spider! I grew up on Exile and later Avernum and Geneforge. I love the worldbuilding and old-school RPG feel Jeff puts in his games.

There was an old Exile fanfic of the early days with the King and Erika and such trying to survive in lightless caves on their own, but I can't seem to find it and fanfiction.net doesn't have the exile or avernum area any longer for some reason.
