Thanks for the response!

I'd noticed those, as well as your tendency to refer to non-mages as "civilians", the Xvim/Ebisu parallels, and [[#s][the]] elements. Those combined gave me the impression it was a major influence, but I suppose different categorizations for what we consider minor or major aren't a huge deal.

Love the story, by the way. Discussed the latest chapter with my SO last night.
