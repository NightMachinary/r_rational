Hey, I was looking back and saw this. I love the flair, and while I doubt I'd accept better than 1 in 5 odds on /the Callow/ empress across the table from a redeemed /sixth/ Akua enforcing the accords, with the recent Akua death pact with the one true heir that is Thief but the offer is still open and easy money (under $50 in liability for me please) if you are sure I'm wrong.
