Hah. Cat sets up a narrative where Mentor offs himself to save the Hero with her as the Hero, Pilgrim goes for it expecting Cat to become Good as a result, and at the last moment, Cat switches with Ubua.

Since Pilgrim is in effect sacrificing himself for Ubua (and other story moments could apply to her about as much as to Cat - remind me, who woke up for Cat's heroic "wake up when friends are in danger" moment a couple chapters past?), Ubua gets redeemed and Cat stays a villain.

10/10 future ploy by Cat Black would be proud.
