Did your autocorrect just replace "Ubua" with "Unusual"? Had she not explicitly shown that she wanted to be crowned as Dread Empress Magnificent, I would make a reigning name joke out of this.

Also, assuming she keeps her speciality after being redeemed (since the heroes didn't swear away devils, and no branch of magic is inherently Evil), how powerful do you think her bindings will be wile powered by a Choir? We already know that most devils can't survive even a gaze of an angel, and her propensity for resisting the mental bleedover (potentially combined with leaning into whatever side of her Name would be dominant) could allow her to avoid the standard Heavens-induced heroic lobotomy.

Alternatively, given the link she has to Catherine's mantle, she can instead transition into Arcadia-based summoner Name, with fae/elves as her primary summons.
