  The other royals would return to Procer, where Hasenbach wouldn't be able to blame them -- Prince Amadis, after all, was the official leader of the army. And the man himself would be out of the First Prince's reach to punish, not that she'd be able to after he'd become a hostage to save his men. He'd come out of this smelling like roses, a tragic figure who had fallen prey to the wickedness of the Black Queen. Meanwhile his allies in Procer would be building the altar of his legend so when he returned it would be to the praise of the thousands instead of blackened by inglorious defeat.

Isn't Amadis' position being strenghtened in opposition to Hasenbach beneficial for Cat? I know she doesn't need Cordelia too occupied, or Malicia has a free hand in the negotiations with Catherine, but shaking the throne under the First Prince might yield /some/ kind of advantage.
