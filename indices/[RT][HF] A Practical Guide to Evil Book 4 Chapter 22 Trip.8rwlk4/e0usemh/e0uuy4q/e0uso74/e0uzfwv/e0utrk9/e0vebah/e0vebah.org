I wasn't quite sure how to read this part:

#+begin_quote
  It didn't matter that I was in charge of Callow, if I was no longer a villain. Sure, most redemption stories ended in death. Sacrifice to make up for previous sins and all that, passing the torch to someone that had the same heroism but less blood on their hands. *That was just spice in the wine*, though, since it got him all the benefits of Callow not longer heading down the cliff without having to deal the issues inherent in keeping me around after my bloody history. In a way, this could be considered an elegantly subtle assassination attempt.

On my first read, I thought the "spice in the wine" (ie, optional) was her death: a true alignment change to Good is enough of a prize, and it's a "subtle assassination attempt" because Cat-as-a-villain will cease to exist when she's replaced by Cat-as-a-hero. "If [Cat is] no longer a villain" she'll be a net positive to reality.

But I think it's more correct to read the "passing the torch to someone that had the same heroism" as the optional spice -- with the idea that, the redemption storyline is so powerful that Cat's alignment change will be necessarily accompanied by her ultimate sacrifice. The assassination attempt is simply lining up the fatal storyline.

In the second reading, Pilgrim's goal is a simple shantraj board move -- checkmate, kill the enemy King, zero sum -- and a straight line to that goal, but through highly abstract space. But in the first, well, the game is a lot more subtle, depending on how you read the Good vs Evil element -- I guess I can imagine a more potent angelic mindrape at the end of that road. But if Cat becomes a Good Queen with the same emphasis on practicality she has as a villain, does that necessarily mean an instant Bad End?
