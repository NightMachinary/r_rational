Anybody offering betting odds against her ending up as Winter in the tower enforcing the Liesse accords against a redeemed Ubua (who was obviously redeemed/resurrected by Pilgrims lifeblood, and there may be a subplot of bards meddling to give the two of them plot armor against her)?

I'm thinking 1:1 on Ubua's redemption at pilgrims life, 1:3 on Catherine in the tower and 1:3 on bard plot armor for Cat and Ubua given an Ubua redemption (my money: your money) with a $5 limit
