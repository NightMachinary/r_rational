At this point, I feel more confident about Cat's survival than I did at the start of the chapter.

We now explicitly know that the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath][redemption equals death]] storyline is Pilgrim's objective, but we don't know what Cat's plan to turn it around on him is. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee][Unspoken Plan Guanratee]] gives Cat the advantage - in fact, in a story where people don't explicitly wield tropes against eachother, I think a chapter like this would guarantee that Cat will come out on top, at least in this conflict between her and Pilgrim.
