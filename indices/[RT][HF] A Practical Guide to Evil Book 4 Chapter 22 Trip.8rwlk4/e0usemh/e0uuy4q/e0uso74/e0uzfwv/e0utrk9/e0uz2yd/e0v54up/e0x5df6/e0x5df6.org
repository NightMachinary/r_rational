We don't know if that's Pilgrim's objective, it was just Cat jumping into conclusions. Yeah, she will probably be right, but there ought to be dozens of other story tropes that Pilgrim or Cat could apply to this situation.

I feel it's quite convenient that Akua just happens to be aiming for a redemption story too. That said, another (and much more boring) solution for Cat would be "not participating", i. e. avoiding any kind of story that Pilgrim'll attempt to form.
