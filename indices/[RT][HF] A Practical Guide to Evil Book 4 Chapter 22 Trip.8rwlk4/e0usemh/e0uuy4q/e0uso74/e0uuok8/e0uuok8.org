Cat knows Pilgrim is experienced with a specialty in Narrative and completely opposed to her being a villain. I think Cat's conclusions are accurate if unflattering.

From Pilgrim's point of view, he sees redemption has both good and Good. He mentioned how big of a advocate he is of it during his first talk with Cat. And if Cat goes to a early grave right after being redeemed, well that is a tragedy but if Cat gets a spot in Heaven after turning then her death would be merely bittersweet.
