  I have one more thing which I could mention. I think you write fast paced scenes pretty well, and you seem to be managing so many characters well too. I would caution, however, that if you have too many things going on at once, it can be difficult for the reader to keep track of who is who and what is doing what. Consider slowing the story down/focusing on one person per chapter or increasing your word count per chapter a bit.

To be honest, that's part of the reason why Shoryu was sent to school in the first place-- it was a way to get him out of the spotlight and not interacting with the rest of the plot. Didn't quite work out, but I tried :P
