you know what? You're absolutely right. You've slightly misinterpreted a few events, but not enough to make your point invalid. As soon as I'm able, I'll make the interlude a noncanon omake, add a few paragraphs of shoryu arguing his mother around to his viewpoint of not going to school, and then make a new interlude with everything changed after the breakfast scene.

Thank you very much for taking the time to do your writeup; I'm glad I'm taking a one-week update break so I can fix issues like this.

[[/u/elevul]], [[/u/Dwood15]] , your (nondenominational) prayers have been answered.
