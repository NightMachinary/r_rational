Finally had time to read them.

Not particularly eventful chapters, mostly building up to what's going to happen afterwards, but still interesting.

I still don't understand why Shoryu decided to accept going to school, though. Is it just for meeting the friends he's missed? Because he can do that without going to school.

The matter with the (uncaring) yakuza is pretty interesting, and so is the one with the american guy playing Ninja Turtle. If played properly this could evolve in a very interesting manner.
