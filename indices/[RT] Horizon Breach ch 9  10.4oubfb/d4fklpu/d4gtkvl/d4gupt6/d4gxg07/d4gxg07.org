/Warning, I got a little long-winded, lol./

You would benefit with closer inspection of the premise and rules of your modified ET universe. The Wednesday World-Building thread would be good, your own thread discussing the specific plot points you want to have happen would be good. Generic questions without naming your own story can help mask the plot a bit if you want.

Let's take a step back and look at the setting. Thousands of players of the game Elder Tale were teleported and transformed into their online avatars, and after a year or two, they have discovered a way to return. For all intents and purposes, these people were dead, and have just now returned to life. A series on Netflix, 'the 4400' explores this premise fairly well, and you would do well to see how different people react to different situations in that show. Moving on, having just four people returning so far, AND it's been shown that there are people willing to attack and attempt to KILL the people returning home. Regardless of power differences, I would be careful. Shoryu has other things to do as an adventurer until things solidify and stronger players come through and are able to guard the /incoming/ portals better.

If the reason he's going to school is because he's bored, I expect some things to have to set up for it to be a thing. You are rushing it way too fast where it feels like you sent him there because you thought/think it would be fun to have a 'return to school' story. There's plenty of things he could be doing other than going to school, /at this moment./ In fact, for him to run off to school is completely irresponsible considering what just happened, and the discovery spreading that humans can use powers similar to the ET players, would give him plenty to do. Let's talk about other stuff he /could/ be doing which would be more important than school.

A Genius just got through a portal to the real world and killed many people with its status effects. Shoryu absolutely needs to be ready when another portal opens, and for him to not attempt to prepare without communicating with his home guild and them describing what happened is irresponsible. If I read it correctly, he's the only person on 'our' side with the knowledge to deal with one. Being at school and then attempting to leave to deal with some kind of threat like a Genius are two extremely conflicting things. In fact, how fast the gang just ran from the scene of the battle was extremely suspect. Any responcible police force would want to talk to everyone involved and figure out what happened, ESPECIALLY if adventurers are involved with the problem. The way that Shoryu and the other adventurers ran off after the battle ended, they would be taken to the police station and interviewed, in fact the police may even consider pressing charges. I highly doubt any responsible force would let the kids go without interviewing them after the event, and getting a full fix for what's going on. Being the responsible people tehy are, I doubt anyone of LH would depart/abandon them. Also, what happened to the people who died because they were turned into monsters? The police would be all over it as the story developed. There's no school for Shoryu for /at least/ 3-4 days while the police figure out wtf just happened, at the earliest.

Secondly, if school is something you want to pursue, 99% of parents that aren't psychotic wouldn't send them off immediately, nor would they be able to... It is extremely likely that prior to returning from some kind of traumatic experience there would be interviews with police agencies, psychiatric evaluations, etc, even if he managed to stay out of the eye of the public. The very fact that he's been gone for so long and has returned is going to make waves in the local community. Look at what happens when someone returns home from being missing for a week, let alone a year or more for examples. Being trapped in the world of Elder Tale would be closest akin to what happened in the 4400, except with more ptsd.

Eventually, Shoryu may return to school, but he's also going to end up getting repeat visits from reporters to his house, people are going to constantly be asking what it was like to be an adventurer, and so forth. Most responsible parents would work with the schools to set up therapy/social assistance programs to help their child who's had to physically kill other beings to live reintegrate with life and let things calm down for a bit before they do. Shoryu merely arrived home and instantly went to school. Surely he himself, literally not having school at all for 2 years or so, would be able to think of things more important in this situation.

Thirdly, if the Prime Minister has discovered that he has a Log horizon 'class' and associated abilities, he may want someone to train with, even if they aren't of the same 'class'. You touch on it with the accountant guy, but people are going to start offering big bucks to adventurers to train them or their children in the associated arts.

*Shoryu's returning to school is made out to be his mother forcing him, and him passively saying 'ok' - If Shoryu has any sense of responsibility, or if he's not a cardboard cutout of his pre-ET teleport persona, wouldn't let it happen without major pushback.*
