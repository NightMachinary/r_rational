Yeah, getting it so you don't have to mention characters at this point in the story is going to be extremely difficult until you can reach further in to find better drop-offs where you can sum them up later. With all that's going on, and the increasing number of people crossing over, I recommend you spend more time on exposition so we can get to know the characters again. Currently there's... 12 people+ mentioned by name currently doing things which you'll have to keep track of? Even for the most seasoned of Authors, that's difficult, especially with a rational take on a world.

For the sum them up later idea, here's what I would have done at the end of the current chapters. Right after they took out the genius, the police would probably just barely be arriving (how fast they went from defeat to arrival of cops and JSDF arriving was way too fast. Minori (&Krusty's?) time limits run out, so they return.

Before he goes, Krusty and Shoryu save the guy in the now-damaged truck. Minori heals the guy of injuries. Anyway, so Krusty instructs Shoryu to stay there and interview with the cops. He is taken into custody for further questioning because all that's left is a destroyed truck and him at the scene along with however many stayed around to witness. As a Battle Leader, he is used to calling shots and is mostly independent. (Genius body dissolves/fades away, right?) Because of his experience as BL, he can take questions from police without issue.

That's the last we hear of him except in summary/reports from other characters for the time being. He's still doing stuff, but I would be guessing the JSDF get amazed at his hand-to-hand ability and he runs the gamut for the country's specops, showing everyone there up. Until he's hit and killed by a headshot from a previously-introduced sniper from GGO.
