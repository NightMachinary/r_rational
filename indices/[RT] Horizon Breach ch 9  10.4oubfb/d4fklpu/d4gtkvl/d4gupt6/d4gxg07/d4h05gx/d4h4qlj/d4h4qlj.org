Thanks for reading my reply and taking the criticism so well! I am excited to see the direction you take the story, it can be difficult to get to the plot points you want to explore in a rational manner.

I have one more thing which I could mention. I think you write fast paced scenes pretty well, and you seem to be managing so many characters well too. I would caution, however, that if you have too many things going on at once, it can be difficult for the reader to keep track of who is who and what is doing what. Consider slowing the story down/focusing on one person per chapter or increasing your word count per chapter a bit.

I look forward to reading your upcoming chapters and seeing where you go from here!
