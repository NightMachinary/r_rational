So i think you have a good premise, but i have problems with the story and don't think it's really rational at this point. You haven't explained prior why shoryu would allow his mother to force him back to school or if the school would even accept him... it kind of jumps from first meeting her, to "back to school this Monday", to "You're going, mister!" to "okay."

His mother is made out to be narcissistic and/or psychotic without care for the kid or what he's been through... and shoryu is a complete pushover. It actually bothers me quite a lot at this point.
