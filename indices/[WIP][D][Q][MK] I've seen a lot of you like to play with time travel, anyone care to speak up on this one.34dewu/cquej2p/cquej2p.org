It annoys me when people try to play with the arrow of time like that. It's a result of the boundary conditions of the universe. You can define that the stones exist with no markings at the end of the universe, but that would probably just result in them forming close to the end. You can't make the backwards arrow of time follow the stone.

From what I understand, the message written on the stone is the one that will result in you writing it on there. You could precommit to writing whatever happens and then end up with what will happen being written, but it would be more useful to precommit to writing what you see if things go well, and writing something else if they go badly. They're not prophesy stones. They're probability manipulation stones.
