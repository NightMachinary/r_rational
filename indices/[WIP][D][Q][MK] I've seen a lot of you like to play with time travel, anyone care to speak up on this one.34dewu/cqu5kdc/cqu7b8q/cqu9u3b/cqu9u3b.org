Oh! I think I get it! Time travel is done by magic circles, which can summon people through spacetime. Peripheries happen when either there are no more targets for the magic circles to latch onto, or no more magic circles to go to. That implies that, whatever the apocalypse is, it obliterates all minds and all magic circles.

For the next bits, I'm going to call the before-mind periphery the Genesis boundary, and the after-destruction periphery the Apocalypse boundary.

My first thought is to extend the Genesis boundary back by inscribing magic circles on the prophecy stones themselves. If that doesn't work, then my second thought is to sculpt the prophecy stones not only into instruction manuals, but into actual, working machinery that can be used to take shortcuts while climbing the tech tree.

The third thought is, if the issue is degradation of the stones preventing a magic circle from persisting, having someone skip back along the stone's timeline, restoring it at each "furthest reachable point".
