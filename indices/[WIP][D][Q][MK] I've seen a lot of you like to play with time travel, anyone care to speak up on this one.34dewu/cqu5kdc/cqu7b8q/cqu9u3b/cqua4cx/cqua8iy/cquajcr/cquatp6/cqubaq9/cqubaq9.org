Your getting the idea :) and yeah I like this. It's mildly disturbing and existentially horrific. But also cool and gives even more room to stretch.

That said practicalities are kind of the absurd yet solid name of the game with the fate market. What is 'practical' tends to define what has happened. In practice there is still borders and limits going into the past, and like you surmised their pretty low value real estate.
