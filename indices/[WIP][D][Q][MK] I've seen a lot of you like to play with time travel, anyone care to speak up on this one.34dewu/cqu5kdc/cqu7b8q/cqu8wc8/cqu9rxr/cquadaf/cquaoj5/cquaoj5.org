Wanting to murder the poop out of grand-dad is a much easier statistical thing to skew then the rest of the universe.

There is already a barrier of entry to those that can even use the fate market to begin with thanks to the great big abyss contact filter.

Those that would be most likely to create a paradox end up not being in charge of fate most of the time.

That said statistically impossible things are happening all the time TOO. But that's more because people are playing stock market with probability.

What happens is whatever is 'paid for' not what is 'likely'.
