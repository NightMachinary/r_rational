Paradoxes do not happen, because they are impossible. However things can seem paradoxical. The person who chooses to donate all their money to the city of a single day and jump past a periphery is not going to be as rich as the person who does more with their life eventually.

The fate market is actually a 'stable' loop. But it's so enormously huge and convoluted no one can SEE enough of it at once to know precisely what all of the causes and effects are.

And prophecy stone is more or less fully utilized, but it's not entirely clear how it's being used at any given point. People work prophecy stone through planning and pre-commitments or from dictations from other prophecy stone, or something.

The end result is that all the work you have to do is equal. Time travel just lets you do it in other periods of time.

A common newb mistake in the fate market is to try and pre-commit to an action, and then because they don't actually do it the action has no time loop shenanigan effect.

Then they don't do the action.

Proper pre-commitments are a LOT harder then most people realize (generally about as hard as just getting the thing done in the first place) and most people find it psychologically healthy and motivational to not pay too much attention to their own relative futures.

Also so glad the fate market is coming across that way. That is more or less exactly the goal of the setting.

Cosmic horror that makes you actually hurt your brain to hold in your head.
