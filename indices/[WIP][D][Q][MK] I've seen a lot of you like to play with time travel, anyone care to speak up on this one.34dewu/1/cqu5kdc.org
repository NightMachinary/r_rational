Is there an entire wave of time travellers building up at the edge of known time, like the Restaurant at the End of the Universe writ large? Do people wait until the nanosecond before they cannot go back, and then go back? Is letting yourself be washed "over the edge" by the stream of time considered the only form of suicide that's really, irreversibly /final/?

I mean, a universe bounded by apocalypse on either temporal side /seems/ pretty depressing until you consider that residents are like fish, swimming against the current before they can be washed over the edge.
