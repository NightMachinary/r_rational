That is pretty good actually, I'll consider it but I'm thinking that they run into similar problems as the future peripheries. And these are extremely expensive machines to build both in labor, time and raw prophecy stone materials.

Still I like it, it helps make the shape of the fate market a bit less lopsided with a really narrow past and a really wide future periphery.
