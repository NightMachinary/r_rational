Well, barring the costs of transferring into the past, it's low-value because there's a huge expanse of indistinguishable time bounded only by things like the creation of planets - or the Big Bang, if everything's prepared perfectly - not because it's undesirable as an aggregate. That's a /ludicrous/ amount of unbounded time, with only a few "crossroads" and maybe a tourist trap at the edge of the inhabitable universe, the formation of notable planets, and so on.
