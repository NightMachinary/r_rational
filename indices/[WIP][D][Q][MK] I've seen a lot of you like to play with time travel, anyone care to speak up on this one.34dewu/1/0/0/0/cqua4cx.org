AH Nice! The primary mechanism problem is a mechanism of the magic circles themselves.

I'll be writing another excerpt on those as there are actually many flavors of them and they vary in what their good for. However for now the hard restriction of a receiver is that you need a symbol recognizing brain to act as an 'activator' for most forms of magic circles, or the equivalent of entangled star gate type systems for actually moving solid matter.

Both of which run into challenges with prophecy stone that ends up meaning the earliest you can get someone back in time is roughly ten to a hundred thousand years ago if we assume this is earth.
