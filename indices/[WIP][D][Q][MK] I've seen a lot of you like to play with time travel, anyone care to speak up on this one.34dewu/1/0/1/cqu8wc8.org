Why is backwards transit limited? That is, what's the mechanism by which it occurs?

Could you retroactively break a prophecy stone by precommiting to smashing it in the future?

How does paradox work? If I can access all the money I'll ever make at once, what happens if I go to the border of the City of a Single Day, donate all of it to charity, and slip into the Apocalypse Foundries?

If you get shot in the face, are you dead? Or can your mind-state be retrieved and restored/shuffled to a new future where you don't get shot?

What happens when it all runs out? The Prophecy Stone seems to flow from the end of the world backwards, but there can only be so much stone at the end of the world, and the city of a single day processes a finite amount per subjective day, meaning that at some point, everyone's value is going to run out, its processing speed is going to grow slower with less labour to support it, and the last vestiges of stone from the Foundry will pass back in time. Unless every fragment of stone moves back from the Foundry every 48 hours, and all the iterations are just loops of the same changeable physical stone?

I'm loving the Fate Market setting so far - it feels whimsical, terrifying, and spectacular. Also really, really confusing.
