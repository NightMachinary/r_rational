That is actually a lot of the point, when your nestled deep away from the peripheries your unquestionably amazingly safe.

As long as you still haven't used up all of your value with the fatemarket.

In the fate market everyone has access to the entirety of their wealth over their lifetimes.

But that wealth is also in many regards also the extent of their certainty and control about their lives.

The residents are a bit less like fish and more like threads that are only so long that can be looped and woven through the expanse until their worth to the market forces involved is used up. And that will eventually happen. Every job and craft and product has an absolutely FINITE demand for it.

Transit back in time is a limited resource. And it has been hoarded greedily.

So yeah drifting into a periphery is suicide, except some times it's as much suicide as being poor is suicide.
