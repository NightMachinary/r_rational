I have other accounts, and will probably use them, but I think the new strategy will be to just "burn" individual accounts immediately after the challenge is over rather than allowing them to have continuous identities. I don't tend to write a story for the challenge unless there's something that really grabs my attention away from other projects, or I'm not working on anything with an explicit/implicit deadline.

(Part of my process for deciding on a challenge is seeing whether I can think of at least three good story ideas in a short period of time, and one of the risks to that is that I might stumble on something that it seems like I need to write to get out of my system.)

(There are currently six drafts in my Challenges folder that have enough meat on them that I want to finish them at some point, and another thirteen that are mostly bones and sketches. It's fairly common for me to start but not finish a story, especially for challenges, where I'm more comfortable walking into things half-baked.)
