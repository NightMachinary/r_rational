I think you're misunderstanding electrical current. The drift speed ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity]]) of electrons is actually quite slow: 0.00028m/s in cooper at 3 amps. So the electrons wont have time to homogenise in the system, which you've discharged your battery (or HV-cappacitor) into. So the spontaneous disappearance of electrons wont discharge the system.

Actually since the electrons you've created are clustered, you get some cool results. The large potential difference created by this will generate a current, with roughly equal magnitude opposing the previous charging current. Which means you're generating AC, and getting double the energy out of the system (compared to coil and magnet methods).

Edit: I should mention that all of this assumes, some weird cut off in your power. Electrons have got to go but the charge generated by a magnet is fair game. Which is extremely odd, but it's what you've stated =p
