Okay first thought is to get unlimited energy generation. To that end:

- Get 7 large transparent coil tubes and place them in a line while vertical.
- Get 6kg worth of the strongest magnets I can find (or just 6kg of coil).
- Jump down one of the coil tubes and create 6 clones at the top of the other tubes.
- When at the bottom of the coil tube and while still in freefall create another clone at the top of my current tube.
- Transfer consciousness to the newly created clone and recreate other clones at the top of all the other coil tubes.

You will be constantly accelerating at ~9.8m/s until you hit terminal velocity (around 56m/s). I cannot remember enough electromagnetism to work out how many joules you will be generating. However this method has numerous mechanical problems in its implementation. Also, one wrong move and you're a red smudge on the ground.

Second thought:

- Get yourself a superconducting battery ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_magnetic_energy_storage]]) with as much charge as feasible for a weight limit of 6kg.
- Create clones and have them discharge their batteries into some system which feeds the power grid.
- Rinse and repeat.

I believe this second idea is far more practical.
