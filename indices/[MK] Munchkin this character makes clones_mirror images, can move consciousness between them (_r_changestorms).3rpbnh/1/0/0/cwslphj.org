From the post EagleJarl linked to:

#+begin_quote
  His power is that he can create up to six copies of his own body + up to 6kg of stuff that he's carrying/wearing. Each clone can be created anywhere within 20 meters (~60'), but he needs to be able to see at least part of the clone when it appears. (EDIT: And there needs to be enough space for the clone to appear.)

  The clones always appear facing in the same direction as Arnoud.

  The clones appear with the same momentum as Arnoud.

Even if it's a fairly typical response, it is still follows EagleJarl's specifications for the thread; additionally it's probably the most efficient use you can get out of the power.

I mean most ideas come under two broad categories, either direct applications of force, or exploiting rarity. If you want a weapon just implement your own variant of the /"Rods from God"/ idea. If you want an item for a limited use case then just clone it.

However you most likely want to solve multiple problems. So it's better to use the power to generate some kind of currency, which can then be used to solve as many problems as possible. Electricity fits the bill quite nicely.

Really the only problems it doesn't solve are extremely esoteric ones (such as the life extension method detailed above). But I doubt the power is an optimal solution to those sorts of problems either.
