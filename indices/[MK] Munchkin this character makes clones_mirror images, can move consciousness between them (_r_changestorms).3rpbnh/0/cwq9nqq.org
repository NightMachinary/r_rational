This requires a reasonably high tech level, but:

Make a clone, cryogenically freeze them, then switch as necessary.

Or alternatively, clone himself the regular way, wait for the clone to grow, create a (power) clone, and then swap the heads between them.

Just some life extension stuff, basically. Not anything optimal, but it should help.
