of course, there's obviously a bunch of ways to generate "free" energy with them, but I think that, compared to the energy output of any powerplant, it's not going to make much of a difference. And anyways, in a universe where that's possible, either entropy isn't a problem once we get technologically advanced, or it doesn't actually change the energy paradigm anyways.

Though, on second though, I think this can be turned into an ansible. Imagine cloning himself holding a radioactive isotope. From however many feet away, there's someone holding a geiger counter. He dispells the clone, and the geiger counter immediately stops recording radioactivity, because the cloned and now broken down alpha particles disappear. And I know that this specific case works, because the human body needs some radioactive isotopes to function (I know I've seen cesium mentioned somewhere), so if the power couldn't properly synthesize them and their properties, it wouldn't be useful. And because e=mc hammer, The idea could probably be applied to any power source, so then he can go to any of (6! - 1) different states to send messages with instantaneously, if each clone sends a different frequency of light. (the math is probably wrong here, but I be people can think of more elegant solutions anyways.)
