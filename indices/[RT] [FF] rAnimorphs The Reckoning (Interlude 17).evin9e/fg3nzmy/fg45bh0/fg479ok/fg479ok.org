And for that, I wanted to give you some feedback that came to me like ten minutes ago.

Marco saying 'we kind of like Rachel now' is a really, really good way to remind people that Marco is in eighth grade. That is such a 13 year old thing to say - it's a credit to your writing you can weave immaturity (or at least the same outcomes that come from immaturity) with raw... Intelligence and strength. Really well done.
