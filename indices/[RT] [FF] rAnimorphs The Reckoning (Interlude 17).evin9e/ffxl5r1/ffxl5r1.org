I'm a bit confused as to what the ship really knows about or not:

#+begin_quote
  The holder of the Key was a shape the ship did not recognize, for it had spent only a very short time in the water before its masters had sent it to sleep

  ---for it was linked by gentle embrace with its makers' /other/ children, the Friends, and could know anything they knew---
#+end_quote

If it knows everything 'the Friends' know, why doesn't it recognize the giant squid? Or is that functionality still booting up from sleep?
