Well, I called the existence of the ship, but that was straight out of canon anyway so it was kind of cheating. We'll see if it can unlock the Chee themselves like it could in canon.

Puppyship is cute, but I'm a little disturbed by how it's so focused on pure hedonistic happiness. Like, it was about to drug Tobias into a stupor before the Chee stopped it. What would it do during a space battle?

  *Jake:* Hey ship, what was that tremor?

  *Ship:* [Rocked by swarms of enemy missiles] Everything's fine! No problem at all! Don't look out the windows! Would you like more pizza?
