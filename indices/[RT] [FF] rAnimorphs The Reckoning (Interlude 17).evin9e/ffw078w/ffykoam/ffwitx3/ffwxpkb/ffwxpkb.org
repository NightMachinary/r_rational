  Like, it was about to drug Tobias into a stupor before the Chee stopped it.

I was way more disturbed by the swarm of flying ticklebots.

  What would it do during a space battle?

It sounds like the ship obeys the Key holder regardless of predicted happiness, and the Chee cut the active link specifically so Tobias could talk about violence. I wonder if the Ellimist orchestrated the TPK so Tobias would be resurrected as a new "person", one who the Chee had never directly seen commit violence.

*Edit:* Like, the Chee obviously understand he's the same person, but the Censor isn't exactly a Chee mind. Maybe it can be fooled by the different Z-space signals, from the new instantiation of the morphing power?

*Edit 2:* In that first interlude, the Chee didn't seem all that shocked by the fact that teleportation happened, just confused about why. I wonder if the Pemalites had that kind of technology?
