Such a person would be limited by their memory in places where most people are limited by speed. I can't read a thousand books in a day because I don't read that fast. A speedster can't read a thousand books in a day because by the time she finished the last one she'd have forgotten everything about the first one.

Certainly that would affect the way they think. It's sort of the opposite problem to caching. A speedster might prefer to do the same calculation twice when most people would do it once and memorise the result, because repeating work is nigh-instantaneous and memory is the bottleneck.
