Let us take the superpower of Persuasion. They can convince anybody of pretty much anything by talking with them for a while, and later on just through letters. Conversations and letters don't have first order effects that are especially positive or negative, so I imagine you conside the actions neutral, not good or evil.

If this person were to converse and write letters to the all the key people in a government I would consider that to be taking over the government outside of the system (and without being the head of state). Agreed?

The policies that this person lobbies for depend on their alignment, but any alignment seems compatible with this position.
