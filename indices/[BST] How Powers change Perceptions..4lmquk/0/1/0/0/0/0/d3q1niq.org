  Conversations and letters don't have first order effects that are especially positive or negative, so I imagine you conside the actions neutral, not good or evil.

Not necessarily. Persuading someone to (say) commit murder would still be an Evil act, and using said power to Persuade someone to give you a lot of money could well be morally equivalent to robbery (if said power completely prevents the victim from refusing your request).

Similarly, Persuading a supervillain to release his hostages would be a Good act, and there's a whole spectrum between.

  If this person were to converse and write letters to the all the key people in a government I would consider that to be taking over the government outside of the system (and without being the head of state). Agreed?

Without actually taking the official title of 'head of state', yes (though at that point the title is just window dressing). Now, how does he deal with the police officers who want to arrest him for Use of a Superpower to Exert Undue Influence over the State, and who are very much not interested in negotiating about it (presumably to the point of wearing white-noise headphones)?
