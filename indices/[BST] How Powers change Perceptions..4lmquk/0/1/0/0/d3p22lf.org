Hmmmm... you can definitely take over a government while maintaining a Lawful Evil alignment with the right superpowers (e.g. mind-control people to vote for you). You /might/ be able to do it while maintaining a Lawful Good alignment, but not without doing at least /some/ Evil actions (unless you go the route of working entirely within the system, at which point even people without superpowers can do the same).

  Also, there's no need to be the head of state to take over a government.

But once you have taken it over, then are you not de facto head of state? No matter what your actual title, if any, is?
