I have yet to read a comic that tackles this question, but bigger fans than I have said it is one of Superman's reoccurring internal conflicts. Apparently there's a comic where he says he only does everything he needs to instead of everything he can so that people don't come to depend on him. Superman: Red Son is a What If where he landed in the USSR and, having been raised a communist, did do everything he possibly could to help people and it all backfired horribly in a way I found believable.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, All Star Superman heavily implies that he has changed the world by working with scientists to advance technology to the point where transhumanism is becoming a reality. Later in the story, he even finds a way to use the resources at his disposal to cure cancer. The same author even wrote another alternate universe comic where Superman was the President and used his powers and connections to pressure a middle eastern country into a nuclear treaty, which I personally found horrifying.
