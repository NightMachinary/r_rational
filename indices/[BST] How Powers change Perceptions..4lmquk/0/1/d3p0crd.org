  I think one of the biggest things comic books get wrong is the idea that only evil people would want to take over governments.

A person who starts out good might want to take over a government. But doing so by short-circuiting the defined processes to do so means you're morally at the same point as a military coup - there will be good people who will honestly think you are evil and attempt to remove you even if at the cost of your (or their) lives. At that point you either have to step back or do some fairly reprehensible things...

...or, in other words, it may be true that a good person might want to take over a government using superpowers. But, aside from being voted in, how can one do so while /remaining/ a good person?
