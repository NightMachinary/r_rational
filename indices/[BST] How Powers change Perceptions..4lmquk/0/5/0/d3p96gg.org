I despise Superman vs. The Elite. It's a cynical take-that at The Authority, which is kind of okay, even if they're right they do have their issues and are themselves pretty cynical.

But, as a concrete argument for why you should act like Superman it's just bad apologia. Basically, you should act like Superman cause people who don't act like Superman are monsters.

It's the same dichotomous thinking that gave us "if you kill him you will be just like him"
