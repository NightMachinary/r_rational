I get where you're coming from, but that's kind of the problem with fictional evidence. You can only use it within the logic of its own universe. That's something I had to get past when I first got into comics, but once I did I saw that they had artistic value for what they are. Even if Superman vs The Elite isn't rational, I still think it's a well-written story that respected my intelligence and challenged my views while completely changing my mind about a fictional character I'd always found rather boring. If anyone would like to watch it, you can find it for free on KissCartoon.
