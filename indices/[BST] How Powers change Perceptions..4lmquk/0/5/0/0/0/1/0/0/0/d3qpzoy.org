What kind of person is willing to kill people?

Cops, soldiers,spooks,generals, and the very politicians we elect, the unspoken promise being that they'll kill the right people when it comes down to it.

At the end of the day killing is not some alien act committed by purely unhinged types

If the only people who kill are unhinged...you see the issue for a frank moral argument right?

And yes, Superman lost control and punched one member if the Elite. He didn't seem to injure him yet this apparently demanded a fight to the death. It seemed like killing someone over an insult to me.
