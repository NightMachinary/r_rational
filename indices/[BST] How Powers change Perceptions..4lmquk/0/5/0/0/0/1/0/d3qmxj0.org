The simplistic element is that the Elite are unhinged. So it's not a competition between two strong viewpoints but a relatively trustworthy Superman and people who show signs of sliding off the slippery slope.

If the Elite hadn't been unhinged and had assassinated a few top leaders and had an actual plan for peace instead of silly,brutal nonsense , if they hadn't reacted to an insult from Superman by trying to kill him we might have had a better argument.

The Elite are standing in for the argument you're thinking of, but they're horrible representatives for it, cause the point is for Superman to definitively win by the end of the story.

The film pretends that it's making the argument youre thinking of, but it ends up making the argument that the Elite -and thus heroes who kill- cannot be trusted. So Superman almost wins by default.
