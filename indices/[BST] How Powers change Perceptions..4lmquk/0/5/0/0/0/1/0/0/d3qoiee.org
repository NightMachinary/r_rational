I think the reason I was okay with the Elite being unhinged was that I thought it made sense. What kind of person is actually willing to kill people? I also didn't get the impression that they challenged Superman because of an insult, but because he attacked them for killing people. He made himself their enemy and clearly intended to oppose their actions, so they decided to end him just like they promised to do with every "cancer".
