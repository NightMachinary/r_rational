  The idea that you would have non-powered politicians controlling superheroes or superpowered people is absurd,

You know, I hear this view a lot, and it always baffles me. It assumes that no superpowered people are law-abiding. In a rational world I would assume you would have some supers who consider themselves ubermensch and try to take over the country. You would have far more supers who believe in the rule of law and try to prevent the evil supers from taking over the country. This is your standard hero / villains split. It's exactly why only villains want to take over -- because the social contract related to appropriate methods of regime change is one of the most fundamental parts of a civilized nation. Once you use force to effect regime change you demonstrate that that's okay. Pretty soon you'll have revolutions brewing, other supers wanting their shot, etc.

Yes, you can construct worlds where it happens anyway -- if you have a world with one amoral God-level super and a bunch of bush-leagues, then the big one can take over. He'll still have to deal with passive resistance and coup attempts, but he can do it. The point is that these worlds were constructed to allow it. "Supers will inevitably take over" is not an always-true statement unless you choose it as an axiom.
