  I think one of the biggest things comic books get wrong is the idea that only evil people would want to take over governments.

I just had a discussion where I had to deal with someone going "well...there'll be a few ambitious malcontents but most people won't..." which is absurd. Comics have really tainted the conversation.

People are inherently embedded in a political system. The idea that the system would /allow/ them to escape first of all is not guaranteed and probably optimistic, let alone that they would go about never using their new powers to their advantage.

And why not? At the end of the day human societies have a "cost of doing business" where we accept that certain people will be crushed. Certain people will be fucked by judges, be executed on the orders of foreign-backed dictators, get hit by cars shoddily designed and fail to get recompense, have to deal with a shitty municipal body. People talk about the glorious nature of the system but a lot of it is inconvenient, and annoying and runs cause no one can take it apart.

Superheroes completely flip this on its head. The super won't be crushed, at the worst society will be.

And these are just reactive supers. As you say, I certainly wouldn't tolerate a lot of the bs you have to tolerate if I was one of those supers basically approaching complete independence like Superman and I don't think all the self-serving bleating about "freedom" from American tv would change anyone's mind. Should your family suffer, starve or be inconvenienced for movie speeches?

I do disagree that it'll be easy to effect good change though, especially in the real world. Well...perhaps change'll be easy if you have a big enough stick, but in terms of just effecting political change, the massive distrust would immediately put the brakes on most things you can achieve within the system.

Think of Caesar and Rome; sometimes he wasn't necessarily wrong about a problem so much as people didn't want /him/ to be the one dealing with it
