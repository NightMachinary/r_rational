Anything by Vernor Vinge or Peter Watts. Also the tropes on the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens][Starfish Aliens]] page. I know that this isn't what you are asking for, but writing about the mindset of an alien is simply a more extreme case of writing how super powers can oddly affect the human mind. So these references should be good for a starting point.
