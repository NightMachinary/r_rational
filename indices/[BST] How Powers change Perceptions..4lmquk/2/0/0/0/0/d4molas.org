Lemme just quote you the part where they discuss it.

[SPOILERS FOR THE MAKER'S ARK CHAPTER 2.]

It's in the third book: so far they have killed a god who did some nasty stuff with oracular time-travel, and thwarted an alien invasion/crusade with the purpose of killing all domesticated macrofauna. They are discussing what to do next, and the topic comes up:

  “It was what I didn't do,” said Doc. "To take an example not at random, she wondered why I was okay with Jumping Spider assassinating a highly placed person in the domestic intelligence community, but, for a number of other powerful men--she had a list--I wasn't willing to 'kill them with death robots, feed them to starving hyenas in Africa, or, at the very least, strand them somewhere they can subsist on bugs and tubers for the rest of their lives and not hurt anyone else ever again.'“

  "Oh.”

  “Which leads into what I wanted to talk about. Several of the people on that list are still in positions of power or influence, none have ever been prosecuted, and they would be very unlikely to be convicted even if they were. Wealth, connections, and corruption in political culture go a long way.”

  Doc turned back to face Flicker. "And you eventually accepted that you didn't have the skill to remove them yourself without causing too much damage.“

  "Yeah,” she said. "No point in burning down your house to kill the bugs. But I never really got why you didn't do anything about them--I just had to accept you weren't going to.“

  He nodded. "As I said at the time, just as there are things superhumans can do that normal humans cannot, there are things normal humans do that superheroes shouldn't. And that's become important for you to understand better, because you're more socially skilled and you've become quite popular. Saving the world tends to do that.”

  “So, I might think I can get away with something I can't?”

  “No, because you might succeed.” Doc smiled tightly. "No government can stop you by force, so you could, say, ignore the legalities, grab the people you consider the cause of a political problem, stash them somewhere, tap someone competent to run things temporarily, then appoint people or hold elections while keeping the 'wrong' sort of person out, and quite possibly end up with something fairer or more functional than before. And some people would object, but a lot wouldn't.“

  "And that would be bad?”

  “Yes, that would be very bad. Because it would set a precedent. What would you do the next time? You'd have experience, and a track record. You'd be the strong leader, supported by the people, coming in to sweep away the corruption and set things right. And there would always be people urging you on, telling you it's the only way to fix real problems, the only proper thing to do--your duty, even.”

  “Oh, shit,” said Journeyman. "That's mythology, and not the good kind.“

  "Yup,” said Doc. "Not religious, but ideological. And the ideology has a name that's been diluted by overuse, but this is its original form. It's called 'fascism'. It's bad enough with normal humans, and I consider it the single greatest hazard to a superhero getting involved in politics. The only reason we haven't had more of a problem is that the first superhero established a strong tradition against it.“
