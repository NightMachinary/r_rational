The Fall of Doc Future has a girl who can circumnavigate the globe in a second or so, and who can think fast enough that crowds become galleries of statues and bullets hang in the air. She has strange habits because she can always take time to think things through, and she can always go /look/ at things, no matter where they are in the world.
