I think one of the biggest things comic books get wrong is the idea that only evil people would want to take over governments. Generally speaking most people in the US don't think the government is doing a great job, have ideas about how it could be done better, and don't think they could achieve those changes himself or that it could be easily done. Change that last part to /thinking it's/ easily achievable because you have super powers and I think the situation would drastically change.

The idea that you would have non-powered politicians controlling superheroes or superpowered people is absurd, it would very quickly become the other way around even with the absolute best intentions and possibly especially with the best intentions.
