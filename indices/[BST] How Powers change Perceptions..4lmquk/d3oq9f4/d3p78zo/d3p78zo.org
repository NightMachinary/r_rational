Squadron Supreme explores the idea of heroes trying to overthrow governments to change the world, though I haven't read it and have only heard very good things about it. However, I have seen Superman vs The Elite (an expanded adaptation of the better named What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and The American Way?) that successfully deconstructs and reconstructs Superman's ideology when he encounters some new heroes that have good intentions but no respect of the law. It single-handedly managed to turn me into a Superman fan, so I highly recommend it.
