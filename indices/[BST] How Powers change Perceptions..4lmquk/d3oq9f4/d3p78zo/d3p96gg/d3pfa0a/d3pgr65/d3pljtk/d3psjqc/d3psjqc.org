  Superhero stories exist so that heroes can do heroic things, it's an escapist fantasy meant to emotionally resonate with the audience.

Right. But that doesn't mean it it makes a good argument just cause it's defending its genre conceits,presumably that's not all you'd want in a [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discussion.

I don't mind characters trying to do the right thing, I dislike the narrative around this one I dislike it cause it keeps showing up in discussions like these, often cited as a definitive argument. Along with that "jet powered apes" quote.
