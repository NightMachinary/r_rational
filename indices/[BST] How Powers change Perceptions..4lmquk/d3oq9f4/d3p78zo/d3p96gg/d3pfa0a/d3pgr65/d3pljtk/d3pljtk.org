I feel like your complaint is that the movie did exactly what it set out to do. You're right that the Elite are untrustworthy loose cannons that exist to validate Superman, but the Joker only exists to validate Batman in The Dark Knight. Superhero stories exist so that heroes can do heroic things, it's an escapist fantasy meant to emotionally resonate with the audience. Even dark deconstructions of the genre like Watchmen or Worm are about characters who keep trying to do what's right despite obstacles both internal and external. What did you want from the film that it didn't give you?
