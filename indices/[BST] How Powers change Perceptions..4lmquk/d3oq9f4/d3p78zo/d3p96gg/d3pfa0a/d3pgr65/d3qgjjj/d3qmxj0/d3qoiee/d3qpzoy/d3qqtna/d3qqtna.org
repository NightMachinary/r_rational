I meant personally killing someone, not just saying it should be done, and it actually is surprisingly rare. I've seen plenty of statistics indicating that police and soldiers go out of their way to avoid killing, to the point where the military recently changed internal policies to combat the problem. Police officers are also required to take leave and go to therapy after killing someone, since it's considering abnormal for a person to not be phased by the act.
