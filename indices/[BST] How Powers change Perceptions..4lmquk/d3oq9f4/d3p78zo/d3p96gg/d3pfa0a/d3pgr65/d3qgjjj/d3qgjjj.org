My memories of it are pretty hazy, but I think the central idea was that the Elite were willing to do morally bad things like murder (of criminals) in order to prevent what they felt would be greater harm later. (The crimes those criminals would have committed later.) Superman won't do this; is he right to respect the rule of law, or wrong to not prevent greater harm when he could easily do so? I don't find that a simplistic question at all.
