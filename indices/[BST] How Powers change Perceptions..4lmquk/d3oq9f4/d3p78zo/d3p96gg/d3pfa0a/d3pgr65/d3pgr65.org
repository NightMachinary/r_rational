Let me see if my memory of the Elite's actions is clear:

- They decided to go out and massacre the leaders of two countries cause they're going to war with one another.

- They execute a criminal they've defeated cause a victim voted for it.

- They decide to sadistically hunt and kill Superman cause he punched one of them.

How exactly is there a balanced portrayal here? Yeah, Atomic Skull hurts people but it's partly cause of the situation the government put him in after Superman caught him, the Elite /directly/ kill the leaders of two opposing countries for fighting, and just sorta expect it to work out, then decide to kill an iconic hero cause of an insult.

There's little morally threatening to Superman here, Superman's actions don't always work out, but the Elite's actions looked deranged at times. Just on a personal level, Superman can be trusted, the Elite cannot.

The story is there to validate Superman's position. Which is a thing that should always be noted with these sorts of stories; Superman is not going to become the Elite (or whatever they're supposed to represent), so the work finds a some strong-looking version of the arguments against his beliefs for him to defeat.
