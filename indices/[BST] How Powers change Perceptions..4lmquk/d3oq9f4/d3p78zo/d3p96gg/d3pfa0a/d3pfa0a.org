That is absolutely not the impression I got from it. I didn't agree with everything Superman did and didn't think I was supposed to. The Elite weren't monsters, they were well-intentioned extremists that pointed out Superman's failures and forced him to ask difficult questions about what he stood for. The movie is an indictment of moral simplicity from both the Lawful Good and Chaotic Good perspectives.

What I love about the film was that it allowed me to understand what Superman represents and why he is so important. He's pure idealistic compassion and he has become a cultural icon because of that. That doesn't mean he can't deal with morally complex issues or that his methods are the only answer, it just means he exists as an ideal we can look up to and try to reach for. Superman gives us hope for tomorrow.
