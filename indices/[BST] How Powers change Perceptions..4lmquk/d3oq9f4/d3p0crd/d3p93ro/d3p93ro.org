I wouldn't limit the discussion to just "take over" in the traditional sense of a military coup setting up shop in the capitol.

Someone can completely undermine it, by returning the world to some old-fashioned system of patronage and so on.

If Superman lands in a country and starts doing favors for people he considers good, while ignoring the bleating of this or that regulatory body, he is undermining the system.

The better he does, and the stronger he is the worse it is, until people may rely on him more than the system.
