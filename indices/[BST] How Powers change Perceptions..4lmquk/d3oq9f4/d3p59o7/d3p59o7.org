  The idea that you would have non-powered politicians controlling superheroes or superpowered people is absurd, it would very quickly become the other way around

Not unless the superpower directly related to the political process in some way, or the superperson was already politically-minded and used the power to show off, draw attention, or otherwise make people think they were pretty cool and voteworthy.

Most powers, though, or at least the standard ones, don't really help directly with politics. You can't bench-press a policy and smear campaigns don't care if you're invulnerable. Politicians would absolutely still be able to control most people with superpowers in the same way they control people without them - through social structures and policy. If you're willing to follow the law and you want people to like you, that's half the battle won for the politicians to start with. And most random people aren't necessarily going to be super-smart or super-witty or actually want to be a politician if they get powers.

(Reverse example: politician Nathan Petrelli from /Heroes/ went out of his way to /not/ reveal he could fly. No point in making the voters jealous or scared. Nothing to see here, just your totally normal representative who is totally a normal person just like you.)

Someone who did want to get into the political process, though, either through running for office themselves or influencing existing politicians, might be able to do so via powers like mind control/influence, super-charisma, or (I guess) powers which let them rig the voting process. But honestly, those are effects which can largely be bought with money anyway, at least to a degree.
