Not exactly. Even though so many people boast about toppling the government, they don't actual revolt against it, despite often having access to "superpowers" (firearms, home-made explosives). The reason is simple: there is always a fish bigger than them, which is army.

Similar situation would take place in a world with superpowers. People on the higher end would be most likely integrated into the upper class of society as celebrities or just rich guys, since their abilities may be easily turned into cash.

If a power would let you live comfortable and prosperous life, would you really throw it away for a small possibility of ruling a city, country or the world?
