This seems a bit of a stretch. There are other means of maintaining a connection to humanity that don't require the stuff heroics does. Especially since heroics forces you to use your power more than anything.

And we're not just talking about broader social ideas here, but fundamental thinking. I cannot stop perceiving optical illusions. However, if I got a perception power I might be unable /to/ perceive them. There's no amount of heroing that'd change something so basic.
