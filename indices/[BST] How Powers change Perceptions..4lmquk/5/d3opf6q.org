I think preventing this is one of the reasons superheroes have secret identities. They started using their powers because they wanted to be good samaritans and don't want to stop being normal just because they want to use their power to help people. Even if they aren't necessarily human, they still want to maintain a connection to humanity and view themselves as part of humanity.
