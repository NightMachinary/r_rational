Being a speedster sounds maddening socially.

Being able to see the future would make everyone else's choices seem highly irrational due to hindsight bias.

Being able to split into multiple bodies would likely strongly disrupt how you view productivity, individuality, and more.

Being able to float around as a ghost without body would change your impression of the mind body problem.
