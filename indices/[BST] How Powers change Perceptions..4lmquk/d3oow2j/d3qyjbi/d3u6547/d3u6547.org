One thing about speedsters I haven't seen much of is how fast their brains must be. Yes they have to have unbelievable reflexes, but there's enough evidence in cannon to show that they are comprehending to the world around them and not simply acting on reflex.

For example, a speedster who can read a book in a second and remember all of it must have crazy high intelligence. If the want to, they could easily bring about a scientific revolution since they'd be able to study every field out there in depth and would be uniquely situated to cross pollinate those ideas and apply the breakthroughs of each field to many others.
