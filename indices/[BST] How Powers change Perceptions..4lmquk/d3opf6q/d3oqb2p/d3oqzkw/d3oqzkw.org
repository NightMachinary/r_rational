Considering what superheroes would be capable of if they were not constrained by human values, I think it's a bias we can tolerate. There's also more than a couple stories about this idea, even the Superman: The Animated Series had an episode where he admitted "I have to be Clark. I am Clark. I'd go crazy if I had to be Superman all the time!"
