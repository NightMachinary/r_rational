Hanno in the Free Cities is seen in the three Heroic Interludes and the three Calamity interludes of Book 3. He defends the cities of Delos and Nicae from the attacks of Kairos and the Calamities. The closest thing to an offensive action he takes is killing 15 magisters of Stygia in Heroic Interlude: Injunction, to prevent them from bringing their slave army to Nicae.
