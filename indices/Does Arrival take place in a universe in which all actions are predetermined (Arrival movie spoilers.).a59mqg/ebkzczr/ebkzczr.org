Arrival definitely seems to occur in a predetermined universe. But note that this is not necessary to explain the main character's behavior w.r.t. her sick daughter.

Even if the sick daughter who dies early is only one of many possibilities, Amy Adams' character never sees any of those other possibilities. Her heptapod-like perception (or flashes of perception) of time means that she experiences the possible future with her sick daughter as the present actuality. That is, as far as she's concerned, she has a daughter whom she loves very much, and would like to spend time with, and children aren't exactly interchangeable. It's natural that she would choose the exact sequence of events she remembers from the future that would lead to the sick daughter being born, even she and the universe had other possibilities.

Small variations in timing, though potentially important, aren't in this case, since the future she saw was the one in which she'd already seen the future. That is, it's not like there's an original timeline with no foreknowledge that she was trying to match to make her daughter come to be. Rather, the timeline that she saw, in which her daughter came to be, was one in which she'd already seen the timeline and all her future actions. There's no room for Primer-style small variations to have big consequences because there are no small variations.
