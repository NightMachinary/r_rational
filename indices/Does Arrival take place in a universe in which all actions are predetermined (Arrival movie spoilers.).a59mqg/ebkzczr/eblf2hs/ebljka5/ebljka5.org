I think the universe she's in is predetermined, so she doesn't actually have the freedom to misstep like that.

But the bit you quoted was an attempt to answer OP's implicit question about why, in a counter-factual world that wasn't predetermined and she could have her choice of futures, she would choose the tragic future she saw instead of trying to get to another, happier, one. (Because she loved the child she had, not the ones she might have had)
