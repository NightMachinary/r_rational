Chiming in a bit late here but I think there are a couple of points worth mentioning. In the original short story the universe is deterministic. In the short story the main character's daughter dies in a skiing accident, and there is nothing she can do to prevent it.

The movie takes a subtly different spin. At one point her daughter asks her a question and she doesn't know the answer, later in the movie she learns the answer (my memory is confounding me but I believe it was the meaning of a specific phrase) and at that point you see the future scene with her daughter again and this time it plays out differently and she tells her daughter the meaning. This very clearly shows that time is mutable and she can choose to make (some) changes.

The fact that she chooses to have her daughter knowing that her daughter will die and it will cost her her marriage is absolutely saying that she valued the time with her daughter enough to make the end worth it. To Amy Adam's character her perception of time had changed so that although she was traversing along it in a moving point, the future was still to some degree real. She essentially had experience of every point of her shared life with her daughter and to choose not to conceive her daughter would have been wiping out all of that.
