If you go the multi-line theory then yeah you're right you don't get the info-from-nothing problem, but as you say you run into other problems, but it's a similar info problem - How do you access another timeline if you can't have info about that timeline? (Because by definition a separate timeline has no info sharing until the first time travel, the time travel is the info sharing)
