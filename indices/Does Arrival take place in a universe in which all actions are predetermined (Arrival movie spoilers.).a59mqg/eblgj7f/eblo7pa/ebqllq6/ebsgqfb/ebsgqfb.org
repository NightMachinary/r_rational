I don't mean different timelinesI know I'm bad at explaning this kind of thing so Ill just link the relevant papers.

Just something like the formulation used in this paper.[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01496.pdf]]( there's also the original paper by Deutsch [[https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197]] but its behind a paywall, use schihub if you are interested ).

You can easily get information out of nothing , but basically what you are doing in many wolrds interpertation of qm terms is making the branches of the wavefunction were you don't get the info not happen.

Its really weird , but perfectly consistent , and not paradoxical.And complex information being generated is more unlikely.

Isolated qubits like in scot aronson's papers could work however( and not make that region of spacetime a crazy mess like it would happen if you sent lots of atoms back in time, which would impose crazy consistency requirements that make human concepts like the human that is made of those atoms wanting to kill their grandfather seem irrelevant, and means you most likely don't get to ever use that kind of time machine), and that is already "generating info out of nothing ".
