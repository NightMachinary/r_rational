nah, in the movie reality is still predetermined. The heptapods came to Earth because in the future humans help them, because they came to Earth. They mention how the heptapods simply don't understand certain kinds of Earth math, but gets others just fine, with difficulty not being an issue - it's because to the heptapods, everything has already happened, and is happening, and will happen. The universe is predetermined.

The heptapods can't change the future. That's why one of them still dies; it knew it died there, because that's what happens.
