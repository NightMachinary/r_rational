Yes, that is kind of the point. Adams learns to value the here and now despite knowing where it will end.

The heptapods even get confused about how humans view the world with the "there is no time" comment. Humans think that time exists sequentially, while the heptapods see it as a "one long moment," so to speak. Speaking in past and future tenses on what could happen or what had happened simply doesn't make sense to them since the future "already happened" to them, and as Adams' knowledge of their language increases, she can glimpse that instantaneous perception of time too.
