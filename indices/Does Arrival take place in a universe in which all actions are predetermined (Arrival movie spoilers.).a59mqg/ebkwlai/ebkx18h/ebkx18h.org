  Reality is predetermined. We only perceive randomization because we are unable to calculate all effective factors.

  A perfect measurement of reality would be reality, because all effects are real, measurable, and caused by previous effects, all the way back to the beginning of the universe.

I thought quantum mechanics makes it so some (microscopic but still butterfly worthy) effects can be caused by randomness, not by previous effects, making perfect determinism impossible.
