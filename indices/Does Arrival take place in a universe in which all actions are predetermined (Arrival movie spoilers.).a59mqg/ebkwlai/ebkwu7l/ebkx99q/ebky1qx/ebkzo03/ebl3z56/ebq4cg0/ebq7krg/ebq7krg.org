From what I have read in the book, he doesn't agree with MWI, but he still presents the arguments for it and against it in a way that's easy to understand.

I won't say that he dismisses it, more just that he simply doesn't agree with it. Despite that, he still presents both MWI and CI in a fair manner and clearly enough to understand how they work and how they differ (which isn't always the case for other books on quantum mechanics for the layperson).

Let me know what you think of the book! I'm really curious to see what reactions other people have to the book and if it's as helpful as it was for me.
