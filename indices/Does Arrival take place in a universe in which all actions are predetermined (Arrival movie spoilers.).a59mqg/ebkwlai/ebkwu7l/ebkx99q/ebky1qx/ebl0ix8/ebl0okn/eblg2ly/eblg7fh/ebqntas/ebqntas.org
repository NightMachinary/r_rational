First off, I wasn't using entanglement correctly. Replace entanglement with "particle/wave".

#+begin_quote
  Anything that we find through observation collapses the waveform?
#+end_quote

Anything that it interacts hard enough with it. It's a packet of energy and if it transforms thats a collapse (aka hiting a wall) Of course we only known how it works through observation.

#+begin_quote
  The fact that it seems to care in some way about what +we+ a human is observing or can, in principle, observe, is what I mean about "privileging human perception".
#+end_quote

Its about information transfer, which is the " can, in principle, observe". The language around the explanation is just shit platonic language because that's what we normally use to talk with.

#+begin_quote
  Because in CI it's a physical phenomenon, there has to be /one/ event that collapses the wave for /everyone/, and it just so happens that it's usually when some sufficiently informative instrument or sufficiently advanced observer polls it.
#+end_quote

Actually it's happening all around us all the time, that's kinda the point of the idea. It almost never "just so happens". Of course we only know about it when we look!

Honestly though I'm rather a minimalist when it comes to all this. If the math works the math works. Come up with ways to test if there's other patterns behind the patterns we are currently seeing, but otherwise I don't think the interpretations are worth much. Like in CI, if waveform collapse is an event its a different beast from what we have been calling events up till now.
