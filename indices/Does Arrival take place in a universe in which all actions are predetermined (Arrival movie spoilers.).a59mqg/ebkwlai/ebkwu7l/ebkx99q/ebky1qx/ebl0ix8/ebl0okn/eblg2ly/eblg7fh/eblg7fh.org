What are the boundaries of the entanglement?

Anything that we find through observation collapses the waveform?

Hmm.

Sounds like an unnecessary (and very complicated, hard to encode) axiom to me.

Edit: In order to contrast this with MWI, it explains apparent wave collapse like this:

A superposition entangles with other particles as it interacts with them and those particles' states start to depend on the state of the original superposition. Those other particles then enter a superposition that corresponds with the original. As we observe a superposition, the particles of light entering our eyes are entangled and superposed. When they hit our retina, the particles in our retina become correspondingly superposed. As signals are sent to our brain, our neurons get superposed, /just like everything else does/.

This requires no additional postulates or axioms. Our particles behave just like everything else.

Our subjective experience of being in a superposition just happens to be "pick a position at random (weighted according to the born rule) and stay there". As we do this, the waveform appears to collapse. It's because we've "decided" which position we're seeing, not because the other positions stopped existing.
