MWI is pretty cool, and I'd love to hear it proven, but I'm not ready to subscribe to it yet. It's just not very testable and it raises so many questions and requires so many assumptions. The Copenhagen interpretation has had some holes punched in it, but I feel like it is a simpler, less complex explanation that will likely prove to be closer to the actual truth.
