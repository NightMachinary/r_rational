I don't think it's at all clear that which sperm fertilizes an egg is sufficiently unpredictable that it can be changed by a plank-scale deviation in position.

Nor is it obvious that no two sperm are similar enough to produce phenotypically identical children when all otehr major variables (egg, mother's hormones, etc.) are identical.

I think an attractor set in which having sex with the same man at the same time is adequate to ensure an identical child at the level of detail Amy observes in her visions, is plausible to a degree grater than there existing aliens with interstellar travel and the ability to remember the future.
