There's no information from nothing paradoxes and there's an obvious way to make it work whith Qm I think.

You just have all the posible casually consistent timelines existing.

In some of them it just happens to look like knowdelenge is created. But most loops will close in simpler wayand its not actually paradoxical. Realisticaly time travel would not be posible at all though, since branches where nothing time travels are way more likely. So we might even live in a universe with time travel and some caracter√≠stics of it that we take for granted actually a consecuence us being much more likely to live on universes whithout time travel.
