The takeaway is that we cannot in principle (edit: perfectly) predict the future even with full information. We could, in principle, map out the entire structure of everett space if we were sufficiently omniscient, but there would remain the question of which path we should anticipate taking, and nothing /in/ everett space can tell us that except hindsight (because really, we take them all).

For all subjective intents and purposes, decoherence is a source of true randomness.
