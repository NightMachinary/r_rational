  The story you experience seems pretty random, but nothing about the book ever changes. It's prewritten and fixed. Immutable. Except what page you are on.

It sounds less like a book and more like a search space. An infinite search space given structure by an equation or collection of equations (universal laws). Are you saying every possibility in that infinite search space /actually/ exists somewhere?

Why? Isn't that merely one of many different possible quantum models?

Can you recommenced some good books or resources on quantum stuff? I gave up on that subject years ago when I kept on running into that question, "Isn't that merely one of many different possible quantum models?", but maybe I should get back into it.
