The absolute best book I have ever read for explaining what superposition really means and how quantum mechanics is really about information instead of physics is [[https://www.amazon.com/Q-Quantum-Terry-Rudolph-ebook/dp/B074DYJTKN/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544560541&sr=8-1&keywords=q+is+for+quantum][Q for Quantum]].

It's the most well-explained introduction to quantum mechanics that I have ever heard of and it's simple enough that middle-schoolers could be reasonably expected to understand it. It doesn't even use any mathematical concepts beyond arithmetic and logic, but it makes for a great foundation for understanding the math in related quantum concepts if you chose to read beyond this book.

It won't explain everything, but it really helps to make a lot of aspects of quantum mechanics intuitive.
