According to Stephen Wolfram, the "laws" we observe are emergent phenomena from underlying, possibly deterministic or possibly probabilistic, processes that are akin to cellular automata. Matter and energy changes in the "grid" according to what matter and energy constitute its "neighbors", and in the aggregate this is observable as F=ma, b=1/d^{2,} etc etc.

Unfortunately it appears to be unfalsifiable, however it is interesting.
