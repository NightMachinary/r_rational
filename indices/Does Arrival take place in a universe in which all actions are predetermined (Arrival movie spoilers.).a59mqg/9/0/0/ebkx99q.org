Right. The term is "hidden variables" or more broadly the question of whether the universe is deterministic. At the macro scale, it appears to be deterministic, but at the quantum scale, everything is non-deterministic and governed by probability. Of course this is one of the biggest questions in physics and philosophy, so there is room for that to be wrong, but all the data points to a non-deterministic universe.
