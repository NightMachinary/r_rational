  I don't think it's at all clear that which sperm fertilizes an egg is sufficiently unpredictable that it can be changed by a plank-scale deviation in position.

Brownian motion is a bunch of molecules bouncing off of each other. If they hit from a slightly different angle, they'll deflect at a much greater angle. It's kind of like a bunch of billiard balls bouncing off of each other. You're not going to hit it a little different but still have every ball end up in basically the same place.

  Nor is it obvious that no two sperm are similar enough to produce phenotypically identical children when all otehr major variables (egg, mother's hormones, etc.) are identical.

Just looking at which chromosome gets picked it's a one in 2^{23} = 8,388,608 chance. But they also switch some of the DNA before getting selected by the sperm, so even then they won't be quite the same. Just look at any pair of fraternal twins. They're not the same.
