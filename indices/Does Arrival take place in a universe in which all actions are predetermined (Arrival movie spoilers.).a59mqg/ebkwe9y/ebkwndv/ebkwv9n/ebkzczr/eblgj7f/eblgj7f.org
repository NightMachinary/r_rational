Its a single timeline just like harry potter. She has the kid because that what has already happened. She doesn't pause and do something different, she does the thing she has already done. Everything she does with knowledge of the future makes that future happen.

Does it make perfect sense? Of course not time travel is a fantasy. Of course it doesn't make sense with QM, and all time travel has information from nothing paradoxes, thats time travel.
