  Reality is predetermined. We only perceive randomization because we are unable to calculate all effective factors.

The uncertainty principle says you can't.

Unless you're one of the old-school hidden variable types who are trying to recreate the clockwork Universe of Newton by saying that the interaction depends on "hidden" interactions we haven't detected yet, and which keep getting harder to find every time someone performs an experiment testing for them, you have to accept that the information necessary to predict future states of the universe does not exist in the universe. That's true for the MWI interpretation, the Copenhagen interpretation, even oddball schemes like the pilot-wave hypothesis.
