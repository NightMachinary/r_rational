Yes, but it's interesting to discuss if it weren't. It could also be a recursively self consistent timeline, as in Harry Potter (and as explored in HPMOR). Though he has a sense of agency, Harry can't not do the actions that lead to the future he sees. There's no real justification for this, he just...doesn't do it, in the story. Presumably time gets mad at you and punishes you and still causes the revealed future to occur, but in a more unpleasant way, for those who try to mess with it. That means, from a God's eye view, that any given story can be viewed as a single, self consistent timeline...or multiple branching but still self consistent timelines.

Amy Adams is in a similar circumstance, except unlike Harry who only sees small glimpses of non-linear time, Amy sees the entire timeline of her life.

This means that, if there existed such a vision of the future that seeing it would alter Amy's actions, Amy wouldn't see it. Amy will only see such a future as will remain stable and will occur despite her seeing it.

In the book, she says that whereas her human thoughts perceive a cause and effect creating past, present, and agency over the future...her heptapod thoughts perceive the entire timeline in a single instant.

We can conclude that whatever she perceived with her heptapod perception (including any urges that came upon her) was perfectly consistent with the actions she chose.

Accordingly, she should be able to act upon future information so long as those actions do not alter the future. (So if the future she saw was one consistent with using future information, she can and will and must use that future information.)

It's not /necessarily/ deterministic, it's possible that Amy is able to choose between multiple possible self consistent timelines (as Harry in fact does). It's even possible that this involves multiple points of decision (as in Harry's case). However the text itself seems to suggest that it is pretty pre-determined in that Amy doesn't /want/ to do anything other than what she knows she will do, and the text doesn't mention any multiple self consistent timelines. This suggests that only one self consistent timeline exists and reveals itself to the heptapod.

Presumably, since Amy sees the /entire/ future, and she only sees /one/ timeline, things are deterministic for her. That doesn't mean their aren't non-determinstic branching points that extend past her line of time-sight (her lifetime)
