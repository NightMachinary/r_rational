What do you mean by "predetermined"? If you mean deterministic, most likely not. Even if it's otherwise deterministic, stable time loops can resolve multiple ways, and it's presumably random which actually happens. Though it's possible that there is some rule that can be used to predict it.

If you're asking about whether it follows [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_presentism][presentism]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)][eternalism]], then presentism makes even less sense than normal in this case, but it's confused to begin with.

There's two types of time travel: single timeline and multiple timeline. With single timeline time travel, all travel is earlier in the same timeline. With multiple timeline, you create a new timeline when you time travel. Arrival uses single timeline. It's impossible for Amy's future child to change since it's the same child. It's not that the same events happen each time. They only happen once. You just see them multiple times if you're not looking at things from a linear perspective.
