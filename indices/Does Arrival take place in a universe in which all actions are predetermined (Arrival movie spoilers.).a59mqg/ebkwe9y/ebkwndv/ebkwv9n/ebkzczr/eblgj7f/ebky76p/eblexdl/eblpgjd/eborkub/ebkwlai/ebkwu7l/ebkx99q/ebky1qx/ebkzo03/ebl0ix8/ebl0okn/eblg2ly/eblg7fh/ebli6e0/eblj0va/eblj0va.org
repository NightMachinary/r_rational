  Any interaction collapses the wave function
#+end_quote

But any interaction /doesn't/ collapse the wave function. If that was true, coherence would be completely unstable. Hitting the half-silvered mirror would collapse the wave. We wouldn't be able to build qubits, because "calculation" falls under "any interaction". And yet, qubits.

There are certain things that collapse it and certain things that don't. CI suggests it's "observation" or "measurement" and then goes on to define what that actually means as a post-hoc list of things that have collapsed the wave function in the past. If we were to come up with an experiment that tests the current grey zone, I doubt any CI adherent could provide a confident prediction as to the outcome, because there's no /explanation/ in CI, just a list of past results, and the grey zone is between opposing entries on the list. The fact that it seems to care in some way about what +we+ a human is observing or can, in principle, observe, is what I mean about "privileging human perception".

Because in CI it's a physical phenomenon, there has to be /one/ event that collapses the wave for /everyone/, and it just so happens that it's usually when some sufficiently informative instrument or sufficiently advanced observer polls it. But there's no way to know precisely, because any chain that results in you knowing is you polling it. All we know is we can calculate with "coherent" phenomena, but by the time +we+ a person (but probably not a dog, or maybe, who knows? A photon detector yes, but certainly not a half-silvered mirror. Maybe a dog that's been trained to bark if it sees a photon) sees the result, it's "collapsed" somewhere along the way.

And also, for some reason, if a quantum phenomenon gets too "macro", it disappears, but this is completely different from the observer phenomenon, for some reason. How much is too much? Well we're not sure but we have this list of past results...

--------------

MWI suggests it's when the neurons of the observer are sufficiently entangled with the phenomenon to themselves be superposed, and that apparent collapse is relative to each observer. While I am aware of the "result of the experiment", the wave has "collapsed" for me, but for you, who I have not yet told, the worlds are still overlapping, and the wave is "still" in a superposition.

A quantum computer in MWI will work for anyone who has been kept isolated from the knock-on effects of the superpositions it uses to calculate, and will not work for anyone who hasn't. Observing the behavior of someone who has been deisolated is almost certainly enough to deisolate you, and certainly talking to them about what they've experienced is. Because what they'd say (and how they'd act) is entangled with the phenomenon.

Decoherence occurs when a superposition becomes too "macro" because its knock-on effects have become wide-spread enough for the superposition to become entangled with our brains by osmosis, /the exact same phenomenon as observation/. The novelty here is that a phenomenon can be "too macro" for some people and not for others. This is much less complex than positing that it's a completely different phenomenon, with a completely different explanation, which we also don't know.

Entanglement and associated decoherence is a local phenomenon. The world doesn't collapse, we do. And it's contagious.

"An unimaginably huge infinite set of other universes" sounds like a big deal, but it's not hard to /describe/ or /implement/, it just takes a lot of hardware resources to /run/. And we've observed our universe is at the very least a pretty well-endowed computer.

The /code/ to write MWI is simpler than CI. The math is simpler.

MWI just takes more RAM.
