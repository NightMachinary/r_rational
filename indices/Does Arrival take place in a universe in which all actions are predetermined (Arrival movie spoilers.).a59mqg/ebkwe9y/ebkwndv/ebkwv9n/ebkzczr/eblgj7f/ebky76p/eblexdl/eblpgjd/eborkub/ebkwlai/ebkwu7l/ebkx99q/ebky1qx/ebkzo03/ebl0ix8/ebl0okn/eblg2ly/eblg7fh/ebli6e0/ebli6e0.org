As the person above said, no need for consciousness in CI. Any interaction collapses the wave function. That's not even unique to Copenhagen, it's just the basic math that defines all interactions in QM and applies to MWI also. The difference is mainly that CI implies that the waveform collapse is an actual physical action, whereas MWI says that this doesn't really occur, just occurs for all practical intents and purposes from our reference frame.

Copenhagen says that there is one observable universe, MWI implies an unimaginably huge infinite set of other universes which is a pretty big leap to me.

But there are so many other interpretations too. De Broglie pilot wave theory is one I really like and string theory/M theory build on CI in some interesting but untestable ways. Until there's some evidence towards one or the other though, I'm not "subscribing" to any of them since they are all pretty incomplete. They're all fun to think about, though.
