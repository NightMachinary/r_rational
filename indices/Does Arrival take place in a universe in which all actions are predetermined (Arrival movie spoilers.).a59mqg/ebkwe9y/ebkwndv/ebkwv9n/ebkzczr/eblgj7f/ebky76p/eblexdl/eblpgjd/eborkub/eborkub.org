The neat philosophical idea at the core of Arrival is the combination of the physics "principle of least action" with the linguistics/cognitive science "Sapir Whorf hypothesis" - yes, the author was serious about his thought experiments.

I'll briefly describe these ideas and how they combine in Arrival, and this should answer your question. But you should really read the original short story "Story of Your Life" - it explores this very cohesively (as opposed to the movie which became heavily Hollywoodized).

The Sapir Whorf hypothesis was trendy in the 1960s, a cool idea but mostly not taken seriously these days. It simply says that the language one speaks significantly shapes the way one's brain works, and the way one perceives the world.

The "principle of least action" is a very general and enormously powerful interpretation of physics which, does *not* phrase things in terms of cause+effect, but instead looks at complete trajectories of a system across time and specifies the rules that characterize entire trajectories. While a typical way of describing physics would say "given the current conditions (position and velocity), this is what will happen next", the principle of least action instead says things like "a complete trajectory of light will consist of straight lines, and interactions with shiny surfaces where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection". This way of looking at physics only talks about "complete stories", and the "arrow of time" doesn't show up at all.

The thought experiment behind Arrival basically asks, since there are two languages for talking about physics (the cause+effect language, and the "characterizing complete stories" language), what if there were aliens that thought entirely in this second language? It's not that they have superpowers or can see the future, just they conceptualize only characteristics of completed stories, and don't perceive cause+effect, nor the flow of time.

On our world, every kid intuitively knows about cause+effect, while the logically equivalent "principle of least action" is only seriously taught at the advanced undergraduate level as an exotic alternative; consider an alien world where these facts are flipped: every kid-alien intuits the principle of least action, but "cause+effect" is an opaque abstraction taught only to ambitious aliens who are really good at math.

The main character of Arrival is, naturally, a linguist (with a physicist best buddy), and the main point of the story is that, as she learns the alien's language, she starts thinking in this alien way, losing her perception of time, and gaining a perception of the complete trajectories of stories.

Naturally, such a perception of time would be an emergent property of her brain across her entire life, and she would not be able to fully realize the thoughts outlined in the story until the end of her life. Each moment of her life contributes to a single timeless perception of the trajectory of her life, once she thinks in the alien language. But the fact that her consciousness is an emergent illusion wouldn't bother her, just as the (different) emergent illusions that characterize our consciousness don't bother us. And while this stretches the believability of the Sapir Whorf hypothesis to a wild extreme, there is well documented neuroscience demonstrating that our perception of time is full of illusions and inconsistencies, forced on us by quirks of processing in our brain (see, e.g., [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866156/]]).

In short, Arrival isn't "just another time travel story", but rather the consequence of taking an extremely foundational, standard, influential, yet counterintuitive view of physics, and writing a story simply asking "what would it take to truly embrace this as a way of thought?"

The story is thus *completely* within mainstream physics, and isn't trying to say anything controversial about predetermination; but it is outside mainstream cognitive science/linguistics, and that is what makes it interesting.
