I mean if you subscribe to manyworlds (/cough/ as you should) you can go up a level and get back to a deterministic structure. The problem is, we don't experience the world on that level.

It's like a choose your own adventure book, except at every crossroads you assign a probability to take each path proportional to the square of how many pages will be down that path, and then you roll some dice to pick.

The story you experience seems pretty random, but nothing about the book ever changes. It's prewritten and fixed. Immutable. Except what page /you/ are on.

As far as we're concerned, any decoherence event is a source of true randomness. But really it's an illusion.

The universe isn't random, but we are. *holds up spork*
