I may have created that term from established conventions. I feel like I've seen it used before but maybe not.

The way I meant it is to refer to the "search space" you mentioned that is comprised of every everett branch. Basically the mathematical description of everything that exists in every possible quantum position.

It's the book itself in my CYOA analogy.
