I'm not sure why everyone is saying it's predetermined: the entire sequence of events is hinged on it /not/ being predetermined. The Heptapods reveal that they only came to Earth to change the far future, since in the original timeline they all die to disease without future-humanity's help. All Heptapods live in an outside-time context, and are still able to change the future so that their race survives, so it can't be a predetermined universe and Amy's future isn't predetermined either.

There's still the case of Amy maybe not knowing /how/ to change her future, though. Just because the Heptapods are able to change it doesn't mean it's easy.
