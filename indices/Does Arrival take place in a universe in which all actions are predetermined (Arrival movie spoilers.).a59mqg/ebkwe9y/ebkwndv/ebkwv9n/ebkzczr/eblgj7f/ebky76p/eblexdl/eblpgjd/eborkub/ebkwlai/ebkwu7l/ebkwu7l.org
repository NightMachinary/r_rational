Are we talking IRL? Because the part of real life that throws a wrench in that is that we only perceive part of the quantum superposition we're always in, and which part we experience perceiving is subjectively random.

It can't depend on past configurations in principle because those past configurations also produced another “us” that are experiencing each other everett branch, and they could in principle be asking themselves the same questions and remember the exact same past.

The universe isn't random; every branch happens exactly as previous conditions dictated. It's a trick of our limited perception - our ability to only subjectively experience one branch exclusively - that creates subjective randomness, but even still, the particular world we see, experience and have access to is determined subjectively by a roll of the dice and the born rule.
