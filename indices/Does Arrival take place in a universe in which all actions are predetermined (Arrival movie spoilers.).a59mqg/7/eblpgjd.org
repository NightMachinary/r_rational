Short version: You're attempting to view the timeline of the movie in a linear fashion. Notionally, Adam's character was "able" to view the "future" information because time stopped being linear to her. Under that view, there is no future, and so there is no changing the future.

When you have information moving through time, AFAIK/short version, you either have meta-time (the dimension along which the timeline changes) or you have a "constant" universe where the timeline is static. In "Arrival" it's the later, in most other fiction (terminator, et all) it's the former.

There might be some wiggle room in there with quantumn funniness and the gap between determinism and knowable (see Scott Aaronson's lecture on free will), but I figure you'd /still/ not get a "changing" timeline.
