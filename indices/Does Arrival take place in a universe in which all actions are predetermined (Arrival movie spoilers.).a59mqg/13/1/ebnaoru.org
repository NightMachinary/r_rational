Is it explicitly stated that the Hetpapods are changing their future rather than 'recreating' it? (I suspect not, but am not entirely certain)

​

To the best of my recollection the Heptapods contacted humanity for similar reasons to Amy "choosing" to have her daughter.

They remember that humanity will be essential to their survival when they get the disease they remember they will have and they remember that now is when they are going to contact humanity so they "choose" to contact humanity now. (And this explanation would sound natural and really obvious if it were being written in Heptapod. Not weird and somewhat contradictory like it does in English)
