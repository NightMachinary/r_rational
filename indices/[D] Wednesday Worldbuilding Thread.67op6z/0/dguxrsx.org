Seeking: Someone who understands organizational theory, mediation, dispute resolution, and/or related topics; and/or suggestions for books on the same; and/or links to relevant subreddits, forums, websites, etc.

I've recently realized that I've made some unconscious assumptions about how certain fictional problems could best be handled, and I want to find out what other options might be available. One example: publicly precommitting to use a neutral third-party mediator in case of a dispute has certain advantages, but I don't know enough about the topic to know if this might lead to any unfortunate incentives that wouldn't appear with some other dispute-resolution scheme, or that might be handled by being careful about certain details. Also have some questions on several related topics.

Any pointers?
