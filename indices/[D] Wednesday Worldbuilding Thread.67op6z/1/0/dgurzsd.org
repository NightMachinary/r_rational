Obligatory not a biologist. Unfortunately, I don't think that rocks have anything /near/ enough energy inside them to sustain macrofauna, especially when you consider how much rocks weigh. All known macrofauna, except for some ocean bound species like jellyfish and coral, rely on plants directly or indirectly to get their energy. They rely on humongous unstable molecules to get their energy, either proteins, carbohydrates, or triglycerides, none of which can last millions of years virtually unchanged. Even a /completely free, weightless/ source of energy isn't enough for most things. Moving just takes too much energy. You might be able to get away with chemical reactions between elements, but the purity and amount you would need them in would mean that nothing could evolve to depend on them before you ran out.

The only energy source that could be depended on, I think, is nuclear. I'm pretty sure that a specialized metabolic system could basically capture the effects of photosynthesis, except instead of molecules aimed at the sun it would be individual radionuclides. [[#s][tag]]

Of course, even if they can't use rocks for fuel, they should be perfectly capable of digesting rock. I know of one sea sponge that uses glass to build it's skeleton, and there's a mollusk with magnetite teeth.
