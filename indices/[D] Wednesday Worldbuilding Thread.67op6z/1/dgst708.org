Any Biologists/Chemists around? What are the minimal conceits necessary for a hypothetical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotroph][chemolithotrophic]] (rock eating) macrofauna to exist, on an earth-like planet? By earth-like, I mean in addition to similar size, gravity, solar radiation, etc., it can also support humans (with minimal alterations) and familiar types of animal and plant species.

Would it be enough for them to have several mechanisms to get energy, and live in a persistent (on geological timescales) hot, mineral-rich environment? Wikipedia lists a few mechanisms that seem promising, namely oxidation of ferrous iron, nitrites, and sulfides; all respirating oxygen and with water as a byproduct.

If it couldn't work for the sole energy source, could they instead use some symbiotic relationship with bacteria as a primary energy source? (And if so, what's the most they could get away with eating just rocks?)

How much "food" would they have to consume? What would be some likely features of their biology as a consequence of rock-eating?

Also, how might they have evolved? I was thinking the gut-bacteria symbiosis thing sounds promising, but I'm definitely not a biologist. Would it be plausible for them to have co-evolved with various forms of bacteria?
