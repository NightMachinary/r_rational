New chapter - took me a while more to write this time, sorry. Also, thanks to [[/u/Caliburn0]] for helping me as a beta reader!

As I'm writing the next chapters, I realised this arc might end up being slightly longer than I originally planned. Probably another 5 or 6 chapters. Still, while it won't match exactly any of the original Dragonball arcs and will have lower stakes, I hope it'll contribute enough to the overall world-building to feel necessary.
