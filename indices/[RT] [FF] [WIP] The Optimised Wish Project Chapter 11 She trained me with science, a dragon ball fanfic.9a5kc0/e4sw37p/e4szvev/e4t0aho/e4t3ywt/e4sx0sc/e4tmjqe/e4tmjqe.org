Shit, are we going to be seeing the Crane School students? Turtle school is a no go since Gohan is dead, Ox King out of practice, and Roshi is a hermit, but the crane school crew aren't averse to using their KI to turn a profit.

Other potential sources are maybe Yamcha, if the Wolf Fang Fist is actually something, Taopaipai (Might not be with red ribbon, actually, since piccolo goons work with red ribbon here and TaoPaiPai remembers Piccolo), Kami / Korin / Popo (definite nos), and maybe Baba but probably no? I'm struggling to remember any other source of supernatural knowledge / abilities at this point, although minor talents we didn't see in canon are far from impossible.
