1) Never cleared up? They are treated as completely different systems. Fusion is magic when it comes from the earrings, Buu's food transformation is another form... and none of the Z-Fighters learn anything close as a martial arts (ki) technique. If it /was/ Ki-based, someone could use the process to turn people back, but it clearly doesn't work that way. I mean, hey, it's a fanfic and all and you can do with it what you will, but it's just... weird.

2) Awesome. :D I mean, this might be one of the few instances in rational fiction where holding a massive martial arts tournament /actually makes perfect sense/.
