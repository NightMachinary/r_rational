I like this story, but there are a couple of hang-ups I have with it on this update.

1) In the Dragonball world, /Magic/ and *Ki* are two separate things. This one seems to be combining them into one. While it's your story and you're welcome to do so, it just seems... wrong. You can have magic users who have no ki, ki users who have no magic, and some with both (Fat Buu comes to mind with his ki attacks but his magical ability to turn people into food). I'm hoping this frequency is just where "weird things" interfere with normal physics.

2) You want to draw in more Ki users? People with /real/ martial arts power while also being able to study them? You host the *Capsule Corporation First Annual Martial Arts Exposition Tournament* and make sure to televise it. Prize money, fame, and *science* all rolled into one. All who wish to participate undergo some basic tests (which determine if they can use /Ki/) and if they pass them are able to enter so long as they sign paperwork (including NDA's for the research results) that permit them to be observed and studied during the event. Make sure to note that this is the /first/ Expo of its kind in the world and that it will be repeated next year, where the winner of this one will automatically be designated as one of the finalists in the next.
