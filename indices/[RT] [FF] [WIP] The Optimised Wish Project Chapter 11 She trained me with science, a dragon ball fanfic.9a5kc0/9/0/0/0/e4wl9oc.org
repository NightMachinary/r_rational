Vegito is able to partially resist Buu's transformation. Gogeta (ok, not fully canon since it's the movie, but) shows a magic-like ability when he uses that rainbow sparkly attack to purify Janemba. Gotenks has the Ghost Kamikaze Attack, which he came up with, and that forms semi-sentient copies of himself - hardly just a brute-force ki attack. I can go on, Piccolo has his "clothes beam", Ginyu has the Body Change, Guldo can stop time... for me the clearest example though are the Namekians: it's said outright that they basically specialise in either of two things, fighting (like Nail) or magic (like Dende). Magic users are healers and can create the Dragon Balls. Warriors supposedly can't... except Kami created the Dragon Balls but also was a decent warrior. It's even more interesting because only /Kami/ could; Piccolo can't. And we know it's probably not just a matter of 'purity', that was more about getting accepted as the next Kami, but creating Dragon Balls is a Namekian prerogative (again, this is said by the Old Kaioshin: that Namekians alone were afforded the privilege to create Dragon Balls as they were recognised as the wisest race in the universe).

So I don't think it's that outlandish. Someone either has magic, or ki; but the two aren't completely mutually exclusive, it's more like they're different specialisations. Like you're either a scientist or an artist, but it's unlikely you'll have the time and talent to reach an absolute peak in both, and win both a Nobel Prize for physics and one for literature. Plus there's a strong natural disposition factor - some races or individuals are clearly born with a higher disposition to magic. I'm not going to discuss this much further here, or I'll have to spoil future plot points; but hopefully at the end of this arc already my view on this should be a bit clearer.
