In canon Goku copies the Kamehameha by seeing it once, while here he invents it on his own just by practicing ki control (with some help from Bulma). I wonder if he will figure out how to fly on his own as well, or if he will see someone else do it first. Probably the latter, since they're bring in a bunch of ki-users. Then again, maybe only a few doofuses like Yamcha will show up and not the more serious and talented people like the crane school students.
