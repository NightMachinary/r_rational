I've pictured it as being something akin to how you make an atomic bomb- you don't just cause the reaction, you also compact it as long as you can to build up pressure. The KMH is similar- Goku projects the ki into a space, then keeps compacting it more and more densely, then finally pushes it all out in one controlled direction.
