What I've seen that's cool about Kamehameha that noone else seems to be able to do for a long time is its flexability. You can shoot it from your feet, you can curve it, you can use it on a time delay, you can supercharge it, etc. Whenvegeta manages to curve the final flash, its a huge deal; the special beam cannon is straight, dodonpa is straight, double sunday and galic gun seem to be straight, vegeta's blasts vs final form freezer, racooome's eraser gun, and freezer's point beams don't seem to be able to do that. I don't think it's ever shown for certain in canon, but I've always headcanoned that the reason it took Master Roshi so long to design (as opposed to how quick it is to learn) is that he's been optimizing it all this time for better and better performance.
