I think the term fandom uses for the kind of attack the Kamehameha is is Beam Wave. I'm guessing the difference between them all is pretty discreet, but maximum chargeup is probably a thing.

Most obvious I guess, is that during Cell, the Kamehameha was never a threat to him, but Vegeta's ridicously long charge up for the Final Flash Attack would have very much destroyed him, despite him being weaker then Goku
