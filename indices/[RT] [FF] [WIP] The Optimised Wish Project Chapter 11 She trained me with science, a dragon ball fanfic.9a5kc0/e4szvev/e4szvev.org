So I'm guessing that their looking to hire ki users living in the city will be how Yamcha is brought into the story. That's been a plot point waiting to be picked back up ever since he decided to move to West City.

About the two chakras in the head that didn't activate. It reminded me that I've always been kind of curious in canon DB of the distinction between ki abilities that it seems anyone can do if they're strong enough, and various magic abilities that didn't seem to corolate to strength or were unique to certain induviduals. Things like levitating objects, materializing things like clothes, telepathy, or transforming yourself. (And all the magic items too) Of course I never expected canon DB to get into it or explain these things, it's just not that type of story, but didn't stop me from thinking about it! It seems like you're going to have it all run on the same system instead of the original where it was left vague how ki and magic were related and differed, so I'm looking forward to this research/world building arc, and the rest of the story too!

(Also I'm writing this comment on my phone at 4:30 in the morning, so sorry if any of it is unclear)
