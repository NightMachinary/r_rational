About 1), I disagree, in the sense that it's never cleared up, but a lot of simple magic-like abilities can be learned (like fusion, or instant transmission), and still use up ki. Whether the two things are just a manifestation of the same underlying phenomenon is never made clear, and I don't think it's a big stretch for me, as long of course as I keep them separate enough to allow for the variety that we observe. Like electricity and magnetism, they just are two sides of the same coin.

About 2), I won't say anything except... have patience :D.
