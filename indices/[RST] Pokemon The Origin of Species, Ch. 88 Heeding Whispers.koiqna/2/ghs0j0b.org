"Ghost pokemon experience time, space, and the order of events in very different ways"

Oh. Oooh. You could say everything is /distorted/ then. This is the tie to Giratina, isn't it? Should've figured the strongest ghost type is at least in some way tied to what makes ghosts so different, especially now as it seems to have some relevance to the story. And with some unknown sighted this chapter, it may even be involved here, not that I expect it to.
