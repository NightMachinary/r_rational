Huh. I wonder what exactly is going on here. In the games its a ghost Marowak that was killed by Team Rocket. It seems like something similar is happening based on the setup. (Could also be part of a Mewtwo countermeasure plan considering what has happened.)

With that in mind I'm curious how much will change. I imagine it will take the form of an Alolan Marowak. It has interesting implications for world building so I doubt it will be that straight forward. Can every pokemon come back as a ghost? Probably not or it would have been observed by now. Is it something unique to Marowak? I think the only other pokemon that might fit the bill in the games is Galar Corsola. If its not unique, what is the shared property that causes this to happen? Interesting stuff and I look forward to see what comes next!
