Super-late to this, I just caught up. As another commenter points out, spiritomb has been mentioned before in the series (chapter 54), so it's hard to imagine Jason doesn't recognize one. Plus, if it is at all possible for a medium to communicate with a ghost/dark, I assume he should at least notice that about the pokemon. That's what I think, at least.

I'm actually leaning towards this being a Dusknoir. Jason mentions that a sufficiently strong ghost type could threaten other ghosts. Pressure lines up, and dusknoir is supposed to be able to consume spirits through the "mouth" on its belly (explaining the gastly's fear). The series has not mentioned the dusclops line at all so far, as far as I can tell. Even if duskull/dusclops are known, it's pretty plausible that dusknoir is undiscovered so far. Game logic does require an item+trade, so it could be slightly convoluted here too; I don't think [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] has explained the evolution of other similar mons like scizor and steelix yet.

Wrt its origin, it's certainly likely there was human meddling. But one interesting point is that the "antenna" on its head is said to receive information from the spirit world. It's unlikely that this is the same as Giratina's distortion world. But given that we know Giratina stirred after the Hoenn incident and that there were unown flying around, it's certainly an interesting possibility.

Glad I won't have to wait too long with this cliffhanger, incredible chapter! I continue to love the way ghosts are characterized in this series.
