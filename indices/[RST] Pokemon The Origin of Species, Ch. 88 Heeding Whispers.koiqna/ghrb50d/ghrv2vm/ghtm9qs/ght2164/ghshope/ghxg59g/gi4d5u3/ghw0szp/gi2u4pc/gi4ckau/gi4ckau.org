Cause Mewto does not have pressure, would not know how to eat, scare or deal with ghosts, would not be defined by fear or grief. Losing a tail made him more cautious, not suicidal.

And he has noone to lose that could make him grief, except maybe Sabrina who is fine. His last stated motivation was of warning the humans about the Unown threat. So he maybe would want to talk to Artem.

But he could just send him an email, instead of taking over Lavender tower. And it wouldn't explain all the suspicious people around either.
