Dang I'm really liking the Lavender Town arc. it's a really unique location in the games, and a really nice change of pace from other arcs (plus it's really nice having the group back together). It also ties in really nicely with Red's personal journey.

Anyways, very good chapter, I am, once again, left wanting!
