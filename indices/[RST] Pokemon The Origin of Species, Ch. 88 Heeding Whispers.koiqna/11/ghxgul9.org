Question on chapter 87. Unpartitioned Red is talking to Leaf:

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah.” He takes a deep breath of the fresh country air. “It's getting easier, as long as I don't get hit with something bad.” Like whatever is behind his amnesia'd partition.
#+end_quote

Is that just an Amnesia full unpartitioned Red applied to make life easier? Or is this unpartitioned red not /actually/ the full unpartitioned Red, and that "amnesia'd partition" is actually the full unpartitioned Red (with "Prime Red" amnesia'ing himself about what's behind it in the same way M2 did)
