Yeah, but those are like, Red's biggest problems. Fear is how the Pressure manifested in him, and he's got a whole psychic tulpa extra-personality partition deal just to not crumble under the grief he goes through. Compare to someone like Blue, I feel like “anger” or “shame” might be more worrying to him. Fear and grief seems specifically geared to give Red a Bad Time.
