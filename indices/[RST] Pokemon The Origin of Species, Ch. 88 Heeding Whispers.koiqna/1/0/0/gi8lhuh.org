A bit late to the party, but I'll weigh in.

The chapter really tries to emphasize how Ghost Types are different from other Pokemon - how strange and altered their minds and perceptions are.

The chapter also makes the point of emphasizing how whatever new Pokemon is coming to get them is actively suicidal.

My theory is that, if it really is a Spiritomb, the 108 Ghost Pokemon it is formed from are still somewhat conscious (in their own strange way) within the 'collective'. They are 'trapped' together in the key-stone, forced into a single form. Jason's mirroring technique backfired because it ended up convincing him that he was also just one more spirit trapped in the collective.

This is why the Spiritomb is actively suicidal. Its constitutive 'parts' want to be free and separate again, and so might be instinctively seeking the destruction of the collective as a way to achieve this.

I also think that, in this setting, Spiritomb is not going to be a natural occurrence - its the result of some humans (maybe mediums? I kind of want the story to explore their 'culture' a bit more) who figured out how to jam multiple ghost types together into a 'key stone', only for their prototype to grow a bit too strong for whatever control mechanisms they thought would be sufficient.

They could even throw in an element of AI Safety - maybe the Spiritomb keeps on attacking and adding more and more spirits to its collective (explaining the flight of every Ghost Type not yet assimilated), and even its creators don't know how large or powerful the collective might get; this could be a problem that has to be stopped right here and right now. This would be an easy way to introduce the idea of 'super-dangerous, potentially even super-intelligent man-made Pokemon' to the protagonists without making the whole Mewtwo Operation uncharacteristically bad at keeping secrets. And it would add a bit more depth to the world as well - show how more people than just Giovannia are thinking of making their own 'tame' legendaries. While the Psychics were working on Mewtwo in one corner of the map, the Mediums were off by themselves working on Spiritomb.

Of course, all of that is just a theory I cooked up just now. I'm sure what actually ends up happening in the story will be even better.
