Yeah I was also thinking that Spiritomb sounds very likely. It explains

1. why other ghosts fear it
2. the pressure-like effect
3. (possibly) why so many ghosts disappeared. In canon Spiritomb are formed from 108 spirits trapped in a stone. So depending on how that is interpreted in this story, it's possible that it's a collection of 108 previous ghost pokémon. Which would explain how so many ghosts disappeared without anyone noticing them leaving. And if it also becomes ~108x as powerful as an individual ordinary ghost pokémon it's formed from, the gang is in deep shit.

One further thing I'm unsure about is the fact that it seemingly trapped Jason. I first interpreted it as the Shadow Tag ability (which prevents pokémon from fleeing or switching out). But it seems like mega Gengar is the only ghost or dark that can learn that, so unless someone had mineralized gengar and the Groudon orb laying around in the tower, that seems unlikely. So I'm guessing that it's just that the pokémon's attack was really strong. Or maybe it's that Jason's mirroring approach to connecting to the Spiritomb backfired and caused him to believe that he was trapped similar to how the Spiritomb is trapped in the key-stone. That sounds like a bit of a stretch though.
