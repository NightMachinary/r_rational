Whelp, they're in trouble. That was tense the whole chapter since you made clear Ghosts are just so different from every other Pokemon. I'm going to make the prediction that the Pokemon here is a Spiritomb since it's one of four Ghosts that have Pressure, and I'm excluding Giratina since it's a Legendary and Dusclops and Dusknoir since they aren't Dark types and therefore not something the other Ghost types should be extra afraid of.
