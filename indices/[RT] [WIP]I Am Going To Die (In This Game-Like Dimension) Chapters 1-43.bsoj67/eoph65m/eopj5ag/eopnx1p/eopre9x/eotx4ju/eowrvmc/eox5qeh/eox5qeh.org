It's portal-fantasy, where many people are transported into a dungeon-like realm: clear the 100 floors to return home. It is separated by difficulties: easy, normal, hard, and hell.

The main character, being drunk at the time of the prompt, selected the hardest difficulty.

Throughout the series he munchkins through rules and limitations, exploits the levelling system, solves problems that can't be handled with brute force through rational means, and works hard to always be a step stronger than before.

While it's not necessarily rational, it is definitely at least rational-adjacent. I was introduced to the series by Andrew Rowe, author of the rational series Arcane Ascension (he frequently recommends it).

Unfortunately, the translation of it has stopped and been removed, because the series has been liscensed and will now have an official translation. You can read it via machine translation, but I recommend otherwise, as it doesn't do the series justice.
