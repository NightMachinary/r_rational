I agree with this assessment. My dislike of the story is that it feels too "rat in the maze". Which is literally true. Our protagonist doesn't really do any long or short term planning, or get past obstacles on her own merits. Moreover, the general flaw with this kind of story is that "played straight", where the protagonist is playing the game by the rules and has not found any significant cheats or exploits, it makes for a story on rails. It makes for a story where the protagonist has no agency and thus while the story might be "rational" it's not good to read. Like reading about the fate of a chicken in a slaughterhouse that evades each near certain death by sheer luck because the chicken lacks the intelligence to really plan anything,
