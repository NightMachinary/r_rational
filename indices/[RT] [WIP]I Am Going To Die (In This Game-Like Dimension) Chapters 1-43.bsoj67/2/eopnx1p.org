This story is not rational, and in terms of the problems that the main character must overcome, badly written too, however entertaining.

The main character is dumped into another universe without any knowledge of where they are or why they were transferred, along with others. By pure chance, she and a small percentage of others who arrived with her have bodies that can adapt to the different climate this world has. And though she doesn't have any knowledge about where she is, fortunately she is paired with a mentor-like entity that can teach her about the world, to a degree. The mentor is limited by what they can say however, as are the mentors of other transportees. This leads to many of the transportees dying as time goes on.

Luckily, our protagonist has a mentor that can and does give out information that they're not supposed to give when they judge it necessary, which always fortunately let's the main character know what needs to be done when the time is right.

Some things are easier said than done however. It just so happens that said mentor has the ability to control the protagonist and pull off feats that the main character isn't capable of doing, to solve things that should be impossible for her. This is, of course, not normally allowed so it was just done that one time.

Our main character also coincidentally has the perfect backstory to most of the problems that show up in front of her - she has experience as a gymnast, and all of the difficult tests that have appeared so far have been parkour-esque tests!

Oh no. Our main character just got into a problem - one of their five party members got kidnapped, and they're too weak to rescue them! How fortunate that they received four powerful items literally a paragraph before this sudden problem popped up: it's even exactly enough for each member of the remaining party to have one! What a crazy coincidence.

--------------

Basically each time things grow tense they're literally saved by the powers of a) powerful mentor doing something that was earlier stated they can't do, sometimes only paragraphs prior, or b) luck.

The author has stated that The Tutorial Is Too Hard is an inspiration for this, which is what drew me to this series, but frankly, they're nothing alike.
