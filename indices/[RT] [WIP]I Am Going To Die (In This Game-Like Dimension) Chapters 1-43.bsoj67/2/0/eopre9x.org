  Luckily, our protagonist has a mentor that can and does give out information that they're not supposed to give when they judge it necessary, which always fortunately let's the main character know what needs to be done when the time is right.
#+end_quote

The mentor has exactly one ability to directly intervene, which is to put the protagonist into a meditative trance. She doesn't do it just once, but whenever it's useful. And the mentor sticks to the rules about what advice she can and can't give; on occasion she does ask the higher ups for a judgement call but accepts their rulings.

  Our main character also coincidentally has the perfect backstory to most of the problems that show up in front of her - she has experience as a gymnast

True. But being a gymnast is hardly a huge stretch.

  Oh no. Our main character just got into a problem - one of their five party members got kidnapped, and they're too weak to rescue them! How fortunate that they received four powerful items literally a paragraph before this sudden problem popped up: it's even exactly enough for each member of the remaining party to have one! What a crazy coincidence.

That wasn't a coincidence. She was specifically looking for those exact items, she knew everyone in her party would need one which influenced how many she picked up. And her friend was kidnapped because it was publicly known that she had a high chance of finding those items and the kidnappers wanted to blackmail her for them.
