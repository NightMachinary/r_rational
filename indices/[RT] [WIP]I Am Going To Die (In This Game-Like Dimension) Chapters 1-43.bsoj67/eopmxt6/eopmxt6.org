I've had this on my 'to read' list for a bit. Looks like there's enough written now to sink my teeth into.

Having read it now, I think it's pretty good. I think there's enough features in it that would appeal to the people here even if it's not completely rational. The main character definitely takes unnecessary risks / thrill seeking but you could argue that's a character flaw and not anti-rational. The same character also thinks about how to maximize their use of time (...sometimes).

All-in-all I'll be continuing to read it.
