Nah, I don't think it's after soldiers as much as adventurers, they are encouraged to infighting to much for this to be training soldiers, there have been some serious hints that the MC is doing well, but not the best she could because she has morals. If she was willing to betray her team or kill other contestants without provocation then she would be in a much better position, and I don't think that the trials would encourage that if they intended for the victors to be soldiers.
