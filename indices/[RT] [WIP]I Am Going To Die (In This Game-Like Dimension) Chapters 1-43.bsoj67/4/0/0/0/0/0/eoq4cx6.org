The argument in favour of adventurers is meta-knowledge of the genre. But I think they're being trained to stand united with their team and be ruthless to other teams. That would work well for an army.

I don't know what gives you the idea that she'd be better off if she betrays her team though? The next challenge (capture the flag? team vs team deathmatch) will probably be very hard if she goes through the door alone.
