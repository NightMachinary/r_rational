Would you be willing to summarize the chapter's punchlines? Or even just your favorite bits? Skimming it there seem to be interesting ideas but the author's a bit... wordy. Some odd bits stick out though, e.g.

#+begin_quote
  You see, during the first half of the twentieth century, it became conventional to measure something called “p-values” which imposed a qualitative distinction between “successful” and “unsuccessful” experiments... somebody who tried using unconventional statistical methods, even if they were better statistical methods, wouldn't be able to publish their papers in the most prestigious journals. And then they wouldn't get hired. It's similar to the way that the most prestigious journals don't publish mere replications, only discoveries, so people focus on making discoveries instead of replications.

This hasn't been true, in my experience.
