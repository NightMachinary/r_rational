Seems to me like you're doing the thing where some people quote /me/ as saying "I see little hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction." Admittedly, a fanfiction about an alternate Eliezer Yudkowsky might in one sense seem like a more plausible candidate for something I secretly sort-of believe, than the words I put in the mouth of Literally Voldemort. Except for the part where, since the beginning of time, not one unusual thing has ever happened. Nobody in the history of time from Newton onward and backward was ever "so impressive as to introduce a hint of doubt that they're from Earth". /I know that./ I am a good enough reductionist to teach others how it's done. It is, or ought to be, /much/ more plausible that I see little hope for democracy and am writing that cryptically under the guise of Literally Voldemort. You have mistaken the voice of a character for the voice of the author. And I say again that in one sense this is a more understandable mistake, since on surface level the character seems so much more based on me; and yet I also say again that it should have been much less plausible that my true opinion sort of resembled his, because I tried to teach you to reject even the /slightest hint and insinuation that one unusual thing had ever happened./ I learned at a very young age not to be impressed by the sleight-of-hand that assembles a clever-sounding argument for why there might be a teapot in the asteroid belt, even or especially when it was my own brain generating the argument; that was where my journey began, with the search for a kind of thinking that /couldn't/ argue impressively for any conclusion. I assure you I am no more impressed by a clever-sounding case for why someone might be a reincarnate from another world.

It's all well and good to remark on how the argument seems self-congratulatory, but the conclusion of it is impossible. Literally impossible. It's supposed to look like a self-congratulatory argument for violating conservation of momentum. "I am so awesome that 12 is a prime number" is perhaps less of a boast than it might sound to the mathematically unsophisticated. Now maybe the argument for my transdimensionality seems less like that if you do /not/ know down to your core that not one unusual thing has ever happened, or if you are seeing through the eyes of people who think that the world is soft around the edges and has some room for arguments to push it just a little. In a similar sense, somebody who thinks there's a little softness around the edges of mathematics might wonder if "I am so awesome that 12 is a prime number" is maybe being spoken by someone believes it just a little and thinks that 12 is a tiny bit less prime. But that I am of the Earth alone is a very solid truth that is not friendly to any arguments trying to push against it, and it is not impossible to guess that I would know that too.
