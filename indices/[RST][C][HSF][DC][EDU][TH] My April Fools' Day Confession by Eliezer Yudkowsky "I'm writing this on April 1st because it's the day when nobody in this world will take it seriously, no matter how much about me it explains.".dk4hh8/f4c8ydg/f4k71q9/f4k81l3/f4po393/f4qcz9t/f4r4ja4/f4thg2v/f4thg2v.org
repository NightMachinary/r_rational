I think you might still be making a big mistake - a mistake I was making for years and that probably has cost me a lot of respect. Which surprises me a lot because usually I can't find a tiniest flaw in your arguments.

I hesitated a lot about writing this. On the one hand, you and CeruleanTresses have seemingly came to a mutual understanding and if I try to lecture you after that, I will feel like a dick. On the other hand, it took you three messages to understand his point - the point that was amazingly, wordlessly obvious to anyone non-status-blind from his first message. (Another thing that was obvious to me at least is that CeruleanTresses is not a hater from a place-that-shall-not-be-named).

You were not accused of saying " I am so awesome that 12 is a prime number". You were accused of saying "I am so awesome that it's more likely that 12 is a prime number than that I am not awesome. Yes, I know that 12 is not a prime, and I know you know that. But I can say what I said in public and get away with it, while if you try the same, you would just be laughed out of the room". We know that's not what you meant, but that's what you, in fact, said - just not in so many words.

(I did not think about your arrogance when I was reading your "confession" for the first time - I still have trouble predicting such reactions, but now I at least can recognize and understand them.)

Hope I helped!
