No, I don't think you believe you're literally from another world. I /do/ think that the long paragraph near the end, where you list off a bunch of your achievements like "oh clearly it's more likely that some rando could do all of this", is written with intentional irony. On the surface, it denies the "from another world" interpretation. The between-the-lines reading, which is not exactly thinly veiled (and I don't think you meant it to be), frames the listed achievements as so improbably impressive that the "/not/ from another world" interpretation is made to sound absurd. And that does read as self-congratulatory even in the context of April Fool's, because it's about things you've actually done, and the story is set up early on as a "haha, what a funny joke...but /maybe.../" thing, and the paragraph I mentioned is one of the parts where your goal seems to be to introduce that doubt.

To put it more concisely: I don't think the parts where you state you're from another world are sincere. What I do think is sincere is the implication that your achievements are so impressive as to plausibly introduce even a hint of doubt that you're from Earth.

This isn't me looking down on you. I've enjoyed much of your work. I'm just not a fan of the ending of this particular story.
