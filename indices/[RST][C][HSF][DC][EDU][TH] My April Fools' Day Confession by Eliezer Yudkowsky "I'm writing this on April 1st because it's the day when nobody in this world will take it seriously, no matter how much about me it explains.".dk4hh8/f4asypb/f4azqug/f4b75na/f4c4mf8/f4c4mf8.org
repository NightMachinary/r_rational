  Oh, and there's geography conducive to tunneling everywhere, as well as bedrock close enough to the surface to build modular (?) housing developments

I kinda think the Watsonian explanation there is that, as a society, they /choose/ to build their large cities in areas with this particular geography.

There's actually a surprisingly common effect in the real world, where the "rich" side of town also just happens to be built on a more geologically stable surface, where the "poor" part of town isn't.

That's why rich people tend to live in areas that the locals refer to as "the hills" - generally hills are places where the local bedrock is easier to get to and build on.

The problem with this split is that the houses the poor live in tend to have a higher incidence of foundation and infrastructure issues (cracking, basement flooding, etc) due to the poor quality of the area for building on top of, which you'd imagine is something they would want to minimize in this story.
