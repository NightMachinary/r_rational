You don't have to drill a tunnel. You can build the tunnels above ground and then build the city's structures above them. This is cheaper and makes handling drainage vastly more feasible.

If you were modifying an existing city to adopt autonomous electric cars, you could start constructing buildings and public spaces over existing roads. If we take NYC for example, imagine constructing a new "street" level over the existing streets. On this new level, instead of roads you might just have wide sidewalks with plenty of trees, separated bike lanes, public parks, vegetable gardens, greenhouses, etc. This is the level where you'd have all of the buildings establish their new front doors. The old ground-level doors would get closed off to help prevent people and animals from wandering out into the tunnels, and the old first floors would have an area get converted into a drop-off/pick-up point for people traveling by the autonomous cars that serve the entire city. You could leave a space for several cars that remain on standby so anyone leaving the building can get just inside, state their destination, and be on their way immediately. A phone app could be used to communicate with the car to handle billing and provide a built-in address book, so you can instruct it to go to so-and-so's place and have the car bring you to the correct address.

If these 'tunnels' below the new surface level are about 32 feet tall, you'd have enough room for two levels of traffic including loaded flatbed trailers. With this approach, all upper-level traffic could go north/south and all lower-level traffic could go east/west (with the roads that were formerly going in other directions being converted into on/off ramps to the other level). That would get you EY's aim of having the cars move without traffic lights, and would plausibly end traffic jams in NYC. With fully autonomous vehicles using these tunnels designed like highways, you could also safely increase the speed limit to 125 kmph as EY described (~78 mph). As an example of the impact that would have, it looks like the fastest travel time from the World Trade Center to Harlem right now is about 36 minutes considering traffic, but this approach would likely reduce that to about 7 minutes.

This would certainly put a lot of people out of work. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, valets, parking attendants, traffic police, etc. Combine that with drastically reduced travel times and you'd free up absolutely enormous amounts of human time that could be better spent. In a sane economic system, we'd welcome automation, but obviously we don't and we'll have to fix some rather substantial problems before we can achieve some semblance of a rational economy.
