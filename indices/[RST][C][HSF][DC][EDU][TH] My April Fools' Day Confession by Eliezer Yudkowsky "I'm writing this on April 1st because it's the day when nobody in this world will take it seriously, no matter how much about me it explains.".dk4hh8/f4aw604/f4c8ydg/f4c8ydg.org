Most of the story is a fun worldbuilding exercise, but I've always thought the ending was kind of insufferable. It's basically "My ideas are so unprecedented and good, and my writing is so revolutionary, and the above worldbuilding is so clever that it's vanishingly unlikely I could be a mere human who grew up on the same Earth as the rest of you." It's a little too self-congratulatory to be in good taste, IMO.
