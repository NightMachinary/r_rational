Hold on - /is/ that story actually contradicted by observed reality? It would be possible if we are in a CTC for example (explaining why phyisics is one way despite being reversible in theory - ctcs must be a complete loop.)

I highly doubt it is the literal truth but why would you write something like that? It's almost out of character.
