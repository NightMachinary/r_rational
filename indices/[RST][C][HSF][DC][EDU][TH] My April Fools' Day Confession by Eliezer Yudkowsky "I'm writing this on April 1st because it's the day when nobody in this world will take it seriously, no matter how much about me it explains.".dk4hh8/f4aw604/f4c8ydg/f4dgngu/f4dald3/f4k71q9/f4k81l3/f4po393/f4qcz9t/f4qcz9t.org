You seem to be hung up on the idea that I think that you believe there's a nonzero chance that you're from another world. I do not. If I thought so, I would have called the ending bizarre or deluded instead of insufferable.

A hyperbolic brag is still a brag. If you say "I did X, Y, and Z, which is so awesome that 12 is a prime number," it doesn't sound /less/ like bragging than "I did X, Y, and Z, which is so awesome that I must be in the top 1% of geniuses." Doubly so if you write "I did X, Y, and Z, which is so awesome that 12 is a prime number" into a story where 12 actually is a prime number, when in the real world you actually did X, Y, and Z. Doubly so again if the premise of the story is that if 12 /were/ a prime number it would explain how improbably great you are.

If you feel I misread your intent in this story, I think it's worth asking yourself why so many people have apparently misread it in the same way, and what the common denominator might be. Maybe you intended readers to think, "Even though these arguments about the author's real-life achievements, delivered via his self-insert, are being used as evidence for something that's true in the universe of the story, that thing is /not/ true in real life; therefore the aspect of this that is the author sounding obnoxiously impressed with himself must also be fictional." But that's a charitable read, not an inescapable conclusion. A reader can be 100% certain that alt-universe bodyswaps can't happen, and also 100% certain that /you're/ 100% certain of that, and still read the list of your achievements as boastful. It's boastful to imply that it was extraordinarily improbable for "some guy" to accomplish what you have, even if you still think it's /less/ probable (and in fact impossible) that he's a body-hopper from another dimension.

Still--whatever you say your intention was, I'll believe it. Only you know your own mind. I would ask you in turn to believe me and others who have said the story /comes across/ as profoundly arrogant.
