  Seems to me like you're doing the thing where some people quote me as saying "I see little hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction."

  than the words I put in the mouth of Literally Voldemort.

While you are on that topic, have you considered how the original audience's infatuation with Voldemort even as he committed increasingly heinous acts (I can recall people still defending Quirrelmort even after he AK'd the centaur) kind of mirrors the draw of the alt-right movement? It was pretty obvious that Quirrelmort was evil to me after the Azkaban Prison arc. But from what I recall of audience reaction on reddit and less wrong, nerd contrarianism and utilitarianism worked together with the fact that you made Quirrelmort just too damn cool and awesome and so many readers failed to internalize the fact that he was outright evil.

The obvious fix (if you can ever bring yourself to edit HPMOR), is to make Quirrelmort less awesome/more pathetic in a way that mirrors real life fascist wannabe's. You might have Quirrelmort quote a few out of context statistics that Harry latter finds to be blatantly wrong, or quote some medical "facts" about muggles vs. wizards that Harry learns to be wrong, or add in an anecdote about how Voldemort's spam AK has backfired before but then Quirrelmort refuses to admit this in his conversation over the effulgence potion making. Just a few cracks to the facade of all around awesomecool mcbadass aura that Quirrel has going would go a long way into cutting into his image.

Of course, given your luck and the direction your image has been going... if you had Quirrelmort quote parodies of racist crime statistics and/or racist human biodiversity pseudoscience a portion of the internet would take that unironically seriously and celebrate your promotion of their racist cause and another portion would cite it as evidence that you've gone full alt-right, so maybe actually ignore this advice....

Well now I have an idea for a recursive fanfic parodying Quirrelmort by having him spout off some pseudoscience over tea with HJPEV while Harry in response takes a milquetoast centrist response (because surely Quirrel can't be that mistaken).

*TLDR*; The problem isn't that you failed to make Quirrelmort blatantly evil, it is that you made him too awesome and cool.
