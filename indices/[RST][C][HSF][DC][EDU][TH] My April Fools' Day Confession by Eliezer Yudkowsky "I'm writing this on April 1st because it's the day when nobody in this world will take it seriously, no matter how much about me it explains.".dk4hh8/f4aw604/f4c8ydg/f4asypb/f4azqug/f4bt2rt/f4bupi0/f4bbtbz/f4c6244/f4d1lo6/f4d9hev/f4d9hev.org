Crap, good point. It does seem feasible to use the tunnels, but it would be tricky. If the tunnels are large enough to allow for flatbed trailers, you'd have about a 14-foot ceiling to work with, but you might use up 4-5 feet of that for the wheels and structure of the vehicle. That still leaves potentially enough space to transport a modular basement, then each floor, and finally the roof, so you should be okay if you can break the houses up into modular layers.

Supporting the layers during this process could be somewhat tricky. You'd have to lift the rest of the house off of the basement and then pull the basement out by itself. You might temporarily install a ground-level house support that could hold the rest of the building after it's been lifted up a few feet, then start sliding the parts out one-by-one.

I'm not really sure how you'd handle the sides of the building and the ground level if you're using this approach. The roof presumably sticks out past your walls, so the first floor presumably has some exterior ground around the walls that extends out as far as the roof does. Still, that would have to leave a little gap in the ground as an error margin, and that gap could become a problem for drainage and erosion, as well as issues with buildup of insects and debris, aside from potentially looking ugly. The best bet with that is probably to put down a walking path that goes over the gap, both to help seal it shut and to conceal it. Picking up that path and moving it could be somewhat annoying, but it might also be something that could be automated if the path is composed of parts with standardized sizes, shapes, and weights.
