God that chapter is hard to read. It's riddled with over-generalizations and simplifications of people, and engages in some questionable ideas:

- There are consistent themes that a planned economy with ever-increasing specialization will somehow work better, with no acknowledgement of the possibility that each specialization increases information asymmetry. Furthermore, specialization leads to EE's much maligned red-tape.
- Prediction markets would only work if it was a mandated part of a job. There's always other shit to do.
- /"And on our planet, Uber and Lyft are currently fighting it out with taxi companies and their pet regulators after exactly that development." -/ Or, they're using massive amount of venture capital to drive competitors out of business so that they can seek to extract rents later while arguing that they are responsible for no part of their actual business.
- Regulation is seen as something that only prevents change from happening, rather than something that also protects idiots from Radium toothpaste. This also seems to follow the mid-college idea of assuming there are no malefactors, or that malefactors have no real power and only follow incentives. The problem is there are malefactors, a lot of them. Just look at the opioid crisis. Or global warming.
- This shows a pernicious underlying bias towards people choosing the best and choosing factual information over lies. Political science seems to be pointing otherwise.
- There's an unrealistic degree of trust expected in the system of planners. Results based metrics (which somehow don't fall victim to Goodhart's fallacy) for everyone! Somehow this will not create a noise-ocracy, where everyone is bombarded by even more information attempting to fix the fallacies of the last measure or the definition of the measures themselves won't be subject to regulatory capture.
- There's very little dealing with local monopolies. This is especially germane to rural medicine.
- The political section is particularly bad. Politicians are seen as 100% responsive to what the political consensus is, without an acknowledgement that they're independent actors with their own beliefs that help form consensus/ the Overton window. Furthermore, there's not much talk on how voters frequently align to stances the party takes.\\
- There's not much acknowledgement of the fact that /solving metaproblems means that several groups loose power/. Let's take a widely known one: switching to a Parliamentary system would generally result in a more Democratic country as well as a more democratic one. Republicans know this and so resist meta-reforms. This isn't new either; change the party names and country, and it's one of the reasons pre-Revolutionary Americans weren't offered seats in Parliament.
- There's the textbook Econ fallacy of assuming a rational consumer in healthcare. When there's an emergency, the average person is not going to comparison shop even if the info is available. The patient goes in the ambulance 911 sends.

I have more issues, particularly with the ever-present libertarian problems of ignoring how poverty affects the current system and proposed solutions, and the magical belief that their proposed systems are incorruptible.
