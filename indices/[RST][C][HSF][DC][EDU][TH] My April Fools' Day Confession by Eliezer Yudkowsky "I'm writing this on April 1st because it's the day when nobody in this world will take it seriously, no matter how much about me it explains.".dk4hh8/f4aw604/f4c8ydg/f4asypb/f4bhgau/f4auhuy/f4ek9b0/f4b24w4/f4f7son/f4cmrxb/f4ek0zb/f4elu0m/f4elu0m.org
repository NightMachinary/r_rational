I'm not a published researcher, so I don't have personal experience. If you have, your observations may be more relevant.

But it echoes a position expressed several times on schischow, an exceptionally accessible and generally well-researched look into scientific academia. Scientific research is a trade, and scientists depend on income, via grant money or new patents for their employers. There is significant economic pressure to publish original research rather than peer review.
