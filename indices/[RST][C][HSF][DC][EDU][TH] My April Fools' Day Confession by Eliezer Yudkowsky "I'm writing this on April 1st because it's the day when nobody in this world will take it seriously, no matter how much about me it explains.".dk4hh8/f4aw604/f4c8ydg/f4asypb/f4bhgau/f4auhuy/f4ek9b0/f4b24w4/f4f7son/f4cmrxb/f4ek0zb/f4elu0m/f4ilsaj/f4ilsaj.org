oh yeah, there are definitely lots of structures in place that incentivize the production of poor research, and maybe ones that incentivize the worse sort of underpowered, biased NHST that the passage dislikes (e.g. scientists need to churn out enough LPUs for tenure and don't have time to learn newfangled methods that better accommodate uncertainty, measurement error, etc. and give them less-sexy results), it was more my reading of prestigious journals disliking

directly, rather than the low-quality datasets that they might be applied to. In my experience, journals love newer, fancier methods, often to their own detriment (e.g. when the invented method is wrong and there exists an actual solution the authors are unfamiliar with, or they just toss some newer buzzwordier technique at a problem over something simpler)
