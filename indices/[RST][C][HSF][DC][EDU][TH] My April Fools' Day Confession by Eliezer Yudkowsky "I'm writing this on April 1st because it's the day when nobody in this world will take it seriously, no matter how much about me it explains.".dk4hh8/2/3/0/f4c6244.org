He didn't discuss moveable foundations, he discussed modular foundations. The foundation or platform the house sits on is stationary but designed so that a building can be lowered on top of it and fitted into place. In turn, the house structure itself would have to be designed with a support structure under the floors which can support the weight of the house either on a modular foundation or on the mobile supports that lift it and transport it.

I'm not a fan of his idea to basically have massive stationary cranes that are kilometers long. Engineering that seems difficult-to-impossible, and the likely initial costs plus maintenance seem unreasonable for the benefit it would provide. A much more plausible approach would be to have the modular houses and foundations, but use a portable house-lift to pick the house up and move it. It's not too hard to imagine a road-transportable house-lift that could lift a house over any trees or other yard obstacles and then suspend it up in the air while slowly moving down narrow residential streets until reaching a street large enough to set it down on a transport vehicle in a less precarious position before hauling it off to the desired address.
