...are you under the impression I secretly believe the sentences I wrote on April 1st? The part that's directly contradicted by observable reality? That part? I suppose some people feel more self-congratulatory when they can look down on me like that, but good God. Of course I was born on this Earth and raised here, nor is there anything else within me; whatever I am is of this place alone. This is not a fact of which I could be plausibly unaware. I suggest you carefully examine the line of thought which made you think I secretly believed otherwise.
