  Still--whatever you say your intention was, I'll believe it. Only you know your own mind. I would ask you in turn to believe me and others who have said the story comes across as profoundly arrogant.

Well said. I will believe you, then. Keep in mind that I do have a rather large population out there with its own subreddit that thinks I keep a harem of math pets, so I can't actually believe what people say they don't like about me without a few sanity checks. Sorry for putting you to the trouble to prove it, but clear communication usually is hard.
