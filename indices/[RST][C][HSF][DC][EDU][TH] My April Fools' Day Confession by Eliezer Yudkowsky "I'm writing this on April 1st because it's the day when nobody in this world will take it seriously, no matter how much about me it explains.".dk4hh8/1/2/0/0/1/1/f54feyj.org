The whole point of Quirrel was that he was supposed to pass the ideological turing test for an authoritarian, will-to-power type.

He's not even supposed to be a racist is he? The whole Voldemort thing was just him strongmanning blood-purism even though he couldn't care less about it. His problem was with the muggles destroying the world through bad institutions and inexperience with worldending threat. Quirrel's got nothing to do with HBD or crime statistics.
