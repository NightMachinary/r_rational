This is something that I frequently see high-level Magic: The Gathering players do, especially in situations when they're in a commanding position to win. The way I often see this phrased is, "How do I lose from this position?" In asking this question, a player who is on track to win might identify an unlikely-yet-possible avenue by which they could lose a game, and then play in a way to avoid that outcome, often described as "playing around your opponent's outs." The best players tend to be those who can take a position where they have a 85% likelihood to win, and play in such a way that they convert that into a 100% likelihood to win by cutting off specific possibilities for their opponent to get back into the game rather than going on "auto-pilot" and playing the game in a way that might feel like "winning harder" but doesn't account for the specific contingencies available to their opponent.
