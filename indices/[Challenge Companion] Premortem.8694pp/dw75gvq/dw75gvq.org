This might be a little different; something I often do when running an experiment is think "This /should/ work, but if it doesn't (and I get a (/blank) result which seems to make no sense instead), what might have gone wrong and what should I try next to address the problem?". That feels as though it helps me approach results more calmly, having an A/B outcome flowchart to proceed according to rather than an 'If this doesn't work, I'm screwed' outlook.
