I find it hard to immerse in post-singularity FiO stories, since at that point /everything/ is theatre.

The protagonist (xor one other person in the room) is the only authentic born human. Everybody else is a zombie or artificial person that was created solely to manipulate the human towards making whatever choice will maximise CelestAI's utility function.

It's hard to care about emotions that have been so carefully engineered (if they exist at all).
