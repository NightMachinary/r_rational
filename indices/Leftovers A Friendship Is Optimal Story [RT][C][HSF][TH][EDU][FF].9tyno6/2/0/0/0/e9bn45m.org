I dunno, I think a lot of people with "normal" (admittedly maybe incorrect) notions of identity put a lot of weight into subjective experience / continuity of consciousness / etc (which is why Hanna made CelestAI require permission before modifying peoples' minds). So I think a lot of people (myself included) would not consider themselves not to have been deleted if a modified clone "takes my place".

(Don't @ me, I know my feelings about identity are basically disproven by everything but I still have this intense visceral reaction to teleporters/uploading/etc)
