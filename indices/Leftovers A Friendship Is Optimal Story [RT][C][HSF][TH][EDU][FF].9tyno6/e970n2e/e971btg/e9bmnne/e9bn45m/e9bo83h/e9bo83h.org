Ok, fair enough, but surviving cryonics at all probably means you are in fact that clone. There are very few plausible scenarios where a future civilization could really repair your cells so perfectly that they could then be made alive again. It's hideously near impossible - you would practically have to scoop the guts out of every cell in your frozen brain and replace most of them.

You would then, after replacing them, somehow have to warm up the mess to where it's liquid enough to be moved but won't decay - so that you can stitch the pieces back together.

I'm not saying it's impossible, but if you /had/ to have a biological replacement brain, it probably would be easier to basically just grow new neurons where you have completely rewritten human cells to serve your needs, where they can assume arbitrary neural states and then wait quiescently for you to activate them, where they grow exactly where you want them, following individualized marker molecules.

​

At which point you basically have a new brain, even if some components of the old one survive - and even if you went to all this effort, you get none of the advantages of a digital mind. A digital mind emulation can be backed up, diffed, error corrected, easily compared exactly to others, transported vast distances, suspended, time accelerated, and so on. Reviving someone as their meat self and they immediately have all the frailities of being mortal as well and start forgetting the very memories and personality you brought them back for.

​

If we could bring back a historical figure, we wouldn't want them to become jaded natives of their new time. We'd want to hear their honest reaction as their original selves to these new ideas. Easily accomplished by forking them, so they could have a dynamic self that gets to live again, and static copies of themselves you can use to find out how they would have reacted to something.
