Huh. This one was actually /good./ Like, /good/ good. Definitely captures more of the horror overtones that some of the other Optimalverse fics kind of gloss over.

Well. It turns out it was written by Chatoyance, the author of the "official"(?) FIO sequel, the one that EY gave a shout out to like five years ago in the HPMOR author's notes. I /thought/ it felt extra legit, I guess that's why. Depending on your definition of "canon," it's actually canon.
