I'm about halfway through ch2 of Implacable right now, but it's close to 2am and I really should've gone to bed by now. But yeah, it's crazy, Leftovers and Implacable are practically canon and they're both less than a year old. I'm gonna save the rest of this story for when I wake up tomorrow, if I'm tired enough to have trouble typing then I definitely shouldn't be reading.
