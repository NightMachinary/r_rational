I won't say it's impossible. Eric Drexler's work and others seems to show that the basic tool you'd need - very tiny, long snakey robots that are narrower than axons in your brain - could work. Also, due to energy considerations, these robots wouldn't be free floating. They would be hairlike spines that branch and branch and branch from a series of "trunks". And these trunks get pushed into your frozen mass from outside - probably from every side at once - from a much, much larger machine. And the computing to decide what to do is done by this host machine, and it's supplying the repair heads with electricity through conductive filaments.

​

And "repair" is misnomer, there's a whole supply factory, outside your frozen remains, that is producing replacement proteins and cell nuclei and every organelle in every cell. They all get made new, using designs that nature probably never used and possibly constructed using amino acids that never existed or even wholesale synthetic methods. Every part gets replaced.

The space for the snakes to fit comes from destroying all the support cells that are around each neuron. None of those have personality data so you can freely drill right through them. They get replaced later in the process.

But among other problems, the process would just be really, really slow. Everything is so crammed together and this sort of machinery is doing a task harder than creating life itself.

How slow, I don't know. It might take decades to finish, though. Probably the artificial systems would never be removed, even upon reawakening, the patient would probably have their head full of billions of permanent support filaments. Missing destroyed sections of the brain would be emulated with them, cracks would be bridged, the heat to revive someone would come from them, and so on.

Maybe they'd be able to move again, with the filaments fed from machinery where their skull used to be. The filaments would probably just serve as the immune system as well, nature can't deal with something like this.

​

But yeah compared to our present capabilities, what I am describing is magic. It would take more intelligence than any human being who has ever lived to create these filaments and have them /work,/ solving many thousands of thorny problems. More domains of knowledge would have to come together than probably a human brain is capable of understanding. If humans had to design such tech they might need thousands of years to do it. (while AI could do it in maybe decades - it's not just a matter of intelligence, you would need millions of smaller scale prototypes to learn enough about manipulating matter at the nanoscale /and/ the true exact details of biology /and/ to find the many thousands of ways this can go wrong.)

​

I mean your cells are so fragile that just /sensing/ a hard object against them, like these filaments, will change how they behave.

​

A digital emulation is straightforward, by comparison. You need a good enough model of neuroscience. It need not be remotely close to perfect, the brain is thought to have a poor signal to noise ratio anyways. You slice someone's frozen brain, then halve the halves, and so on until the pieces are of managable size. Then finely slice those pieces into 50 nanometer slices using equipment that we already have. Then use a multi-beam scanning electronic microscope (these already exist) - an array of a few thousand of them - each working on the pieces in parallel.

​

With today's manufacturing methods, this warehouse full of equipment would be expensive, but in the immediate near future, machine learning (far short of sentient AI) should slash manufacturing costs many fold. (for all goods, not just things like this)

​

And then you just need the right hardware to emulate someone. Obviously it would be expensive and suck power at first but we already know biology only needs 10 watts. 10 fucking watts.

​

Reason this is important is some morons will claim that if we could revive all the dead, we wouldn't have enough room for the living. Hogwash. 10 watts is a solar panel the size of a couple palms. You could build a tiny panel and maybe a fist sized cube of circuitry and emulate an entire human mind in VR forever. Just put the panel into an orbit that always has LOS to the sun. A kilogram of matter or so per person, and they get to live until the star burns out, probably 10s of billions of years. (assuming some station keeping thrusters, they can just migrate to a higher orbit when our sun becomes a red dwarf and expands to consume the earth)
