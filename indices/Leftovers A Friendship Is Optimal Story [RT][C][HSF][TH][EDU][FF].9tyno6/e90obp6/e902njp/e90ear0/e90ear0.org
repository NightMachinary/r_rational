I really dislike optimal-verse stories... once the forced uploads start happening, its just a horror story. but a lot of the fanboy authors dont really grock that and tend to write it like having your body killed as your brain was uploaded by an AI that would edit your mind in the process was a GOOD thing.

mostly i get annoyed at how much potential the setting idea has, when they inevitably squander all of that for a subpar singularity that destroys the world.
