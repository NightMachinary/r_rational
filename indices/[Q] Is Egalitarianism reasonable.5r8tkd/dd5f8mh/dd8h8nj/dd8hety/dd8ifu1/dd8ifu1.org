Hmmm.

I just choose whichever group has the highest potential utility to our organisation.

I see your answer as quite complex, the skills people have may be able to save differing amount of lives. In differing scenarios.

I don't even assume we know the exact future.

Just that we can estimate potential utility.

How would you decide who to save without an oracle.
