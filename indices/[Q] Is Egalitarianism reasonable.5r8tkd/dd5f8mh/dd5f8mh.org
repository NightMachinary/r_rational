Even if all you said is true, there is no metric that can without fail determine how many lives an individual can save. A genius can spend his time and money devising clever ways to evade bans in runescape and an idiot's help to someone in power can afford them time to do something revolutionary -- or maybe the idiot himself can have a perspective on something that would lead to something revolutionary. Future scientific developments could lead to enhancements to bring mentally disabled people up to an average person's level of intelligence.

Once you /do/ have such a metric, you can probably utilize it to make a great life for everyone since it probably involves seeing the future in some unerring way.

Egalitarianism (or eagle-librarianism, a name someone used that I liked) is reasonable because it's practical.
