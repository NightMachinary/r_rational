Imagine this: Person A is a brilliant scientist one the verge of curing cancer, and person B is a mass murderer. You have to choose which one to save, and which to let die. I agree that A should be saved. However not because they have a higher status or more rights, but because I'm also considering the lives of millions of cancer patients, and thousands of potential murder victims, who all also require equal consideration.
