I guess one could split the definition and define something like "global utilitarianism" which gives an equal weight to the utility of all human beings, and something like "national utilitarianism" which gives equal weight to all citizens of a country or faction, and some smaller weight (maybe zero, but not necessarily) to noncitizens.

Egalitarianism specifically is probably compatible with either model. It's more concerned with the idea that the weights do not have people with different weights interacting with each other internal to the system. So something where the U.S. government values U.S. citizens living in the U.S. more than it values Chinese citizens living in China is perfectly fine and still counts as egalitarian, but if the U.S. government decides that U.S. citizens of Chinese descent living in the U.S. deserve fewer rights than other citizens then that's not egalitarian.
