Pretty much. Egalitarianism is a pretty new thing relative to history, the idea that all people should be treated equally instead of only valuing the majority race/class/sex. I suppose you could put egalitarianism on a spectrum and say a system which says all humans have basic rights like life/liberty but only [class A] type of people can vote or have certain jobs would be more egalitarian than a system in which only [class A] people have any rights whatsoever, but less egalitarian than a system where everyone has all of the same rights.

Whether it's "rational" or not depends on whose perspective it is and what values they have. For a self-interested upper class Roman senator, it's entirely rational to keep the system separating citizens from non-citizens because that allows him to benefit from the taxes and control that he gains at the expense of the noncitizens. For a kind-hearted orphanage-runner who wants to help all the poor children it would be rational to oppose such a system (at least in principle, actually rebelling would likely lead to bad outcomes).
