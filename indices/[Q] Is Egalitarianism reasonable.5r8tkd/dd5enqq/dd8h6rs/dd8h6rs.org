A billionaire or king will likely be able to provide me with sufficient utility for saving his daughter. Regardless of the daughter's own skills, her utility includes how much her family and possible suitors or other concerned parties are willing to pay for her.

Her potential; utility is much greater than a street rat's. I'm assuming that thee street rat has average or below intelligence, and so is not a diamond in the rough.
