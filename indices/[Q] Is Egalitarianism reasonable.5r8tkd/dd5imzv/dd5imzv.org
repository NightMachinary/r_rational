I think egalitarianism translates into rational thought as the idea that all people should have equal weight given to their utility functions.

Utilitarianism is the idea that we should maximize the greatest good for the greatest number of people. While that's difficult to measure precisely, we can still make approximations. Each person has some collection of things they value: health, safety, friendships, fulfillment, love, etc... which is all absorbed into some measurement as a utility function.

Now a naive view of rationality is that a rational person is inherently selfish and only seeks to maximize their own utility. But that can be easily modified by adding some sort of altruism coefficient, where the true utility function of a person is some weighted linear combination of their original function and the utility functions of everyone else. If I am not a psychopath then my actions causing other people to become happy will (usually) make me become happier as a result. Similarly, if I cause someone to suffer then I will (usually) become less happy as a result. Although this effect is usually weaker than if the good or bad things directly happened to me.

Thus an egalitarian view of rationality simply says that the utility function that society/governments ought to maximize should be a weighted linear combination of the utility functions of all people with EQUAL weight applied to each person. However this applies to the actual payoffs, not the processes in the middle. The utility function is the end-goal which all other processes we value exist to serve. So while I might agree as in some of your examples that one person's life might have more value than another, it's only if they are capable of providing more value towards the inherent utility function.

As a contrast to this, a non-egalitarian system is explored (humorously) here: [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-04-03]]

Another example would be describing a large class of humans as having zero inherent value (in which case, enslaving them to serve the people who do have value all is a rational response)
