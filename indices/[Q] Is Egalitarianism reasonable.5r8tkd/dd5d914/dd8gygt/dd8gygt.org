I fundamentally do not believe in"evil".

I believe all people have a worth. An intrinsic worth, a baseline worth that does not go below a certain level.

For this belief, I agree with fundamental human rights.

But Wikipedia's definition of egalitarianism, I disagree.

I measure people's worth not in terms of other peoples, but in terms of potential utility.

If I had to save one group of people over another, I'll calculate the /effective/ potential utility of both groups, and save the more useful group.

Your last statement may be wrong. You don't know me, and I daresay you may be wrong. I'm 18, and my parents belong to the upper middle-class where I live. Many people would consider us rich.

I rarely interact with street rats(considering I'm in a university) and live in a sheltered neighbourhood(Estate) with people in the same social class.

I believe I'll have ample opportunity to interact with the latter group as I climb up the social ladder. I doubt I'll interact with the lesser group in future, especially as I disdain incompetence, scorn mediocrity and do not even consider myself with people below a certain intelligence threshold.

Snobbish and elitist? I know, and I do not care.

I believe conventional morality is a hindrance to a leader, I plan to be one in future, and am currently working on restructuring my beliefs and worldview into one as efficient as possible.

I should be able to make the "right" decisions in future. Even if it involves sacrificing human life.
