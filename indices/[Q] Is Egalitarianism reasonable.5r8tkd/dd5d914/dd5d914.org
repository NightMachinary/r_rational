If you don't take it axiomatic that people are equally valuable /on some level/, then why do you care that the medical genius will save billions of future lives while your relative won't? You haven't even established that 1,000,000,000 > 1. If you don't think you have any reason to care about the anonymous pauper, why do you condescend to care about the many anonymous paupers whose fate is dependent on that of their princess?

The importance of a person varies, but that importance is measured in persons, so there's clearly some unit of importance fundamental to persons. You gesture vaguely at the variation in importance, and use this as an excuse to dull your capacity to care about people at all (as the vast majority of people you interact with, if not /all/ of them, will be more like the "street rat" than the billionaire's daughter). Whether you are doing so intentionally or not - and I suspect you are - you are arguing in favor of evil, using (necessarily) irrational arguments.
