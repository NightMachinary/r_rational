I hear this often from people criticising rationality by aping an irrational version in their head, but not often from people who are themselves aspiring to rationality. Think it through.

For starters, what is the purpose of this excercise? you say that the "right" ten people may by some standard be more valuable than the "wrong" ten million people, but what value do those ten have without the ten million? Is not the value contribution of the uncommonly brilliant most commonly measured by the benefit that it brings to the many? The skill may be valuable, but only in the right context, and those people bring that context. If you value the context less than the skill then you are missing the point of the skill!

It is possible that this disagreement is a values dissonance rather than an issue of rationality, though hints in your OP suggest that it is not. I'll cover mine anyway: I want to increase and potentially maximise the health, happiness, safety, prosperity, and fulfillment of the greatest number of people possible, and ideally everybody. These are the values I begin with. Rationality is the tool to get there, to reason a path and find the best course of action.

The mistakes people often make are either to forget about the big picture (or rather, misidentifying a slightly smaller picture as the big picture) or failing to understand that the big picture is made of little pictures. This means that while their reasoning may make sense on one scale, if they reasoned it through properly they would see that the consequences are either antithetical to their overall mission statement (such as the one I just outlined) or will cause roadblocks down the line that will make further progress even harder, and perhaps impossible.

What even is the purpose of doctors and researchers and brilliant people if their work serves primarily to help those whose lives you value less? Does not your undervaluing of the vast majority of humanity undervalue the work of those who mean to raise up humanity? Of course it does, you are attacking egalitarianism because you undervalue that work. Is that work only valuable if it helps those who are capable of such contributions? That would create a class of elites who act only to help themselves at the expense of the many, who are left behind in ailing conditions and reduced opportunity to improve their situation. It is certainly in conflict with my values. I can see how someone following my values would come to your position /if they did not think it through,/ by treating preferentially those with the ability to help, in the hopes of increasing their effectiveness. But the consequences actually harm progress toward my goals, so I advocate against it.

This is actually the current, real situation, and to make things political, the entire motivation of the Republican party. It leads to social instability and increased suffering. Just watch! That experiment is entering its final stages.

The thing is, there are a lot more people in the world with the ability and drive to improve the state and stability of the world, their home nations, and the people who live there, in realms political, financial, technological, educational, scientific, medical, rational, artistic, and more. The talent, ability and intellect exists in far greater supply than the opportunity make use of it and make that difference. It's not enough to get by on the actions of a few well meaning elites. Larger scale progress cannot be implemented by increasing the power of a privileged and talented few, but by increasing opportunity until we have a talented many. That is the egalitarian model. And it isn't just the work of those with marketable degrees that are valuable. those who work in sanitation are routinely undervalued and underpayed, but would you want to live in a world without them? Municipal sanitation was one of the greatest and most important advances in health and quality of life of the twentieth century! Thank your garbage collectors. They don't need geniuses to do their job, but geniuses sure as hell need garbage collectors to do theirs.

As it is we have a tiny fraction of the world's population trying to ruin the world for their own gain and another tiny fraction of the world who are trying to save it, and everyone else sitting in the middle able to do very little except wait and see what happens, and this is entirely unsustainable and irrational to support.
