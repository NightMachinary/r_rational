Hold on. Are we talking about intrinsic values or extrinsic values here?

A rich philanthropist has higher extrinsic value than a poor man, because of the good that he will go on to do with his life. If we had the option to kill either a random everyman or a doctor who will go on to save five sick people, of course we should choose to spare the doctor. But that doesn't mean that the doctor's life is intrinsically worth more than the everyman's - it means that the doctor /plus five sick people/ is worth more than the everyman.

In and of themselves, human lives are equally valuable.

P.S. Don't say "street rat", and don't assume that homeless people are below average intelligence. It's extremely rude to stereotype people like that.
