  A billionaire's daughter or princess of a kingdom is far more valuable than a street rat of average or below intelligence.
#+end_quote

A billionaire's daughter or a princess was born into a position of power. She has done nothing to earn that status - no feat of intellect or skill is required to be born a princess, nor does princesshood confer any gifts or knowledge that cannot be obtained elsewhere.

By your criteria, then - "intelligence, past contributions, current assets, knowledge/skill set, rarity of skill set, relevance of skill set, motivations, etc" - what has a princess done to deserve such value? At least a homeless person has demonstrated the ability to sleep rough without starving or freezing, to stay determined in the face of adversity, and has learned firsthand how society mistreats those it can get away with mistreating. Shouldn't you value her life more highly than a billionaire's daughter?
