Clearly, this statement is wrong at face-value since humans clearly have differences. The statement has a more complicated political/law meaning.

The second example differs from the first in that while the researcher has some merit, a princess is simply born into a princess. So you are saying the rich are more valuable simply for being rich. A leftist/marxist (the kind who would support egalitarianism) would object to that and point out that the poor does work that sustains society. I think the statement is going from rational to villainous evil.
