It's actually sort of funny, because the term "chauvinist" originally meant a sort of blind, exaggerated patriot. In the late 60s the term "male chauvinist" was used to refer to sexists, and later it transmuted into being just about sexism, with the earlier sense being mostly dropped in modern times (along with the need to append "male"). So it's totally fine to say that the Doctor is a "Time Lord chauvinist", just a little bit unconventional.
