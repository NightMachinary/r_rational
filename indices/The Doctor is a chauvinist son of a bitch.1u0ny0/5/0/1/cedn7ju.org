Ah, okie. I don't think I've ever seen it used in the sense of "racist" rather than "sexist", but no matter.

(Funny thing is the Doctor, IIRC, has also explicitly said that Time Lords are more corruptible than humans, that a time lord (including himself) directly absorbing the power of the time vortex the way Rose did would be really really really really really bad. Actually, come to think of it, I think he said that in the same episode, heck, in the same conversation that he admitted to Jack that he might be a bit of a irrational bigot on the subject of immortality.

(I think the episode was "Utopia")
