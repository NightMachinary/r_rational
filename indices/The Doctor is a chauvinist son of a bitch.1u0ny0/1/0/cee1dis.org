They're generally portrayed as having Gone Decadent and Corrupt, prior to the Time War. I wouldn't call them the good guys, but neither would I say they were really /bad/, either. It's not like they purposely ruined their own lives, or ruined the lives of whole other species (that often) and thought it good to do so. They even fought the war against the Great Vampires.

Overall, I'd call it a better universe for having had the Time Lords keeping a measure of historical order, even if they weren't the ideal universal rulers.

(Some of the Expanded Universe stuff even claimed they had a treaty of neutrality and equality with an Expy of The Culture, so in that conception it's not even as if the Time Lords were /really/ universal rulers, just one of the several parties at the top of the heap.)
