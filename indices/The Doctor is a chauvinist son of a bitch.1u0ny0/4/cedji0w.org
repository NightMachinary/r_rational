While I overall agree with you, the organization in question, as the other commenters have noted, wasn't trying to solve death or anything, but explicitly trying to kill the Doctor, and was engineering an assassin. And all of that was to serve the offshot branch of those that believed that Silence Must Fall.

The Doctor himself did, in fact, once concede to Jack Harkness that his prejudice against immortals might be a flaw, that it might be a bad part of himself, an irrational bigotry.
