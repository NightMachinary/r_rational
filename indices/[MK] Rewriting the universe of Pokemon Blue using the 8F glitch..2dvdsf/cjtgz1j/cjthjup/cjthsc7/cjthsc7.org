The way these work is by exploiting a glitch (or series of them) that can write an arbitrary number to an arbitrary address, and can change the program counter. If you write a series of numbers to a block of addresses, then move the program counter the the beginning of said block, the console will execute whatever assembly is stored in said block. Hence, arbitrary code.

It's not really a hack since someone trapped inside the vanilla game would have access to this ability.
