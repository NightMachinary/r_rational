If this is what we're doing, I recommend [[http://youtu.be/JxgEXDnXD6M][this]], where Mario finds the exact pattern of jumps necessary to take over the universe in a minute and a half. Not just fiddling with the details like Red here; Mario decides he'd rather be playing other games, so he does.

Red gets in on the action too, [[http://youtu.be/3UnB1fomvAw][manifesting dancing numerical constants]] and [[http://youtu.be/aYQpl8Jj6Yg?t=10m30s][replacing reality with something he prefers]].

Breaking out of the Matrix is really dangerous you guys.
