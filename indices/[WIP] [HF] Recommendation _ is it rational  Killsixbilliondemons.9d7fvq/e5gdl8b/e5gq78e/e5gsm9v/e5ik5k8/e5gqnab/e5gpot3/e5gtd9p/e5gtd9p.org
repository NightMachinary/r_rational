  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
