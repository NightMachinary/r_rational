I'm honestly convinced that's where the author got at least some of the background lore.

All of the info with Yisun, Yis, and Un reads way too much like Anu, Anuiel, and Sithis. Hell, even the stuff right after with the Multiplicity is kind of like the first few generations of Aedra and Daedra. There's no direct parallel to the King/Mage/Rebel dynamic but you could definitely make the argument that something like it is in the works with the bestowing of the Key to Allison.
