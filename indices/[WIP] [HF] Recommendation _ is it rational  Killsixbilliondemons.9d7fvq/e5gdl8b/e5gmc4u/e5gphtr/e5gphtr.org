Ok, this went longer than I thought it would, But I agree entirely with you.

IIRC, death, ignorance and fragmentation is the purpose of the multiverse and all within it, not the virtues derived from such elements. YISUN finds his rationally perfect existence pointless and so commits divine suicide. Now, YISUN is everything, so after this he both exists as an individual, as a divine providence within reality and as all the fragments of himself, which make time and space, as well as YIS and UN.

Both gods are incompatible truths: one is all that is, one is all that is not. Since they are incompatible they fight, but since they've already understand half of the divine truth of YISUN, the hate becomes love when they understand the other (and what YISUN wanted of them), then they inherit the will of YISUN and have the 777, 777 children. Death and division, and an advancement of YISUN's cause.

These gods then create angels, servants and humans. Humans, the least perfect and most irrational, are fascinating to the gods. The 777, 777 are enlightened and go through the same divine suicide, creating the wheel around throne, scattering humanity and the servants out of throne. Note that everything done is to drive the successive generations further from divinity, enlightenment and grace, which is the exact opposite of what comes to mind when I think of a rational way to improve myself.

Eventually we reach poor Al-YIS-UN, someone who hates themselves, understands nothing of the universe and their own place within it. She is the one chosen by both providence, which exists in the KSBD universe, as well as the one whom we can call closest to god, Zoss, to inherit all of creation and end the madness of the enlightened and rational demiurges

Outside of what we see in the comic, we see the same conflict of a pointless reality in the blurbs and parables we see in abbadons fluff. YISUN's disciples all struggle to accept the singular nature of the universe, that it is a lie, and that there is only YISUN, lying to himself and everything that thinks it exists. The secret name of god is I, in the wheel and outside of it.

Personally, I make the argument that YISUN, after achieving a rational perfection, has started an attempt to lie convincingly to himself and obtain a greater perfection through the imperfect universe and successor, in some weird fashion.

Because of this, irrationality is rewarded in universe, and rationality punished, since god doesn't want anything to do with it.
