The universe (multiverse?) of KSBD demands a different sort of rationality, where ignorance becomes a strength all of its own, and attempts to game the system are both well loved and horribly punished at the same time, like poor stupid Aesma.

That being said, rationality is useful for anyone not striving for royalty, but so extremely dangerous it pays better dividends to be irrational. Jadis of the demiurges is powerful, immortal and omnipotent, but her enlightenment caused her body to begin breaking down and now she wishes only for death. Jagganoth and Metatron both wish for the end of all things, after learning some of the truth of creation.

For those who become truly enlightened, death, disgrace and poverty await. Meti was the strongest swords women alive, and she lived in a barrel and begged for food. Zoss abandoned throne and got his head cut off (just like he planned). The gods committed suicide to the last.

In the world of YISUN, the daughter of a noodle vendor is best off remaining as a noodle vendor. Lying to oneself is the most rational choice, but only if it's not on purpose.
