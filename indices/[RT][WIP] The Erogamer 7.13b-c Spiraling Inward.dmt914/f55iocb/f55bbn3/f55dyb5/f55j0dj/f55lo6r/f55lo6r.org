Sorry, didn't mean to offend. Got lazy and didn't write out my question properly. I did not think the book was bad, but you're right I should have asked "does the book move faster from a time line perspective, or is the beginning pace of the book what I can expect for what is written so far"? For me personally the balance of "thing happening" vs "react/think about/monologue feelings or thoughts about thing happening" was not what I wanted out of the story at the time.
