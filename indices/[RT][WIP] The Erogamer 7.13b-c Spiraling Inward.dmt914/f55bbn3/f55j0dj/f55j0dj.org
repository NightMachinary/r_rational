  does it eventually get better?

I always, always hate this phrasing.

LikÂ­ing is a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eDpPnT7wdBwWPGvo5/2-place-and-1-place-words][two-place]] word.

Instead of the always near-offensive "Does it get better?" can't people ask if it gets different from the bits they personally disliked, but which lots of other people loved? You are asking this question to people who loved it, and using a phrasing that assumes it sucks. A classic "Have you stopped beating your wife, yet?"

Even a 'Does it get better in this regard?" would have been vastly preferable.
