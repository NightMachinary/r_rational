I did not mind the philosophical debates, I actually enjoyed that aspect, but at the time I was reading the balance between real events happening and the debates wasn't what I was in the mood for. I think at the time I was looking for a stronger focus on the game aspects and got frustrated that it took awhile before new events/power ups happened. Not a problem with the book itself, just a disconnect between what I was looking for.
