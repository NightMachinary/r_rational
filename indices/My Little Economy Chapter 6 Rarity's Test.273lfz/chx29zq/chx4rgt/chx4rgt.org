I hope you realize that I have a lecture in half an hour that will go for two hours, and then I have to meet with an operating-systems professor who will probably try to talk to me about doing a PhD with him, I have an MSc thesis manuscript to work on, I have proof-programming lessons to do, I have to study Bayesian statistics/probability theory while I still have the textbook from the library, I have to go the gym, and maybe then I can have a social life... at some point I'm supposed to get around to trying to save the world... and I'm tempted to click on this link.

You're /good/ at this.
