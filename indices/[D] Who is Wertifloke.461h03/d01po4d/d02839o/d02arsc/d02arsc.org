- You mentioned in a (public) Facebook thread that /Time Braid/ was your first exposure to Naruto. Presumably you were exposed to /Time Braid/ through [[/r/rational]].

- /Time Braid/ was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/28n846/rt_naruto_time_braid_groundhog_day_fanfiction/][first submitted]] to [[/r/rational]] around 1.5 years ago, in June 2014.

- /The Waves Arisen/ was posted all at once (or close to it) right before your hiatus on /HPMoR/ ended---around the end of January 2015. I would guess that this implies that the work was written on some varying timescale before then and queued for publication (rather than the assumption everyone else seems to be making: that the author can just type very fast.)

That gives you a decent window to read /Time Braid/, read up (and maybe watch) /Naruto/, decide to write something, pick the "genre" of rational /Naruto/ fic, plot it out, write it, and set it up as a "treat" to presage /HPMoR/'s return.

It also gives you a pretty good motive---to write something serving as all of:

- a /break/ from the stress of /HPMoR/, which everyone had very high expectations for.

- as /practice/ for a complete story---important for someone who knew that they hadn't had much practice writing endings, especially satisfying munchkin-shaped endings.

- as a /NaNoWriMo/ novel. Although you've never (to my knowledge) personally mentioned participating in NaNoWriMo, your wife does, and likely was in November 2014 ...though I'm not sure how well you knew one-another at that point in time? Anyway, I would also say that, when outlined, /The Waves Arisen/ fits well as the kind of short story that results from a single month-long writing sprint, with a good bit of editing and polish done later.

- as, perhaps, a /fun social interaction/ with someone you wouldn't ordinarily get to collaborate with.

Actually, taking that last point further: I don't think anyone was considering that the work might have been cowritten until you mentioned the possibility, just now. Cowriting would, of course, thwart stylometric analysis. It would also make your easy assumption of outside view on the work---complimenting its originality and so forth---more "human"; you'd be complimenting your co-author's contributions.

.../and/ it would make your above comment into one of those infuriating literal statements---it would make perfect sense that you /cannot/ confirm /or/ deny you are the author of /The Waves Arisen/, if it is not true that you are "the author", and also not true that you are not "the author", because you are one of multiple authors.
