  I think it's unlikely that Eliezer would write a rationality story and then not take credit for it.

He literally did that with HPMOR until months after he first started publishing it. Kinda, anyway. Read [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/20w/open_thread_april_2010/1uf9][this set of posts]] on that popped up on LW as late as April 2010.

  Lesswrong is writing a story, called "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality". It's just about what you'd expect; absolutely full of ideas from LW.com. I know it's not the usual fare for this site, but I'm sure a lot of you have enjoyed Eliezer's fiction as fiction; you'll probably like this as well.

  Who knows, maybe the author will even decide to decloak and tell us who to thank?

  I'm 98% confident it's Eliezer. He's been taunting us about a piece of fanfiction under a different name on fanfiction.net for some time. I guess this means I don't have to bribe him with mashed potatoes to get the URL after all.

  Yeah, I don't think I can plausibly deny responsibility for this one.
