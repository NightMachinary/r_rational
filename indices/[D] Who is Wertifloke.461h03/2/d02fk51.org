We should all pick a few of the worst --- but still good --- fanfictions that could conceivably be written by Yudkowsky, and consistently say they're written by him. Progressively choose fiction of lower and lower quality, until he's forced to tell us which is actually his!

Note: Do not actually do this. I think it might be libelous.
