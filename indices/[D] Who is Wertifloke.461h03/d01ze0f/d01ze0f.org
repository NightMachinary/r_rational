I don't think it's Eliezer, the style is pretty different to anything Eliezer has ever written, at least I think so.

I don't think it's unusual to create new identities for individual projects either. I've done it before, I don't think it's particularly weird, and I would predict Wertifloke to be perhaps more likely to be no-one significant in particular, as opposed to someone well-known under a different name in the world of fiction, rational or otherwise.
