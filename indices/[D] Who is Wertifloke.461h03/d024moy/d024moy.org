Hmm, there are some things that make this less likely.

I am positive I've seen Eliezer refuse to confirm or deny that he is Wertifloke after someone asks him. I also remember the facebook post where he talks about anonymously writing things, and asks everyone to never confirm or deny their identities if asked.

Eliezer did comment and praise "Waves Arisen" for its originality in one of the earlier chapters, which would be a bit weird, but something I definitely wouldn't put past him.

Also, Wertifloke, when he first released the first chapter here, said that he intended to finish it all before Methods started its final arc. I would think it a bit strange that Eliezer would spend three weeks writing a complete story when, from his own account, he wasn't even finished compiling the final versions of the Methods chapters. I recall that some of the chapters were fully put together not very long before they were uploaded.

Alas, this is at least plausible. Eliezer has read a lot of Naruto fanfiction, so I wouldn't be that surprised if this ends up being him.
