Hmmm, I have made personal copies of /Waves Arisen/ in epub and mobi formats when I thought the website was only going to be up for a short while. (I never made any pdfs, because the font size tends to be off or some similar issue)

Would people be interested in me distributing these copies? Is this an ethical thing to do when I cannot get in contact with [[/u/Wertifloke]] to ask if s/he would be okay with this?

EDIT: Alright! Anyone who wants a personal copy of /The Waves Arisen/, PM me.

Also, I've successfully made a proper-looking pdf version after trying it again today.
