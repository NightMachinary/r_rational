I can answer the questions about reasons why you'd do it, since I've done it.

Pseudonyms are good for works of a different nature or with less time invested, to counter expectations (real or imagined), to post something untoward, or to avoid prejudice/favoritism during the weekly challenge (which I couldn't otherwise participate in since I run it). Plus if you post something under a pseudonym you know that any attention or appreciation it gets is real and honest, based solely on the work itself rather than accrued credit.

(That said, I didn't write /The Waves Arisen/.)
