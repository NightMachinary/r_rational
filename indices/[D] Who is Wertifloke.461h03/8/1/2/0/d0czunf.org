There's a section of HPMOR, it might have been during the Self-Actualization arc, where Harry talks about applying the reasoning of "I can neither confirm nor deny" seemingly at random, so that people can't deduce from your usage of it your true meaning.

The fact that he's discussed this before means you can take absolutely nothing from his usage of that phrase, because the chances are high he applies it in exactly the same way.
