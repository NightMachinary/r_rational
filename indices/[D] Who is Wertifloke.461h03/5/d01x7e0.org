  A few minor details, such as the different between "chÅ«nin" (the style used in A Drop of Poison) and "chuunin" (the style used in The Waves Arisen), point to their difference as well.

This has very little weight. If I had written a Naruto fanfic, and I wanted to write a new one that couldn't be traced back to me, this is exactly the sort of cheap details I would change.

(Then again, if I had written a Naruto rationalfic, and I wanted to write a new rationalfic that couldn't be traced back to me, I probably wouldn't use the Naruto setting at all.)
