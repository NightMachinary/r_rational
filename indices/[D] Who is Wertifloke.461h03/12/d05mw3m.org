I just read the first several chapters of The Wave Arisen, and I have to say, there's almost too much thematic overlap with Yudkowsky's writing for it to have /not/ been written by him. The focus on the prisoner's dilema; authority figures "following a script"; the oblique references to Worm characters; the emphasis on real world consequences to bad decisions, the list goes on and on.

Edit: Just finished a few more chapters and I'm now basically certain this is either written or co-written by Yudkowski. The interlude in chapter 11 is just way too similar to other writing by Yudkowski, not to mention how the author quotes Yudkowski writing (Final Words). It is /exactly/ like a test draft of the thematic structure of the last chapter of HPMOR -- only written before HPMOR was finished! Barring strong evidence to the contrary, I'm concluding that Yudkowski wrote some or all of this.
