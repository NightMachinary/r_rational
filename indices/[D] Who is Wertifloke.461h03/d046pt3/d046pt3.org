I don't know anything about Nate Soares except through the internet, but I think there are some similarities between The Waves Arisen and his nonfiction. I'm not talking about specific tics or phrases, just content and quality and style. Both The Waves Arisen and his essays are motivational and interesting to me. Does anyone think he might have written TWA? I think that's more likely than Eliezer having written it.

This community of readers and authors is so small that it's not very surprising to me your analysis turned up inconclusive. We exert a lot of influence on each other, and started off similar to begin with.
