I once asked Eliezer on reddit if he wrote The Waves Arisen. He told me that he could neither confirm nor deny it. So I doubt we're going to get any information from that direction.

Edit: I have also been unable to reach Wertifloke on their wordpress website, nor through any other means. It is a shame, because if they have any other stories I would like to read them.
