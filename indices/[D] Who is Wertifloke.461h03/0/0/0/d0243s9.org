It seems to me that the purpose of this was to obscure the identity of author of /Girl Corrupted by Internet/; but Eliezer decided against it, for some reason, and published it under his actual name.

(or it could be that the /real/ author of /Girl Corrupted by Internet/ isn't Eliezer, and his taking credit for it was a part of some plot; if it so, I have no idea what this plot could possibly be)
