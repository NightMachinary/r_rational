Off-topic: An hour ago I was wondering this exact thing; similar phenomena have occurred when thinking of contacting a friend, and within fifteen minutes they contact me. Is this the same phenomena that occurred when Newton and Leibniz both independently conceived and formulated the calculus? How does one go about investigating its cause?

Best guess is like thoughts occur all the time, but only when presented with evidence of an agent, uninfluenced by ourselves, thinking the same thought at or near the same time do we notice and give weight to the occurrence. This doesn't explain the calculus issue, an explanation for which I've heard posits that the confluence of the sum of an era's knowledge in the minds of experts can lead to identical insights if the base of knowledge is the same.

Thoughts?
