It's likely to be a coincidence, because throughout an individual's lifespan they will have millions and millions of thoughts. Therefore, events with a one-to-million odds for occurring at a similar time period as to when you will have a thought about the event occurring are likely to happen over and over given billions of chances. In addition, you and your friends have similar routines due to living in the same time zone, so the both of you were bound to call at the same time sooner or later (in fact if your friend tends to always call around 5:00 PM, you are likely to be thinking of him/her right before the call).

It's hard to say how unlikely it was for Newton and Leibniz to come up with the same idea because we don't know about all of the other people who could have come up with the same idea given a few more months to years. Hence this probably looks more improbable than it really is.

TL;DR - It's not as unlikely as you'd think and even if it was, there are so many chances for it to occur that it has to happen sooner or later.
