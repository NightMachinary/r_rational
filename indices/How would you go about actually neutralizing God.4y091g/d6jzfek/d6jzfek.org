If God describes himself accurately in his books, then not by a long shot. Like, what are you thinking? What would you even /do/? Our most powerful weapons are explosives that can destroy cities.

Where would you fire them? Why would you /bother/?

If God exists as advertised, your best course of action is repentance. I get that people don't like the idea of worshipping some controlling asshat, but sometimes you've gotta shrug and cope with the universe you live in.
