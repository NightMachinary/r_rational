  By what I understand of islam, I expect god to be neutralized by virtue of being multifaceted enough to see all sides.

Why would this be the case?

God in Islam iirc outright stated to [[https://quran.com/3/123-129][sending angels to interfere in a tribal conflict for Mohammed]], and angels have shown the ability to disguise themselves almost perfectly to deal with mortals.

It's not a being that you can expect to not act.
