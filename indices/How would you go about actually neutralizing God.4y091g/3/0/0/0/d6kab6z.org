I was, of course, being humorous. Yours is an accurate reading as far as I recall.

Maybe continuing the corporate metaphor is the right way to go.

I stand by my "find better gods" solution. But maybe it is a hostile takeover that is required to "neutralize" the old order. Buy up part of a sphere covered by an old Greek/Roman god, and just work up the set. Sea, War, Farming, Writers, etc. Just with rational solutions and modern technology to answer prayers.

Maybe with the help of some of the more scary gods -- I'm thinking again Hindu, but maybe also Chinese, West African, or Native American -- never absorbed by the Abrahamic religion you could run a disruptive new startup. One reactive to customer needs, and able to quickly pivot into new areas.
