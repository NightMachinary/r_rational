OP specifically stated that it was the Abrahamic god.It's the gods of the Christians, Muslims and Jews only.

Something can be logically possible but not scientifically proven.

You can say that god can't make a square hole fit in a round peg, but this does nothing for the idea that there are different celestial realms filled with inumerable angels (that God has explicitly used for war before) that God is at the center of (as described in Islam). This is not logically impossible, it's just not scienfically proven.

But, given that we're assuming God is real..it has to be assumed to be true.

And this goes for the other stuff. At the end of the day not being logically impossible is no salvation
