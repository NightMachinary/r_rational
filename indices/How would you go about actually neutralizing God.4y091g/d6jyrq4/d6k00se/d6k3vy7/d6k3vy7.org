I think you're missing my point. This whole line of reasoning is also really shaky, and doesn't agree with OP's prompt.

#+begin_quote
  OP specifically stated that it was the Abrahamic god.
#+end_quote

OP didn't say no other gods existed. Those three books being "divinely inspired" doesn't preclude other gods. In fact, the OT explicitly states that there are other gods. The NT even has demons.

You are adding in your own constraint and not giving any reasons. I gave reasons for my expanded scope.

Lots of supernatural things are implied by three religious texts being really, actually inspired by a supernatural being. I'm saying the Hindu deities are most likely next-tier gods. Their people are fruitful and successful, their beliefs survive the test of time with numerous followers, and their books are ancient and predate Christianity. There is evidence that parts of the three "divinely inspired" books are based on shared oral history and precursor writings. A shared history of similar beings, instead of Yahweh existing in a vacuum--an assertion which isn't even backed up by the three "true" books in our scenario.

A final thought on this point: */OP did not even state that Yahweh was the inspiration for those divinely inspired books./*

  Something can be logically possible but not scientifically proven.
#+end_quote

True. Nothing to do with what I said, however. I'm talking about things from the books that aren't logically possible /given existing scientific observations/. Not just unknown or unproven, but /known to be false/.

If the Bible actually said the Earth is 4000 years old (it doesn't, explicitly), then that part would be wrong. It doesn't agree with scientific observation and best theories. There was no great flood that covered the entire planet and humans and a few animals escaped via divine hints. That doesn't agree with geological and oceanographic historic data.

OP said parts of those books would not be accurate. *I'm suggesting the existence of the supernatural doesn't throw out all of science. It just requires careful observation and new theories.*

  ...this does nothing for the idea that there are different celestial realms filled with inumerable angels (that God has explicitly used for war before) that God is at the center of (as described in Islam). This is not logically impossible, it's just not scienfically proven.
#+end_quote

It is impossible based on current science, which was my constraint for reality. It also isn't very good logic, as it doesn't have very well formed assumptions that back the conclusions. Given observations about how the universe works, it doesn't make sense for there to be an uncountable infinity of angels and hidden divine war bunkers.

#+begin_quote
  But, given that we're assuming God is real..it has to be assumed to be true.
#+end_quote

This is so off it isn't even wrong. That isn't how anything works: logic, science, or epistemology.

The books are inaccurate, as OP said. And who says Yahweh can't lie when inspiring people to write those books? Really, this isn't a well thought out point at all.
