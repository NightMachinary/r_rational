  You are adding in your own constraint and not giving any reasons. I gave reasons for my expanded scope.
#+end_quote

I mean...the reasoning is simple: OP wants to have a discussion about countering the Abrahamic God. Thus he posits that the Abrahamic god exists.

He never posits a mechanism for this that would justify expanding existence to any other gods (*you* decide to posit that number of believers somehow matter, *you* impose a mechanism that justifies that leap).

So I never see a reason to infer this from the OP's stated words nor any reason to infer this from the OP's implicit desires. Like, if you read that post, it seems clear to me what he wants. And it's not about discussing the Hindu gods.

At a certain point you have to ask yourself where reason is taking you? It seems that you can add certain features and then extrapolate whatever you like,but then are we talking about what the OP stated? Neutralizing the Abrahamic god?

  True. Nothing to do with what I said, however. I'm talking about things from the books that aren't logically possible given existing scientific observations. Not just unknown or unproven, but known to be false.

We don't even use those rules for scifi universes (and scifi doesn't have the metaphysical claim that God is transcendent). I wouldn't respond to a Culture-on-Earth hypothetical by saying that the Culture would fail cause some power of theirs doesn't work according to our science.

It's not just not how these things work by convention, it's not /fun/.

  OP said parts of those books would not be accurate. I'm suggesting the existence of the supernatural doesn't throw out all of science. It just requires careful observation and new theories.
#+end_quote

They could be inaccurate for other reasons, like the message getting corrupted.

Even so, you still have to maintain a "core" of "Godness" otherwise you're not really discussing anything like the actual God of the popular conception.

If the Islamic God says he knows everything down to the finest atom or something similarly absurd...tough shit if that contradicts some scientific principle.

If we tossed it all out then there's no point.

/Some/ of it may be inaccurate. But there are limits before we're not actually talking about God as seen by people or as written- making the whole exercise pointless- and you're just creating an alternate being to discuss.

Frankly, I blame the OP for this. Cause the entire scenario is flawed. God as described is kind of unbeatable, so the OP throws in a sort of weak caveat and never fleshes it out. So this is exactly what happens: you either extrapolate too much to find a path to something seemingly impossible or there's little to nothing to discuss.
