Either we are talking about a world that makes sense and is like our own, or we're talking about complete fantasy.

OP *wasn't* discussing a world where, for all of creation, Yahweh existed -- a world completely unlike ours and with totally different rules -- but our world /plus truly divinely inspired religious texts and the god of those books/.

This is RWxBible^{3} fanfic. I assumed a rational world, with rational rules, and explained how that could even work based on how we see reality in the real world.

In this fanfic world, Yahweh cannot possible be the only god, because the Old Testament /itself/ says *there are other gods*. He is the "god of gods" -- at least, so He claims through Iron Age scribes. It is without question that the core "godness" of Yahweh in a world that actually has *A GOD* /REQUIRES/ other gods. I explained where and what those gods likely were, based on successfulness of world religions.

Your interpretation of the original question is lacking in rational depth and scope. You do not even attempt to posit a rational world.

Why are you posting in this sub again?

  So this is exactly what happens: you either extrapolate too much to find a path to something seemingly impossible or there's little to nothing to discuss

Again, why are you arguing with me if I did nothing but what had to be done /to even discuss this topic/?
