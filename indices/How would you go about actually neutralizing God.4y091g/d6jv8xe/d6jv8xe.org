The holy books are inconsistent enough that "how would we neutralize God as defined in the holy books" is underspecified. If he's capable of creating the universe in a day, there's probably not much you can do. If he has to send the angel of death to kill the Egyptians by looking at the marks on the doorposts rather than just waving his hand and having them all instantly die, he's a lot weaker.
