Apparently, it is possible to [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2032:22-32][win a wrestling match with God]]. Also, he's prone to making [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15][long lasting promises]]. Combining that creatively might be a way to get to the standard omnipotent-genie condition (which you'd want to be very careful with, obviously).

He seems to respond well to blood sacrifice, so a program of breeding large numbers of doves and pigeons might be in order. No sense wasting energy on lambs and oxen, unless there is found to be some empirical benefit. (Note: Mt. Carmel used oxen, but there's no explicit requirement of bigger and more expensive animals.)

The city of Sodom [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+18%3A16-33][could have been spared]] by seeding it with ten 'Righteous' people. So one way to neutralize God's wrath would be to make sure the world has a small clan of 'Righteous' people living in every city.

We don't necessarily know what Righteous is for the purposes of this rule, but there seems to be some type of bloodline effect involved rather than a purely behavioral property. Lot and his family are seemingly considered Righteous for the sake of the story, despite exhibiting what we might think of as reprehensible behavior, due to their relationship to Abraham. Of course, not trying to /rape angels/ probably factors into the consideration of what counts as Righteous, but there were probably a fair number of women and children in Sodom who had no part in that particular event. In any case, selectively breeding Righteous bloodlines and ensuring that a small tribe of ten or so exists in every city (especially ones known for wickedness) would seem to be highly advisable.

Another way to potentially steer divine will would be to use an artifact such as the Ark of the Covenant. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel+6][Obed-Edom]] got good results by hosting the Ark at his house for a few months, and presumably [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel+7:1][Abinadab's house on the hill]] had similar results in the twenty years it hosted the Ark. Such artifacts can certainly be dangerous, as God has been known to kill people who touch it without due reverence (for example, whilst trying to keep it from falling off of an oxcart, when it was supposed to be ported around on foot by Levites using sacred poles). Hosting it in a contaminated environment (e.g. dedicated to an idol such as Baal) tends to cause plagues to be released, so of course you don't do that.

One intriguing possibility is that Arks might be mass produceable. The question is whether there needs to be a new Covenant per Ark, or whether a single Covenant can have multiple Arks. Either way, you could have more than one Ark (assuming more than one Covenant is possible). Note that the Ten Commandment tablets of stone were destroyed and replaced; perhaps of the the broken tablets were to be repaired, they could be used to fuel a second Ark. Other types of spiritual artifacts might be collected and placed in suitable boxes to similar effect.

A good use for Arks of the Covenant (or Arks of Covenants, if you can talk Yahweh into agreeing to additional Covenants, perhaps one or more per generation) would be to filter un-Righteous people out of a given bloodline, making it extra pure over time. You could have a ceremony before a young man can get married where he has to touch the Ark with due reverence and survive. Since polygyny is tolerated by Yahweh, this wouldn't necessarily come at much cost to the tribe's ability to replenish its numbers. Those who survive the ceremony could also be given a special license, such that ten such individuals would receive pay for lodging in a Wicked city to prevent its destruction.

The Old Testament doesn't seem to have a Hell, but resurrecting the dead is desirable in any case. You'd want to preserve at least the bones of any dead people, since the [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2037:1-14][Valley of Dry Bones]] prophecy suggests this might be necessary. As far as I know, the only artifact known to resurrect the dead in the OT is [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+13:20-22][Elisha's Bones]]. During his life, Elisha also uses [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+4%3A18-37][full body contact]] with a patient to resurrect him, so direct contact with the bones may not be required. Such bones could perhaps be put in a box similar to the Ark along with other artifacts to keep them charged or to extend the range of their effect. Resurrecting wicked people would be important if there's a Hell, but it might be safer (less likely to trigger 'defilement' protections similar to the Ark in the temple of Baal) to use the bones to resurrect Righteous people first. More Righteous People in the vicinity would lessen any divine retribution in any case.

If Elisha himself could be resurrected from a partial skeleton somehow, it might be possible to self-replicate this artifact (assuming the resurrected Elisha has a complete skeleton, and eventually dies).
