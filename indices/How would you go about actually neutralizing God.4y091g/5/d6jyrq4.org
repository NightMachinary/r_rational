If Yahweh's book is mostly canon, everyone else should get at least the same level of treatment. That makes things...complicated.

Reality just became a crossover fix-fic. But, "/if it isn't logically possible given scientific observations, it isn't true/" still needs to be the rule of the day or nothing can be rationally determined about reality. Also, you can't just call a new god into being by writing it down. Otherwise, that would be happening all the time.

So literally all religions ever and everywhere can't all be true. That's not what reality acts like. Gotta trim things some.

You said big three, but let's do the numbers. It seems reasonable to say a religious book isn't "canon" if there aren't enough worshipers to prop it up. Let's say if you're looking at, oh, /10%/ or more of the population of the Earth, it gets added to the crossover fic that reality apparently is. That's an ass pull, but I did it without checking the exact numbers.

(furious wiki-ing later)

Here's what we've got: ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations]])

#+begin_example
  Religion        Adherents       Percentage
  Christianity    2.2 billion[3]  31.50%
  Islam           1.6 billion[4]  22.32%
  Secular[a]/Nonreligious[b]/Agnostic/Atheist...  
  ...             â‰¤1.1 billion   15.35%
  Hinduism        1 billion       13.95%
  Chinese traditional religion[c]...
  ...             394 million     5.50%
  Buddhism        376 million     5.25%
  (snip)
#+end_example

(Oh thank god [heh], those crazy ancient Chinese religious ideas didn't make the list. That would have been hard to manage. Ditto with Buddhism and their shit. No mountain-god-dragons, no hard to resolve reincarnation. Point is, it looks like Atheism + Hinduism vs. "God")

So, given that, two options when it comes to realistic deicide in a universe where it is possible:

1. *Just grab a spear or sword and go for it*, Greek/Roman/[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0yVUaL9CWs][Klingon style]]. This technique has a proud tradition in the only non-Abrahamic religion that is still "true enough" to count in this analysis. Staple on all the magical and religious stuff you can find and kill a god.

   It'll at least slow Him down if you take out an avatar or two and that will give you time to cut off the snake's head. Note: unlike Hinduism, this may not literally be a snake head.

   Just going ham on Yahweh is better than 3.8 billion or so (all Abrahamic religions' worshipers) killed due to ideological cleansing, the other proven way to "kill" a god's existence in our theory.

   /Negatives:/ may need a rocketship to reach heaven for the final boss battle. Constant natural disasters may kill hundreds of thousands. Popes will be unhappy about being constantly killed (both sets of them).

   /Positives:/ this has a proven track record in Hinduism. Good exercise.

2. *Find a better set of gods, then kill Yahweh*. According to the OT, they are out there. According to their religious books and teachings, they are awesome.

   Start a coalition of the willing. See if there are some disgruntled former employees from that famous Canaanite startup (protip: hail Satan). If Hindu religious books are right, this sort of thing happens all the time. See if you can get the Trimurti on-sides. Remember, tank, healer, and DPS. Need all three.

   /Negatives:/ this is basically starting a new religion, just with "disruptive" ideas gathered from existing ones.

   /Positives:/ it is *your* new religion, with blackjack and hookers. You'll have help with that three-part (two part now?) boss fight.
