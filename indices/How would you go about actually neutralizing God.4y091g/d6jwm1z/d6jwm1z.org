Well by the torah, I'd expect god to be neutralized by his own directives. By the king james bible, I'd expect god to be neutralized by his son basically going "Dad, don't be a dick". By what I understand of islam, I expect god to be neutralized by virtue of being multifaceted enough to see all sides.

In general this is a case of the invisible dragon in their garage. You can expect god to do nothing measurable or meaningful, where it can be recorded. Accordingly video cameras and regular recordkeeping effectively prevents god from acting in a detectable way. So I'd argue that god is effectively already neutralized.
