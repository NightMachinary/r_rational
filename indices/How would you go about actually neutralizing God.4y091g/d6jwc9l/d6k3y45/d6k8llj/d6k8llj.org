Specifically /not/ Satan. The two times he shows up in the bible - Job's first chapters and Jesus' temptation in the wilderness - he comes across as a loyal and effective employee. He thinks outside the box, but he never does anything God doesn't ask him to do.

Like I say, the Lucifer rebellion is (with the exception of one of the Pauline letters) only in the Apocrypha rather than the bible proper... and even there he's got nothing to do with Satan.
