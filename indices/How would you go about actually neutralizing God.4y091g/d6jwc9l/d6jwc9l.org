God's biggest biblical weakness seems to be a requirement tor intermediaries. God only speaks to specific people, and even then usually indirectly through angels or signs. Direct action by God seems so rare that the few times it happens could very well be explained as elision: God "created" the universe in the same way that Steve Jobs "created" the iPhone.

God as supervisor rather than pure omnipotence... a functional polytheist pantheon hiding behind a single CEO.

In that case, convincing various underlings to revolt would be the obvious path to neutralizing God's influence. Indeed the (largely apocryphal - in the classic sense) failed revolution by Lucifer seems to imply such a previous vote of no-confidence.

I'd also suggest that pushing for boardroom politics would be risky unless we could also guarantee that whomever filled the power vacuum would have our interests better in mind than God did... a tall order whether it's a new CEO, a committee, or some sort of nascent shareholder democracy.
