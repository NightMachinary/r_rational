Yeah, that was frankly a low point for me too. Completely out of nowhere and edgy as fuck for no good reason. Right now I'm halfway through and the demon situation has been resolved through some vague brand of mindfuckery - Demon!Sakura has been reabsorbed and integrated into the main personality. Hinata though has been turned into some kind of crazy-ish assassin sub by the experience. They're also at the stage where they would have no problem stopping the invasion and even killing Orochimaru, but now they've found out about Pein so they'd rather train enough to beat /him/ too before they quit the loop.
