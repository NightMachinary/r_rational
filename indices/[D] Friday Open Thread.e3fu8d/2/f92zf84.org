So, just chronicling my recent reads...

I fessed up and read Mother of Learning, knowing that it's set to end soon. It was fun, though certainly not without flaws. The mystery is good, the world building is interesting, and I liked the fact that while we see everything from Zorian's POV we also see his issues and get to witness his character development. Now I'm still waiting for the end chapters.

To treat my withdrawal symptoms I then decided it might be a good time to read the /other/ famous time loop centered ratfic, Time Braid. I'm not even halfway through, but that one is leaving me less impressed. The concept of it is much better than the actual execution. A lot of people are put off by the sex and torture, and sure, both are /a tad bit/ gratuitous, but frankly, my biggest problem is that a lot of things feel just contrived, pulling off concepts out of nowhere. To begin with the odd idea of the Sexy no Jutsu being a special "real" transformation technique rather than just the regular transformation ninjas practice, except Naruto uses the template of a hot naked girl to confuse his male opponents and gave it a stupid name. Also, Hinata gets ridiculously out-of-character compared to her canon counterpart, especially during the Demon arc, currently one of the most eyeroll-worth bit of the fic for me. Still, I'll finish reading it I guess, mostly to see how it ends.
