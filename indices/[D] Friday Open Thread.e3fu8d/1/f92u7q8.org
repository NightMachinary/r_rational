How was everyone's Thanksgiving?

For mine we went to my sister's house and had a potluck, with everyone bringing a side and my sister taking care of mashed potatoes and the two turkeys. I made stuffing, which was my first time trying it, and kind of winged the recipe; it turned out really well, but I wouldn't be able to make it again, because I wasn't paying much attention to how much of which ingredients were going into it. Aside from the food, it was good to see some of the in-laws that I rarely ever see.

(I guess that should be 'every American's Thanksgiving', but if you're Canadian or whatever, feel free to chime in on what you did on your Thanksgiving day.)
