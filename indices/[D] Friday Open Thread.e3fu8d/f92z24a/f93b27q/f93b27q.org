I think it's more of a hobby that you do something like one project every few months, try following some 3D printer media and making a list of things you would like to do. Then estimate how long those projects would take and see if you would be happy if you got the printer just for that list of projects, it's a high bar but avoids buyer's remorse.

I would use it for: shelving, organizers(so many organizers), custom board game stuff(there are some incredible Catan piece and case prints), and personalized gifts (wood name plates and keychains spring to mind). I've also seen some very cool props and cosplay parts but that would be beyond me.
