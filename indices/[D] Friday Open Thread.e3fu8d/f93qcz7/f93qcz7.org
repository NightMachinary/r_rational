I recently started using [[https://habitica.com/static/home][Habitica]]. It's an app that let's you set tasks/habits and then when you check them off your character gets experience like in an RPG. There's a few other typical RPG elements such as parties, classes, and skills, just enough for it to feel more fun than a typical to-do list.

It will surprise no one here that I find seeing numbers go up makes me much more likely to do tasks I want to do anyway. I've really enjoyed it for getting me to write more and go to bed at a more reasonable time. If anyone else gives it a try, send me a PM and we can quest against dust bunnies together!
