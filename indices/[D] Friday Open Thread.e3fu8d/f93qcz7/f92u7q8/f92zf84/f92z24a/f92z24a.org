I'm contemplating getting a 3-in-1 3D printer/laser engraver/CNC engraver. Basically, I can have a machine to print out plastic pieces of any shape, put extremely detailed images on a lot of different materials, or carve letters or images into wood.

Long story short, I'm extremely interested in this, but everything I can think of using it for would be within the first few months until the novelty wears off. I don't really want to spend a grand on something that I can't think of any long term use for and end up putting into storage due to a lack of use.

If you had a [[https://shop.snapmaker.com/products/snapmaker-2-0-modular-3-in-1-3d-printers?utm_source=snap2-ks1&utm_medium=ks&utm_campaign=snap2-pre][Snapmaker]], what would you be using it for?
