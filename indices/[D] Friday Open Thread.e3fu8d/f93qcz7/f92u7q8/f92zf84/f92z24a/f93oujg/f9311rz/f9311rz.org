Can anyone help me to understand what's going on in the latest Lord of Mysteries chapters? I know there are several people on this sub following it.

I just must have missed a critical chapter or three. I don't understand why the MC isn't more surprised by Helmosuin's sudden appearance at his doorstep, nor do I understand why the Mother Tree is after him.

When I venture into the comments on webnovel, they're talking about the "Seven Lights" that serve the MC for some reason or act as knowledge sources to the him and this guy was one of them. I am not remembering this bit of lore at all...
