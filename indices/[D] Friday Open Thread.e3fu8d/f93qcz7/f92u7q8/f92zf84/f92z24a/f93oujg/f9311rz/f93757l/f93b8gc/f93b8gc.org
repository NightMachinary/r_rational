Thanks for the reply. If you can remember details is it possible you could elaborate?\\
How does Klein know anything about these colors? Does the mirror explain it to him at some point? I don't ever recall anything about yellow or red things. (But then, I'm blanking on who the Abraham family is.) Did I miss how this scientist is suddenly a spirit-world creature?

OK. Maybe I'm just wanting more than the author is willing to give, at this point. Because the explanation in 724 just seemed borderline nonsensical. When would be have even been 'in close proximity' to this God? And wasn't She after the person he was body-doubling for back then, not him?
