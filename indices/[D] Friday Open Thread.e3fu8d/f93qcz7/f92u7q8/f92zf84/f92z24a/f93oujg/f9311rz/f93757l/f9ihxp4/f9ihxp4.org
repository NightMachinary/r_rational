Regarding LotM:

The existence of seven Pure Lights were hinted many times before when Klein is above the fog, such as in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-399/][Chapter 399]]. We first know there is a Red Light from Arrodes during one of his question-and-answer sessions with Machinery Hivemind (and Klein learns his name in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-544/][Chapter 544]]), Yellow Light and the Pure White Brotherhood was mentioned in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-397/][Chapter 397]], and the recent appearance of Orange Light hints that they still incarnates as various influential figures in the human world as they did in the past.

The comments on webnovel are full of theorizing and occasional spoilers by people who read ahead.
