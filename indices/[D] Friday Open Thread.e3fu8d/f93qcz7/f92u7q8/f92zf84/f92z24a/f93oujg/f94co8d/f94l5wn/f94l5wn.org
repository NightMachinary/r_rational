  YES! I managed to ruin non-French bread for you! Victory!

I honestly understand why the francophone facebook group in my city contains half requests for beuh, half requests for au pairs, and half requests for "où le baise je peux trouver un bon pain bordel" (that french was bad on purpose)

  Tanguy played his first Cards Against Humanity game with you and he says he remembers it fondly.

Hearing all the cards being read out in ultra-sexy french accents is one of my fondest memories, and I really appreciate you inviting me along because I was really lonely before I'd managed to branch out a bit and make some of my own connections!

  Also, I agree about La Défense. Most underrated tourism location in Paris.

Yeah, it's beautiful. Reminds me of Bangkok - all new and sparkling (Bangkok also has old crummy sections, but it obviously doesn't remind me of those). It does require either the 1 or the RER, and as a newcomer I hated the RER (older trains, more crowded at peak times, and harder to know if you were going to end up in the right place - I ended up at Gare de Lyon instead of St Michel once!).

Another one: I also really liked Arts et Métiers. They've got an original replica of the kilogram from The Revolution, along with a litre and metre. Those were so badass. Plus this fucking lion eating a snake made entirely of /glass/ like wtf.
