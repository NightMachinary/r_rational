My partner had to do some treatments in the morning & evening, so I went into work for a bit with the dog, and then she came home and then to me with the cat, and we had a nice walk around a deserted campus / arboretum. After, we came home and watched some tv and did some cleaning. Our Thanksgiving meal was a veggie roast from our local coop, a side salad, and some blanched spinach -- all quite tasty! We did have a brief discussion of our reciprocal gratitude for one another.

(I've never been a big Thanksgiving sort of guy -- growing up, celebrations were always a little lame -- and my partners also fairly tepid on the holiday. Both of us quite like the fall season, though!)
