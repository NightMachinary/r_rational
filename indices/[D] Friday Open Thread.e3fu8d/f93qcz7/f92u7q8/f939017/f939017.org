The biggest thing was that I was the host for the first time for Thanksgiving. This was also the first time I ever baked a cheesecake and the turkey. My family prefers potluck style celebrations so everyone brought a side dish, dessert, or helped me with making gravy.

I'm proud to say that everyone just about died for my whiskey cheesecake!

Now we are helping my brother and his girlfriend moving into their new apartment which is cool to do.
