OK well Weasel World Tour is over!!!! I didn't keep updating on reddit because I got too busy and I'm sure you all missed me like crazy. Here's my takeaways:

- [[/u/couteaubleu]] was exactly what you'd expect, and he was a real darl for coming to my going away party that was organised at the very last minute. and i finally managed to demonstrate that i have learned what a good baguette is, though the bakery the baguette i presented him with was my third favourite bakery in the Paris region (the other two are in Sèvres, which is not Paris, but to an Australian it is). (My partners brought an Australian baguette (or, as we say in Australian English - I shit you not - a "french stick") with them to the airport when they picked me up, and it was horrible I need to find some good bread now :|

- [[/u/svalbardcaretaker]] was extremely friendly and personable (he seems very reserved on here IDK), I only spent one afternoon with him but it was one of my fondest memories (and my saddest memory). Highly recommend him to anyone who wants a friend/tour guide.

- Paris tourist "hidden gems" (there is nothing hidden about any of this, Paris is the most tourested city in the world IIRC): Tour Montparnasse had the best view of Paris (CouteauBleu recommended it to us and we went there on my last day between breakfast and lunch) but was relatively quiet (maybe because it was a Monday in November?). La Défense is spectacular: it's full of all these huge modern skyscrapers rather than the Hausmannian stuff of Paris proper. La Grande Arche has another great view of paris and all the modern buildings and was practically deserted when I went there (....a thursday morning in november) and the only other people there were francophones, not sure if locals or like from Lyon or *shudder* belgium. Other notworthy was La Panthéon, which is a huge monumental building with gorgeous paintings and statues and the graves of famous french people (including Braille, the Curies, Voltaire, Lorenz....) - we only went there because my husband wanted to see something related to some famous french Mathemetitian, and I managed to find that Lorenz was buried at La Panthéon which he consented to visit. It was again very quiet (.....on a weekday in November).

- Travel advice: if you don't have your passport, they don't let you on your flight. source: personal experience. (fortunately, money fixes most problems, so I bought a ticket for a later flight - about 150 EUR).

- Tourist advice: I don't "drink coffee" but Amsterdam was amazing. Brussels has the best natural history museum, Berlin a close second. Paris's sucks, but that's mostly because it seems unchanged since like 1890, which is actually quite charming in its own way. Ghent, Belgium is really cool in general.

- look i don't know how to mention this or even if it's appropriate, but: a bunch of sexy things happened. I am thinking of doing a retrospective blog somewhere to chronicle them all, or maybe write them up in some tome and sell them to horny people on amazon. Does anyone know where something like this could be done? I am not above monetising this sort of thing.

- being back home in Australia is awesome even if I'm still mad jetlagged (it seems much worse in this direction). That said, I am going to be tearing up Paris like a lot.

- WEASEL WORK UPDATE: Evil boss is transferred to another area and being Evil there (YAYYYYYYYYYYY), I have new potentially evil boss (potentially because people don't seem too fond on him, but all the negatives they say about him are things I think myself, so: YES). I had a meeting with him on Thursday and he was basically listing all the changes he wants to make (tl;dr fixing everything Evil Boss fucked up). I wanted to hug him. I might actually keep doing project management and keep working for the government because being able to have 14 weeks off a year (10 unpaid, lol) if I ask very, very nicely > getting paid twice as much.
