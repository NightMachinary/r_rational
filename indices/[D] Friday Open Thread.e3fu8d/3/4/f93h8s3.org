Some ideas:

- Cases for electronics projects.
- Gifts.
- An air filtration system for 3d printer fumes.
- Cardholders and other game accessories.
- Clips and bases to hold anything that might move around (whiteboard markers, spare change, phone)
- Materials experiments.

These are only 3d printer ideas, because that's what I'm most familiar with. A laser engraver can be used to cut acrylic panes. A CNC might be useful for mitering, to make wood boxes look professional without a saw. Anything made of wood looks better and makes a better gift.

I tend to err in the direction of "Just get it, regrets are also a cost you bear." Keep in mind the law of equal and opposite advice--if you have a room full of junk you never use, hesitancy is warranted.

If you find you aren't using it that much you could donate it to a local maker's club--or better yet, go use their stuff and see whether what they have is good enough for you before you buy anything. I did that myself until the inconvenience of travel and dues became too much.
