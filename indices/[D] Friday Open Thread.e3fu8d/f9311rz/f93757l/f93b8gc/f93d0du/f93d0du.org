Sure, but I'll just go ahead and say I might be remembering wrong

Lights: The lights as a whole are mentioned sometime near the beginning of the story as "mysterious spirit world things." Red's name is in one of the emperor's journal entries, and is also one of the questions Arrodes asks. Yellow's name and general abilities were brought up by the magician's mentor (from the Abraham family). Orange has just shown up in 723. My guess is that he has some kind of merlin "ages backwards" thing going on, with access to future memories.

Tree: I honestly don't know. Maybe her projection into the manor as enough to notice the MC's grey fog power?
