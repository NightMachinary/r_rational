We had a few family friends over, and I'm glad they didn't bring any food because we made far too much. Maybe a third of the turkey was gone by the end of the night, we have about half of all the pie left, and for one of the sides we didn't even touch the second dish of it. My sister brought in a bucket of gumbo from some shop that probably could have fed all of us by itself. Also, Costco sides are great. We had the mashed potatoes, and there's very little reason to make them yourself if you can get the Costco ones.

Aside from the left over food, we also have a decent amount of materials that weren't even made into dishes. A couple pounds of sweet potatoes, enough filling for another pumpkin pie, and some boxes of cornbread that I'm glad I didn't make (which will admittedly stay good for longer than the other stuff).
