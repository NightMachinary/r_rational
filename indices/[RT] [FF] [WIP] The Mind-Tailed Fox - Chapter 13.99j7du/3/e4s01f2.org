This is really good. I read it all at once pretty much, and it drew me in. I really like the relationship between hinata, sasuke, and naruto. Inner Hinata is hilarious, and the overall focus of the story is great. I like that you're taking it slow with the timeline, because even as slow as it's going, it still feels too fast sometimes.

One question I do have: What prompted you to skip the actual altercation with mizuki?

I hope that you continue working on this (and maybe increase the pace of chapter releases a little, since it seems like this has been going two years with only 13 chapters?) and I'll be sure to keep reading.
