A couple of notes:

1. Naruto would be an absolute idiot to trust the demon fox's word on how the seal works.

2. Naruto at the start of the story is kind of an idiot. One of the things I wanted to do was show someone slowly acquiring rational skills over time, rather than starting out with them.

3. The events in the first chapter (specifically the demon fox preventing Naruto from being killed by Mizuki) weren't meant to be evidence that the demon fox is lying about how the seal works. If asked, the demon fox would say that Mizuki had already betrayed the leaf, and from his perspective Naruto was an enemy combatant.
