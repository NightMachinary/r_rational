I'm only on chapter 1 but the demon fox doesn't just let Mizuki kill Naruto (which would be one of the conditions of being freed) and Naruto doesn't /notice/, despite the fact that Kyu just /told/ him that "if you're assassinated in cold blood it will free me". And also Naruto doesn't seem nearly suspicious enough regarding the entity that as far as he knows almost destroyed his village. Oversight, or plot?
