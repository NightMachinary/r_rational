Thanks!

​

I'd like to write more chapters, but it's slow going because the story's style is a style I don't really write in naturally any more, so it takes a long time to produce a chapter in that voice.

​

Re Mizuki:

​

This was one of the first things I ever wrote (the first draft of the first chapters was written *way* more than 2 years ago, I just decided to actually publish it two years ago). I literally didn't know how to write when I started, so I just read through the manga and transcribed exactly what was happening panel for panel into words, then went back and edited it to have something slightly different happen. This was a useful crutch, since I didn't understand how story structure worked, but produced predictably awful writing.

​

The writing got a lot better in the later chapters once I'd had some practice (or at least I like to think it did). Two years ago I decided to publish it, but the first chapters were godawful, so I just threw them away and rewrote them. This was kind of boring, so I basically tried to move the story as fast as possible to the point where I felt the writing was publishable, which meant skipping everything possible. The fight with Mizuki didn't have any important exposition or character-building in it, so I just never rewrote it.
