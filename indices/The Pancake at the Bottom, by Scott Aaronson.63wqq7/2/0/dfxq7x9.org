In normal usage, there is no difference--both are used to describe a quantity that is greater than any finite quantity. The reason "transfinite" exists as a word is because [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor][Georg Cantor]] wanted to distinguish his "infinite" cardinals from something he called the "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Infinite][Absolute Infinite]]": a quantity so large, it exceeds the size of every other transfinite cardinal. Note that this is a philosophical concept, not a mathematical one; set theorists don't talk about "Absolute Infinity" as a mathematical object, and in fact there are several paradoxes that would be caused by the existence of such an object, implying that it is self-contradictory and hence /cannot/ exist. Despite this, however, the word "transfinite" stuck, and now it and "infinite" are used more or less interchangeably, at least in mathematical circles.

*EDIT:* I forgot to mention that the Absolute Infinite actually appears in-story as the titular pancake. This, then, is the reason you're not allowed to ask what's beneath the pancake: technically, it shouldn't even /exist/. (Why does it exist, then? Only Scott Aaronson knows for sure. Maybe it's because dreams don't always make sense--or maybe the old man was lying.)
