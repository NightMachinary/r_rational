I don't see why the paradoxes that arise from assuming that *On* is a set implies that *On* doesn't exist, just that it isn't a set.

*On*, I think, is to be considered with something at least almost like fear.

When asked if there is /Something/ at the bottom of it all, he is silent for a minute (not just for a second or so, but a minute) before responding. When asked why it isn't valid to ask what is below it, he responds "ominously". The dreamer's response is shock and horror.

In my mind, this seems connected to

"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom"
