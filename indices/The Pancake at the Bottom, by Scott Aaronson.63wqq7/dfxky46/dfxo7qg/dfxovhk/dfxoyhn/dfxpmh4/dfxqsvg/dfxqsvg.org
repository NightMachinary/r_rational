I have, at one point, dreamed that I was in a locked room, and that the key needed to unlock the door was located on the other side of the door. I imagine that's about as complicated as it gets for dreams, though, since your brain's higher functions aren't exactly, well, functioning while you're dreaming. I'd be very surprised to hear that anyone had ever dreamed about something as complicated as transfinite towers of dreams-within-dreams.
