If I understood set theory at the proper intuitive level, and dreamed in a narrative style (rather than, mostly, a series of meaningful snapshots), I would not be surprised if I dreamed the story related in the OP.

I think the key is that any concept synthesized in my dreams could be expressed to me in a single phrase, each part within a single level of inference for me.

(Only when I have to explain that "the empty can of Spam is a nanotechnological membrane air-breathing rocket and oracle AI." ...does it become obvious that it is a /complicated/ tin can.)

Three scene-spaces is also a reasonable number for me.
