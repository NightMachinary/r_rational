Aw yis, update!

Can somebody remind me what the nuclear pen was (that Ganesh uses for fly by drone aerial support maneuvers)?

It's been what, 15 hours in the dungeon for their rescue mission thus far? About a mile in dungeon (insofar as space can be measured) until they get back to semi-known territory that's represented on the Map?

Author is really doing well evoking the desperation this arc must be inducing. Hoping we see a Big Damn Heroes rescue moment from their buddies when things look the most dire.

Also, I ran into this SCP that reminded me a lot of this story (the inter dimensional Ikea dungeon):
