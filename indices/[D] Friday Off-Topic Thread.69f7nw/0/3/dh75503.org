- another problem with restricting free speech is that in a restricted environment people fail to develop resistance to propaganda. So any propaganda that manages to leak through (esp. unnoticed) will have more devastating effects on the community.

  - a government restricting free speech is a government confessing in three things, IMO: in its impotency in certain regards, in its laziness, and in its desire to abuse the above-mentioned vulnerability on its own.

- >If you let people speak freely, the powerful will shout down the powerless. --- this can at least partially be solved by designing a platform that makes shouting someone down harder. Reddit's hierarchial tree structure was an improvement over bulletin boards, but the next big thing has been failing to show itself for quite a while by now. Google wave \ Discord are a thing, but they'd fail to work as a large open forum solution.

- >the evil people will use their social power to paint nice people as evil --- or as trolls, which is why I think it shouldn't matter whether or not your opponent is actually trying to troll anyone. What should matter instead is whether their comment is worthy of attention and answering.

  - this doesn't solve the problem of spamming the same opinion to overwhelm the opponents, though (e.g. kremlin's troll army, trump's, etc)
