Not sure this was the intended reading, but the first thing that came to mind was online personalities rallying their base for one reason or another. Popularity is power, and if you're sufficiently popular you can send thousands of people to flood every channel of communication with smears, misrepresentations, and various darks arts of discourse. (A perfect outside observer /could/ look at the evidence and make their own determination, but outside observers are generally imperfect and subject to be swayed by the dark arts.)

Edit: Coincidentally, I happened to come across [[https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/obscenity-indecency-profanity-faq][this paper]] half an hour later on the Russian "Firehose of Falsehood" method of propoganda.
