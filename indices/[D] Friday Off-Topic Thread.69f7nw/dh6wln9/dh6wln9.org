Has anyone here given much thought to the minimum viable mass you need to launch for an Orbital Ring to be functional? I know Paul Birch used 180,000 tons in his [[http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-II.pdf][example]], but something that bugs me is that this was never subsequently questioned. If it turns out that 180 tons would have worked, all this time, that translates to nightmarish amounts of lost utility that we could have had with cheap access to space (not to mention mundane utility like a hypersonic freight connection to every continent). Heck, 180 tons is little enough that SpaceX could probably pull it off with a small bank loan.
