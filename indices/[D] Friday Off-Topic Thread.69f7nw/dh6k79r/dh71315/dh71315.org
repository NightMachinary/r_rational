  If you let people speak freely, the powerful will shout down the powerless.

Can you give an example of this? Because I'm having a hard time thinking of any examples that fit into this more than they do into the second one. If both people are speaking then can't any observers listen to whoever they want to? Unless you mean two people literally speaking at the same time and one of them is literally shouting too loudly.
