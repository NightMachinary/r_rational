It is easy to believe that something is ripe for munchkins when we have a simple view of it.

Now, idealism can be extremely positive when it inspires us to learn more, to explore, to investigate. This is deconstruction: seeing old ideas afresh, without their traditional contexts. More often than not, however, we discover that we are not the first to have followed these paths. Either previous explorers have mapped our objects all the way to their dead ends, or else we find well-fortified opposing camps defended for political or cultural reasons rather than rational ones.

Most rational fiction is deconstruction, either of someone else's fiction or an author's own fantasy idea, and most fictional worlds are simple enough that they can be completely understood with little effort. Better yet, they haven't been "lived in" long enough to have their rules optimized, or to have inspired deep political divisions.

They can be "broken" precisely because their problems and flaws are not like the problems and flaws of our real world. They're smaller, simpler, and younger. The idealists win because the paths they're walking are new frontiers.

Could we reconstruct rather than deconstruct? Could we endeavor to upgrade the realism and lived-in "maturity" of fantasy worlds? Absolutely, and some authors already have. In our world, thousands of generations of munchkins have optimized solutions for an overwhelming number of possibilities. We could absolutely write small-scale stories within similarly un-munchkinable worlds, where people struggle with problems at a more personal, less idealistic scale.

Keep in mind, however: Changing the magic in the world of (for example) Harry Potter so that it can't easily and superficially solve most of his problems, while still maintaining the feel and hitting the beats of the original story is /very challenging/.

Poking holes in a story so simple that it /cannot/ be understood complexly is always easier... whether you're deliberately fencing with a strawman, breathlessly embracing unprovable futurism, or writing fanfiction.
