  If there's a future where death isn't something people deal with, and that's a good thing, then what does that say about people like me who accepted death's existence or all the people who fell victim to death before it was defeated?

That they were tragic/wrong? I mean, there are plenty of cultures that believed and experienced things that we of today's world tend to think of as tragic and wrong, such as human sacrifice or slavery or the Divine Right of Kings. Why should our modern culture be any different to those in the future?

  When transhumanism is framed as improvements to humanity and our environment, including with changes in moral and philosophical consensus, then I'm completely supportive of it. When it's framed as a utopia where life is fundamentally different from how it's always been, then I don't approve of it even if I think it's possible.

This is a pretty natural feeling that a lot of people have, actually. It goes back to the lack of induction thing though. If you list all the things along the way to a transhumanist utopia, you'll probably agree with each one of them. And if you live through each of them, there will very likely not be a place where you stop and go "Woah, no, that's a step too far." Some things you may feel a bit uncomfortable with, maybe you'll wonder if there are some bad side effects, but children born in those days wouldn't: it would just be the way life works to them, the same way kids born today are used to having all of human knowledge in their pockets by the age of 10.

It's possible that so much change would be distinctly uncomfortable for people born in previous time periods, and if you transplant someone from our modern day to that idealistic future one, you'd almost certainly have many people who find a lot of it uncomfortable or even wrong. But if you at all find the tension between those two ideas irritating (being supportive of transhumanist goals but uncomfortable with a society that's fundamentally different from ours), that's the hurdle you should work to overcome in your mind.

If not, no big deal :) You'll still find plenty of fiction that falls on the more comfortable side.
