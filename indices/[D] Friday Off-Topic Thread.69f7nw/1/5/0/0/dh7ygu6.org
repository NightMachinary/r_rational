  I think death is something that should be fought, but cannot be truly conquered and must be accepted as an eventuality.

Well sure, an "eventuality." Meaning what, though? As far as we know the heat death of the universe is still going to be pretty much the end of any possibility of life as we know it. But I agree with [[/u/gbear605]], this:

#+begin_quote
  I don't like it that people die and want everyone to live longer and better, but I've accepted death as an inherent part of life and see attempts to outright destroy death instead of merely fighting against it as hubristic.
#+end_quote

Feels like a lack of induction. If we ban the words "destroy death" and talk about what is actually, realistically the goals and objectives of those who are anti-death, you seem to be in total agreement. End disease. End aging. Possibly upload the mind in the far future. In what ways, then, do you believe those trying to "conquer" death differ from you? Which line crossed makes it hubristic? Thousands of years of life? Millions? Billions?
