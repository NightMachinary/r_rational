  I've accepted death as an inherent part of life and see attempts to outright destroy death instead of merely fighting against it as hubristic.

I know this wasn't the point of the post, but if you'd be okay with it, I'd like to explore this more. When a anti-deathist says something like "I want to destroy death," I'm fairly certain that they mean something like "I want to stop all the things that cause death" rather than "I want to destroy the fundamental concept of death," since that's not how reality works. So when you say you want to fight against it, I just hear a lack of induction, since if you keep on fighting the causes until none of the causes are left, you've done what the anti-deathist was calling for in the first place.

I suppose the method of phrasing leaves a bit lacking in terms of publicity, but I don't see the real difference.

I suppose that the simplistic "I want to destroy death" throws away the possibility of euthanasia, but I feel like that's a very small side case when you consider only the people who would want to kill themselves when they're not in any physical pain and they're not mentally ill.
