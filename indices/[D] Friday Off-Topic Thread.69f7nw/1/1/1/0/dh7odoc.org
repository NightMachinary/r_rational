That's certainly a very major point too. I was never under the impression that what I was describing was the entirety of what makes rational fiction, and this is probably more central anyways.

I /do/ still think that rational fiction tends to put intelligence front-and-center, to a greater extent than willpower or other common virtues. The zeitgeist, as I've heard it described, serves as a catch-all for works that this community likes, including things like Worm (which despite not being written as rational fiction is sometimes regarded as such) and other works as crazy as UNSONG. To refine my idea further, I would say that [[/r/rational]]'s zeitgeist involves works where intelligence and related virtues are the primary metric by which conflicts are won or lost.

Whether this relates to rational fiction on a more fundamental level alongside the Level 1+ Intelligent Characters concept is something I'll have to do more thinking about.
