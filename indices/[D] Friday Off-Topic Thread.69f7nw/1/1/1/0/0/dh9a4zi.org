  I /do/ still think that rational fiction tends to put intelligence front-and-center, to a greater extent than willpower or other common virtues
#+end_quote

I agree, it /tends to/. I don't think it's its fundamental property, though: it's a direct consequence of using L1 intelligent characters. It makes interpersonal conflicts /realistic/, and in reality...

In reality, intelligence is the most powerful weapon --- and tool --- around. A fiction that doesn't aim to inspire one thing or another and warps the plot to do so, which instead realistically describes a conflict between parties, it would naturally end up with the most intelligent --- the most powerful --- party winning.

The rest is just authors choosing the particulars to tell a satisfying story, so that it expresses the virtue of intelligence, deconstructs non-rational works, or something else.

That said, I've just remembered another interesting opinion, expressed in [[/u/AmeteurOpinions][u/AmeteurOpinions]]' [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2txg42/metad_they_should_have_sent_a_poet/][They Should Have Sent A Poet]]. What do you think?
