I'm referring to the distinction between stories which are about rational characters optimizing their outcomes and rational authors optimizing their stories. Thus:

/rational/ fiction is rationalist-lite fiction, where the author tries to present intelligence to the reader in an emotionally satisfying story. They probably try to use tenets of the rationalists ethic but don't go so far as to cite them in the story like HPMOR did.

rational /fiction/ is the author finding the exact problem, theme, or concept of their story and exploiting its potential emotional/intellectual satisfaction.

This is how I would try to describe the distinction with a minimal word count. Hopefully it's not confusing.
