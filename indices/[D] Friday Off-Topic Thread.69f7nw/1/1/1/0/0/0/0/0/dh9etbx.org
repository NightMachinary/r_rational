/oh god they still remember/

The first draft stalled out because nuclear physics is complicated (who could have guessed? Not me, apparently) and in general I bit off more than I can chew.

However! I did find some better and more helpful sources to work with and started writing it again. My current plan is to pick up the Sunday slot after Unsong finishes. I was going to announce as much when I was ready to post, but I may as well do it now.

Back on topic, my opinion hasn't really changed. I still see far to much /RATIONAL fiction/ when what we need is /rational FICTION/.
