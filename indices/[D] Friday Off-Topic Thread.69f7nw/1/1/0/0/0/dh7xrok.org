This applies pretty well to Dr. Who too. Conflicts are often resolved through the Doctor or other characters being clever, but the cleverness is usually expressed through technobabble or just doesn't make sense. It's entertaining and I enjoy it for a number of reasons, but it's about the farthest thing in the world from rational fiction.
