I totally agree with you, so I feel really guilty for thinking /A Bluer Shade of White/ is an example of munchkinry I don't like. It's not a bad story, I enjoyed it overall and really liked your take on Elsa, it's just that Olaf becoming a Seed AI wasn't something I wanted to read about in a Frozen story.

I get what you were doing with the idea that Elsa had incredibly versatile powers with no known limit, but it still didn't feel satisfying to read. Then again, I felt basically the same way about /The Rules of Wishing/ so what do I know? Maybe it's just the difference in themes from the source material.

EDIT: Thinking back, I actually did like nearly all of the clever exploits characters came up with in both stories. It was the plot points that followed those exploits that I didn't enjoy very much. The way munchkins unexpectedly alter the story must be the problem I have rather than the munchkinry itself.
