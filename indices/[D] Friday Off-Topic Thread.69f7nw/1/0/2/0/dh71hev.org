In cases like that I usually go with a higher-dimension entity that is acting as an arbiter for enforcing that specific whimsical set of rules.

For instance: sometime in the past the population of the Earth has decided to wage wars non-violently, and ended up choosing the card game's simulation as the setting. Optionally, the participants also have their memories altered before entering the arena with a new personality.

Or: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfVillainThreat][A powerful entity]] decided to enforce a specific set of rules on a specific dimension (or a pocket dimension, metaverse--- whatever) for some reason or another (that's what their moral system dictates them to do, [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/reincarnator][they were bored,]] etc).

Both explanations work, but now you'll have to keep in mind the character of this “hidden” entity and negotiate any changes to the canon with it, trying to reach a consistent outcome. Then you'll likely also have to ripple through the whole timeline of the setting, retroactively changing all of its history to match the negotiated changes (since it's unlikely that your character(s) was the first in that universe to think about investigating \ using that specific loophole).

Problems with this: 1) You'll still have to work out an answer that would /logically/ make sense (resolution of paradoxes). 2) If you go deep enough, the modified setting becomes very different from the canon (even if it /is/ more consistent) and you lose part of your audience due to lack of empathy. 3) Simulating\projecting the meta-entity in your mind /and/ simulating the whole canon-setting in 4D (3S+1T) to find out what the outcome will be looking like is going to be dauntingly difficult --- at least if you don't cut some corners (which is another problem by itself).
