I mean, if you go far enough with this idea, you basically end up with the /actual/ explanation for what we observe in any fictional universe: someone out here in the real world decided to make it so. The problem with that explanation /in-universe/, of course, is that once you postulate a vastly more powerful intelligent entity capable of messing with you, pretty much every observation you make becomes suspect. It no longer becomes possible to deduce things from within the context of the fictional universe, because there's always the possibility that some capricious being might decide to overturn your prediction just for the heck of it.

I don't have a link, but there was actually a short story inspired by the 2-4-6 scene between Harry and Hermione in HPMoR (chapter 8, I believe) set in a different universe where the laws of physics /were/ determined by a capricious entity, which basically explores this exact idea. If anyone knows what I'm talking about and has a link, that'd be great.
