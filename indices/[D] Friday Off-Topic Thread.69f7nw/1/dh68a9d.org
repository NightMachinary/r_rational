This started out as one thing then turned into another, then another, but I decided to post it anyway because it feels like it's something I should be proud to say even if I'm not totally sure what it is or whether it means anything because it really does describe what I'm thinking right now.

I wonder if we need a better way to describe the mindset of a rationalist character than munchkinry. I've come to think that the defining characteristic of a munchkin character isn't creative use of mechanics or outsmarting opponents, but an explicit desire to break the game they're in and take control of the plot for themselves.

I've heard two schools of thought in RPGs about what to do about munchkins since they stop anyone else from having fun how they want to. One says that the GM needs to be smart enough to keep the munchkin under control and ensure the rules can't be exploited. The other says the munchkin shouldn't be allowed to play the game in the first place since they violate the social contract between players.

For a while I subscribed to the former, but now I think the latter makes more sense since the entire point of the game is to have fun within the shared rule set. Should the same idea be applied to rational fiction? Do rationalists always need to try and break the story they're in rather than just come up with smart plans and deductions?

I might have a different perspective on this than most rationalists since I'm technically still religious. I can see how those that aren't would view the GM of reality as someone who forced them into a game they didn't want to play and seek to knock the board over, but I'm kind of okay with the existence of death even if I don't see it as /good/.

I'm still in favor of transhumanism and reducing human suffering however we can, but I still instinctively flinch at the idea that death should be eliminated. I don't like it that people die and want everyone to live longer and better, but I've accepted death as an inherent part of life and see attempts to outright destroy death instead of merely fighting against it as hubristic.

The RPG analogy is getting away from me, but I guess I just don't like stories with munchkins very much. I don't really want to read stories about people trying to become God as if it's a completely sane and logical thing for anyone to do. It's not really something I relate to or feel satisfaction from seeing.

I still love HPMOR and other stories about intelligent characters with big ambitions, but they're not what I want to read these days. Recently, the stories that I liked most were about people achieving limited personal success in a conflict that effected their life more than others. Not all of them were mundane, but even when magic or superpowers were involved I liked when they didn't effect the world around the protagonist very much.

When I was a teenager the idea of munchkinry made me feel empowered to break out of the bad situations I was stuck in, but now that I'm about to graduate from college I just want to be happy in my little corner of the world. I still care about people and try to help when I can, but whereas I once rejected the idea of contentment I now aspire to it.

I once felt like I could do anything and needed that at the time, maybe I still need it, but these days it seems more like a pipe dream I grew out of. Rationality has become a rote part of my way of thinking and it's helped me immensely, but awareness of biases and inefficiencies hasn't necessarily made them easier to eliminate as of late.

It could be that I came down with depression over the past year and a half so I've made it my goal to simply survive rather than thrive, but I don't think that's where this is all coming from. I've been feeling really good lately and still feel good now. Things could be going better and part of me says I should be working harder and smarter, but it feels okay even if I don't.

I guess that's the reason I wanted to write all of this. I may be a Ravenclaw, but my recent melancholy makes me think I can learn from Hufflepuff. This is one of the few communities I identify as a member of, so I want to just be friends with you guys and read entertaining stories. I don't really care about the rational part that much anymore. I wonder if should even still be here.
