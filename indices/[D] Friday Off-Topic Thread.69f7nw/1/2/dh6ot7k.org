  I've heard two schools of thought in RPGs about what to do about munchkins since they stop anyone else from having fun how they want to. One says that the GM needs to be smart enough to keep the munchkin under control and ensure the rules can't be exploited. The other says the munchkin shouldn't be allowed to play the game in the first place since they violate the social contract between players.

I'm of the third school of thought: if the players can do it, so can the NPCs. Or rather, from a literature standpoint, I think it's the right of the MC to exploit mechanics in however broken a manner as they can, but at the same time, the enemies can copy whatever the MC does. So while there still is an incentive for players to break the game's system and create overpowered exploits, they need to be wise about using those exploits unless they want every two-bit mook copying them. After all, there are only <6 players, and a potentially infinite amount of NPCs.
