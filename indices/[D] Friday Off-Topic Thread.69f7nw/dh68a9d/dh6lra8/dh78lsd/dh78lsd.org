Interesting, but I disagree.

I think the main part of rational fiction is employing [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level One Intelligent characters]]; that is, every relevant character makes a honest effort towards achieving their goals, instead of being a plot device.

- It's not about consistency: the world could be inconsistent to the point of ridicule, but as long as the characters recognize and take into account (and possibly exploit) the inconsistency, it's fine.

- It's not about moral conflicts: the characters could be Evil because they want to be Evil, but as long as they have valid reasons for having that goal (even if the reason is, a Random Omnipotent Being made it that way), and use valid methods to achieve it, it's fine.

- It's not about intelligence: the characters could be stupid and win through power instead of intelligence, but as long as they still /pursue/ their goals in a reasonalbe manner, and win /without/ reality warping to help them, it's fine.

- That means Deus/Diabolus Ex Machinas are prohibited, unless their appearances could be predicted and exploited by the characters. (The hero doesn't get a convenient power-up because the villain is about to defeat him, but the hero /could/ base his plan on getting a power-up at the most desperate moment if he has reasonable evidence that he would get it.)

- Worldbuilding could be whatever, but the author must choose: either they model every background human in the history of the world as honestly pursuing their goals (and so having wizards take over the human world thousands of years ago), or they imagine an inconsistent world and have the characters notice the inconsistency (are the wizards idiots, or something powerful stops them?, they should be asking).

*The main point is*, rational fiction is about /characters/ and conflicts between characters, not about showing one virtue or another, inspiring one emotion or another. It's closer to a quest or a roleplaying campaign indeed, than normal fiction.

The other way of looking at it is, it's a different approach to writing fiction: a normal author sits and writes a satisfying story; a rational fiction author figures out which characters in which situations would weave a satisfying story, /then/ writes it, and can't use divine interventions or contrived coincidences to nudge the plot the desired way.

Rationality won't necessarily make a story satisfying: 'a Random Omnipotent Being manipulated everything to be so' would turn /any/ story into a rational one, but it won't be satisfying in the least. On the other hand, 'a Random Omnipotent Being made Voldemort smarter, then watched', could make quite an interesting story.

The trick to writing rational fiction is striking a balance between how you want the world to look like, how much of the world and plot premise you want to rationalize, ensuring Suspension of Disbelief, and telling a satisfying story.
