That's similar to what I thought you meant, but not quite the same.

I thought /rational/ fiction used the story as a vehicle to showcase how rational the characters are, while rational /fiction/ just happened to feature characters who react rationally within the story.

I'm not sure how I'd classify HPMOR. Possibly "rationalist /fiction/"?
