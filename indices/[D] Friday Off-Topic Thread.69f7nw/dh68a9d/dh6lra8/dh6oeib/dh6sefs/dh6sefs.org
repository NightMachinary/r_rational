That's a good point. Jimmy Neutron isn't rational fiction, but places a high emphasis on intelligence and plans for winning. So, what separates the likes of Jimmy Neutron from the likes of The Metropolitan Man or HPMOR? I'm just sounding things out right now, trying to see what makes sense.

A possible option is that, while Jimmy Neutron ostensibly values intelligence, the intelligence is to rational behaviour as technobabble is to actual technological behaviour. For this to be true, I would want to find that Jimmy Neutron's displays of intelligence and planning only superficially exemplify the virtue of intelligence, and more honestly exemplify the virtue of willpower.

Looking at my vague memories of the show, the most I can remember is that episodes tend to involve some goofy problem spiraling out of control, until Jimmy focuses really hard and comes up with a big plan to save the day, his 'brain blasts'. This reminds me of what you often see in certain fights in action shows, mostly against gimmicky enemy-of-the-week characters but frequently against more important foes as well. The enemy appears unbeatable, outclassing the hero and clearly winning, but then the hero notices a critical weakness and immediately develops a plan to exploit that one weakness.

For instance, suppose the enemy is in a giant mech with invincible armour and is steamrolling the heroes, but then the hero notices that the mech's giant beam attack leaves the mouth vulnerable, and formulates a plan to strike then. That would not be out of place in many shonen anime, and in fact I think I've actually seen it a few times. I wouldn't say that this makes the show rational, however, far from it. My original statement is satisfied in that the battle is won and lost based on the awareness and plan-building of the hero, but I would argue, in this case, that spotting the weak point is the 'second wind' of the standard Willpower-based fight, and the hero's intelligence is being used as a /method/ to emphasize the core willpower virtue by which the fight was survived and eventually won. I'm not 100% confident on that, but it feels right.

So if we say that Jimmy Neutron's Brain Blasts is, for all intents and purposes, identical to noticing that the mouth is vulnerable when preparing the giant beam attack, then even though Jimmy Neutron is a show about a genius who solves his problems by being super smart at them and making good plans and such, it's structured in such a way that Jimmy Neutron's fights are won by his willpower and conviction, with his intelligence as merely a tool to facilitate success, for as much as intelligence is given the 'spotlight'.

Or, you know, I could be totally wrong and just building up a tower of justifications. I'll have to think on it some more.
