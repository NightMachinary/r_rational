A while ago I was trying to piece together a more concrete definition of what makes rational fiction, since the sidebar and most other definitions are a combination of general good writing tips (such as 'nothing happens because the plot requires it') and descriptions of what tends to /happen/ in rational fiction (like 'the antagonist shouldn't be evil, they should have valid arguments of their own'), rather than what makes it rational. You can tell writers of /any/ genre that having things happen /just/ because the plot demands it should be avoided at all costs, and I can easily envision a rational fiction in which the protagonists are in a world of pantheistic gods and the God of Evil is the main antagonist.

I haven't pieced it together fully, but I think I figured out a part of what makes a rational fic. One of the core virtues, the ones fights are resolved by and which carry the hero to victory, is intelligence. Think of your Generic Action Show, where at the climax the protagonist is fighting the final boss, and gets overwhelmed. But the hero hangs on! Through his Determination and conviction in What He Believes In the hero gets a second wind and reaches victory. That's obviously an idealized scenario, and it's not like all rational fiction /fails/ to express this virtue (similarly, it's not like Generic Action Shows fail to express the virtue of intelligence), but the core virtue in rational fiction, above all or at least most others, is intelligence, cleverness, or some associated trait.

Again, I don't think that's the whole picture. But it explains things like why the well-known rational fics tend to have anti-climaxes more than usual, because the final showdown doesn't have to drag on long enough for the hero to show the Strength Of His Beliefs. Instead, the core virtue of intelligence can be shown off in how the hero weaved a trap for the enemy along the entire story, or how the hero's plans were versatile enough to handle whatever the villain threw at him, or how despite being utterly blindsided the hero can analyze the situation and come up with a workable plan, and none of those explicitly require the final fight against the villain to last a long time, or for the hero to be put in dire straights and forced to reach deep within themselves for the strength to go on.
