I haven't made the misinterpretation you suggest. I know that people are referring to sources of death rather than the concept. I'm fine with curing disease and increasing lifespans, I don't even have serious objections to transhumanist methods of immortality. I can't be considered a true deathist since I believe in an afterlife, but I don't consider death a goal to aspire to in any way. I think death is something that should be fought, but cannot be truly conquered and must be accepted as an eventuality.
