I don't have a line because my feelings on the matter aren't logical, they're instinctive. It might just be the way the idea is framed, such as in HPMOR when Harry envisions a future where children aren't told about death until they're older and able to handle the sadness that so many people died before them.

To be clear, I found Harry's indomitable crusade against death fascinating and it introduced me to ideas I'd never considered before. It's just something about the vision EY has laid out in his writings that I automatically dislike. It's not that I think he's wrong to want a world like that, it's that I don't want it for some reason.

Perhaps it's the way that future would change the context of my view on the past and present. If there's a future where death isn't something people deal with, and that's a good thing, then what does that say about people like me who accepted death's existence or all the people who fell victim to death before it was defeated?

When transhumanism is framed as improvements to humanity and our environment, including with changes in moral and philosophical consensus, then I'm completely supportive of it. When it's framed as a utopia where life is fundamentally different from how it's always been, then I don't approve of it even if I think it's possible.
