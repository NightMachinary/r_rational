There's also the muchkinry as a result of merely exploring the setting too deeply. Often you'll either have to partially zombify your character, for them to ignore a glaring opportunity or inconsistency in front of them, or to proceed with the exploration that will likely result in poking at the inconsistency or loophole even more and lampshading it to others.

I feel like the first one is straining the SoD while the second one puts too much work and expectations on the setting's DM (an RPG tabletop's DM, a group-story's creator, you yourself, etc).

One compromise solution to this is to keep the meta-discussion open with the DM and clarify beforehand digging how deep (and in what directions) is expected to be ok.

Another thing likely to help is discussing beforehand what type of experiences are all the other players hoping to get from that particular game. I.e. if the majority of the party is just looking to be lazing about in taverns, singing on a lute and whatnot, the one or two players who are trying to concentrate on deep exploration of the setting and loophole abuse will likely be perceived as game-spoilers by others.
