  if you go far enough with this idea, you basically end up with the actual explanation for what we observe in any fictional universe: someone out here in the real world decided to make it so.

The difference between a person IRL and a meta-entity in-universe is that the meta-entity is “supposed” to have much higher computational capabilities and intelligence than a real-world human (hence the need for corner-cutting and “under-the-hood” world-building that is not being directly presented to the audience).

I remember in one of the previous threads there was some question about characters realising in-universe that they were, in fact, characters; and someone else asked what was the point of such a question since the character obviously wouldn't have a real intelligence and thus wouldn't be able to realise anything like that at all. Using that as an analogy, the above-mentioned meta-entity would've been able to simulate a character (and its environment) perfectly enough for the character to be able to realise, in a linear stable timeline and in a consistent manner, that it is a character --- while a real-world human can't properly do all that because of the limitations of their mind. Even though, strangely enough, the human /can/ still imagine both the meta-entity and the character simulated by the meta-entity --- albeit imperfectly, just as a thought experiment of the hypothetical thing itself.

It's not a panacea, of course. What you're saying can become a valid criticism (and often does) if the entity in question is made to interfere too much, or on too small scales, etc. This happens, for instance, in many badly-written LitRPG stories and can be reduced to being a mere case of a Deus Ex Machina or May Sue trope. When done well, however, the entity can be designed to be impartial --- to the point of “losing its agency” and just becoming part of the world-building.

Consider also that the stage during which this entity is still making changes to the setting (so to speak) is when the real-world writer is still only designing the story's outline and re-defining the canon's whole history. By the point a satisfactory outcome has been reached, the final versions of the characters will be acting in a world where all the questions they will be asking have already been accounted for and answered.

1) This doesn't have to be true in case of /all/ settings that feature such an entity. 2) Even in cases where one or both of these phenomena are true, the story can still be made to work --- at least if the entity is not allowed to mess with the characters' minds too much. One example is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3z306m/your_last_first_day_scp_foundation_story_by_sam/cyivhcy/][the anti-memetics series,]] and many SCP entries in general (though these are proof-of-concept examples and don't feature entities like the one we're talking about). There'e was another one that I don't remember the title of (but it's been discussed here before) --- it was a magical setting in which the magic itself actively resisted being researched, so it returned intentionally nonsensical results for any experimenters.
