one of the things I find difficult is knowing how deeply I have to justify the rules of the fictional world. So like, here's some things that happen. Why? Because these things happen. Why do those things happen? With fictional worlds it sometimes feels like there has to be some inconsistency in the rules otherwise you can't /really/ justify them. Like, the reader is on the explain/worship/ignore decision tree/web and they get locked out of the explain option much too soon while they still have questions. And when they try to give what would normally be the obvious answers to those questions the entire fictional world falls apart.

Maybe part of the reason for that is that I just don't know enough about the rules of the universe we actually live in, but somehow I just get the impression that if I try to put some weird fantasy element into a story I won't be able to write it in a way that doesn't seriously break the suspension of disbelief of every intelligent physicist who might stumble across it. I mean, the first setting I seriously tried to work with in rational fiction was yugioh or something like it, and no matter what I did I could not get the yugioh universe to work in a way that made any sense at all. Some people said that rational fic doesn't require the setting to be self-consistent, just predictable in its behavior, except that a smart protagonist would still want to know why and the universe would yield no actual answers, just a jumbled mess. And only in regards to a particular aspect of reality, which happens to be a trading card game. And I cannot for the life of me figure out how to answer the question of why a magic-ritual game that simulates actual combat between summoners have such a special place in the laws of reality, nor why the universe won't answer that question no matter what experiments you try. There has to be an answer and there is no answer that I can think of and that seems like it would be REALLY relevant to the plot of a rational yugioh fic and a rational yugioh protagonist would WANT TO KNOW THAT.

Maybe I should have gone with a different setting than yugioh for my first rat!fic?
