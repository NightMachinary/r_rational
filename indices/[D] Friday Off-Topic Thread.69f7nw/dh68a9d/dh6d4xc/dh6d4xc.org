There are different levels of munchkinry in tabletop games which I think should be treated differently. There's *Rules-As-Written munchkinry* that makes no sense within the context of the simulation, like trying to hide behind a tower shield and claiming that the tower shield is hidden as well because on page whatever of the Player's Handbook blah blah blah. That's stupid, it makes no sense, and doesn't actually work within the world ... yet some people will insist on it, even in the face of the DM flatly saying no, and those people can get the fuck out.

Then there's *Rules-As-Intended muchkinry*, where you aren't actually breaking the simulation by descending into rulebook legalese, but /are/ ending up with ridiculous stuff like throwing boulders made of titanium for 14425d6 damage, probably through some combination of things that were never balanced against each other (because the two or three relevant books were written several years apart). This is slightly less annoying, but depending on how good the combination or exploit is it might be the case that the GM /can't/ fix it short of just saying "you can't do that" which (in my experience) can create an unhealthy metagame of munchkins seeing what they can get away with. It comes from a better place though - not wanting to break the system, necessarily, but wanting to have a good, competently built character. The only problem is that if one player is taking it to extremes, the others probably should be too, and there are some extremes which are allowed by certain combinations of rules but which make the game unplayable.

(I feel the same way about videogame speedruns, actually. Speedruns that abuse glitching through walls and skipping cutscenes by exiting to the main menu just don't do anything for me, because they aren't seeking the thing I actually watch speedruns for, which is mastery of the game. It might just be a difference in what I define as "the game".)

As it relates to prose fiction, I think that munchkinry stories which completely contradict the world created by the original work/system don't tend to hold that much interest to me, mostly because they break the shared suspension of disbelief that I come to prose for in the first place. It's worse when no one else within the world is aware of these things that can be munchkined, since that break SOD even more. And of course it's a real challenge to include munchkinry while also keeping character in focus, and most authors aren't up to the task. Typically it just reads as a character set up for perfect success and an author trying to show how smart he is.

For rational fanfiction, I think there's a justification/exploitation axis. If you read a work of fiction and there's something that doesn't make that much sense, do you assume it's a crack to work your fingers in, or do you think about how to fix that crack? I think of myself as falling more on the justification side of things, which is why I tend to like reading those more. I still /like/ clever exploits, but they have to take place within the framework of the world and make sense as novel creations, rather than hinging on something the original creator/author forgot or glossed over, if that makes sense. Part of that is definitely a desire to be enraptured in the world rather than thrust outside it.
