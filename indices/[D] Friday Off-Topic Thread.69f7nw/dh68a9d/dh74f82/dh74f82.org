  I wonder if we need a better way to describe the mindset of a rationalist character than munchkinry.
#+end_quote

As far as I can tell, that isn't the case. Rational, munchkinging, and deconstruction stories often overlap with each other but they are not one and the same. That being said, there are also certain types of scenarios in stories in which the characters /have/ to start deeply exploring \ deconstructing the setting in order for the story to remain “rationality-validated”, so to speak.

Consider the setting of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline][SAO,]] for instance. If the character's goal in it is just to survive and enjoy their daily life, then the story can be rational [[http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Nishida][even if all they do is catch fish]] and learn how to cook it for others. If the character has to return to the real world as soon as possible, however, they will have much more restrictions and requirements placed upon them for the story to maintain its rational! status.

  Recently, the stories that I liked most were about people achieving limited personal success in a conflict that effected their life more than others. Not all of them were mundane, but even when magic or superpowers were involved I liked when they didn't effect the world around the protagonist very much.
#+end_quote

That's a very good point though. Even though there /should/ be many stories out there that are technically validly rational /without/ also having that need-to-become-stronger motive to them, I haven't seen that many such stories either discussed here or listed on any of the relevant rat!story lists.

  It could be that I came down with depression over the past year and a half so I've made it my goal to simply survive rather than thrive [..] I've been feeling really good lately and still feel good now.
#+end_quote

I'm glad it's worked out for you. Is it ok to ask how you managed to achieve this turnaround?

  since they violate the social contract between players
#+end_quote

If the contract is an unspoken one, then it is likely that each player has their own expectations regarding what that social contract looks like.

#+begin_quote
  since the entire point of the game is to have fun within the shared rule set
#+end_quote

What if deconstruction and deep exploration of the setting /are/ what's fun for those particular players?

#+begin_quote
  since they stop anyone else from having fun
#+end_quote

If this is the case and they can not adapt, then that particular game is not for them, sure. But I think it may be possible to have a whole group of such players who'd enjoy their thing without spoiling anything for anybody. Or even to work with the DM and other players to make their interest contribute to the gameplay instead of spoiling it.

  I can see how those that aren't [religious] would view the GM of reality as someone who forced them into a game they didn't want to play [..] but I'm kind of okay with the existence of death even if I don't see it as good.
#+end_quote

Death's not the only negative aspect of this “game” that can be criticised, but that's not significant here.

#+begin_quote
  I can see how those that aren't [religious] would view the GM of reality as someone who forced them into a game they didn't want to play and seek to knock the board over
#+end_quote

Those that aren't religious would likely have no “GM of reality” in their worldview at all. Or if they had, it would be something closer from the Cosmicism philosophy --- not only something that doesn't care whether or not we manage to “knock the board over”, but also one that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth%27s_Location_in_the_Universe.jpg][created a board so big that any changes we made to it would fall tens of orders of magnitude short from being noticed.]]
