In fairness, the only Dresden fanfic that I've come across that manages to capture Butcher's "ever-escalating shitstorm" style of narrative construction was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8005922/1/God-s-Eye][God's Eye]]. It requires a deft hand to keep the ramp-up going without either losing tension or becoming self-parody.
