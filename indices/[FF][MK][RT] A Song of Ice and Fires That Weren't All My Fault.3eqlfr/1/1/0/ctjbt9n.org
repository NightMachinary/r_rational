My major concern with it is that it doesn't feel as though there is any conflict. There might be some more later, but one of the defining characteristics of the Dresden series has always seemed to be continually cascading challenges. Here, it seems to be more a series of continuing lack of challenges, and when he encounters any, a simple application of the easiest magic he knows makes it go away completely.
