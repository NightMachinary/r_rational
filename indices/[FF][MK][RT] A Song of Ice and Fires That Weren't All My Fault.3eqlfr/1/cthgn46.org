This was linked in a comment in the Rational!ASOIAF thread a few days ago by [[/u/FuguofAnotherWorld][u/FuguofAnotherWorld]], but I thought it deserved greater exposure. It's ASOIAF/Dresdenverse crossover (Harry Dresden + his daughter in the ASOIAF universe), but I've never read a Dresden book and was perfectly fine (though I googled a few things as needed).

Besides the setting/munchkinism/tone, one of the things that I really like about this fic is its ability to cover long stretches of time all at once (not via montages, more like changes in scope). These types of serials can easily fall into the trap of covering everything with the same time resolution and thus either having really boring episodes or implausibly making important events happen in quick succession, but the author here is good at avoiding both of these.
