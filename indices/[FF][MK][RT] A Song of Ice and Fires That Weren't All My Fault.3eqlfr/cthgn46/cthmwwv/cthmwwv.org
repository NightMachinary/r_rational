I (obviously) support this recommendation. It's a fun read with daily updates, a consistent world where actions have consequences, a magic system that has specific limitations and a decent hack at bringing the braavosi into the industrial revolution. Each of the actors also seems to be capable of at least level 1 thought and planning, which is nice.

What I particularly like is that building a particular technology leads to far ranging effects as people explore its uses, completely changing many historical events from the series. This makes the world feel fleshed out and real. Also, the writing has a fun witty tone which I enjoy.
