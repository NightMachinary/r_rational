Honestly I mostly appreciate that someone's paying attention :)!

Yeah, I've heard that people like regular updates most of all, so this is my attempt at seeing how that goes. The only natural place to split the chapters is in between scene breaks, and those often work out to be really short or really long.

If people would prefer it, I might go back to the old release schedule (1x ~7k word chapter every ~6 weeks). Since that works out to the same amount of writing output for us.

Here's this chapter's section lengths:

4.1 500 words

4.2 3,300 words

4.3 800 words (this one)

4.4 1,500 words

4.5 1,800 words

Interlude 200 words

Couldn't cut 4.2, but I could maybe have combined this week's with next week's and gotten two ~2,000 word chapters: or bundled 4.1&4.2 and then 4.3-4.5 for two ~4,000 word chapters.

We've got a chapter coming up (I think chapter 6?) that is full of little 500 word sections, which I was tossing up between posting every 2 or 3 days versus combining them into weekly ~1,000 word drops.

Anyway, I think I've talked quite enough about all that. Does anyone else want to weigh in whether they'd prefer a predictable, weekly drop that might be very short, or a nice chunk of 7,000 words every month or two?
