Another short section, expanding a bit more on who Red is as a person.

It also hints a bit about vampire "powers" here: I wanted being a janissary (vampire-feeder) to be 'useful', so taking a page from the rationalsphere/LW/SSC type area, I decided: what if feeding a vampire did everything that nootropics promise in their marketing literature? I thought it was a lot more "realistic" than the "mere" quasi-sexual thrill that feeding vampires gives you in a lot of romantic vampire mythology (though yeah, you still get that here).

So here, (microscopic spoiler for next week), Red doesn't need to sleep (modafinil) and is able to concentrate on the boring novel (ritalin) enough to finish it overnight.

Apart from that, it's mostly more character development for Red, though I think we already knew he was an empathetic sort of guy, and beginning to wonder whether this whole vampire thing is a good idea. I think the stuff about Janet shows up for the first time in this chapter, though.
