Yeah, I think I'm finding these short chapters more motivating because they give me a constant feeling of making progress by pushing chapters. If I was releasing full chapters at this rate it'd be one chapter every 6 weeks, and it would be easy to push that out to 7 weeks for example.

Next chapter I'll go back to the old way and see what I like better.

I think in terms of the social media dopamine rush, so far I prefer the old style as I haven't gotten comments on any of the three "sections" of this chapter.

That said, I've noticed that even though I haven't been adding anything to the sections of this chapter, I've been spending more time on writing other parts of the story with this. Maybe any level of consistency will help with this motivation, though?
