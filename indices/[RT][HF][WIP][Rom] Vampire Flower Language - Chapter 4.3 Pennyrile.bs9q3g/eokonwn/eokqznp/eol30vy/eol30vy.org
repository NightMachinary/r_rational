Short chapters are considered a "cheap trick" that authors use alongside dummy cliffhangers to artificially keep the pacing of a story tight and to keep the reader turning pages. If the chapter is short and vaguely unsatisfying the reader is more likely to read another one. The desire to read another chapter is then taken for interest/engagement, which ends up informing the person's opinion on the novel(especially people who rarely read and normally have difficulty finishing a novel). That's why "page turner" is used so liberally on cover blurbs.

I think the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule][peak-end rule]] describes why this works. Writers are unwittingly exploiting a cognitive bias(probably doing it on purpose with those young adult books nowadays, though).

(not accusing you of this, obviously)

Anyway, I think short chapters are inherently unsatisfying, especially in webserials, and especially(x2) if you don't use those annoying cliffhangers. There are many writers who make a living with short chapters released daily(or multiple times a day, in the case of xianxia/wuxia writers in china), but I don't know of any that do it on a weekly or inconsistent basis. In your case if people are unsatisfied but don't have more to read until next week(or longer) I imagine the experience will not feel positive. I could be wrong, though, I don't know.

My advice is regardless of all that, though. I think if I were in your shoes I would worry less about satisfying/attracting readers and more about maintaining your own engagement so you can keep writing. That's pretty much the only advice that's universally given by professionals to aspiring authors("WRITE CONSISTENTLY!"), so it must be true, right?
