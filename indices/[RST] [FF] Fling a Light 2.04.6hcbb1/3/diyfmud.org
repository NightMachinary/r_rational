yay! It's back. I don't normally approve of rational actors fighting out of their league, But consider it was done with math and heroic mindset and an action stance (!!!!!), asdasdsa It's good!

Speaking of heroics, I hope we will see more of this type of behavior in the future. It is disappointing in all the Superhuman fics and or fanfics that don't have heroic/hotblood leads or even support characters.
