The story is very, very good, as is the sequel. I have only on suggestion for improvement. In France, René is a male name. Renée is is the female name, although René can be used as a girl's name in places like the US.

Calling her René caused me to imagine her as a male until near the end of the story when she (in my mind a "he") seemed to be attracted by a male (odd but possible) and she was finally referred to as "her" on page 6 (obviously this only happened because I clicked the link that described you as winner instead of reading your comment in which you describe her as a female).

I'd suggest changing her name to Renée so that readers won't picture her as a male for 2/3 of the story :)
