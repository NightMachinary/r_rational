Osk was being both metaphorical and literal. I don't remember when I first came up with the idea of his name being significant, but it was while I was writing the first book. It's been an active potential plot direction (I don't do detailed plots in advance) since Call.

I've been wondering if anyone who knew a little German was going to speculate about it for a while 8-)

Edit: Flicker's momentum transfer is primarily for balance--it's very diffuse for everything else and she only has crude control. When she pushes too hard, she has no more control over where the ground goes than someone running in mud does over where the mud goes 8-)
