1: I'm assuming Buffalo would refer to the Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Area

2: The defined region would be Buffalo at the time the powers were given, not Buffalo as it is at the time.

3: Arbitrary restrictions: Only the troposphere above Buffalo would count as Buffalo, not the stratosphere and above. The powers would not extend below the crust of the earth.
