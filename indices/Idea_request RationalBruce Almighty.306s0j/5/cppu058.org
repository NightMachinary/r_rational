[[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Fun_theory][Fun theory]] seems relevant. Utopia is easier said than done, even for an omnipotent god.

He'd need to expand control outside Buffalo. A utopia that tiny hardly matters at all. He could easily send jets full of supplies to the rest of the world, but there's a lot of stuff that needs to be done outside Buffalo.

Once you get to interplanetary stuff, omnipotence on an Earth city won't count for much. It will give him an edge for material science research. He could start a lab to research cheaper and more effective solar panels, to start work on a Dyson sphere. He could produce large amounts of them from just that city, but eventually he'll need to use what he has to start mining all the planets to build more. Then he'll need to work on starships to build Dyson spheres around other stars.
