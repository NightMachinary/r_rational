Google says Buffalo is 136 km^{2.} Let's say that each person needs 1000 square feet of space to not feel crowded (ignore things like roads, hallways, and infrastructure. This utopia has teleportation and other magic.). That's 10k people per square kilometer, or 1.4 million people in 136 km^{2..}

Next, make the living spaces 10 feet high and stack them one on top of the other. Let's say that you get 1000 layers before you leave "Buffalo" at 10 000 feet up. That gives you enough space for about 1.4 billion people or ~20% of the world's population without needing to do anything too strange with the powers.
