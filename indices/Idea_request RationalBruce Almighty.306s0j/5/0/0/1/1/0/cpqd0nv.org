Assuming he specifies it, yes. But assuming he's giving out holy objects / magic wands that enable the bearer to do this to any room, he has to think of the precise functioning in advance. Otherwise he's letting the power do whatever it wants with the situation, which is a Bad Thing.

Moreover, let's bear in mind that a solar system sized volume of air has substantial mass -- more than our sun, for example. Packing that within a small room could result in some rather extraordinary gravitational effects.

Density of air at sea level = 1.225 kg/m^{3}\\
Mass of the sun = 1.989E30 kg\\
Volume of one cubic AU (radius of the earth's orbit) = 3.347929E33 m^{3}

For rough back of envelope purposes, we're talking 4000x the mass of the sun per cubic AU. If we were to look at something the size of the orbit of Pluto, it would be many of orders of magnitude greater.
