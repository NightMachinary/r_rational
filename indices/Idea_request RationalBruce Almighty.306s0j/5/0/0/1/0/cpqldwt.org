If he's allowed to alter geometry like that, then he can cheat a lot more. He can completely fill any volume with air, and ignore any gravitational effects this would have.

He could remove a point from Buffalo and warp the universe around it to grow it to infinite size, resulting in a wormhole to another universe that technically is inside of Buffalo. But it gets better. He doesn't have to stick to Euclidean geometry, and he can make the second universe have hyperbolic geometry instead. Locally, it behaves similar to Euclidean geometry, so small objects would work fine. However, on a large scale, the volume of a ball increases exponentially with the radius. If he gives everyone an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_triangle][ideal triangle]] to live on, he could fit everyone in the world within 31 triangles of the center.

I'd rule that that's too overpowered, and he can't increase the volume of Buffalo.
