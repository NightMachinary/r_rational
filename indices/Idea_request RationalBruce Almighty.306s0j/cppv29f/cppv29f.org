Here's the copout answer: Create Friendly AI

Some less cheap ones:

- Use omnipotence to find saintly people. Give them omnipotence that isn't limited to Buffalo
- Create safe, un-abusable general-constructor nanotech
- Build a beanstalk to geosynch
- Create the blueprints and all required scientific documentation for arbitrarily advanced technology, plus all the tech that would be necessary to achieve it. It would take a long time for people to master all of it and make use of it, but it shouldn't be more than a generation or three. By the end of that time humanity would effectively be gods through the power of science.
- Create full documentation on psychological / scientific methods of modifying the brain, but only to turn it into a brilliant, sane person. Make available.
