I think we can assume that God limits him to Buffalo hard. Let's pretend the meteor and pull-the-moon scene were faked by God (parallel universe?). No science-breakthrough-spread-to-the-world either. No "affect free will", but body modification works. Cannot reveal your power (although that was not a hard rule in the movie).

Bruce is quite selfish. The movie is his journey to a more altruistic person. Probably not going to happen with rational!Bruce.

Goals:

- have a relationship with Grace
- be successful at work / revenge on Evan
- (later) be not be bothered by prayers
