How is Buffalo defined? Legally? Would it be possible to expand it to encompass the entire state of New York, by convincing the right authorities to pass the right laws? How about including say an island on the other side of the world?

Also, is this a three dimensional relationship? Can he carve a Buffalo shaped wedge to the center of the earth? How about creating a Buffalo shaped tower of infinite (or just very large) height?
