Everyone here is forgetting that God can fold space, and /does/, inside that white building.

But ... my main concern would be less "the affecting of all things possible", and more worried about whether this "God" guy I'm talking to is effectively a Friendly AI. Why exactly do I have these powers? Is God omniscient? Has he planned this all out in advance? What are his goals, and what will he allow me to do?
