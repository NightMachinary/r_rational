All the responses I've seen seem to be approaching this from the premise of "assume Perfectly Rational Being also becomes Omnipotent and Omnicient" and, even with the given constraints, that just sounds like a recipe for a rational circle-jerk, not an interesting or meaningful story.

For this premise to work, I think, you have to start with a flawed rationalist who, over the course of experimenting with his powers, discovers the flaws in himself. One possibility that jumps to mind, there is a, ah... /slight/ tendency for /certain/ rationalists to be a bit ... condescending, to anyone they perceive as less rational than themselves. So the character might start out focused entirely on trying to find ways to apply their omnipotence without violating free will, and largely overlook the full applications of omniscience as applied to people, namely, fully understanding others, what they want and why they want it, the full story of who they are and how they think and feel, both as subjective personal experience and objective truth.

Of course, there is also the little fact that this presumably-initially-atheist rationalist is confronted with a literal God, and presumably immortal souls and some sort of afterlife to go with it. It might well take him time to fully absorb this new information into his world view, and change his perception of life on earth which, in such a scenario, would in fact be a brief juvenile stage of life for an immortal being.

eh, bottom line, I can imagine good stories coming out of this premise, but I can imagine a lot more terrible and pointless ones.
