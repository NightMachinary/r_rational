I'd make my domain run on rules closer to D&D than our reality, albeit with quality of life improvements. Think Two-Year Emperor with a few decades of advancement. I want a world that can operate without my constant interference.

You just turned 18? Time to go to the neighborhood FLEA and get to level 60.

Do you need a place to stay for the night? Cast Mage's Magnificent Mansion.

Want food on the go, rather than going into a Magnificent Mansion? Use Create Food and Drink, which in my version produces reasonably tasty food (about as good as you could prepare with decent ingredients and tools).

Want something more permanent? Create a demiplane (which, due to constraints, may be located in a non-Euclidean subspace in a protected pocket deep in the bowels of Buffalo). And my version of the Genesis spell even conjures a piece of forked metal suitable for teleporting into the plane you just created, so you don't have to wander interplanar space for weeks to find the world you just made.

Feeling a touch under the weather? Cast Cure Disease on yourself.

Dislike your appearance? Cast Polymorph Any Object on yourself. You can do it if you want to change your eye color, weight, apparent gender, tattoos...

[[http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/587/768/c7b.jpg][Seen something? Said nothing? Tried and failed to drink to forget?]] Have a trusted friend mindscrape you to remove the problematic memory.

Not enough time during the day to do what you need to? Grab a Ring of Sustenance, or perhaps an Ice Assistant, the demilitarized version of Ice Assassin.

One large problem to solve is identity tracking. If I can PAO myself to look like Nicholas Cage, how do you tell me from Nicholas Cage?

Another problem is law enforcement. What laws can you enforce on a population of level 60 wizard/sorcerer/archivists? Even if most of the dangerous spells are removed, it would be easy to escape into a private demiplane.

--------------

That's the standard and style of living I'm looking for. Non-Euclidean geometry to fit a large and growing population, universally available magic to give people their own lives, not dependent on my continued existence or one extremely powerful entity, that are still appreciably better than current reality.

Now there's the problem of relocating seven billion people to Buffalo, NY.

1. Create a demiplane that will fit the entire earth.
2. Create a fleet of utility airships -- invisible, permeable to matter, etc. Position them around the planet.
3. Have them duplicate all the non-human bits of the planet into the giant demiplane (except for the region within Buffalo that contains the demiplanes).
4. Have them teleport all humans into the corresponding positions in the giant demiplane on the cloned Earth.
5. Have them erase all hazardous materials from the surface of the earth and otherwise make it safe. No reason to leave trash around; keep the old Earth as a nature preserve.

Now the whole population of Earth is inside the Buffalo region, the old Earth isn't going to explode or melt down, and the new Earth is available for me to alter as necessary.

If that sort of power projection isn't possible, then I use my powers within Buffalo to create a giant airport and fleet of airships bringing anyone who wishes to Buffalo, free of charge. Perfectly normal airships, no divine power to keep them afloat or make them operate. I use my divine power to multitask enough to pilot them all, and I use divinely created satellites to communicate with them so I can pilot them remotely.

(Why airships rather than airplanes? Because they're more awesome. And I can land them with fewer facilities than an airplane.)

And if governments started imprisoning their populations, I'd have to deploy divinely created techno-kidnappers. Remove the problematic officials and bring them into my domain so I can give them a high quality life just like everyone else. It's kinder than assassination.
