I respect what you are saying. Not as a defense, but as a clarification, in the beginning of the story the friend states that he wanted to provide an experience as close as possible to what Nando experienced. From my perspective, I wanted you to 'be there'. The intro says "...and faithful to what my friend experienced during his chat sessions"
