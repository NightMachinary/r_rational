I was kind of frustrated at having to wait for the next line of text by the time it told me this was all going to be text chat logs. I thought it was a joke, but skipping through shows this is indeed a video of just text. If I'm just going to have to sit there skipping the video ahead all the time and finding my place again, I think I'd just like it in text format, I have no idea why you would make it a video.
