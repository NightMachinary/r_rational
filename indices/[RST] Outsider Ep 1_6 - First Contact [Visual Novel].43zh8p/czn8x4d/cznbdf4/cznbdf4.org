I think the author intended for this to be an immersion experience. Trying to convey the feeling of having a conversation through the chat, to show the intensity as Nando reacts pausing or fires off questions. The space ambient adds nicely to the story too - Stellardrone's amazing.

It would have been nice though if the author had provided text logs as well, I like to archive interesting things.

Hope this doesn't dissuade you from watching, this really was good - one of the better rational stories, imo. It might be better to just watch it later when there's nothing pressing to do at hand.

Maybe we can request the author for a text version, he seems to be on reddit. [[/u/danielrpa][u/danielrpa]] I'd love to have answers on few questions about the series. And ask if there were plans for a sequel or if he has any other writing.. What do you guys think? He'd fit in great with the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd :P
