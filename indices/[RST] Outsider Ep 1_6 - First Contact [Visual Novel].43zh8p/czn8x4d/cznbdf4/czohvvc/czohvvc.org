Hello brightwing!

I actually didn't realize there was a thread about my story, quite surprised! :)

I plan to release a text-only/ebook version of Outsider - lots of people asked for that and certainly on the plans. The reason I haven't done it yet is because I wanted it to be professionally reviewed. Folks probably spotted some errors (grammar, typos etc) and I wanted to get rid of those first :).

I appreciate your feedback!
