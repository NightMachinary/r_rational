It's kind of like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs][watching]] Big Bang Theory without a laugh track. I realize the pauses are there for a reason, but that wouldn't make it any less annoying to watch for three hours, which would completely overshadow the point.

I actually can't do it. I start doing that thing where I'm reading the text but I'm not processing it after a few lines. I was reminded that youtube had a fast forward feature, so I might try that a little later.
