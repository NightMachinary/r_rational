Hello literal-hitler,

I'm sorry you didn't like the approach I used. I tried to simulate a chat and added delays in order to simulate the other party thinking about what had just being said. I can see that fast readers would find it boring. I really think that this aspect adds value on top of a self-paced "text read", however obviously not everybody will like it.

One day I might release this as an app so you can select "reaction pauses on/off" and "global read speed |---slider---|". This would allow the piece to adapt to particular tastes while still maintaining some of the multimedia value.
