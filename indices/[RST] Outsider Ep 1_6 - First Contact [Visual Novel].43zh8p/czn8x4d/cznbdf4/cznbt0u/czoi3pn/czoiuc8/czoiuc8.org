Thanks for responding.

I thought that might be what you were trying to do, but it doesn't make sense in the first place because the story isn't told from Nando's point of view, it's told by his friend who's reading the chat logs.

I did also read the story at some point and I like it. Thanks for writing it. When I watched it at 1.5x speed it was too slow and at 2x it was too fast, but to be honest even at 1.5x speed it seemed to lose most of the multimedia value, to me at least. Just data to keep in mind on incrementing speed and whatnot if you undertake your idea.
