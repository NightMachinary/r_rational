I don't know where to put this, but this is what I think after watching the first episode:

1. Even providing the information that FTL or a facsimile of it is possible is about as influencing as confirming or denying the Riemann hypothesis.

2. About the sharing of technology point: It's impossible to keep something secret once there's a sufficient number of people in on it. Why am I saying this? Because unless some socio mathematical law guarantees that it won't happen, or other civilizations violently suppress it, there will be some actors of some kind that share information openly (other civilizations, splinter groups, individuals). As long as those exist, trying to keep ideas a secret is quite frankly not a viable strategy in the long term. And to be honest, a civilization that uses violence to prevent sharing of ideas is sufficiently against my values that I would consider it an enemy, not an ally. After all, they will chaperone me too when I try to share my ideas, and for their strategy to be effective they need to ensure I remain at a level where I cannot seriously challenge them.

So in conclusion, a civilization that will not share technology and ideas freely whose application is mostly limited to non-military matters must be either hostile, or stupid.
