I can see that, thank you for the feedback. The hard part about simulating super human intelligence is that I'm a human :) In Abel's case, I also wanted to stress the angle that his ego got in way of his thinking. Abel does NOT have the same level of intelligence as Mara. He doesn't possess all the intellectual tools that Mara does. I wanted to convey, like I said, that maybe he wouldn't be able to grasp Nando's malice, but also that his ego got in the way of his reasoning.

For some time I considered having Abel performing some feats to prove his intelligence (your point about "showing") like Mara did. But I thought that it wouldn't be necessary because a) Abel had no motivation to prove his intelligence (he would get the device anyway) and b) it could be repetitive to the reader. I did offer a glimpse of his intellect by having him solving the riddles very quickly.
