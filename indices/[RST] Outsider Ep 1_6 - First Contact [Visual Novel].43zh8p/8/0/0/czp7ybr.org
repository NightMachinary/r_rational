Mostly it's a problem of telling instead of showing. In the story we're told the aliens are super advanced and really smart, Abel talks a lot about this, but it never shows in his messages, he's neither persuasive nor seems to properly understand Fernando's motivations. It's like a writer telling about how funny a character is, how great the jokes are, but failing to show anything truly funny and showing just mediocre comedy instead.
