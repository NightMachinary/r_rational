From what you describe, it sounds like an obsessive or obsessive-compulsive disorder, pretty literally. I'm not sure whether compulsion fits as I don't know whether the compulsion was strong enough to actually produce behaviors, or even if it needs to be strong enough to fit. I'm also not sure if it is a disorder per se. Does it interfere with successfully living a life you desire, or is it just directly undesirable?

I am not a doctor, don't take my advice. The OCD sounds pretty cut and dried, but I don't know anything about how OCD normally expresses itself and I don't know what the actual doctors heard or thought.
