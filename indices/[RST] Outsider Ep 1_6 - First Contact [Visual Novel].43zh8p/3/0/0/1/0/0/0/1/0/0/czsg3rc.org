Have you recently taken any drug, herb, or had any brain trauma? Any recollection of this occurring when young?

I can think of two approaches that might help. The first is to shut down when trigger, meaning to relax you body with something covering your eyes to simulate darkess, breathe deeply, and do mindfulness meditation. Since it doesn't occur concurrently, I don't know how long you'd need to do this; you would also do the meditation when or if the response also manifests.

The second is to think of positive qualia, and try to trigger the response. If that proves impossible, you might try to twist your negative qualia to its postive counterpart, e.g. sex for revulsion. I also offer no estimates on the feasibility of this approach; indeed, it could even be quite dangerous.
