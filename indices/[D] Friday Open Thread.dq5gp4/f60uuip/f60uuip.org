Prediction time! I'd like to register the following:

We will see human level or greater General AI before 2030 (>=95% cumulative probability mass). This is an Inside View prediction rather than outside view.

I'd like to know (a quick summary) of others thoughts about this. Do you think I'm crazy?

I had another prediction which has been asked to be removed so I have removed it. Sorry [[/u/Badewell]].

Part of unedited post: (Unrelatedly, does anyone have the link for that Scott Alexander story about the Whispering Earring? I remember reading it a while ago and wanted to have a look at something)
