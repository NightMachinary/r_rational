  (At least) One of the works that Yudkowsky repeatedly hints he is behind is The Erogamer, the porn LitRPG/erotic novel that he keeps recommending.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/e5ssj4x/][Here's the relevant Yudkowsky post]], and some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9ft8w4/eliezers_latest_challenge_a_reverse_whodunit/e5z2bmj/][older discussion]]. I tend to agree with that thread; The Erogamer reads /too much/ like Yudkowsky to fit the bill. (I also really hope Groon is its own person because I want more such writers in the world.)
