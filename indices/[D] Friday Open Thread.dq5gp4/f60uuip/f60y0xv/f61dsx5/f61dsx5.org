Agreed, which is why I say P(someone else) is likely higher, but of any single author P(Yudkowsky) is the highest.

Despite that, it /really suspiciously/ does fit /both/ his writing goals /and/ his writing style /and/ all the meta-stuff around the story /also/ fits "things which are consistent with things Yudkowsky would do." So, I would be very surprised if he was not involved at all /somehow/.
