A year before Groon started The Erogamer, they wrote [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylor-hebert-harem-protagonist.26134/][Taylor Hebert, Harem Protagonist]]. It's pretty clearly a first draft of the later work in terms of its premise, and also pretty difficult to see as an intermediate step between HPMOR and the Erogamer, in terms of its writing quality.

Which is to say that I'm /very/ sceptical of Yudkowsky being Groon.
