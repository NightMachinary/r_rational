All good points. The only one I'm not so sure about is the Coffee test (ie. manipulating physical objects) as that's a very difficult problem in uncontrolled environments. Certainly doing it safely around humans in non-industrial settings should be done carefully.

I still think basically all those tests will be substantially passed by a single or small collection of systems (such that those systems can be chained together to produce the outcome.) /Right now/, we have an explosion of complexity but as the tooling catches up to the tasks at hand, we are likely to get (due to compositionality) an "implosion of simplicity". I think you may be underestimating how long 10 years actually is and what we can achieve.

In this prediction I'm just assuming current trends continue so no major wars, unrecoverable disruption due to climate change etc.
