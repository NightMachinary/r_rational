  Turing Test: I suspect we'll see a few AGIs pass in the next ten years. A bot that spouts frequently misspelled crap about antivaxxing, contrails, flat earth, Jewish conspiracy, pro-Trump, anti-immigration, pro-Russia shit, etc. is rather likely to be deemed a human. The bar for humanity can be set pretty low at times, so getting a bot to pass for a human is not necessarily very difficult.

This has been done. 10 years ago, actually. I put a bot up on 4chan that passed as human, though some folks questioned its mental health. It was just a Markov Chain text generator fed with the topic it was responding to.
