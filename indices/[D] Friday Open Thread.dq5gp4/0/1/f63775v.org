  We will see human level or greater General AI before 2030

This seems pretty doubtful to me, but it's also not very well-defined. To get a clearer picture of what we're talking about, let's look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Tests_for_confirming_human-level_AGI%5B15%5D%5B16%5D][tests for AGI]] and see which ones are most likely to be passed in the next 10 years:

- Turing Test: I suspect we'll see a few AGIs pass in the next ten years. A bot that spouts frequently misspelled crap about antivaxxing, contrails, flat earth, Jewish conspiracy, pro-Trump, anti-immigration, pro-Russia shit, etc. is rather likely to be deemed a human. The bar for humanity can be set pretty low at times, so getting a bot to pass for a human is not necessarily very difficult.

- Coffee Test: It seems quite doubtful that this will be passed in the next ten years. You'd need to be able to identify cupboard doors, open them to search for other things, identify water faucets and use them, identify coffee machines, identify coffee, etc. I suspect that with a prize of $100 million and ten years to get this done, it might be possible to get a robot that can succeed more often than not, but it would likely be a single-purpose machine rather than something that could also go and make a bowl of cereal.

- The Robot College Student Test: This /might/ be feasible for certain niches of study within the next ten years, particularly in subjects that use tests exclusively. However, completing all of the general education requirements would also entail things like English composition, which I doubt an AI would be able to pass in the next ten years.

- The Employment Test: This has long-since passed. Industrial robots are already commonplace.

- The Flat Pack Furniture Test: This /might/ be passed in the next ten years. It seems unlikely, but I could potentially see stores selling flat-packed furniture and offering to have a robot assemble it in your home at some point in the next ten years. This can be aided by having a QR code on the box which provides a link to a set of instructions which are more machine-friendly, plus QR codes on the parts to help the machine identify them and follow the directions.

- The Mirror Test: I could see this being passed fairly easily within the next ten years, since looking at objects in the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum could be done relatively easy by a robot, and this would make it much easier to distinguish mirror images from actual objects.

- AGI IQ tests: For this, the obvious benchmark would be to reach or exceed an IQ of 100. I could see this potentially happening within 10 years, though I have very low confidence about the odds.

Will a single machine pass all of those tests within ten years? It seems highly unlikely for now. We've definitely made some good progress since 2010, but not enough to justify saying that we'll have genuine AGI with just another 10 years. Right now, I suspect that AGI which could pass all of those tests is probably closer to 20-40 years out.
