I'm leaning third. Easier to do perspectives from another character with less disruption. Then again a lot of times third is just "inner third person" where you say things like "John liked flowers. They had lots of effective poisons for killing bad guys. Poison was awesome!" where it's sort of his inner thoughts but you're saying them in third person outside quotes and italics.

It is actually possible to make things clear to the reader that aren't clear to the main character with strict person but it's difficult. It's uncommon that you'd want to, but still.
