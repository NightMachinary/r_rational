First person always raises the question of why the narrator is telling the story. Related questions include "to whom is this story being told?", "is the narrator worried about their enemies getting ahold of this book?" and "how did the editor write down his notes and send them to the literary agent under these circumstances?".

Some stories answer these questions. Those answers can be a part of the story, and a useful storytelling tool with no third-person equivalent.

But some stories ignore these questions. And then the reader pretty much has to deliberately not think about them. And deliberately not thinking about things doesn't fit well with overall rationalist fiction.
