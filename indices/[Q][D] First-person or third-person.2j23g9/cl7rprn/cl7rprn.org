I've come around to appreciating first person. I've found that it is very good for mystery and rational fiction because the reader is explicitly seeing what that character is thinking, seeing, and feeling. It's playing it 'fair' with the reader. The reader can think about what they would do, and what they know, and compare their thoughts to the character's. The limitation also forces you to figure out how show the information to both the character and the reader. Often enforcing limitations like this is great for inspiration and writing quality. There are downsides. If your character is introspective, you run the risk of telling instead of showing what they are feeling. You also can lose out on viewing the wider world.
