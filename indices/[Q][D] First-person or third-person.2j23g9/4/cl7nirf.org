I prefer limited third-person, mostly because it allows you to do outside-viewpoint digressions and (more cleanly) hope between multiple viewpoint characters.

In my opinion, third person allows you to do just as much as first person, and then some more stuff on top of that. I don't think it affects quality of writing all that much either way - it's just that first person limits your possibilities.

(I write pretty exclusively in third person - I might be a little biased.)
