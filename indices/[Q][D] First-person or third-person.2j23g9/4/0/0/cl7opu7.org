I think the biggest thing is to know why you'd do one over the other. I found [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/09/07/we-5-1-third-person-limited/][this episode]] of Writing Excuses to be a fairly illuminating discussion on why to use one or the other. I personally don't see myself dipping into first person anytime soon because I have so much less experience with it, but I think that there are certain stories that can be better told with that more intimate perspective.
