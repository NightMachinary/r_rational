I agree for the most part, but then I take into account confirmation bias. You only /remember/ the third-person chapters that stuck out to you, while others weren't so successful. Also, you're comparing "occasional chapters from a third-person perspective" to "many many chapters from Taylor's perspective." The interludes are more "singular" than the rest.
