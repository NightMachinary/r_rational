The more I think about it, the more I think that the interludes were the high point of /Worm/ - they definitely stick out a lot more for me than the endless chapters stuck in Taylor's viewpoint, and I felt like they were /far/ better at developing the side characters than anything that happened in the first-person parts. But I don't know how much other people would agree with that.
