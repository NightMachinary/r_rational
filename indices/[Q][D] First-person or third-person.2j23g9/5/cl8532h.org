Limited third. First person has too many hangups, especially for people from a fanfic background reading the work. You can do it, but you start under the automatic stigma of first person narratives -- that you are an amateur who doesn't know any better.

The only reason to do first person I see is if you are writing someone telling a story.

--------------

For example, the Dresden Files books by Jim Butcher use this /mostly/ because it is a hard-boiled detective trope. You can almost see him reporting on the case after the fact, face bandaged up and with a tumbler of scotch in his hand.

Charles Stross' Laundry series uses it because they are first-person reports (later, literally written reports) of the events that occurred, from a single person's perspective (plus guesses about other, off-scene stuff). As he doesn't want to hide motivations or justifications for his actions long, this works very well for a straight-forward character dealing with events as they come at him at 120kph.

The Nero Wolfe series by Rex Stout uses first person because it is reports by a single detective, often as if he was writing up case notes or telling the story to his boss. Sometimes, he tells his boss things from first person, in first person, making this deliciously meta. Sometimes, he attempts to actively see things from his boss' perspective, again a great meta point. This makes the other characters pop more, as you see only his clearly biased but also carefully trained detective's eye view of them and their actions, contrasting and comparing his abilities against a master detective's instead of seeing everything from a more perfect (if limited) god's eye view that would have to skip over things or weasel about details. That would be really boring in a detective novel, after all. It also avoids lots of "he noticed, but apparently no one else did" types of sentences.

--------------

So unless a story really needs first person, and needs it bad, I say third person limited all the way. The character's internal life does not need to fully be exposed and you don't risk breaking suspension of disbelief by not saying what someone is thinking when they have to deal with something dramatic. The reader can worry about the character from a more detached position, instead of being confused by not knowing what is going through their head sometimes. You also have a built-in reason to show more, tell less than in first person. And fewer problems with making the first person character simply a self-insert.

It is harder to write third person limited in general, as you need to maintain POV at all times and only switch carefully (no switching mid-scene). But the results are more like a play or a movie, plus a few internal hints occasionally. I think that is a good thing, most of the time. It is actually easier to write groups of people sticking together in third person, too, as you usually don't have to track as carefully what the POV character sees and hears and thinks when describing a scene.

--------------

As for rational fiction? Still third. Way, /way/ too much tell-not-show already, and we don't need yet more awkwardly detailed descriptions of what a rational person is thinking. They usually aren't very realistic. A lot of the time, people writing rational fic want a smart character. And if they aren't that smart or smarter themselves, their generated internal models they have for their character's thoughts and motivations quickly break down.

You can Sir Arthur Conan Doyle it up (he wasn't Sherlock Holmes smart by any stretch) by explaining the results of rational decisions a little fuzzily (wait, what brand of tobacco was it, and how was it identified?) while making the /process/ that was used to arrive at the results the most interesting part of the story. In this way, you can write any level of intelligence into a rational character in third person. Not so easy to do in first person.
