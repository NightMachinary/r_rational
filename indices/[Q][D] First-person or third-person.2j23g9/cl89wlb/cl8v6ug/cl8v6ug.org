Note (for the uninitiated, not you): A lot of what he's talking about are rather common tropes, as can be seen on TvTropes (which I highly recommend for all writers). For instance, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee][Unspoken Plan Guarantee]] pretty much /is/ what he was talking about in the fourth paragraph.

Also, something I've noticed with third-person vs. first-person is perspective changes. I haven't read any books written from the first-person which are both not epistolary and from multiple perspectives (epistolary novels, like /Dracula/, and more contemporary /World War Z/, are perfectly capable of changing perspective), whereas most third-person books I've read tend to have multiple perspectives (/A Song of Fire and Ice/ being the best example I can give).

(side-bar: the first book I ever finished had thirteen different POVs, and was in first-person. They all had different, distinctive, narrative voices, too. It's just, the book sucked. It was partially that what I'm working on now is basically a major retooling of that idea, but from the third-person and with less POVs, that I made this thread)

Note: Both you and [[/u/alexanderwales]] have now commented on this post. I'm feeling starstruck, despite the fact that you're both rather active in the sub.
