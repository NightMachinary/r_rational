I prefer third-person because I think it reads better, especially in rational/ist stories where the main character is hiding something like a plan from the reader for the point of suspense. /HPMOR/ has used this well (or should I say, /is/ using it), whereas in first-person /Worm/, when the plan finally came into fulfillment, it seemed sudden and contrived (to me, at least). IIRC, the incident in mind was about [[#s][Monarch spoilers?]]

Although past this, I think first person is pretty well-suited for a ratfic. /The Two-Year Emperor/ is a good example of this: by being in the main character's head, we can see how their thoughts play out, we can see how they draw deductions and come up with plans, and that's half of rationality right there, isn't it?

:. Both have their upsides and downsides. My opinions cancel out. This post was a waste.
