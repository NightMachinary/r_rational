For The Two Year Emperor (which I considered linking but then decided that would be utterly whorish and it's easy enough to find on this reddit since I link it here every bloody week) I mostly use first person because it allows me to (a) insert humor into the thought stream of the narrator, (b) better show his reactions to the madness around him, (c) allows for some very specific foreshadowing, such as about [[#s][how]].

That said, I dip into third person in a couple of places, either for narrative purpose or for humor--for example, a third person view of a KEW attack, and a couple of reframings right in the middle of an action moment. The latter provides a sense of tension as the reader waits for the events to resolve, provides needed context, and is a good way to inject a bit of dry humor. It's also a really easy way to utterly screw up and look completely lame, so I don't do it often.

First person is typically done in one of a few ways: real time (what I do with 2YE), epistolary style (Dracula), or as an after action report (can't think of a famous example offhand). I strongly dislike the latter two, as the fact that the main character obviously survived sucks most of the tension out of the story. Also, epistolary style can just be boring as hell.

The problem that first person has is information hiding. If you show a plan ahead of time, it must fail. To have it stated and then succeed is (generally) boring. The trick I use for this is scene cuts. If I want to show that a plan exists but not what it is, I'll have Jake say to the others "Ok, here's what we do..." and then cut to the next day where they are actually doing it.

The major advantages that I see are:

- First person told-in-real-time has an immediacy that third lacks, and makes it possible for the audience to identify more with characters who, in third person, would not be identifiable. "The Tell Tale Heart" is a good example of this. The narrator is a crazy murderer; told from the outside, you just want him to go to prison ASAP. Told from the inside, you get sucked into his worldview much more.

- Third person makes information hiding easier, simplifies the process of dealing with characters smarter than / very different from you, allows showing things happening in multiple places more easily.
