I'd probably pay about $2-$5 a month through patreon and would go up to $25 for a kickstarter... I enjoy reading your work and I think it's important to make writing prose a viable profession instead of just an hobby so I budget about $25/month to support various online writers I like.

By the way, enjoy Malaysia, I've lived for a year near penang and it's definitely a nice country to live in and it's indeed quite cheap. Only thing that's a bit frustrating is that in a lot of places internet is painfully slow albeit reliable...
