Thank you, I really appreciate the input.

As to my finances -- I have a pretty good amount of savings, so there's a fair bit of runway under me. Also, I can probably live on <USD$1000 / month in Malasia, which makes that runway stretch even longer.

As to my day job -- I quit back in April. :) I worked for a consulting company that only had one client, and several important people at that client clearly wanted to get rid of us for political reasons. About a month after I quit, the consulting company lost its contract and everyone except 4 people (one of them the founder) were laid off.
