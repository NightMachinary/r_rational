I would probably not fund a patreon/kickstarter at this point in time.

I wish you the best of luck with your endeavor, but from an outsider's POV who doesn't know any details about your current finances, I think it would be very unwise to quit your day job to write for donations before you've got a sufficient revenue stream that you can support yourself. Nevertheless, good luck with whatever you decide to do!
