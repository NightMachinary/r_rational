Have you considered doing commissions?

Suppose a member of this community absolutely had to see a really good rational horror story.

[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hoef9/any_good_rational_horror_stories/]]

You could be our go to guy "Hey, this guy writes pretty good stories, you could go to him to fix a horror story if you really want."

If you wanted to turn that into passive income you could make a site or blog with a number of those stories on there, have some advertisements.
