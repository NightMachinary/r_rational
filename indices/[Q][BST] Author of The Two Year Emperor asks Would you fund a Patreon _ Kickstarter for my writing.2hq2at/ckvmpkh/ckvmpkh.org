1. Probably not. I'm not big on Patreon, since I'm bad with accurately gauging monthly expenses.
2. Probably yes. That depends on what the subject matter was, and how much "proof of concept" had been done.
3. See above. It depends on how much the concept interests me, and how much groundwork has been done. I'd much rather Kickstart something that had already been written and was just awaiting editing/polish than something that was going to be released in weekly chapters, but that probably doesn't work for you from a monetary perspective. Amount probably depends on how I'm feeling that day, and what the reward levels are, and how long the book is projected to be, but an average of $10, which is about the price of a paperback.
