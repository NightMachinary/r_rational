Speaking as someone who once took an interest in living off book sales, and who has read the blogs of many professionals, I think you're going to have to keep writing as a hobby, or accept some pretty extreme lifestyle changes. No one is in this business for the money.

If you had a completed book I'd pay $10 for it. Maybe $20, if you released the first chunk as a sample and I really liked what I saw. I'm not a fan of just paying people money and waiting for them to deliver.
