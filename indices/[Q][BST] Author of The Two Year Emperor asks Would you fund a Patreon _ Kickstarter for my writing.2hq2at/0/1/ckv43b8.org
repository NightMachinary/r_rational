  No one is in this business for the money.

I would definitely agree with that. Even Harlan Ellison made most of his money from speaking at conferences / conventions. There are people who write romances(*) who make a ton of money, and the occasional blockbuster (HP, Twilight...) exists and makes the author rich. Oh, and "50 Shades of Gray" fits in both of those categories despite the fact that almost every review I've read and every person I've spoken to says its crap. I bought it on iBooks and I'm going to read it now, just to see what I have to do to do better.

  If you had a completed book I'd pay $10 for it. Maybe $20, if you released the first chunk as a sample and I really liked what I saw. I'm not a fan of just paying people money and waiting for them to deliver.

Thank you, that's good to know.

(*) Which I have no problem doing, but I don't think that fits the [[/r/rationalist]] scene and I wanted to stay mostly on topic when I posted this.
