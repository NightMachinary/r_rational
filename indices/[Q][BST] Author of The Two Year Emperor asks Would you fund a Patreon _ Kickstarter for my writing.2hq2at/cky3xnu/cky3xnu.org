So much of your time in TYE is spent explaining why the world doesn't work without lots of glue and binding wire. I'd really like to see what you can do world-building-wise outside of those requirements. The few hints we've gotten have been very good, but still have to exist in this broken rule set world.

I think what I'm trying to say is, you seem to have good writing chops. It would be a shame to get stuck on TYE as either a genre or a setting. I'd be more interested in funding an original project than more TYE-world stuff.

Something D&D-like (or "lite") would be cool, like what nobody103 is doing with [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]. You seem to be suggesting this is your goal, but you're also saying sequels to TYE...so I'm a little confused at that. If this sort of thing is what you're planning anyway, then great. If not, then I urge you to reconsider. Building new worlds is hard, but you can always crib from old works shamelessly. It's what all the pros do, after all.

As for funding, Patreon for extra side projects or accelerated publishing seems like a popular and effective strategy, and would be the sort of thing I'd support. Then, after the project is started and gaining momentum, run a Kickstarter for self-publishing physical books for the first 100k word long part (a reward level) and for future web hosting costs for the finished digital work.

Good luck, and good writing.
