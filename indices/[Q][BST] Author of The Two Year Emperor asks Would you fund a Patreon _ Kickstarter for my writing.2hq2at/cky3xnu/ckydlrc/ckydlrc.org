You've pretty much got it as to my plan. the next story/ ies would be in an original world but the Drauga War would be part of the background... I think. Not the actual events -- Jake wouldn't be in the picture but the war would, the gods would, Albrecht would, etc.

I would rationalize the magic system ...right now I'm thinking something where magic happens by negotiating with special spirits -- gods, extraplanar creatures, spirits of trees /rivers etc -- for favors. I guess it would be less a direct sequel and more a spiritual one.

EDIT: Spelling. Stupid iPhone auto-correct and tiny little screen that makes proofreading hard.
