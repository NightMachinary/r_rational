More or less, yes. It wouldn't necessarily have to be a weekly thing, but if I were to pay on a per update basis, I would expect sparser updates to be more substantial (if I were to pay more for them). I would consider funding a kickstarter for an in-the-works project. I just mean to say my willingness to do so decreases with the time left to completion (I'd have to be very impressed with a proof of concept to consider funding something that's just getting started). Also, the amount I'm willing to pay would probably be less than for a completed work.
