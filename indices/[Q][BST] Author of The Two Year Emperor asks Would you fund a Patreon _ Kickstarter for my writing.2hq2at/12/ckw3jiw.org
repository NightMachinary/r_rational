I would be willing to pay maybe $1-2 per update for a serial/WIP (assuming weekly updates), and perhaps somewhere in the vicinity of $25-$35 for a completed work (assuming an average length novel). The specifics of the medium are inconsequential.

I would however prefer any projects I back to be completed or at the very least rather far along, as opposed to supporting something that might come to fruition sometime in the nebulous future.
