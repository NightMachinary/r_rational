I would fund a Patreon/Kickstarter, especially if it regularly included fans getting some degree of input in the story, like suggesting tactics and seeing them play out.

My level of funding would entirely depend on my feelings and whims on the day. £2 a month or £15 for some fixed purpose is probably my limit.
