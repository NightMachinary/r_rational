Patreon supports "per x updates" donations, I personally prefer them when it comes to anything with a weekly or longer update schedule. A popular model is to let patreons have a few exclusive latest chapters, and then roll them out into general availablility as you finish more.

Patreon works better for ongoing projects like serials, Kickstarter is more for getting a lump sum to to a larger project, and failure there is easy.
