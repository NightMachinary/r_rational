Have you tried Alastair Reynolds /revelation space/ series? Also, might I suggest Greg Egan? I found Permutation City kind of mind blowing, with the first half being an excellent examination of what it means to be a simulated person, and the second half having different assumptions about what reality is than myself (or the Rationalist community, for that matter).

Also, though slightly less Rationalist, and more anarcho-communist (but still pretty excellent science fiction) Ken MacLeod's Fall revolution.

Or the entire sub-genre of Cyber-punk or post-cyber punk. Those are pretty cool too.
