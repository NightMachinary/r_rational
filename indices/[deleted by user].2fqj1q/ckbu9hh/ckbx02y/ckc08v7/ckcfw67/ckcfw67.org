Physics student, I disagree with you. See my post a few levels in for my attempt at ELI5.

For a jargonny explanation: the map from what I'll call "physical dimensions" (as opposed to mathematical ones) to the various fields we define on them is one-to-one (by definition). The reverse is not necessarily true. There is a distinction between the two and Energy, momentum, quantum fields etc. are not dimensions in the "physical dimension" sense.
