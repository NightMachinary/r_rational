Your conclusion might be right (I'm a mathematician by training, but no kind of physicist), but the logic isn't. A photon has a specific energy state, and doesn't need to be moving to have that energy (though all of them are, in fact, moving, this is a distinct property of photons from the fact that they have varying energies). It is conceivable that a particle could exist in a 0-dimensional state and have varying energies which vary in a well-defined way over time.
