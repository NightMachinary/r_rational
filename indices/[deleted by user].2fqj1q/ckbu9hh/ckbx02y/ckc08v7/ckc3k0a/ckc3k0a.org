Spatial dimensions, then. I don't know whether you can reasonably express energy as another dimension. You may be able to express velocity as another set of dimensions in a reasonable way, for instance -- though that probably wouldn't work in 0d, since that's a vector with 0 dimensions.

Temperature probably isn't a candidate for a really-exists-as-a-dimension-in-reality sort of thing. Or I horribly misunderstand kinetic theory, which is reasonably likely. Chemical potential energy and gravitic potential energy likewise. Vacuum energy might be a candidate.
