I am curious how you store information in a zero-dimensional universe.

Transitioning from 3d to 2d is straightforward assuming that the universe is discrete -- you just take each successive slice of the object and lay it out in the 2d equivalent universe. So if you have a cube that's 1,000 Planck lengths to the side, its 2d footprint is 1,000 times its vertical surface area. Similarly, going from 2d to 1d is straightforward. You go from 1,000 squares of 1,000 Planck lengths each, laid head to tail, to 1,000,000 lines of 1,000 Planck lengths each, laid head to tail. You have an infinite number of points in each dimension, and ∞³ = ∞, so you can project a 3d object into 1d.

Going to 0d, though, is much different. You have zero dimensions. How can you have any points there to stuff things into? I suppose you might posit that "information" exists, and this doesn't need to be tied to matter in any way, which is a pretty huge change. It opens the door to souls, for crying out loud.

On the other hand, if you can define the transitions between Xd and (X-1)d, you can do it with losing only one dimension. You project the Xd object into (X-1)d using one function, and you use another function that isn't the inverse of that first function to project it back into Xd. So you turn a point (12, 3, 7) into, say, (418, 79), and then you turn (418, 79) into (112, 103, 107).

This also opens the door to a rather effective weapon. Attach one of these projection teleporters to an object, but define its 2d -> 3d transformation as effectively random, or as scattering the constituent atoms of the object to the four winds. You could project an object from an arbitrary location to any other location -- if you're accurate enough, you could project a wad of gum into someone's aorta, wait for them to die, then project it out.

And this stuff is why I generally hate it when people try to explain too much in their sci fi stories.
