The problem here is that /ins't/ the 0th dimension, as far as I understand what dimensions in this context mean. The fact that the point has multiple states, even if it's only two, makes it 1 dimensional. The information that encodes whatever it is you've "moved" into this "zero dimension" requires some state to change over some other state (i.e. a series of 1s and 0s changing over time). The 1st dimension (visualized most commonly as a number line) is the "lowest" dimension such information can be encoded on, surely, with the location of points upon the entirety of the line being being said information.
