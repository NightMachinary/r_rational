The characters don't accept dumb explanations. If someone is doing something stupid or irrational they get called out on it. There is no /because the plot/. In fact the plot of Line War is all about how the AI's are not acting as intelligent as they should. Also, as far as I can see there's nothing that could be insanely exploited to instantly solve a situation. If the main antagonist can simply be shot in the head, you shoot him in the head, preferably with an augmented soldier who can run faster than most vehicles and takes heavy weapons to kill.
