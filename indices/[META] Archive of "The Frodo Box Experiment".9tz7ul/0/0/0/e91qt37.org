If we underestimate him, we will perish.”

“Send the Ring, and we lose,” Gandalf said slowly. “But if we defend the gates of Gondor and wait for Sauron's armies to disintegrate from their own poison, again you say our defeat is inevitable.”

Frodo smiled. “Not quite, Gandalf. You have me.”

“Ah,” Gandalf said. “I cannot say I am entirely surprised. The Ring has corrupted you, Frodo! It will not stand against its master, not so close, not when the Enemy reveals himself in full.” “Again, not quite. You have misunderstood. The Ring does not seek out Sauron because Sauron is its master. The Ring is fundamentally a fulfiller of ambitions. And until today Sauron has had the greatest ambition.

“But now! look at this assembled Council. Gandalf, you seek victory over the most terrible foe Middle Earth has ever known. Elrond, you desire to preserve your prosperity and peace. Boromir and Strider, my friend, you wish to defend Gondor, to strike down Sauron's armies and lay waste to the Enemy of Man. Gloin, and Gimli, and all the dwarves want for no less than the return of their ancestral lands and treasure. And,” Frodo smiled at Bilbo, “We hobbits have the greatest ambition of all: to go home again and tend to our gardens, eat plenty of cake, and have no more of this business with adventures!” At that even the Elves laughed, and Gandalf cracked a smile.

Frodo waited for them to quiet down before he went on. “What this Council represents is not the unity of our military strength or intelligence. It is the unity of our ambitions. For what each and every one of us here today wants cannot be achieved first and foremost unless Sauron is defeated.” His eyes were hard, challenging them to disagree, and no one spoke.

“What I say then is that if I face Sauron outside the gates of Gondor in front of the armies of Man against the hordes of Mordor, as long as I stand for and with this Council, its power will not be turned to him. Rather, he will have to contend with a strategic brilliance that he retains only a pale shadow of today.”

But Boromir was still suspicious. Boromir, who should have been the first to leap at any chance to save Gondor, which was obviously in a hopelessly indefensible position. “How do you know Sauron and the Ringwraiths still retain some of the Ring-sight? Or what if you are lying and seek only to wear the Ring once more?”

Before Frodo could think of a response, Bilbo spoke. “No. Frodo is right. Even after Gollum lost the Ring, he was still cleverer, more crafty, than any creature I have ever encountered.” Gandalf nodded his agreement, and Boromir was silent, looking assuaged if not entirely satisfied.

/Thank you again, Bilbo/. Who would have thought that the old hobbit would be so quick on his feet? For that matter, was it just a coincidence that Bilbo's words helped Frodo? Was it actually true that the Ring-sight remained? If so, perhaps Bilbo could see what Frodo was doing. Helping Frodo convince the Council that they needed someone to wear the Ring...

...So that he could wear the Ring himself.

/No! No! It's mine! You can't have it!/ Frodo's mind lashed out at Bilbo, filled with fire and fury and murder, plotting Bilbo's death a dozen different ways: poison, stabbing, a great fall, on and on and on Bilbo's death ran through Frodo's mind.

No. Stop. Don't let it show. Get out with the Ring, and then kill the old hobbit.

“There is not enough time,” Aragorn said, “To take you to Gondor, Frodo, and to set you to work training Gondor's armies and devising strategies. You would arrive there only shortly before Mordor's attack.”

“That is why I should begin now,” Frodo said. “With you and Boromir and Gandalf, and such Elves and Dwarves as have military knowledge. Together we can predict Sauron's movements, devise strategies, strengthen the defenses of Gondor, while we prepare to arrive there just in time to break the back of Sauron's might.”

But they weren't biting. Something held them back. Was it too good to be true, perhaps? Did he push too strongly? If only someone else could speak on his behalf.

I need---

“This idea,” Elrond said, “Depends solely on the word of the one who wears the Ring and one who wore it.”

Ah, Elrond. You failed to kill Isildur when he held the Ring in his hand, and because of that we are here today to deal with your folly. Is this why you created such a still, idyllic world? So that you wouldn't have to make any decisions, to risk losing anything? “Elrond, wise lord, no path is perfect, no decision without the chance of failure. What I tell you is that Rivendell and Lothlorien, all your lands, are not lost nor need be. Why do you so hastily choose to discard them? Sauron's power can be defeated by a power of his own making, as does the orc's corrosion undo all his metalwork.” Hopefully that would be enough to reframe the decision in Elrond's mind, force him to see denying Frodo's plan as a deliberate choice to sacrifice something close, something he could feel and would regret long after the decision had proved wise or foolish.That, and Elrond had the spin for the decision he would inevitably make.

“This is the only path the Ring-sight has shown me to defend Gondor,” said Frodo, and that won Boromir and Aragorn. “There are many here who are afraid of the Ring,” Frodo continued in a voice that suggested it was understandable but about to be shown as foolish, “But fear itself is a weapon of the Enemy. It stifles our thinking delays our action, and thus is Gondor on the verge of destruction while only just now do we assemble a Council. Let us banish fear along with folly.” And that won Gandalf.

The dwarves were still a problem, and Frodo could see doubt on Gloin's face. Then Gloin said, “If it means we can take back our kingdom and our treasure, I say the dwarves are in this too. Let us destroy the real enemy before we fight each other,” he laughed, and in the Ring-sight Frodo saw within Gloin's bravado the knowledge that all others were decided and to state his own reservations would draw attention and put him on the spot. And this settled the minds of all else at the Council, for with the last of the leaders having made up their minds, it would have been /rude/ for anyone else to object.

With that, it was over.

“Enough time has been lost. Sauron is preparing his attack even as we speak,” Frodo said. “Let us begin our preparations.”

“No one, not even you, Frodo, who may be our salvation, can walk freely within Rivendell while they wear the Ring,” Elrond said.

“The Ring grows stronger the longer I wear it,” Frodo said, “And weakens as I remove it, and it does not return to its full strength instantly. Everything is at stake here. We cannot afford to lessen our strategic potential. But I agree. Do not let me go anywhere without Gandalf on one side and Glorfindel on the other. Take me into the planning chamber, and I will go nowhere else. If it is necessary for everyone but me to leave it for some reason, lock me inside until someone can return.”

There was a pause that stretched for a millennium in Frodo's mind, and then Gandalf nodded. He spoke a Word of Power, and Frodo nearly fell over as his movement returned to him. “Oh, Frodo,” Bilbo said quietly, “What have we done?”

“Don't fear, Bilbo!” Frodo said cheerfully, embracing the old hobbit. “I promise you, with the Ring-sight we will be back in the Shire eating cake, or, if you prefer, in Rivendell writing merry songs.” I'll kill you, you scheming old hobbit. You'll never get the Ring, my precious ring. But with the Ring on his finger, Frodo could not miss the contradiction. Did Bilbo want peace or war? He could not enjoy life in Rivendell if he held the Ring, he knew that.

The Ring changes people, Frodo realized. Makes them stop caring for things they cared for before. Makes them care only about the Ring. Bilbo. Gollum. Sauron, even.

Me. That's why I want to kill Bilbo. Even though before I wouldn't have been able to think of killing anyone, let alone someone as dear to me as old Bilbo.

But then Frodo was walking with Glorfindel and Gandalf and Elrond, Boromir was already outlining Gondor's defenses and resources, and Frodo found that he no longer cared about Bilbo or the Shire or even the War. He had talked his way out of the binding with the Ring still on his finger, and that is what he would do forever more. Anything, anything at all to keep the Ring on his finger until...

...Until I die?

No.

I will live forever. The Ring will stay on my finger forever.

And with the one true goal firmly in mind, with the power to bind the world to his will nested tightly around his finger, Frodo nodded and spoke tersely, absorbing the information Boromir freely gave him, the Ring-sight tunneling through all the world's barriers to the end where Frodo emerged and saw only that it was forever from now and the Ring was still on his finger.
