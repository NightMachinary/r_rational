I don't have a copy, but I'll put a description of the plot as far as I remember behind a spoiler. I'd suggest that you hold off on reading this summary for a day or two in case someone does have a copy, because it's more entertaining to read the story in its entirety.

If I remember right, the setting was the Council of Elrond, with all the characters present that were there in the original. They are debating over whether to take the risk of having someone temporarily wear the Ring, which some of them think is the only way to find a strategy to defeat Sauron (or some goal along those general lines). They reach the decision that Frodo will be immobilized so that he can't do anything but think and speak (I think this was done via spell of paralysis), the ring will be placed on his finger, he will be questioned about how to defeat Sauron, and the ring will then be removed.

This is of course an allegory for the "boxed AI" scenario, wherein an AI whose only abilities are to think and communicate with its "gatekeepers" tries to convince them to give it more freedom. It turns out that what the Ring does is give the wearer supernaturally good reasoning skills, tactical acumen, cunning, etc. At the same time, it turns the wearer into a "paperclip maximizer" whose only desire is to keep the Ring on their finger, forever, at any cost.

As soon as Frodo puts on the ring, the value shift kicks in. He recognizes that per the Council's prior agreement, the ring will be removed from his finger as soon as they're done questioning him, which he obviously can't allow. For the rest of the story, we watch him manipulate the others into "letting him out of the box" by convincing them that he retains his original values, that he will use the Ring to defeat Sauron, and that defeating Sauron is impossible unless he continues to wear the Ring. He presents a different argument to convince each of the major players, until they finally agree to release him. The story ends with a chilling reminder that although he might play along with the fight against Sauron for a time in order to continue to be allowed to wear the Ring, he intends to eventually eliminate anything and anyone that threatens his possession of it. Every action he takes from now on will ultimately be in service to his singular goal of continuing to wear the Ring for all eternity.
