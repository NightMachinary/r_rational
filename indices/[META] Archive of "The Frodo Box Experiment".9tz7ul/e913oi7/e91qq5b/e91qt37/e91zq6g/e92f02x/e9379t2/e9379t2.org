Answer: the Ring /truly/ has his own will. In fact, the Ring is a magical mind-upload of Sauron, in which he poured the best parts of his intellect and personality, leaving behind a brain badly damaged by the process which couldn't function properly without being reconnected to the object which held the major part of its abilities.

Sauron did not lose the Ring. The Ring got bored and decided to go for a walk.
