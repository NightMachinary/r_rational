* The Frodo Box Experiment

  :END:
“Frodo must wear the ring once more,” Gandalf said.

The cacophony that resulted Frodo would not forget for a long time. Thick-bearded dwarves in chain mail jumped to their feet, wielding axes and shouting curses. The elves did not stand, but some of the Ring-sight lingered, and Frodo's eyes did not miss their tensed hands, the tightened faces and voices that spoke with less than perfect rhythm and grace. Neither of the two Men objected. Boromir of Gondor only nodded his head, and Strider the Ranger stood and voiced his support of Gandalf.

Frodo hand jerked toward the ring, and he could only stop it by grabbing his wrist and squeezing it so hard his knuckles turned white. He had already seen that there was no alternative. For the Wise had proven themselves anything but, and the decisions that had lost this war had happened before Frodo had even been born. And Frodo had heard the whisper of the Shadow when he had last worn the ring and knew it to be true, that only the ring could promise victory if there was any victory to be found.

“To wear the ring invites the Shadow here!” Gloin the dwarf said. Fear was evident upon his face.

“It is folly,” Elrond said with barely concealed fury, “To ask the Enemy how he may be defeated.”

“The Enemy does not believe we will destroy the ring,” Gandalf said. “He suspects us all of wanting to keep it for our own gain. The Shadow's power will not lead us a false trail but instead offer the most plausible excuses to the one who, it believes, is using the Ring's power to claim it for himself.

“Nor does the Shadow cast his eye here. For he is not yet strong enough to pierce the walls of the Elves and I together, and he believes we would take the ring to Gondor to use its power against his armies. The roads to Gondor are what he watches now. He is not entirely mistaken either.” Gandalf nodded at Boromir, who inclined his head stiffly in return.

/Fool/, Frodo thought, and he began to speak, but then he stopped. For he realized that if the Ring could offer him insight into a problem as impossible as its own destruction, then it could solve any more minor ones along the way. Including the problem of how to get the ring /off/. And Frodo said nothing.

But Bilbo spoke. “I, I remember what it was like to wear the ring. To wear it a second time even for Frodo would be a burden too great for a small hobbit to bear. He will not,” his voice caught, “He will not be able to take it off again.”

“I will bind Frodo myself with a Word of Power,” Gandalf said. “Take no offense, dear Frodo, but you cannot wield the ring at half its full strength, and my binding will be secure.”

At that Frodo could only laugh, a high, wheezing sound. Even Gandalf looked disturbed, but he went on. “And you, Bilbo, when we have the Shadow's plan, you will take the Ring from Frodo's finger, and I will take the Ring from you and return it to Frodo, or perhaps his servant Sam if Frodo needs to recover.”

The dwarves looked suspicious, but they said nothing. The elves tersely nodded their assent. Boromir and Strider stood with Gandalf, and Frodo signaled his consent. And in Frodo's mind he applauded the sheer genius of the Ring, for he could not possibly conceive how the Ring had pulled /this/ off. Or perhaps even the Ring's power was not that great, but the Wise were so foolish.

Frodo released his wrist, and his hand shot up to where he kept the Ring, and just as he slipped it on, Gandalf spoke a word of Power, binding Frodo's body still.

But Frodo paid his body no heed. For his mind was changing, fluctuating, expanding and sharpening exponentially. Color did not fade away to be replaced by shadow and fear, but became clearer, /realer/, and part of a pattern. Faces he saw in two parts: the part that was presented, and, behind it yet just as visible, the state of mind that made it likely.

/Exploitable./

The Ring did wonderful things for his vocabulary.

“Frodo?” Gandalf was saying. “Frodo, can you hear me? Are you all right?”

A dying part of Frodo wanted to weep, and a growing part of him wanted to laugh, but that wouldn't do, wouldn't do at all. He needed to get out of this meeting with the Ring still on his finger. He looked at the dwarves and elves, and in an instant he conceived of half a dozen strategies to inflame their mutual suspicions and jealousies. It would be easy to turn this Council into a bloodbath...and amusing.

No. Sauron waited beyond the borders of Gondor, a more terrible enemy than any he faced here, but potential allies he had in the Council and the Wise. Even the Ring could not defeat Sauron alone. But with his strategies, the armies of Gondor could become invincible on the field...if he could get to Gondor with the Ring still on his finger.

“Frodo?” Gandalf spoke again. “What do you see with the Ring-sight? How can we Wise be saved from our folly?”

Frodo noticed the way the whole Council's attention turned on him. Surprisingly, Boromir did not look eager for Frodo's advice, though he had earlier called for the power of the Ring to be used against Sauron as it now was. Frodo was mildly surprised to learn that he could be surprised with the Ring on his finger, and he noted this fact, allowed it to seep through his mind and ripple through all the paths of action that came to his attention until the new realization was an already-calculated fact in every possibility.

They were still looking. Oh, right. They wanted his council, or rather, the Ring's. Well, it was an interesting question. How /could/ Sauron be defeated at this point? Something about asking the question swept away the visions of various tunnels through this conversation to endpoints where Frodo still had the ring on his finger, and replaced it with tunnels from here to the light at the end when Sauron withered and died, and his castles in Mordor fell, his armies obliterated. And what filled those tunnels...?

“Sauron's armies are great,” Frodo said. He noticed how Boromir's face changed, and subtle flickers in the eyes of the Elves,. Ah. They thought he was Sauron or Sauron's servant and so spoke flatteringly of Sauron's power. Mad fools. How had Sauron ever lost to foes such as these with the Ring on his finger?

“Great in number, though not in kind,” Frodo said loudly. “Through dark magic Sauron turns the flies and rats and orcs into his spies and soldiers. Though Sauron's devious strategy allows him to build a dozen armies each more numerous than all of Gondor's, the core of his army is treacherous and foolish. For the fly and the rat are still black and dumb, and what the orc touches is forever corroded. From the center outward Sauron's armies will disintegrate.”

So quickly did their suspicion and fear turn to hope! Even Boromir looked eager for Frodo's next words, and the Elves were suddenly calculating. Did they not remember wars with the orcs? Did they not recall that orcs were strong, fierce warriors, swift trackers, and true shots with their bow? If orc armies had an inherent propensity to fall apart from the center outward, then how had they ever driven Men out of their ancient kingdoms, fought a war with the Elves for centuries, contested with the Dwarves for their treasure? Somehow the Ring had found the words to wipe away the weight of their experience and history. The promise of success in an unanticipated manner...Frodo would remember its power.

“Sauron is building his forces rapidly and preparing soon to march on Gondor, as our friend Boromir has said, because of this weakness. Sauron must conquer and conquer swiftly.” And with that, even the last of Boromir's suspicion was wiped out, and all the Council was with him now that Sauron's actions seemed to confirm Frodo's analysis.

“Then we will defend Gondor from Sauron's assault,” Gandalf said. “Until Sauron's armies break apart and shatter.”

“The gates of Gondor will hold back Sauron's armies for as long as need be,” Boromir said, and Aragorn nodded his head, holding tightly his sword.

Frodo smiled---for the spell of binding had left him that---and he said, “I agree. No, I declare. It will be so. Gondor's armies, one led by Boromir and another by Aragorn and a third by Gandalf, will repel and defeat the Enemy's hordes. But recall that Sauron too knows of his weakness. Thus he masses his armies and prepares to sweep aside Gondor's defenses like a great wave. Even Gondor's power will not be enough. For they have the Ringwraiths and Sauron himself.”

“What of them?” Gandalf said sharply. Was he wondering if Frodo could sense them somehow?

“The Ring-sight is exceptional at noticing patterns,” Frodo said. “One such pattern I have noticed with the Ring on my finger is that its effects are not entirely lost once the Ring is removed.”

Bilbo nodded jerkily. “Yes---I remember. A part of the sight lingers.”

/Thank you, Bilbo/. Frodo continued. “The Ringwraiths have all been touched by the Ring's power. Sauron himself has worn it for many years. Undoubtedly they see with a part of its sight even after all this time. If so, their strategies and tactical prowess will be beyond anything Gondor is prepared for, beyond anything the world has seen since the last wars with the Ring-forger.”

“Men have learned a thing or two since those days,” Aragorn said mildly.

“Elves have their own rings,” Elrond murmured.

Frodo's ears twitched at that, but he pretended not to notice. “Forgive me if I am too blunt, but the Enemy many years after losing the Ring was still able to maneuver this Council into sending the Ring into his lands with only a small guard. On the battlefield, his armies will move like lightning, strike from every direction, disappear like smoke and reappear behind you in an inferno of slaughter. If we underestimate him, we will perish.”
