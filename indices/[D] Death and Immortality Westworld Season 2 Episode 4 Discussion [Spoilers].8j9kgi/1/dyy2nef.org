1) I don't think this belongs here. It isn't rational, it doesn't belong on [[/r/rational]].

The AI are just people. There's nothing to explore about Hosts regarding their artificial intelligence, they're just people with usb dongles for brains. What Westworld *is* is an analysis of what it means to be human. Are we still human if our fathers are assigned to us at the start of the month? What if fate is deterministic?

2) I don't know why you and others are confused about guns. They were clearly said to have been reprogrammed at the end of season 1. It's frustrating see dozens of comments every week about them like they're a huge mystery.

It's up to the mods whether this stays but ultimately it would muddle the value of the subreddit. Just my opinion tho.
