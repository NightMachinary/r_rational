It's a discussion of fiction with interesting themes relevant to the community. We can make the discussion rationalist by critiquing the show with rational criteria. Anyway, it's a gray area, so the mods can decide. I don't see how this is different than when CGP Grey's and Kurzgesagt's anti death videos were posted here. Those weren't rational fiction.

The programming explanation seems right but is unsatisfying to me because it is a hand-wave. I was wondering if someone could come up with a “rationalized” explanation. For example, what happens if you shoot at a guest through a wall? How does the gun know not to use a real bullet?
