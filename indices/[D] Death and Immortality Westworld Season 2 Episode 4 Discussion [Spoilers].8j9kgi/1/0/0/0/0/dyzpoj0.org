Nah man, I love westworld and would shoot the shit with you about it any time... just not any place - this isn't the place for it.

I mean this in the kindest possible way but you're not super clear on the definition of rational fiction or rationalist fiction, because you've been using the terms interchangeably, and more importantly, using it in the context of a show that it just doesn't apply to: Westworld is meant to be viewed through the lens of creation and meaning and a bunch of subjective features.

What I *would* love is a rational fiction set in westworld's universe where the Hosts become rational and bloodthirsty to defend their own rights to live, or Arnold's creation a race of sentient robots and growing them responsibly into a race that caters to humans instead of being raped and killed for sport.

At the end of the day, actions taken in the world are simply because the plot requires it - it is unreasonable to apply the rules of the world on what might happen in future because they're so easily disposed of in this show, the transhumanism is just alternative humanism.
