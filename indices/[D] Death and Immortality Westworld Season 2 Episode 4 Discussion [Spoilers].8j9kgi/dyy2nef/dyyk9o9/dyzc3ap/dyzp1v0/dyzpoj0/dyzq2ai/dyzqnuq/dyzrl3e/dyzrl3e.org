Not gonna actually try it, but...

"Rationalizing Westworld: Season 2 Episode 4 Discussion"

"You've been teleported into Man in Black's body, and now you've got to decide whether to continue the questionably ethical immortality experiment that Original Man in Black started. What do you do?"

"You're Robert Ford and you have decided to create Westworld. How do you design the guns so that they work normally most of the time but don't hurt the guests?"

"You're an AI researcher working for Westworld, and your job is to program the hosts to follow their narratives while allowing them to improvise. What sorts of design tradeoffs do you make here? What are the high level technical details (asking for a TOOOOTALLY RATIONAL worldbuilding exercise that I'm doing)."

Seriously though, every post is different from every other post. I know that posts like this can work if framed correctly. I think it's a combination of people being sick of these particular discussion topics (covered by the Kursgesagt video and CGP grey video threads) plus not everyone watching Westworld plus some people not wanting spoilers plus the perception problem that you've described. Anyway, it's fine, this post was experimental.
