Governments already have democratically elected roles and the democratic party sort of vetoed Sanders. An extremely ethical nonprofit organization with a very strong filter does indeed sound good, the question is just how that would even look.

I too would prefer to prevent that. That scenario is pretty different than just an immortality scenario.

I'm not seeing any fail sure way of preventing it, though you could lower the chance by putting in barriers. Easier ones would be requiring background checks before making simulations and the simulations to be accessible online so they could be monitored. If you want to go all out transhumanist you could alter the DNA of all humans to not have the urge to do stuff like that.
