  Yeah, this is a problem. Governments can help, but those too are corruptible. I think the onus will fall on the inventor of the technology to introduce it in a responsible way without being unduly swayed by money.

How exactly would an inventor manage that? Putting the question aside about how they'd get enough funding for such a project or how to distribute it without a way of rich folks to reverse engineering it, how exactly would you consider it a responsible way of distribution?

  The problem is that an enforcement system can't get every bad person, and it can't really prevent bad people from performing a crime for the first time. Ideally there would be no crime because no one would even want to commit crime in the first place. It's unclear how to implement this without being a terrible totalitarian mind-control society.

That is already the case. I'm not seeing how immortality makes this any different. If anything resurrecting people by reuploading makes some of the harsher crimes less horrible.

  Excellent point, though in the case of Delos, every time they resurrected him his memories were wiped, and the copies were too unstable to process their situation before degrading. I think for this to be any kind of ethical the original test subject should be a terminal cancer patient put through extensive mental prep before the copies are made, with a contract outlining clear stopping conditions.

I'd say that anyone could sign up to be volunteer although you're probably get more old people or terminally ill people. If Delos knew that then he'd be ok with a number of copies of him being killed off in the process. If not you could tell inform him that a certain number of copies have been killed off when a new copy is started.
