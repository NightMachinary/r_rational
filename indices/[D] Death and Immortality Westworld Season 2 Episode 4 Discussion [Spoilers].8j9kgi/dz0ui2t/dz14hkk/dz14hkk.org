  the exploration of whether robots can be concious/sentient or not
#+end_quote

In the context of Westworld, the question isn't whether they /can/ be sentient so much as whether they /are/ sentient. I don't want to spoil season 1 for you too much, but my interpretation of the show was that none of the robots were technically conscious until the end of the season - and still in season 2, not all of them are yet. The robots were originally programmed to closely follow "narratives," even having some of their direct dialogue preprogrammed.

  If immortality were invented today I don't think you could feasibly keep it from the rich and powerful

Yeah, this is a problem. Governments can help, but those too are corruptible. I think the onus will fall on the inventor of the technology to introduce it in a responsible way without being unduly swayed by money.

  presumably there would be laws in place to punish people or remove people who caused nonconsensual pain
#+end_quote

The problem is that an enforcement system can't get every bad person, and it can't really prevent bad people from performing a crime for the first time. Ideally there would be no crime because no one would even want to commit crime in the first place. It's unclear how to implement this without being a terrible totalitarian mind-control society.

  you should always be able to retract your consent at some point during the experiments

Excellent point, though in the case of Delos, every time they resurrected him his memories were wiped, and the copies were too unstable to process their situation before degrading. I think for this to be any kind of ethical the original test subject should be a terminal cancer patient put through extensive mental prep before the copies are made, with a contract outlining clear stopping conditions.
