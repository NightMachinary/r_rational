  How exactly would an inventor manage that?
#+end_quote

No idea - somehow create an extremely ethical nonprofit organization with a very strong filter on who gets appointed to leadership roles (such as democratically elected roles, but the organization can veto candidates who don't meet their ethical standards, and also requires elected candidates to give up all other enterprises when joining). Another vision I had in my head was that immortality tech goes hand-in-hand with AGI, so the inventor can create a perfectly value-aligned friendly AI and let that thing decide. But that's a whole different, and far more difficult, problem. I'm just spitballing here.

  That is already the case

Yes, but ideally I'd like it not to be the case. One single immortal psychopath has plenty of time and resources to create his own little virtual hell and populate it with billions of conscious sims. I'd rather prevent that possibility outright than try to enforce it externally.
