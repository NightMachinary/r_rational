I liked the story. I'm not sure what your reasons for struggle were, so most of this might be tangential.

The summary at the beginning read easily, especially considering it was explaining a complicated idea. It's really good. That's too bad, because I'm going to recommend you consider putting everything it explained in other parts of the story, so that the reader has to infer the setting. Trying to figure out what's going on is a natural source of enjoyment.

It struck me as weird that the supernatural beings left after agriculture but before science. That would be like leaving a baseball game after the first pitch is thrown but before it's been hit. I'm trying to think of a distraction that would cause them to leave (another sentient race that one of them uplifted when he was bored of humans?) or another justification for a mass departure. Maybe their leader said "I'm bored!" and left, and it took the rest of them a few thousand years to realize they didn't have to actually do everything the leader told them? And how did they decide to come back... maybe a few die-hard fans finally decided to let the rest know that interesting things were happening? Hmmm.

As for "thinky" stuff...

I frame a lot of things as conversations. That has the benefit of forcing complicated ideas to be explained in a conversational way--if you want to write something "thinky", you can have one character think and explain it to another. I'm imagining a new employee at the god-manipulating stock firm who has to have details of the gods explained to him. He can raise any obvious philosophical points, for his senior to explain in more detail. That's just one possibility. It's going to be a lot easier to explain things about the gods with human-to-human conversations than god-to-human conversations, or uploaded-to-god conversations.

If you have difficulty writing a natural-sounding conversation about philosophy, you might try engaging one of your friends in a conversation about philosophy and use it as material. That's worked for me.

I'm sorry I can't help more. I thought the writing was good and I'd read more stories from this setting if you chose to write them.
