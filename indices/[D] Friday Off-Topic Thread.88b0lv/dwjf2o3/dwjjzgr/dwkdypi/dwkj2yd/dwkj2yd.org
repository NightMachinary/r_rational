I didn't set up my metaphor very well.

More like millions of years. Human beings stopped "living in trees" with Australopithecus around 3.6 million years ago. Agriculture probably started with rice, 13,500 years ago at the earliest. That's a ratio of 266. A pitch takes .4 seconds to reach the home plate: so I imagine someone watching a bunch of humans on a field for about two minutes with interest, then teleporting away the moment no humans are holding a ball. Except it's a whole stadium of watchers. The timing is unlikely, and indeed it would be weird if someone happened to leave the baseball game just before things got interesting.
