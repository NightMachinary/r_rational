A few weeks ago, I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zoo8l/d_friday_offtopic_thread/duqvy3i/][this]] in a friday thread. tl;dr it's a pitch about a setting where immortals decide to return because they find the singularity interesting. [[/u/trekie140]] posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zoo8l/d_friday_offtopic_thread/durcriq/][this]] comment about how such a setting could be used to explore some interesting philosophical topics, and [[/u/eaturbrainz]] challenged me to write using that prompt.

It didn't turn out so well, for a variety of reasons.

Can I get some constructive criticism on the writing, and any advice people have for writing “thinky” stuff? It turns out, philosophy was further out of my wheelhouse than I'd guessed. Feel free to be as brutal as necessary.
