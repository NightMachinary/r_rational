I've been rereading a lot of fantasy books, with supernatural societies using their abilities left and right in secret, and it got me thinking: how much mass can you create out of nothing before NASA notices their rocket equations are going wrong? I mean, it would take a lot before gravity changes noticeably, but every bit more gravity is a bit more speed needed to hit escape velocity, and that extra speed requirement /exponentially/ increases the amount of rocket fuel that is needed to push a rocket into space, if I understand rocket science correctly (I probably don't). Anyone more familiar with rocket science able to put some numbers on this?
