  Can I get some constructive criticism on the writing, and any advice people have for writing “thinky” stuff? It turns out, philosophy was further out of my wheelhouse than I'd guessed. Feel free to be as brutal as necessary.

You accidentally wrote comedy while trying to write something philosophically serious. The basic trope to play off for drama is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment][Romanticism versus Enlightenment]] here, but you've kinda degraded both sides into parody versions of themselves: the war god who's fooled by the "supplications" of bored employees and semi-sapient AIs, and, well, bored employees forking copies of themselves to deal with boring work in a world that, according to your reader's pre-baked expectations, shouldn't have much scarcity or boring work at all.

More so, in relation to the original post: if we're talking about a world in which the reappearance of gods and magic was /jarring/, who's jarred? Samantha's not: she's /bored/. The war god is, apparently, too mentally primitive to be all that significant in the post-singularity corporate world, so where's the actual conflict? Where's the sandpaper scratching on the souls of your posthuman whatevers and AIs as they confront the profundities and ancient powers of mythology?
