First of all, chapter 1 is perfect. Opening of Hamilton perfect. You could not have explained this premise in a better way and that last line had me hyped to see what you did next with this idea. Where you faltered is that you didn't seem to decide whether this would be a world-shaking mystery like Arrival or a anthology of short stories like old sci-fi satires.

Chapter 2 sounds like a scene from a story about first contact, but it skips over the buildup to the encounter and doesn't establish a goal the protagonist is after. The thing I was most interested in hearing about was the immortal, but you instead focus on explaining how transhumans work. The story of how Samatha was chosen to do this is a great way to present that, but there's nothing to establish why she's meeting Bob and what she wants from it. Consider opening with pulling the straw and then her going over the plan because she's anxious.

Chapter 3, on the other hand, is about how the immortals are being integrated into human society. It's definitely interesting, arguably more so than Chapter 2, but it's basically a vignette from a person's life in a strange world that we want to learn about. This is a completely different kind of story from what Chapter 2 seemed to be going for and it leaves us hanging by not exploring the consequences of the event or revealing more about the immortals.

Both ideas are great ones for stories, I had originally thought the former was the best way to go but now I think the latter might be a better choice. If you didn't have a specific theme you want to teach the audience, like Arrival did about communication, then it's fine to just present some cool ideas in short stories about this world and the people in it for us to think about.

I think you should also hammer out precisely what the immortals /do/ in this world and why. One possibility is that humanity lives in a simulation that the immortals got bored of interacting with, but have now returned to see what's new and recapture the fun they once had. It could be like a new expansion pack for an old video game, or commentary on nostalgia if you want to do that. That's just a random idea I haven't thought through the implications of, though, so you can do whatever you'd like.
