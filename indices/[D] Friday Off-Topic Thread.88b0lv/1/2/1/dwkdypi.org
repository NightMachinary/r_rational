  That would be like leaving a baseball game after the first pitch is thrown but before it's been hit.

This analogy works from a hindsight perspective, where we can see how agriculture enabled humanity to have enough extra time and resources to develop science which lead to all sorts of interesting stuff, but to an immortal who has spent thousands of years not seeing science, how would they predict that it would become more interesting? If the immortals have traditional values such as honor and strength, then they probably enjoyed watching humans roam and hunt animals, and once they start settling down as farmers they become weaklings who sit around watching plants grow and are no longer interesting to spectate.
