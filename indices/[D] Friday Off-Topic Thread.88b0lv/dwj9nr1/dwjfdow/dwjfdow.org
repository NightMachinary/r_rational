  It's my opinion that either all the stories on the list should have ""warnings"" or none of them should.

The suggestion of fairness is an ideal that we should aim for, but isn't practical here. After all, to fairly add warnings to all the stories on the list, an editor would naturally have to read /all/ the stories on the list. Effectively, you would be saying that people cannot add content warnings unless they first invest hundreds of hours of time reading all the stories, even the ones they doesn't like.

Perhaps an alternative approach would work: add content warnings to all the stories, but leave them blank or with some kind of "todo" marking. That way editors who have read the stories can fill in the blanks, and blank warnings for stories would mean "unknown content" as opposed to "safe content".
