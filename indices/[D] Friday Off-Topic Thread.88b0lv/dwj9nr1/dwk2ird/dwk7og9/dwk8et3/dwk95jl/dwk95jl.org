  rolling my eyes in disdain for a person too squeamish for textual depictions of child rape*

  rolling my eyes in disgust for a government that doesn't care about frozen peaches**

*This is the pot calling the kettle black, unfortunately, since I myself, to my intense annoyance, avert my eyes from reading depictions of M/M intercourse.

**This was a minor maymay a few years back: =free speech= = =muh freeze peach= = =frozen peaches=. I haven't seen anyone else use it recently, but I still like it.
