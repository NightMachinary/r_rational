I'm not joking, text depicting sexual actions of minors is defined as child pornography in Australia - here's a newspaper article about someone who was imprisoned for writing such stories: [[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-14/man-jailed-for-depraved-texts-about-young-children/6391718]]

If the acts you're describing happen between bodies of child age or appearance, then consensual or otherwise, they're illegal in my country. (I believe we also have laws that say that adult actresses can't depict children in pornography, for example).

I don't know if anyone's been prosecuted for /reading/ such material, but still. (And yes, I do use a VPN)
