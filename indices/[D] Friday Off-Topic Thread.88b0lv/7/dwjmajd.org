Has anyone read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35018907-semiosis][Semiosis]] by Sue Burke? It's not perfectly rational, but it's a fascinating story regardless. It contains perhaps the best viewpoint description of alien thought I've ever heard, although I wonder if my perception was affected by the quality of the audiobook.
