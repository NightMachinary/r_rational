It's a shitty move from the boss. I guess the question here is, what benefit do you get from not sending in the sick note, and what costs are associated with that, and is the benefit worth the cost?

Generally speaking, in situations like this where there is nothing directly to gain from proving to your boss that you're technically right, I keep my head down. This is not because I think my boss would take it badly, but because there's no real benefit to it, I get over the annoyance quickly, and it could have a negative impact on me.
