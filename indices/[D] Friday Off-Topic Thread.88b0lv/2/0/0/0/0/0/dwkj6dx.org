Ugh, yeah, that sucks a lot : /

I think "I'm confused why you're telling me that" still comes off as passive-aggressive. The simplest answer I imagine him giving is "I was just reminding you. What's the big deal?"

I would recommend something a bit more honest and vulnerable, like

"I know you're just reminding me because you want to make sure I follow the rules, but please extend a bit more trust to me on issues like this. You may not realize how it comes off, but after seven years of working here, being reminded of things like this can feel demeaning, and I'm sure that is not your intention."

But if you don't think he would change any behavior from that, it might be better to just let it go.
