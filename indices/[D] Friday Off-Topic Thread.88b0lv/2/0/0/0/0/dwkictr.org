Oh no, he's pretty terrible in general. Example: with my two previous managers, procurement documents were read within a business day, and within a week in exceptional circumstances. Now these same documents take three weeks to be read. And I don't mean 20 page reports: these are one, maybe two pages, and very routine.

I've complained to his manager (as has /everyone else on the team/ except for the 60 year old Sri Lankan man who dgaf). I once had a minor breakdown (crying and everything) at work over the stress I was under working with him, but that's improved a lot now I no longer sit in the desk /immediately next to him/.

Government means there's nothing that can be done in terms of getting him fired or demoted, unfortunately.

He has improved slightly in small ways when these things are brought up to /his/ manager.

I like the idea of being a little less passive-aggressive in the email. Maybe something more honest like:

"I'm confused why you're telling me that. Of course I know the corporate policy is to get a sick note after three consecutive days of leave. It makes me feel as though you don't trust my knowledge of the policy when you give me unnecessary reminders like this."

And said with words rather than over email where there's a record of it.

Ugh, corporate life, amirite?
