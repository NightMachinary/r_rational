Realistically, the message I want to send is,

"I've been working here for 7 years. I am well aware of the sick note requirements thankyouverymuch."

I think the ask a manager blog would tell me to phrase it like this:

"I'm confused why you're telling me that. Of course I know the corporate policy is to get a sick note after three consecutive days of leave. Did I do something to make you feel as though I don't understand the sick leave policies?"

The issue is more, my manager seems to think I don't know how to do my job: I've got emails from him where he lays out in excruciating detail each step of a process I have been doing every month for the last four years. He makes basic annotations on my reports (on printed copies in red pen because he doesn't know how to use track changes in word), with things like "are you sure this is the right thing to do?" and I just want to scream at him, "of course that's what I think, this entire 20 page report is justifying why I think it's the right thing to do, can you read the fucking report?". He's always giving me instructions as though it's my first week, and it shits me. He's apparently like that with everyone, so it's not an age or gender thing (thank god), but it still feeds my imposter syndrome.
