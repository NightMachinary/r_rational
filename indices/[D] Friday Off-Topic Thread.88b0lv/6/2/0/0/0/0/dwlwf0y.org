  Really, what's the difference?

It stops being a conversation only about the readers' notions about what should and should not be considered [1:] sex with minors (e.g. because of the characters' subjective ages due to the looping) and [2:] child rape (e.g. Sakura having sex with Naruto as a reward), because it is no longer implied --- in the context of the discusion --- that the placement of the warning was justified for the sake of the general audience's preferences, “common sense”, etc.

Instead, the information regarding the legal definitions of [1] and [2] are added as a factor to the discussion. So now it doesn't much matter how well someone manages to defend the position that Scene A wasn't depicting children (e.g. because Sakura was subjectively over ~100 years old by that point) or that Scene B wasn't depicting rape (e.g. because all the participating parties have been shown to give their consent) --- because in the eyes of Australian (and British, etc) law it /is/ child porn because they look like children, it /is/ child rape because children have no right to consent to sex, and possession of both entails rather severe punishments --- even if all the “children” in the “child pornography” are fictional characters.

TVTropes has outright removed that story's page from its catalogue, and with the way reddit's been developing recently, I expect the chilling effect to shatter the references to that story on this (and other) sub's wikies as well, sooner or later.
