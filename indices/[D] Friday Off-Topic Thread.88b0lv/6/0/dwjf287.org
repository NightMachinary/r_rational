I think this is one of the cases where idealism has to give way to pragmatism. Ideally, we wouldn't self-censor. But pragmatically, the point of a recommended reading list is to recommend works. If a reader tries to read Time Braid blind and gets majorly turned off by some of the more objectionable elements, then it's likely that they'll trust the recommendation list less, and avoid reading the other works simply because of their association with Time Braid.
