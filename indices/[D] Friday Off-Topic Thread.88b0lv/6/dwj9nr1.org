I recently had occasion to roll my eyes at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index?v=a9b19216-22c3-11e7-ac72-128763c683de&v2=e55ccc9a-684b-11e7-8481-0e1e02ebdfd0][an edit]] that someone had made to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][the wiki's list of recommended stories]]:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] (Content warning: Contains child rape, torture, mind rape)
#+end_quote

It's my opinion that either /all/ the stories on the list should have ""warnings"" or /none/ of them should. (Doesn't the list contain /several/ other stories that depict torture and mind rape in graphic terms?) However, out of an abundance of +respect+ +caution+ cowardice, I took it upon myself to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index?v=02b9f006-7b11-11e7-beac-0e38c7f6c7fa&v2=08538c00-24aa-11e8-9bf5-0e044fc19876][delete]] only the =child rape= portion of the ""warning"", since, IIRC, it's false. (On the other hand, of course, my most recent (sixth) reading of /Time Braid/ occurred /at least/ a year ago, and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/54bz8l/q_recommendations_similar_to_mother_of_learning/d80l4s8/?context=9][I've accidentally made false claims about the story in the past]].)
