So, I had the flu this week, and I emailed my boss on Tuesday to let him know that I'd just been to the doctor and the doctor had told me to stay home the rest of the week.

He responded with the usual get well soon, and then said, "a gentle reminder" to get a medical certificate.

This shits me, because this guy is completely anal about sick leave for some weird reason (we have 12 days sick time a year FWIW). I've been working there for 7 years now and I am /intimately/ familiar with the sick leave policy because I've read the documents that outline it: so intimately familiar, that I know that due to a particular confluence of events, I /don't/ actually need a sick note for last week.

I do /have/ one though, because if you're going to the doctor anyway there's never a downside to getting a note written.

I'm like, should I sass him back when I get back to the office and be all, "Actually according to 12.4.6 of the EBA, blah blah blah" - or should I just put my damn head down and give him the sick note even though he doesn't need it?

He's asked for sick notes from coworkers that are in /unambiguously/ non-sick-note-requiring territory before, and they haven't provided them AFAIK, but my sick note situation is more ambiguous.

geez this is like the longest post ever and it's just me whining!!!!

since it's already long, sick note policy is that you need a sick note if you take three consecutive sick days. i had wednesday booked as a day off, so I only took Monday/Tuesday and Thursday as sick days, so I didn't get three consecutive /sick days/, even though I was absent from work for four consecutive days. (And you can't turn pre-booked "days off" into sick days because you were sick on them except in very specific circumstances, but I could potentially use this situation to turn my day off into a sick day, which would be niice as they come out of seperate "accounts").
