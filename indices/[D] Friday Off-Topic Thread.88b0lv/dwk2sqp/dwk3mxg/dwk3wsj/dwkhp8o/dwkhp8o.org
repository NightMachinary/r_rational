Honestly this just sounds like the kind of manager who is constantly trying to cover their ass and be super on-top-of-things. Are they otherwise a good manager? If so, I'd let it go. If not, then maybe it's worth having a frank conversation with them about this, rather than doing it pseudo-passive-aggressively?
