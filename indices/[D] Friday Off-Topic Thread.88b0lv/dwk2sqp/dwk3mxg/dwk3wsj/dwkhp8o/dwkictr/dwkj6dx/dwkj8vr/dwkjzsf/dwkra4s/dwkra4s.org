He literally sits in the same cubicles we sit in (I just moved two cubicles over after it became clear to my grandboss that sitting next to him wasn't working for me), but he communicates with us over email 99% of the time. So I think I will send an email saying more or less what you said, when I get back in. I think he'll be away for Easter so someone else will be doing his job (.... the guy who sits next to me now actually, but he's Cool), and that way I will get away without submitting that sick note (MUA HA HA HA HA, completely irrelevant victories), but can send him the email and it'll be in the pile of emails he ploughs through after getting back from leave.

More random ranting about my boss: at one point I was begging him for more projects to work on, at the same time as he was saying how we needed more people to handle our huge workload and also saying that he thought I had /too many/ projects (I had 6; the average person in the area has 8).

And he bitches about how projects are late but I've had to add 3 weeks into the gantt chart when there were /never/ those three weeks there /because he takes so damn long to approve the one page tick and flick procurement docs/. I am going to lose my shit.

The worst part is, I like what I /do/, and I don't want to move for the foreseeable future, because it's a damn cushy job.

*breathes into paper bag* I get three months of paid leave put into my account in June, I'm gonna take that at half pay in the second half of 2019 and gallivant around Europe for a bit. And then probably find somewhere else to work / keep working at the same place but pop out a few kids on their maternity program and then work somewhere else. By which point Evil Boss will have retired anyway so I'll probably just work for the same government department for 40 years the way some people do. But I'm cool with that. It's /traffic/!
