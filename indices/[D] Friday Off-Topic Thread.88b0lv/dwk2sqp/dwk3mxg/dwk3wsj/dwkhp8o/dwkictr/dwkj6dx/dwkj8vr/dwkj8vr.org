If I go too vulnerable, I will start crying (ugggggh), but that's a good general way to go.

I think, in his mind, he's being charming and fatherly. (He tried to give me some personal advice when I hadn't asked for any, and I told him that was unwelcome, and he said something like "I'm just saying to you what I'd say to my daughters").

Maybe especially demeaning for me. I dno.
