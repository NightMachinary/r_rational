What are some good ways to improve your rationality? I'm thinking of making a daily rationality challenge for myself, but I'm not sure how to implement it. Or better yet: I'm not sure how to map the territory.

Let's do simple prioritising for now. The "fundamental question of rationality": How do I know what I know? Is there a way to determine my current level? After reading /Thinking, Fast and Slow/ my guess would be taking 1000 rationality challenges, nealy split into a difficulty range from 1-10, and notice when things get difficult.

Now is the /real/ test though: I think this "solution" is rather bland, and somewhat textbook. So I'm asking [[/r/rational]] what I could possibly miss. And while you're at, good rationality exercises?
