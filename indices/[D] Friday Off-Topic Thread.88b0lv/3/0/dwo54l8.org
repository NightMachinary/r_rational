If you're looking for a fun way to practice making probabilistic judgements and getting immediate feedback on if they're true or not, the Future of Humanity Institute have just released a tool for doing this on simple Fermi estimation tasks and determining veracity of news statements. [[https://thinkagain.ought.org/][Check it out here]]

Another website that's useful for being graded on your judgements is metaculus, which has more sparse and carefully curated questions. However the feedback is more on the scale of months there.

You could also try putting a rationality technique into a randomised flashcard deck and every day pulling one out and making a goal to use that technique that day.
