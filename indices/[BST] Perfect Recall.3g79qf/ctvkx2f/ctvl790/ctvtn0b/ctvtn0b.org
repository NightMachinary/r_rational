Well, it depends on how you define perfect recall. The human eye is actually pretty lousy, outside of a handful of degrees of arc at the very center of your vision, detail drops quickly, that's why you have to move your eyes across a page when reading.

If you got a few 144hz monitors, and made a simple program to flash a different image 144 times a second, you could theoretically compress a textbook into "human readable" format into a second, but that won't be much good if you can only remember a fraction of each page.

Using a more reliable sensory input seems like it could be the way to go, setting up a system to compress data into tones or taps which actually get the entire signal to the brain, followed by learning the way to translate it all from noise to readable information.
