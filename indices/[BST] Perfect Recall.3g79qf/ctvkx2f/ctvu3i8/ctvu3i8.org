So basically you'd try to do the Lilu fifth element info binge using visual media only. Why not add in the matching text-to-speech audio component on ultra-fast-forward too? While we're at it, you get ten minutes of Braille info that provides an indexing function to help you figure out which part of your memory to "zip to" when you need it.

It's good to pick physics and mathematics since other types of knowledge are at higher risk for becoming out of date or just plain obsolete.

You should also eat your favorite foods, assuming that you can sneak them into the library.
