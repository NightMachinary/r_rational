We can pick up the Randi Prize with this, for one. ~24 fps * 600 s is ~15000 frames. I estimate 10 - 100 pages of text that a monitor setup can present per frame, making for ~1500 books of 100-1000 pages. Our marginal advantage is in accessing this information without the delay and bandwidth introduced by just accessing the smartphone we could instead.
