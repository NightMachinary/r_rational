For all intents and purposes, you gave me a video camera with ten seconds of film. It's not particularly useful.

Edit: Although I guess the fact that nobody else can see it can be useful. I use it to look at my private and public keys. Although I'd still need to type the private key somewhere to use it. I can't do math on that scale in my head.
