Skimming through the first chapter of Snake Report it looked like a "transported to an RPG world as a weak snake then starts getting stronger" sort of story. If you're looking for more of that than Kumo desu ga, nani ka? (I'm A Spider, So What?) is literally that but as a spider instead of a snake.

Translation quality and how far along it is varies a bit.

I've also been enjoying another "transported to RPG world" story called The Wandering Inn, where the protagonist ends up taking the Innkeeper class and starts trying to just get by.
