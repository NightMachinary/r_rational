MoL is a member of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop][groundhog's day loop]] subgenre. Check out [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu][Re:Zero]], [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi][ERASED]] (AKA boku dake ga Inai Mache), and [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/][Edge of Tommorrow]] (also known as "All you need is kill") for non-fanfic examples. Also check out the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue][peggy sue]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][groundhog peggy sue]] pages for when the time loop is on a significantly larger scale. For some reason I can't find a whole lot of non-fanfic examples (I've probably just forgotten stuff I read a long time ago) but there are /oodles/ of fanfic with that premise.

Are you willing to read MLP:FiM fanfiction? I have a bunch of excellent completed fics to recommend for groundhog's day loops. If you like naruto, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] and Chuunin exam day of the top of my head for loops, though they come with caveats: Time Braid is rather overty sexual, and Chuunin exam day is pure tripe written by an author I hate (so I only mention it because of its popularity.) Naruto also has incredibly amounts of peggy sue fics, but they tend to be either fairly blatant wish fulfilment or incomplete. I know for a fact that harry potter has tons of both peggy sue and time loop fics, but I don't really read that fandom much. Worm has a bunch of peggy sue fics, but they're all (or almost all) incomplete.

--------------

On the other hand, Hero's War is an "uplift" fic. The only non-fanfic example I can think of off the top of my head is [[https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GASFDA/ref=series_rw_dp_sw][Light on Shattered Water]] which I'm about halfway through. Aside from that, check [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/][spacebattles]] for ASOIAF SIs: they almost all tend to be of this variety. Again, I also have a bunch of MLP:FiM fics with similar premises.

For sort-of-similar works, check out [[http://archives.erfworld.com/Book%201/1][Erfworld]] and [[https://smile.amazon.com/Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-War-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74?sa-no-redirect=1][Two Year Emperor]] for modern-person-gets-put-in-charge-of-fantasy-land fiction.

Spacebattles really likes both of these kinds of fics, so you may have more luck posting a thread there.
