Wuxia/xianxia (chinese martial arts/chinese high fantasy)/litRPG (setting is a game world or game-like fantasy world/) and maybe also isekai (portal fantasy). (I haven't acutally looked at your link, I can tell just from the website name,). Do note that [[/r/rational]] as a whole isn't really a fan of these genres, although you will find some overlap. Try royalroadl for western-written xianxia, isekai, and litRPGs.

Mother of Learning/A Hero's War are the fics posted here that have the most overlap with those genres.
