So I had a massive writeup with links and wordcounts and everything, but then chrome ate too much of my RAM and crashed. feelsbadman.jpg.

I've added an ampersand after the very bet works.

Here's a mostly unordered list:

Time loops:

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] (has two complete non-looping sequels.) COMPLETE *&*
- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]] (AU with multiple loopers (and vector clocks ([[https://github.com/RampantArcana/Hard-Reset-2-Helper][and it's own github page to keep track of everything]]))). DEAD *&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&* (seriously just read this one, even though it's dead)
- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever][The Best Night Ever]] (has one incomplete non-looping sequel.) COMPLETE *&*

As for Uplift fics, the general consensus seems to be that ponies are somewhere around the industrial revolution already, so the equivalent isn't as blatant as in a Hero's War and ASOIAF fics. (Incidentally, the general consensus is wrong: ponies have cathode ray computers and video games, but whatever. Less advanced ponies make for better stories.) As a result, mostly I actually have first contact fics with more advanced humans. I think I had some more blatant uplift fics, but then unfollowed them because they got too blatantly wish-fullfilment-y for me.
