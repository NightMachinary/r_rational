As far as I'm concerned, "rational fiction" isn't a real thing. "Rationalist fiction" is a real thing, and works which attempt to emulate it by invoking its tropes are colloquially referred to as "rational fiction."

This animated short invokes the tropes. It's not rationalist, but it /is/ rational.
