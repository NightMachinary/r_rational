When judging sci fi or fantasy stories with impossible powers it's normal to rely on the nature of their tech. We know from this sci fi story that airlocks work to kill things, and they repeatedly use them to kill things.

That's a refreshing change from many sci fi stories, where they forget the powers of their ship when the next crisis comes along.

Likewise in real life, teleporting things into space isn't a reliable safety protocol, but in Star Trek teleportation is a known power, but they forget to use it to teleport invaders into vacuums. Stories that regularly use reliable solutions are appreciated. You can't claim Star Trek people are rational, because they forget a power they have when space aliens come to eat them.
