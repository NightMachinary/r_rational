I'm sorry, my last response was needlessly smarmy. In truth I just don't really want to have this conversation. I am entirely happy to agree to disagree here.

I think ultimately your argument is resting on the idea of "it worked therefore it's rational", but I'll note that this proves too much---you could use the same justification to claim almost any winning protagonist is rational, which is clearly false. I think it's fairly obvious that recommending a safety protocol of "if something goes wrong then throw it out the airlock" in real life would simply just not work, but I'm not going to justify that claim.
