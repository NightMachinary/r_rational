Why are you giving it straight 'No's? The main character has clear reasons to decide to implement intelligent solutions to their problems through creative application of their resources (IE, the airlock), as an explicit deconstruction of the low-effort sci-fi plots that might otherwise have ensued. An attentive watcher can probably figure out the solution to the climactic problem ahead of time, too.

I mean, yeah, there are a lot of precautions that realistically should have been taken, and events just happen to line up conveniently for the sake of a punchline. It's not a fully rational story. It's just a joke. But it's a joke about an intelligent way to respond to threats by non-intuitively expoiting the features of a particular exotic environment.
