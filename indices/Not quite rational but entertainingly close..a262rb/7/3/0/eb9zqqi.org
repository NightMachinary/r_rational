I think the key difference in our views is that whereas you think of airlocking the problems as a creative solution that other writers in this space overlooked, I think it's a strategy that doesn't make much sense, and wouldn't actually work as a method of assuring safety (/doesn't/ actually work in the last case) except for narrative handouts and idiot balls.
