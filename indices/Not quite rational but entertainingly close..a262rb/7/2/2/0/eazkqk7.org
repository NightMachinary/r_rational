You're right, people are perfectly allowed to be critical. I was just trying to answer their question of “why the downvotes”. I think people respond better when criticism is written with a tone of humor, but their post seems serious, especially when compared to the content of the op. You're right though, I shouldn't've suggested they act any differently, or at least done so in a more polite manner, sorry. But their post bothered me so I was a little heated, and I'm not apologizing for that
