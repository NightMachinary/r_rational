Obviously my personal beliefs about the qualities which qualify a work as "rational fiction" aren't quite as simple as that. General consensus seems to be that "rational fiction" is its own thing, with "rationalist fiction" as an offshoot of it; I believe the opposite, that "rationalist fiction" is its own thing and "rational fiction" is the offshoot. I just feel like that makes way more sense.

"Rationalist fiction" is hard to write because /showing/ "level 3 intelligence" is hard to pull off successfully, so "rational fiction" exists as an attempt at emulating "rationalist fiction" by invoking its related tropes and themes without having to do the hard part of /showing/ the viewpoint character thinking in a way which is /reproducible/ so that readers can imitate the character's thought processes in the real world and get /results/.
