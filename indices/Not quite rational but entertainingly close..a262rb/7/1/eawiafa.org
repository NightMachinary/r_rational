As far as I'm concerned, the current definition is irrelevant and the only criterion for qualifying as "rational fiction" is having a main character who reacts rationally, ie their reaction mirrors the way a real person would react in that situation as opposed to reacting in a way that allows the plot to happen. As far as I can tell, the main character of this short reacts rationally.
