I disagree with your viewpoint, but I understand that people read this fledgling genre for different reasons. It sounds to me like you'd be perfectly happy with a crime drama if the characters just behaved rationally, but to me the "MC is a rational agent" aspect is just one of many aspects of the genre, and isn't even a necessity.

After all, it's my understanding that Ra is generally accepted to be "rational fiction," but many events in the story are motivated by more human elements rather than pure rationality.
