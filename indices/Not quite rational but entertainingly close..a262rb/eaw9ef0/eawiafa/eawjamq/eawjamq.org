If you have an AI that outright says it is evil despite having not gained any sort of control at that point, and there is an eject button lying around that the character can use to instantly solve the problem, my impression is less that of a main character with Level 1 intelligence, and more that of a plot that exists solely for the main character to make a point. Similarly for "eject the whole crew" or "here's a dangerous alien I'm holding in my hands with no quarantine protocol". These are only coherent actions because the plot has set up implausible dichotomies that leave no real space for intelligent thought. Which is fine for a skit, but it's just not what rational fiction is about.
