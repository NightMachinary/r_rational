Throwing a machine out an airlock is not an intelligent solution to their problem. It's not something a real person would actually do (think of how much easier it would be to flip a hardwired power switch) and it's only in use to make a throwback to HAL, not actually because "In Space" is relevant to the threat model.

The main character's whole thing is about how you should respond to threats /in space/, but each of the risks we come across have threat models that have nothing to do with being in space, except that some idiot put said threat on a spaceship, and the proposed solution in each case (airlock it) is the kind of stupid solution you would only come up with if your goal is to relate back to space tropes.

Again, this is fine given what the video is trying to do. It's just that the video isn't rational fiction.
