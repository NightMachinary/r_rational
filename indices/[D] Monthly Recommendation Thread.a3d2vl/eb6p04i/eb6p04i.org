I am really into self-insert fanfiction but I kind of shot myself in the foot getting into this niche genre of fanfiction because self-insert fanfiction has all the irrational qualities that people in this subreddit strove to stay away from. Self-insert fanfiction has a frequent tendency to delve into wish-fulfillment, harems, fix-it gary stus and mary sues, highly irrational power ups, and my least favorite quality of them all, eclipsing the main character role from the original main character.

Does anyone have some self insert fanfiction to recommend that focuses on the realities of being cosmically kidnapped to a magically inclined foriegn universe? A focal point on survival and acquiring power to do so in a rational manner with the semi omniscient knowldege they have in the world they are in?
