It's a great cliffhanger to be honest, it leaves me craving for more without hating the writer a million times over. I've seen some that are just waaaaay worse (not necessarily in a bad way).

It's also been a while since i've read a novel with a MC that is smart but not inhumanly so and it's also a good person without getting annoyingly preachy or exceedingly stuborn about morals.

P.S.: Do you know of another fanfic similar to Lizard Brain? e.g. reincarnated SI with a really shitty childhood who refuses to be broken by the pains they are faced with.

I'm /bit/ tired of waiting for Lizard Brain to update again.
