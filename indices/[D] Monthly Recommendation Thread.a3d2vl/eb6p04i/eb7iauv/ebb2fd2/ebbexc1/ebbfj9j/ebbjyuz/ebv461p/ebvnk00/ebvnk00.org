Thank you for the recommendation! I actually got pretty far in that one but ultimately had to drop it because I got frustrated with the MC. The premise was an intelligent, deductive protagonist but she just kept failing me. :(

Edit: looks like I got 1/2 way through the last chapter. I should probably just finish it lol. There is that sequel though.
