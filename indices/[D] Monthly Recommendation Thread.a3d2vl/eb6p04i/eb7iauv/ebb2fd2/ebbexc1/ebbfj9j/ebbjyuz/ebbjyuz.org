Lizard Brain is pretty unique. I was quite excited to read that one. Here are some that mostly fit what you're asking for, to check out, at least:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7103346/1/Cleaning-no-Jutsu]] (not an SI)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8684118/16/Clockwork-and-a-Teacup]] I did drop this one but I can't remember why. I think the Inner Sakura thing turned me off

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369247/1/Triumphant-the-Dreamer]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11101458/1/Russian-Roulette-Reloaded]] I liked the premise of this, and I usually prefer slower novels but I dropped this one because it dragged too much and the science-y aspect that I was digging wasn't really developing. But the journey still might be fun for you, even if you too drop it

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10996503/3/Of-the-River-and-the-Sea]] I hesitate to recommend this one because the protagonist both does what you're looking for in terms of refusing to break, but she also does break, and hard. Also way too much angst.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12411007/1/This-Transient-Floating-World]] early days, yet but it seems like this might fit the bill (read to chapter 11)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11813418/chapters/26652618]] the protagonist in this one might be too passive for your tastes, and I eventually dropped it because the premise was an intelligent and deductive protagonist but that doesn't really happen... That said, I enjoyed it for the first few hundred thousand words and you might too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12433631/69/SHINOBI-The-RPG-Act-1]] his re-write makes for a decent story

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling]] (not SI)

[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/douluo-dalu/]] technically fits your criteria but like most tensei novels the fact the protagonist was reborn is basically pointless

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushoku_Tensei]] same as above, but childhood is easy

My ears are open to any recs you may have, too ðŸ˜Š
