so one obvious rec is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], which is highly popular around here.

realities of being cosmically kidnapped to a magically inclined foriegn universe - check

A focal point on survival and acquiring power to do so - check

semi omniscient knowldege they have in the world they are in - check

rational protagonists - check
