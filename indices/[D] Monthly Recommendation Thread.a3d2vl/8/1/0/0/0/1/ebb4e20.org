I just started getting into it. It's as the other responder says, and an enjoyable read with a decent understanding of midieval economic realities, but I find myself often annoyed at the MC for making vast assumptions about things that he has no good reason to think he knows.

I really hope he gets his comeuppance for that in later chapters.
