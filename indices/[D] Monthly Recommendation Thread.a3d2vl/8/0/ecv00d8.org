I recently read These Games We Play by Ryuugi, an RWBY/Gamer cross. I haven't watched RWBY at all, and I'm pretty sure that the majority of the worldbuilding and twists are non-canon compliant, so you won't be missing much. It's a really well-written power fantasy with a compelling plot and enemies that don't just let the protagonist walk over them, obstacles scaling with the main character's growth.

The unreasonably fast development of the protagonist's skills as well as the scaling of enemies are justified pretty well in-story, both because of the fundamental premise of RWBY and also other reasons that become revealed as you read on. The nature of the Gamer part of the story isn't handwaved away or presented as an OOC phenomenon---Ryuugi manages to explain everything seamlessly within the the setting.

I'm not sure it's rational, but it's close enough to count, given the inherently unphysical nature of the Gamer.
