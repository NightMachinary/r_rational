A Song of Ice and Fire(Game of Thrones) I think is the best possible answer, nearly every character is morally gray and it's an all around excellent series.

Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Vlog is good, it's only about an hour long and is free.

Code Geass is a classic anime that I think is pretty gray.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/87619/biblical-monsters]] is a 10 000 word MLP fanfic that I think would count. The only MLP knowledge you really need is that Celestia is a white pony who's the semi-divine Princess of the ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/242635/split-second][Split Second]] is another MLP fanfic that I think counts. It's been a while since I read it and I think it does require more MLP knowledge, so if you don't like MLP I wouldn't recommend it. But if you do like MLP it's pretty good.

The Witcher book series might work. I don't think the protagonist is that gray personally, but might be worth a shot.
