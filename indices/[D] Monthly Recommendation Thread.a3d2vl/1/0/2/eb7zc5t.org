  Have you tried The Prince of Nothing series? It seems to fit your requirements exactly. It was my favourite series for years, I actually got turned off of it because the sequel series was too grimdark, hah.

I tried reading this, but at least in the beginning the book seems to have a bad case of "tell, don't show" with regards to the main character. Everybody always tells you how charismatic Kellhus is supposed to be. The narration is really heavy handed about this point, without ever /showing/ the character doing anything compelling. Does this ever get better?
