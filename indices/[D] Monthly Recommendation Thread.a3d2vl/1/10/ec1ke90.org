Have you read anything by Joe Abercrombie?

Half A King is the first book in a trilogy that focuses on a viking-like world, and while I've yet to read the third book (I've got it for over Christmas) so far I've massively enjoyed it. It's dark, the main character is pretty villainous without being so bad that you stop rooting for him, the world is horrible, and the main character needs to be cunning because he can't match people physically.

The Blade Itself is... hard to summarise, but also sounds like the sort of thing you're after. One of the main characters is a crippled inquisitor, one is an arrogant born-to-rule swordsman, one is a not-all-there berserker, one is an ancient wizard whose powers are failing.
