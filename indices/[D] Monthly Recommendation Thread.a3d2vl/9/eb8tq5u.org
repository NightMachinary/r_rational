/Request/: Good comic books

I am looking for any good comic books as long as it is action/sci-fi/fantasy/superhero in some way. Not really looking for rational stories (doubt there is much out there) just ones that don't into the usual cliches and don't have dumb-when-it's-convenient characters. Basically stuff that [[/r/rational]] might like. But even trying to pick from what's considered the best my success rate is mixed.

What I've read so far (sry for the wall of text):

/Black Hammer/: Good characters and deconstruction of archetypes, will keep reading.

/The Sandman/: It's too much of a scatterbrain series with some good ideas and some more poor ones and it really tries not to have a main plot. I liked the Nada and Lucifer storylines but not much of the rest of the cast.

/Watchmen/: Liked it for all the usual reasons: great engaging plot, great characters and themes. Doubt there is much else like it.

/All Star Superman/: Overall a decent series but it has the reputation for being one of the best and "true to character" Superman stories so I ended up being underwhelmed.

/X-Men by Chris Claremont/: I read the Dark Phoenix Saga some years back and I wasn't impressed. Recently restarted from Uncanny X-Men #94 but I find it too cheesy. Is it worth continuing?

/X-Men Age of Apocalypse/: I quite liked the issues focused on Cyclops and the Four Horsemen but most other cross-overs were very poor quality (and there where a lot of them).

/New X-Men by Grant Morrison/: I really liked the characters of Emma Frost and Xorn but the U-Men and the new teens were so mediocre.

/Astonishing X-Men by Joss Whedon/: Absolutely great stuff in every way: characters, art, dialogue and a plot that's unpredictable but not off the charts crazy. Best X-Men story I've read /by far/.

/X-Men House of M/Messiah Complex/Second Coming/: House of M was good but the followup was a very average storyline that's forgettable. It seems to me I should avoid cross-overs.

/Uncanny X-Force by Rick Remender/: gorgeous art and a good team-up but the actual storylines were so-so. Ended up dropping it in the Otherworld arc which was terrible.

Some things I have problems with:

1. The villains are too often... cartoony and evil for evil's sake. I thought superhero comics are now aimed at an adult audience and were supposed to have better antagonists than MCU/DCEU?

2. Action seems too chaotic. Like if there are 5+ characters fighting I really lose focus of the action and it all seems a mess. Do I get better at reading action over time or what?
