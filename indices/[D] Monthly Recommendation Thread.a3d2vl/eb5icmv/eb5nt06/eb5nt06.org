Have you tried [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing][The Prince of Nothing series]]? It seems to fit your requirements exactly. It was my favourite series for years, I actually got turned off of it because the sequel series was /too grimdark/, hah.

I assume you know of [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/233453-the-books-of-the-north][The Chronicles of the Black Company]]? Their highest ideal is to fullfill their contract faithfully, regardless of how evil their employer is. Very groundbreaking for its time. The first two books especially seems to fit your requirement to a T. After that they vacillate between doing good and evil.

How about [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen][Malazan]]? It's an unmatched achievement in worldbuilding and it certainly qualifies as grimdark. It demonstrates how exquisite worldbuilding and a long running narrative can elevate storytelling immensely. It's truly unlike any other series before or since.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/64473-the-broken-empire][The Broken Empire]] series may also apply. Not my favourite(too edgy), but it has a lot of partisans, so maybe it's just me. The author has two other series which I liked better, but they are not as fitting.
