Malazan and Black Company are two books that tend to get disclaimer with their recommendations.

Black Company was a seminal book that inspired a lot of the fantasy that followed it, including most notably The Malazan Book of the Fallen series. It has a lot of tropes that people might find cliche nowadays, but that's only because The Black Company /created/ those tropes.

Malazan has probably the roughest start of any exceptional series I've ever read. There is no ramp up in complexity like is common in these type of novels, Erikson drops the reader in right off the deep end of the pool. If I hadn't had several very strong recommendations and nothing else to read at the time I don't know if I would have made it through the first book, or even the second book. It's only with the end of the second book that I started to really appreciate it, and then the third book, Memories of Ice, just blew me away. Fifteen years since I read it and it's still one of my favourite books of all time. And the following books were also exceptional, and two others remain among my favourites.
