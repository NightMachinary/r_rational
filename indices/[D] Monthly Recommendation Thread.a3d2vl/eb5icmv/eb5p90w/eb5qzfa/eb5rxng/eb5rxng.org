I dunno if Aegon is meant to resemble Aragorn, but FWIW Jon is a bit more ruthlessly pragmatic in the books. For example, he forces a mother to swap her kid to protect another kid. Still, he's a good guy. Most of the story is him being like "um guys can we stop fighting amongst ourselves and worry about the ice zombies that are going to kill us?"

(The show, for the most part, has done its best to strip down and simplify the characters, or make them not resemble their book counterparts at all.)
