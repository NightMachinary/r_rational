*POTENTIAL GoT SPOILERS BELLOW*

So, I tried GoT when it first came out but was sick at the time which made me not care for it (or anything). Some time passed, and I got spoiled too much over the years with hearing names of characters who die (the fanbase seems very bad with avoiding spoilers). Still, I always approvingly thought that at least it is neat that the pop-fantasy work of this generation is gray, with complex characters, no goody two shoes protagonist etc. Then at some point I saw a few episodes with friends and was deeply disappointed that they centered around a dude that was an obviously Lawful Good MC, possibly a polished Aragorn - Jon Snow. Since then I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.

Yup, enjoyed it when I watched it as a kid.

Edit: I just googled Jon Snow and apparently his real name is Aegon, which I didn't know. Is he for real supposed to actually be a knock-off Aragorn!? My (apparently undeserved) respect for this work has lowered again.
