  So, I tried GoT when it first came out but was sick at the time which made me not care for it (or anything). Some time passed, and I got spoiled too much over the years with hearing names of characters who die (the fanbase seems very bad with avoiding spoilers). Still, I always approvingly thought that at least it is neat that the pop-fantasy work of this generation is gray, with complex characters, no goody two shoes protagonist etc. Then at some point I saw a few episodes with friends and was deeply disappointed that they centered around a dude that was an obviously Lawful Good MC, possibly a polished Aragorn - Jon Snow. Since then I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.

I've never actually seen the show, just the books, and it's not at all what you described in the books at least. The series does not revolve around any one character, they are probably about a dozen characters it rotates POV between. In fact, the fourth and fifth books happen simultaneously, just from the perspectives of about 6 characters each. There are a few protagonists who are pretty lawful good, but they still have to kill people, lie, and make moral compromises. And the other POV characters like Arya Stark and Cersei Lannister are a lot worse morally speaking, probably leaning closer to evil than good.
