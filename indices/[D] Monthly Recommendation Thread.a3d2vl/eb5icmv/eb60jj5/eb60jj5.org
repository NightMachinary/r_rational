Sopranos. Life of a mafia man who becomes a boss.

​

The Wire. Story with drug dealers and cops as POVs.

​

Deadwood. Small town in 1800s following relevant people, some of them evil.

​

The thing is, these type of stories aren't popular with most people so they are rare. It's also difficult to keep them interesting, either the MC succeeds and it get's boring and ends, or he fails and dies / goes to jail and the story ends.

​

There's a solo D&D series on youtube, 'Dicing with Death', most of the mcs are evil and they've had many. That's exactly what you see there. Most of the time the MC dies, sometimes they succeed and they have to put the series aside because it becomes a timeskip, self indulgent, "boring" story about a powerful character that will never die, slowly and patiently gaining more political power. Which as you can imagine is not the type of thing people want to do when playing D&D.

​

Frankly I'd like to see them run with it, but they won't =/

​

(it also kind of breaks their universe because they have different series set in the same world, with characters that can interact with each other, so you can't have one character going 1 year into the future while the player in the other series doesn't).
