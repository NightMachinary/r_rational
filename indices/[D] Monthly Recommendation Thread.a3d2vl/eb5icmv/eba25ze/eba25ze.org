You can try Reverend Insanity. I've read a substantial amount of translated asian novels and this one was a breath of fresh air.

Pros:

1) Protagonist is smart, driven, and a villain that's actually a villain. No anti-hero or hypocritical behaviour.

2) Characters behave as people, and act in their best interest. This is supremely rare in translated novels.

3) Interesting, fast and high quality translation.

Cons:

1) It's on Qidian.
