*Request* /(I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8wb5nt/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/e1v2oka/?context=0][this]] 6 months ago with minimal luck)/

 

I'm looking for stories which are *grimdark* and/or have very *gray morality* and/or have *villains* as the *protagonist*, while also having *smart/driven main characters*.

 

A few varied (but limited) examples:

- [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] (although all of Wildbow's work probably counts)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]] (one of the best HP fanfics I've read - smart and depressing)

- [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Practical Guide to Evil]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]]

- [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html][The Dark Wizard of Donkerk]]

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154798.Superman][Superman: Red Son]]

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/83726-how-to-succeed-in-evil][How To Succeed in Evil]]

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917233-snow-glass-apples][Neil Gaiman's Snow, Glass, Apples]]

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179186-the-dire-saga][The Dire Saga]] (Though I stopped reading after book 3)

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257970/][The End of the F***ing World]]

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877057/][Death Note]]

 

Things that fit on paper but I didn't care for as much:

I've also tried a few asian translated novels like [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world][Warlock of the Magus World]] but (possibly mainly because of the translation) to me they read like written by stereotypical overly excited 13 year old gamers though some of the concepts seem great at first. So maybe there's something that can sate my thirst there, although I am starting to doubt it. I also tried [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11706669-the-first-law-trilogy][The First Law]], and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202544.Devices_and_Desires][The Engineer Trilogy]] based on reccomendations when I asked last time but they didn't care for it. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Tanya_the_Evil][Saga of Tanya]] was also reccomended, but at least the anime didn't hold my attention for too long. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer][Goblin Slayer]] I liked a bit more but it abandons most of what makes it interesting episode by episode.

 

I guess things like Breaking Bad, Blackadder, American Psycho etc. mostly count, too so if I find something else in that direction, I'll be okay with it.

Edit: A lot of promising responses so far. I'll make another post like this one including them after 6 more months.
