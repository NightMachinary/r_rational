That trilogy is great, but I ended up liking Abercrombie's other books set in that world a lot more. Particularly [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2315892.Best_Served_Cold][Best Served Cold]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9300768-the-heroes][The Heroes]]. The first is a kick-ass revenge story, and the second is a realistic portrayal of a medieval/viking battle, told from multiple PoVs, from veterans to bright- eyed raw recruits to civilians just trying to survive.

Both are stand alone novels set in the same world as The First Law trilogy, and both have characters from that trilogy making the occasional cameo.
