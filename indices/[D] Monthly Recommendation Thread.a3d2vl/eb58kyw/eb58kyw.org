I've been reading /The First Law/ recently, and it's quite good. I assume most people here have heard of it before, but if you haven't it's a dark fantasy deconstruction of traditional fantasy tropes. The mysterious wizard is a bitter old man who's manipulating everyone, the dashing nobleman is a stuck up asshole, and the grand quest ends in failure. I enjoy it, though I do find myself hoping the author eventually writes a series set during the Old Time which tells the story of the conflicts of Euz and his sons in more detail.

Speaking of that, does anyone know of a good fantasy series like that? Something set in the early age of a traditional LotR-esque setting, before magic started fading. Ideally trilogy-ish length.

I also just finished /Raven Stratagem/. It was every bit as good as /Ninefox Gambit/, and I recommend the series highly. The setting is fascinating, and the author does a good job creating the appearance of rules without getting bogged down in the details. This sub in particular will probably appreciate that the heroes win by manipulating the rules, rather than simply overpowering their enemies.
