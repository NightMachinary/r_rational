It's got a very anime style of combat. Arrogant villain shows up, finds a million reasons /not/ to just take care of business, an ever-growing roster of heros shows up, gets obliterated one by one. The main character musters his gumption and does something minor but clever which leaves the villain open for the final /real/ hero who then actually defeats them.

Unfortunately he repeats this trope so many times that it becomes a little comical, and he never kills any of the villains or heroes so they just begin piling up and the story sags under the weight of a million high-powered characters with unspoken agendas.
