Can we /un-/recommend something? I've just finished the first two books of the "Arcane Ascension" series after seeing them posted here and elsewhere as rational fic. I would just like to warn anyone else thinking about reading these- they are many things, but rational they ain't.

They're about a boy in a wizarding school, replete with the standard lit-rpg tropes of monsters and classes and power levels and dungeon crawls. Sometimes these things can be really fun, especially if the main character really breaks the world over his knee and the narrative gets to explore some deeper issues. This story seems to promise something like that, but never delivers. The main character always /intends/ to learn or grow or be prepared for his next challenge, but he is railroaded so hard that he basically has no initiative in the story. Super-powered villains, laughably out of his league, are always countered by super-powered good guys, laughably out of his league, who then take him aside and give him his next objectives at the conclusion of every battle. He (the main character) is intensely, aggravatingly passive, and despite being raised as a noble and a duelist his whole life has basically no knowledge of people, places or events in the world around him. He doesn't plan, barely experiences any character growth, and is just generally intensely dull and unlikable when held up against any of the side characters.

In short, it reads like someone wrote down their World of Warcraft adventure. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the writer used to work for Blizzard and Obsidian). Plot elements (keys, dungeon rooms, monsters) and narrative tropes (his fear of touch, his fear of overusing his power, long tedious explanations of runes) are overused to the point that they easily fill a third of each book and I found myself lightly skimming. At no point does anyone come even /close/ to the standard of rationality, and it's intensely frustrating that the character's power set (Enchanter, basically can create any magic effect or item as long as he knows the runes/can power it) which is so /easily/ broken, is never really taken advantage of at all.

Read these books if you want to pay several dollars for a bog standard fantasy school adventure. Or just go play an MMO, you will have the same experience.
