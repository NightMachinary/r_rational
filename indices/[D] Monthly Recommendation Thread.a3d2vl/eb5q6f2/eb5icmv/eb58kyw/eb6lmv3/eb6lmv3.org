I've recommended it a while back, [[http://wildelifecomic.com/][Wilde life]] is a very relaxing and somewhat rational(debatable) comics. It made me feel very "content" and happy, it has a very strong atmosphere I can't quite describe, probably a combination of great art, dialogue and character interactions. Oh, and you should definitely go in blind for the best experience.
