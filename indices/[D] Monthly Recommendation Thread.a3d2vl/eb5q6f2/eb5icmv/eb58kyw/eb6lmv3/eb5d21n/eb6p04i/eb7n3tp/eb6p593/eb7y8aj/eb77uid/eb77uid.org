[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] - Not really a crossover, but I think it fits the spirit of your request. It takes this anime that is itself a deconstruction of the "Magical Girl" genre and makes it into a far future transhumanist military hard scifi. Basically, humanity's government goes on to use the magical girls' physics defying powers to first explore and colonize the galaxy, and then to fight an interstellar war of extinction against a technologically superior Alien species. Great stuff, and some of the authors writings on the philosophy and musings of morality of transhumanism and its politics are honestly better than a lot of professional scifi that I read. The worldbuilding is fantastic. I think you can get by without having watched the show if you read the plot on the wikipedia page.

It fits the first requirement that you mentioned, and a bit of the second, at times.
