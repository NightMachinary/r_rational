I would highly recommend Deduction in Shadows ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11813418/chapters/26652618]]). It has a very good first chapter, followed by several slow chapters where very little happens. This may leave the impression that it's a slow story with a passive protagonist, but the pace picks back up for a thrilling adventure. Note that I say adventure: despite its name, it's a romance/adventure story, not a mystery. The deduction is written in very good style, and it's thrilling and exciting, but it's not a solution to a puzzle the reader had a chance to attempt first (Mayu's first chapter exposition is a good example).

If you liked the first chapter, I'd recommend you to read further in (perhaps skim a few chapters after 2 until it picks up again). If you didn't, then you probably won't like it.
