To be honest i haven't read many fanfiction/novels in general so as to recommend any. Do I do know a few althought they don't share the themes from the request in my earlier comment.

One that I really liked was "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6154638][The Hill of Swords]]" which is pretty popular so you might've already read it. Fate/Stay Night and ZnT crossover. It's far from perfect but it's pretty entertaining and completed.

Another one would be "[[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/gaemon-redux-si.438278/][Gaemon REDUX]]" over at alternatehistory.com so you'd need an account to read it. It's a GoT SI OC during the events of the Dance of Dragons. It builds more heavily upon the magical side of the world and it's in general a great read. Currently updating.

For original stories i'd say [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/5701/savage-divinity/chapter/58095/chapter-1-new-beginnings][Savage Divinity]] (not a Rational/rationalist fiction at all) which starts a bit more in theme with my earlier req. request. MC is reincarnated and wakes up as a child slave working in a mine. He suffers much much more than the MC from Lizard Brain and while he didn't completely break, the mental scars he was left with are more pronounced and last through the vast majority of the story. Fair warning, he suffers from massive self-steem problems and fucky metal health issues which, because the story is written in first person, makes him an incredibly unreliable narrator.

While I admit that the story may have its share problems, one of the things I really commend the author for is how he manages to make each different POV /feel/ like a completely different character.
