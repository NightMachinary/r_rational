I mean stuff that is not Shonen: Freeza is the most powerful being in the universe. Oh wait there is his father that is more powerful. Oh there are Androids that are even more powerful.

For example One Piece is good. At the beginning the admirals were said to be Powerfull and they still remain powerful. I want a setting with power balance that makes sense.

In Fimbluwenter we have gods and so far nothing stronger then gods emerged.
