The reviews on that linked website are pretty accurate. If you don't mind the aspects brought up in the low-star rreviews, I'd give it a shot (except for that one person talking about a block, I don't remember that). I'm enjoyg it for what it is, but it's by no means a great story or anything.

In terms of the translation itself, it's about average for the new wave of translated webnovels. There are errors but they don't detract from the story too much... but I may be a little biased having read so many poor translations. If you're new to the scene the errors will be more jarring.
