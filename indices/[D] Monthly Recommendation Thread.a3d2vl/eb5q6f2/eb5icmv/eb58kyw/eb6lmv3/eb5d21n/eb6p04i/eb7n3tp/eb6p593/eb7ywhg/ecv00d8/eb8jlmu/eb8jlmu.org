I'm afraid rits been ages since I read fimbulwinter...

When you say consistent power levels do you mean a world where the protagonist/antagonist(s) are not increasingly powerful to rediculous levels, such as in Dragonball Z or I Eat Tomatoes' works? Or do you mean you want stories where the protagonist doesn't gain power much at all but wins the day by her brains/luck/friendship/etc?
