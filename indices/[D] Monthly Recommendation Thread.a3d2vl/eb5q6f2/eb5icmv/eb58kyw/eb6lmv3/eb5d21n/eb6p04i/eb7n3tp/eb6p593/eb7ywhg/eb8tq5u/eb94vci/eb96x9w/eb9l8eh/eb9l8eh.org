Let's have a throwback: Elfquest. It's a long running (20+ years!), well regarded series. Out of print, but the entire thing is available online. [[http://elfquest.com/read/index.php]]

It's a post-apocalyptic blend between sci-fi and fantasy that basically works out into a low-fantasy setting. It's not terribly rational but it does avoid a lot of cliches (and many of those you do see were things the series created).
