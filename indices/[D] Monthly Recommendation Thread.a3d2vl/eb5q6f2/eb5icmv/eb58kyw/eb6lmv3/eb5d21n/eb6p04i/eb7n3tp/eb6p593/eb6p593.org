Request: Can anyone recommend me /good/ crossover fanfics. 'Good' here meaning by the standards of people who came to this subreddit because they were fed up with the certain type of bad plot and characterization that rationalfic writers try to avoid. So no crackfic please, no matter how hilarious.

If I get to make more specific wishes, what I'd love to read is a story where one or more (can also be many more) /intelligent/ characters from a technologically less developed world (anything before widespread industrialization) find themselves in a more modern world (somewhere between industrialization and modern age equivalent or at least near future sci-fi). If back and forth travel s possible that's also fine. Either setting can also be real world history, but doesn't have to be. Magic existing in one or both worlds is also fine. Really the main point is that the "inserted" character(s) move into the future as opposed to being SIs in the magical dark age, but that they are not dumb knights attacking "beasts" (cars) as they often do in those kinds of movies.

So... Anything that applies to the first paragraph is welcome. Anything that hits the second would be extra awesome.
