Astro City by Kurt Busiek - reconstruction of superhero genre. It combines examination of tropes with thoughtful, personal stories.

EDIT: /Astro City: The Nearness of You/ is [[https://www.comixology.com/Astro-City-1996-2000/digital-comic/46309][free on comixology]] and it's good sample of that type of story that Astro City tells.
