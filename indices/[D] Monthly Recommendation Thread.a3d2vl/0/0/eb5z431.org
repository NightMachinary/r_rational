Good to know, thank you.

I started reading it, but the combat annoyed me too much, too unrealistic even though it's sort of trying to be. The author is trying to do it, but he doesn't understand enough to pull it off. Dropped / paused it at chapter 3. Don't know if I'll get back to it anymore though.
