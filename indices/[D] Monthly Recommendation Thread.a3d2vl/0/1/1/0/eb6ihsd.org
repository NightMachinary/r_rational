I didn't like Threadbare that much. It's competently written, the main character is not a Beary Stu, but that's about it. I really think it only looks good in comparison to the average litRPG.

Plot kept getting slightly comedic when it should be getting real, and characters were /really/ generic outside of the MC. Extremely unambitious story, I can see the appeal the same way I see the appeal of xianxia, but I can't see myself reading it to the end.
