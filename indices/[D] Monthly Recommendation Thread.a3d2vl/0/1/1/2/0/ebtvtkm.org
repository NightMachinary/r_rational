Off the top of my mind, The Emperor of Solo Play: Korean vrmmorpg, time-travel-restart, late start, no starting capital, OP MC, semi-vengeance plot (with an satisfying alternative conclusion), unique character build, the usual jazz.

The characterisaction and language style speaks distinctly of a translated korean novel, but compared to similar novels in the genre, it gives a surprising amount of respect for realism. There isn't as much overt self contradiction.

Of course, this is far from simulationist; expect a powercreep story revolving entirely around the MC.

I enjoyed it, you might too.
