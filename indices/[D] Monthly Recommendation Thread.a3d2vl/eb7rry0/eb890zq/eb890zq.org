Weird rec, but there's a book series called Otherland, by the excellent Tad Williams, which has this as one of many elements.

To do a really hard-tech take on the idea, though, I think it would be more interesting with mind uploads and no clear way to "win," so you have to break out by finding and exploiting bugs in the code.
