You've probably read this one, but I'm case not, check out [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With this ring]]. It's a self insert Young Justice fic where the MC gets an orange power ring. It's pretty well written, especially if you don't mind some of the authors stylistic idiosyncracies, and it updates literally every day (he switched forums when he got a temp ban rather than missing a day once).
