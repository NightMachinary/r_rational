I've been on this same kick for the last month so if you have anything to recommend, I'm all ears. Here are the incomplete fanfictions I've enjoyed enough to set alerts to. I'll try to remember some of the complete ones I enjoyed, but I don't think there were all that many:

Bleach, pre-canon. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10572048/1/Walk-Two-Lifetimes]]

One Piece. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12187990/1/Tell-it-to-the-Marines]]

Harry Potter

This is me being relatively picky, too. I'd say I dropped about 4 in 5 of the SIs I've tried.

Edit: looks like a few of these aren't SIs, sorry about that. If you like my tastes, though, I can post the other pics I've enjoyed.
