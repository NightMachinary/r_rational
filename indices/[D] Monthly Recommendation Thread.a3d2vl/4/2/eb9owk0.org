Playing Choice of Vampire right now.

So far (just reached the point after my first love, Clotho, dies) I'm not impressed. Witcher (Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker) quests are better. I feel too many choices are presented, making each choice less impactful. Also it does feel railroadish, I believe Clotho dies whatever I decide to do.
