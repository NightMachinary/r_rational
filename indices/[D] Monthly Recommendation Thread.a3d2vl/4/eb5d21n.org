Not exactly rational per se.. but I always was a fan of [[https://www.choiceofgames.com/category/our-games/][Choose Your Adventure]] type stories. It's interesting to be able to see a story from different angles, take different approaches for the characters.. My personal favourite of the lot is [[https://www.choiceofgames.com/vampire/][Choice of Vampire]] and maybe [[https://www.choiceofgames.com/romance/][Affairs of the court]]. Certain parts can get railroad-ish though for the sake of story continuation.
