I don't think there is a way to keep Clotho alive. Or any of the other mortal love-interests.. It's so frustrating, I kept replaying again and again trying new things to let Silas the soldier live.. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever][Stupid Who Wants to Live Forever]] trope.. It kinda rings true with the old vampire novels though. Thanks for recommending Witcher, definitely going to have to check it out.
