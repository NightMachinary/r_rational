Can I sell anyone here on giving Brandon Sandersons new book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward][Skyward]] a try?

It's Sandersons second take on a YA novel and this time it actually feels like a YA novel. The basic summary is that it is about a hotheaded girl whose family is at the bottom of the social ladder (because her father deserted during a major battle) and yet wants to become a fighter pilot, which is roughly the highest status job in the highly militarized sci-fi/post-apocalyptic society she lives in.

It is also about a million times better than it has any right to be given that summary. I don't know if I would quite call it rational fiction, it's rational in the sense that the characters are acting according to their own incentives and biases, but the main character is not particularly smart and lot of the plot revolves around her working around the biases of other people as well as her own. It /is/, however, a story with fleshed out characters and a coherent world that somehow still manages to be extremely tightly written.

*For the people that stopped reading at the words Brandon Sanderson*: This book manages to get around one of the major criticism that I have about him, namely that the first half of a lot of his book is dreadfully slow. Skyward has a very brief introduction into the world and the characters after which the pace kicks up and it just kinda keeps on going at full speed right up until the end.

*For the people that stopped reading at the word YA*: Yeah ok, maybe give this one a pass. Skyward is incredibly good, but unlike Sandersons other YA series this one (despite all the high tech dogfighting and deconstruction of militaristic societies) /is/ at its heart clearly about a teenager trying to figure out her place in the world and that's obviously not everyone's cup of tea.
