Make it max feasible size. Lift it high enough to 'park' it at L5 Lagrange. Wait for 10 months. When Earth is exactly at 1 AU from the object, discharge all its energy (massive resistance or capacitor banks). Wait for 'contact' at 30 km/s (Earth's orbital speed).

EDIT: The object may need to be parked a bit farther than 1 AU from the sun for this scenario.
