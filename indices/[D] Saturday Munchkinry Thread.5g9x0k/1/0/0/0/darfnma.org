  The problem with the slingshot and the arbitrary-elevation set up is that an antigrav's ability to pull you up is exactly equal to how hard it was for you to drag it down. But then I guess it's still a good slingshot that can release all that energy really quickly, so it's still a good thought.

You can do this step-by-step: Lift both to 1000', charge device 1 with 100 pounds of force. Drop down to -1000' (fighting against 100 pounds of lift), charge device 2 with 200 pounds of force. Lift to 1000' (fighting 100 lbs of net weight), charge device 1 with an additional 200 pounds (300 total), then repeat as needed.

  Setting it deep enough that it will always press down may require it to be pulled so tight that it puts enough force on the car to cause problems.

Couldn't you just reduce the force if that was a problem? Let's say that the moon changes Earth's gravity by +-30' relative to the surface (which seems high, but whatever.) An antigrav device set to pull towards a point 1000' below itself wouldn't change force very much between 970' and 1030'.

Also a fun use: Since their weight and mass are not proportional to each other, you could make some funky pendulums.
