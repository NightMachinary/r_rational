As we get closer to the Sun, or the Moon, or anything else, an active antigravity device actually hovers a bit lower. It "wants" to experience a very specific gravitational acceleration. As the Sun/Moon/whatever cancels out more of Earth's gravity, the antigravity device will get closer to the Earth to make up for it. They will hover 130 meters closer to the Earth at perihelion than at aphelion, if I've done my quick math right. That's certainly not insignificant, if you want to leave one running for multiple months. The Moon might make a difference of 3 meters on top of that, and rest of the Milky Way is a rounding error.

The device doesn't quite prove that the entire universe is or isn't accelerating. But it does prove that any such acceleration is constant at all points in space, and therefore doesn't make any difference when the device compares its current gravity with the gravity that it wants, since the same acceleration is factored into both.
