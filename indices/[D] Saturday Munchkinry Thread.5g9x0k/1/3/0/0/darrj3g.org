But points of equal gravitational potential are not the same as points of equal gravitational acceleration. On a lagrange point versus some other random point in the solar system of equal gravitational potential, the latter is 0 in the first case and nonzero in the second.

Can we make a generator out of having the moon's gravitational tides pull an active antigravity device with enough energy in it up and down a linear crank of enormous torque? (If there's a reaction force to this, this draws energy out of the rotation of the Earth, but then so do the tides.)
