Given the whole basis of relativity, is that being in a box accelerating upwards, is the same as feeling an equivalent gravitational force on the ground; I'm certain this violates /something/.\\
Or maybe the device would just have to be vastly more versatile, since you can't distinguish between gravity and certain types of acceleration.

Damn somebody competent in physics really needs to look into this, because something is definitely /very wrong/ with the way the device falsely distinguishes between gravity and acceleration but I don't know exactly how.

I also have a strong suspicion that you could somehow get free energy out of this device, because it doesn't treat acceleration and gravity equivalently, even though the rest of reality disagrees with it.
