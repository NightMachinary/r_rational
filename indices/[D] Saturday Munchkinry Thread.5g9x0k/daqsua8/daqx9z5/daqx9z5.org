Your average molecular motion - that is, your temperature - quadruples from 37°C (310 K) to 967°C (1240 K). Your inorganic fluids flash into steam and all of your organs explode. If you manage to avoid this, then the slow world (including your clothes) feels to be about -200°C (73 K), which kills all exposed tissue almost instantly.
