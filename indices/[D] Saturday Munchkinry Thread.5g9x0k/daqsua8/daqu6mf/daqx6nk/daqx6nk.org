I'm not a doctor either, and that's what I thought at first, too. A little armchair research has convinced me that the heart and lungs can handle this intense a blood viscosity change, and most of the molecular activities on the exterior of cells are strong enough to deal with similar momentum shifts.

Almost all of the body's second-to-second interactions happen inside cells where time is operating normally. They'll run out of resources if you push yourself, but not immediately.

So long as you're not speeding in moments of extreme stress, and haven't got latent circulatory problems this really oughtn't be a killer. Seconds should be easy (if weird), minutes sustainable with care and training, and half an hour possible but risky.
