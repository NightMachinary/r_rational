LOW-END SPEEDSTER: You can - switching on and off at will - move, think, and act at four times speed. From your point of view it is the rest of the world that slows down, so you require none of the concomitant increases in strength and durability that speedsters tend to require and you are otherwise an average human being.

Only your body's living, nucleic cells are affected, so your clothes, outer skin, hair and most bodily fluids operate at regular speed other than that the rest of you drags (and pumps) them around. This has some awkward biological effects - slow digestion and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorheology#Blood_viscosity][high blood viscosity]] for example - that make it difficult and potentially harmful to stay in the state for hours at a time. This largely prevents you from noticing that you age four times faster while speeding.

Oh, and from your point of view gravity seems about four times weaker but all momentum (except your cells') seems four times stronger.
