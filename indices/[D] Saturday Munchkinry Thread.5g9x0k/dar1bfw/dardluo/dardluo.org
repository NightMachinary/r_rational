You can use them to harvest tidal energy from the moon. Simply charge one at ground level while the moon is on the far side of its orbit, put a mass on top of it, wait 12 hours, then drop the mass off of its new, elevated position (it gets lifted in the same way that water in the ocean does).

You could build a pretty impressive launch pad with one. Simply bolt two anti-grav devices together, one set at 1000 pounds of force going towards 1000' elevation, and the other charged to 1000 pounds force going towards 1000' /depth/. Detach the bolts to fling something into the air (or violently smash it into the ground.

Similar to the above, you can build rechargeable arbitrary-elevation anti-grav devices by having two: one charged up high, and one down low, and selectively discharging one or the other to raise/lower the net target elevation.

An anti-grav device set to deeper than surface level would be useful for cars, acting like a spoiler, but better.

Littering would /suck/. There's no reason why an abandoned anti-grav device would fall down, so they could just clog up the sky and get into collisions with things until they explode.
