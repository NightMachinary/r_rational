The antigrav device actually runs away from the Moon. As the Moon's gravity cancels some of the Earth's, the antigrav device thinks that it's too high up the gravity well, and lowers itself to where it should be. Of course, your scheme still works, just 12 hours different. Thanks, I hadn't thought of that.

The problem with the slingshot and the arbitrary-elevation set up is that an antigrav's ability to pull you up is exactly equal to how hard it was for you to drag it down. But then I guess it's still a good slingshot that can release all that energy really quickly, so it's still a good thought.

Spoilers may be a bit tricky, since tidal forces change the antigrav's set height. Setting it deep enough that it will always press down may require it to be pulled so tight that it puts enough force on the car to cause problems.

Littering is another good point I hadn't thought of.
