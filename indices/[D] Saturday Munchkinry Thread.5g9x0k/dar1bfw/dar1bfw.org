You have the designs for an antigravity device.

It's about as expensive and difficult to build as a nice TV; You won't be making one in your garage, but it can be mass produced without too much trouble by a fairly small business. The minimum size of the device is about the size of a skateboard. It can be made larger, to increase the load-bearing surface or for other engineering reasons, but its size doesn't significantly affect its operation.

The device can be activated by pumping energy into it and deactivated by pumping that energy back out. It requires no power to stay on. You can get almost all of your energy back, but there are some efficiency losses. While active, the device doesn't go up or down. It is locked onto its current shell of gravitational potential. It basically just hovers, and it can slide around frictionlessly at its current elevation. If you try to move it up a hill, it will go up slightly, to account for the hill's gravity, but not by enough to actually go over the hill. It'll crash.

The device isn't actually /completely/ locked. It acts more like a spring, and the stiffness of the spring is determined by how much energy has been pumped into it when it was turned on. If you put weight on it, it will sag, and if the weight is removed, it will bounce up and down around the elevation it is locked at. The energy in an electric car's batteries is enough to stably support a car. However, the device can't "see" anything more than the gravity in its local area. If you set it on Earth and pull it past the Earth-Moon L1 Lagrange point, then the device will snap towards the Moon. The transition will be violent.

Every bit of energy pumped into the device ties it to its elevation at the time the energy was put in. If you anchor it weakly at a high height, pull it down, and then pump a lot more energy into it, it will not strengthen the current anchor to let you shoot it upwards cheaply. Rather, the new energy will anchor it to the lower height, and counteract the original setting. When energy is removed, every current anchor is weakened exactly in proportion to how much energy they have.

While in operation, the device emits a variety of exotic particles that barely interact with normal matter, preventing it from violating conservation of momentum. If the device is damaged or tampered with in any way while in operation, it explodes. If different parts of the device are pulling it in different directions, it can tear itself apart then explode.

What horrible consequences does this have?
