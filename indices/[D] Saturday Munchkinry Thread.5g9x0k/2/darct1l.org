You have a counter that tells you how many living people you have had physical contact with. Reasonable Fermi estimate is that that number is pretty high. Upon looking at any given living person, you can instantly recognize whether you've touched them or not.

Tomorrow, you're going to be stuck in a 24-hour time loop. During that time loop, you must try to kill everyone you've ever touched. When everyone you've ever touched is simultaneously dead, the loop ends.

When the loop ends, every human will be tortured for e^{n} subjective seconds, where n is the number of cycles it took you to end the loop. This includes all humans who have ever died, who will be temporarily recreated.

How do you minimize suffering? "Keep the loop going forever" is exactly the wrong answer, because there's a tiny but very real chance on any given iteration of the day that factors outside of your control will end the world, killing everyone and ending the loop anyway.
