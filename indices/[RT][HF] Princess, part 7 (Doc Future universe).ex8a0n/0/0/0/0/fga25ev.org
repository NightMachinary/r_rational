I really enjoy these bits of causality shenanigans in the story, and they seem to be very well thought-out. Do you have any more background on those, beyond what is in the story at various points? I've followed the story over a long time and feel like you (and your characters) have a much more intuitive grasp about this than I have, probably due to reading things mostly piecemeal. I might just re-read the story at some point, but still, I think it'd be interesting :)
