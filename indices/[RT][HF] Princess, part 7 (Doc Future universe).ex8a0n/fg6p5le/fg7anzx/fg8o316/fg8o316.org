Yeah, there's a fairly general clustering effect that can happen in systems subject to continual small perturbations that I figured would apply to the final stable state of a worldline after a long timeloop duel. The only assumptions you really need are 1) It's easier for the timing of event B to change if you aren't trying to move it before A or after C and 2) at some intermediate state, one side could get a relative advantage by moving an event sooner or later. So you get clumps--and someone clever might look at them, raise an eyebrow, and say 'Huh. Looks like there might have been an Oracle duel here.' 8-)
