Yes, I touched on it in my Behind the Future essay series (which are now more than 5 years old 8-0) but I don't think I was posting to reddit yet. The one on how I constructed causality and time travel is [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/88821806006/behind-the-future-part-2-building-in-time-travel][here]].

Edit: For those who have read Fall already, or don't mind spoilers, the first 2 paragraphs of Doc and Stella's discussion in Chapter 29 of Fall (Endgame II), which sound like theoretical technobabble, are actually a fair description of what Journeyman has been struggling against, although some of Stella's later speculation is inaccurate.
