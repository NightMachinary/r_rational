First off, the hero should not be Timmy. Timmy is terrifying. Timmy is an immature pre-teen boy with control of the most powerful technology in existence. (In-world)

I'm not the most familiar with the series, but if this were the writing prompt I were working with, Crocker would be the main protagonist. In a more rational Fairly Odd-Parents world, he may just be the only thing between Timmy and global destruction.

All it takes is one screwup to kill the entire human race, or worse. Crocker will have his hands full just preventing Timmy from blowing up the world or breaking the laws of thermodynamics, let alone getting wish technology for himself.

Timmy is terrifying without even considering how the kid manages to weasel around "Da Rules", with such efficiency he might as well be a munchkin in disguise. He outright breaks them a lot of the time, AND THEN MAKES IT WORK ANYWAY.

An ordinary(ish) middle-aged teacher versus a volatile ten-year-old kid with potential world destroying abilities? That's a scary story.

(For added rationality, it could be Crocker's goal to utilize wish technology to benefit the species, rather than his usual shtick.)
