There can only be one explanation. Timmy is an uploaded mind and the world is a simulation. The (imperfect) system is set to keep him in check, while keeping him entertained and satisfying his values the best way it deems.

The God!Timmy concept has so much potential.. The only other story that I read that tackled this idea was [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2059690.Daddy_s_World][Daddy's World]]. Not a recommended read though. They really could have handled the A.I. part better.
