This would be amusing to read. I imagine you would have to make the rules a bit stricter than in canon for the protagonist to not immediately break the story. Alternatively, you could make Norm the genie with his unrestricted godlike magic the antagonist as he chooses human wish askers who he can easily manipulate. That might end up breaking the story the other way though. Both parties would be undoing each others' wishes as fast as possible, assuming they can't just wish each other's magic away, until one or both set up some kind of automatically granting wish like "I wish all of Norm's wishes were undone right after they were granted" or something.
