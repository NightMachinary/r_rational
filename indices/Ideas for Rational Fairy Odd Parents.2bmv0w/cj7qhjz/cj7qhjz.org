Rational!Timmy: Timmy walked into his room and saw Cosmo and Wanda waiting for him. "Timmy it's your one year anniversary since you got us, which means you get a rule free magic muffin." "Anything?" Timmy asked to clarify. "Yes anything" said Cosmo and Wanda exchanging worried looks. "Alright", said Timmy with a mischevious grin. He took a bite out of the magic muffin and said "I wish for the ability to make unrestricted wishes similiar to those allowed by the magic muffin at any time I want, either by writing them down, speaking them, or thinking them." Wanda and Cosmo stared in horror at the god in front of them. Timmy then wished for omnipotence, invulnerability, and omniscience. THE END
