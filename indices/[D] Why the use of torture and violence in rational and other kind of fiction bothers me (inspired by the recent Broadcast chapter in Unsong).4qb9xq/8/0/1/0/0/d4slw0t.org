Frankly, it doesn't make sense for the bulk of the responsibility to fall on the author, either, because there's only one author, and many readers. Making a story worse to please one reader will decrease the value of the story for other readers. If we assume the author's job is to maximize overall utility, it would be silly to expect that utility for every reader is maximized, because people have such different desires and expectations. But that's an oversimplification, because good authors don't try to maximize overall utility, they try to maximize their own utility. In practice, this is much more effective, because people are much better at maximizing their own utility than they are at maximizing the utility of an abstract average other - trying to do so tends to minimize novelty, which is actually very valuable in art, as well as sincerity.

So, as readers, what can we do? Well, I won't tell you not to engage in criticism, because I find that engaging in criticism often increases my utility. But I will tell you to *try to enjoy things*, for what I think are fairly obvious reasons.
