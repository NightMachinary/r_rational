I think it's quite uncharitable to say that people are /acting/ surprised, rather than being /genuinely/ surprised.

More generally, I have trouble with this sort of response to criticism. I'm usually on the reader's side; if a reader says something like "this didn't feel right to me" or "I was bored at this part" or something like that, my default response is generally "okay, what could the author have done differently?". It's the author's job to communicate with the reader, and while communication is a two-way street, the bulk of the responsibility is on the author.

You're saying, essentially "no, you're bad at reading, the story was this way all along". I personally think that if the story was supposed to be interpreted that way all along, it was the author's job to make sure that this was clear to his readers. Based on the comments for that chapter (both here and on the site) this isn't something he accomplished.
