  I'm usually on the reader's side; if a reader says something like "this didn't feel right to me" or "I was bored at this part" or something like that, my default response is generally "okay, what could the author have done differently?"

I have the same response, generally. Here, it's different. No one is claiming that the writing was bad (as in, poorly written). People are claiming that it was too violent. /It was meant to be violent./ It was meant to show the horrors of hell, and what the characters are up against.

If you look at the disclaimer it explicitly says...

  Content warning: Part II of this chapter contains graphic scenes including references to Hell, gore, rape, psychological torture, and death...
#+end_quote

If you still choose to read it, you lose the right to blame the author. So, in this case, it is /completely the fault of the reader./

#+begin_quote
  You're saying, essentially "no, you're bad at reading, the story was this way all along". I personally think that if the story was supposed to be interpreted that way all along, it was the author's job to make sure that this was clear to his readers.

You could plausibly claim that up to chapter 12, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4b99m4/unsong_chapter_12_borne_on_angels_wings/d17a5nx][which people did.]]. But that ship has long sailed.
