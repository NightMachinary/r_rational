I expect people noticed that the characters were humorous and a few whimsical things happened, so they figured that the story was going to be lighthearted and whimsical. It probably doesn't help that, stylistically, most chapters sound like SlateStarCodex chapters.

Still, I've felt all along that the characters' humor was sort of like a shock response. The world is really messed up, and no one knows how to act, so they they pretty much go around making jokes and doing normal things.

I can't speak for [[/u/electrace]], but this is pretty much exactly how I feel. The author isn't blameless, of course, but the evidence has been pretty clear from the start. This is a story where the US has collapsed and the Midwest is ruled by warlords; The universe we understand is slowly and irreversibly falling apart; People are employed at minimum wage to recite potential names of /God Himself/ so they can be copyrighted and sold for profit; Most humans who've ever lived are currently or will soon be suffering in literal hell, and the world's best hope of saving them learned something so terrible that he lost heart and was killed.

I suppose I've some sympathy for those who discovered it through the "stories without major sadness or darkness," but this hasn't been a light story for a long time. The Broadcast didn't change that--it just briefly shined a spotlight into the darkness.
