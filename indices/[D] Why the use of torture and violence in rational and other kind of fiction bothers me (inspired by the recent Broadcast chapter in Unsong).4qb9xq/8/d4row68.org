Can we stop acting like this was a surprise?

This story has been dark since near the beginning. It's just been /intellectually dark/, rather than explicitly dark.

Chapter 12:

  That worked for about five years. Then there had been another sudden drop in the efficiency of technology, and parts of the route needed costly refitting to use the Motive Name. Then the Comet King had died and the security situation went to hell, in some cases literally. The smoking ruins of the Midwest had been taken over by warlords and barbarian chiefdoms -- Paulus the Lawless, the Witch-King of Wichita, the Oklahoma Ochlocracy -- who wanted tolls to pass their territory. The Other King seized Nevada and demanded another toll plus the promise that the train wouldn't be used to lift the siege of the West children in Colorado. The smouldering conflict that had troubled the East Coast after the election of 2000 had devolved into guerilla warfare that made the whole Appalachian area dangerous.

Chapter 20 had Thamiel killing virtually /2/3 of all angels./ Is genocide not dark enough?

If you thought this was going to be just a light-hearted story, the realization that it wasn't going to be should have hit you a long time ago.

Was /The BroadCast/ more explicitly dark? Yes, but there was a prominent content warning at the top of the page.... I don't know how much clearer Scott could have possibly made it. If you know that things like that bother you, why on Earth would you choose to read it?
