You are a better reader than I, then. I don't get distressed by darkness, but I do get a bit distressed by other things, usually various forms of cringe or social anxiety-inducing moments. Never enough to make me stop reading (usually, sometimes I'll stop reading in a huff and come crawling back quickly enough).
