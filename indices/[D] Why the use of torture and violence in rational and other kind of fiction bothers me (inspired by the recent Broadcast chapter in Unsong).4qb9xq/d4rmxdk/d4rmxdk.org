Separate point: the interaction between fiction and the reader of fiction is very intricate and varies from person to person. Some people read slowly and take time to mull every word over and visualize. Some people read quickly enough, and are desensitized enough that things like Worm barely bother them. I think the last time I felt anxiety while reading was when I read the Hunger Games trilogy three years ago. (in that period, I've read Worm and Pact, and a whole bunch of other stuff that would probably drive you mad)
