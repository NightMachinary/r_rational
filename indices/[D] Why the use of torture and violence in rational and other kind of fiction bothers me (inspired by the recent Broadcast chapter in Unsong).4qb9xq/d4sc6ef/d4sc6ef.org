Most fiction is based on superstimuli of various kinds, from robots punching dinosaurs, to super-smart Harry outsmarting his opponents by being smart. So that's not a strong objection to me.

Also most fiction can be accused of insensitivity to real suffering, just because it's fiction. In a world where children starve, etc, etc. So that's not a strong objection either.

That leaves artistic criteria, which depend on what the artist is trying to achieve. Clearly, LOTR works better without torture and GOT works better with torture. Most artistic works fall somewhere in between.

That said, I'm also disappointed by Unsong's use of torture. It doesn't fit with the rest of the work and it feels made up. As a doctor, Scott has tons of experience with actual suffering, and his SSC posts prove that he can describe it vividly and truthfully. So why talk about cartoon stuff like forks in eyeballs?
