I think I'm probably one of the offenders as far as darkness goes, but ... I'm a cynic and suffer from depression. I have a lot of trouble writing cheerful, optimistic things. I've tried, in the past, but it always comes out wrong and takes a turn for the dark.

So I do agree that rational fiction as it stands tends to be a little darker than I would like it to be, but don't feel like I can actually do anything about that, because that goes so contrary to who I am as a person and how I see the world.

Actually, maybe I'll make that the next weekly challenge: happy stories.
