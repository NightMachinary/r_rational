I think one of the reasons rational fiction is so often dark is the "intelligent application of their knowledge and resources" part. After all, violence is a universal resource and pretty easy to apply. Unless your characters have some plausible reason to not be violent, it would be unrealistic if they didn't consider it all, especially considering how common its use is in the real world. So, what it comes down to, in many cases, is coming up with more creative uses for violence.
