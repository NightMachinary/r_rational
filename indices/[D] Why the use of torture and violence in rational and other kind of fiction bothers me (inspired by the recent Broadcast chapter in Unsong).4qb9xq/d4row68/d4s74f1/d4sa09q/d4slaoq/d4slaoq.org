I didn't say the entirety, I said the bulk. Communication is a two-way street, and the reader does have their own responsibilities.

My view is colored by having people beta-read things that I've written. When someone says, "I didn't find that character sympathetic", responding with "no, you're wrong, they were actually sympathetic, here's why" is /a terrible response/ that will never help you improve as a writer. Similarly, if someone says that something was confusing, or dissonant, or boring ... you have to have a lot of hubris to say "the fault lies with you as the reader, not me as an author". The same principle applies when fans are talking to other fans -- but of course, fans get stupidly tribal about the works that they like, and any criticism is taken as a mean-spirited, idiotic attack rather than a genuine reaction.
