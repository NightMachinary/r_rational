Another option that I'm going with is that, yes,this is a huge change compared to past chapters, and that it was jarring, but that it's a feature, not a bug. The story should have had a trigger warning, but I don't think this chapter should be criticized from a literary point of view.

From the author's comments here, they had a goal for this chapter and it certainly seems fulfilled, so I'd call that a success.
