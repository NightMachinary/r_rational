  I am interested by your idea that option #2 emphatically doesn't belong here. I'd imagine that a discussion about what modes of fiction are "pleasurable to read" would be particularly interesting for a community that wants to write well. Engaging with writing involves more than analysis of grand themes and recitation of plot minutia. There's an emotional "affective" component that is often neglected by the more didactic branches of fanfiction (and web fiction more generally). This is largely an artefact of the lack of (professional!) editors.

There was miscommunication there. By number two, I meant a post that effectively boils down to "DAE like x" threads, mainly. Where the only purpose it patting each other on the back for liking the right things.

Your suggestion is sensible. I've tentatively edited the original post to add this.

/However/, I don't think this a very likely motive for OP, but I will concede it throws my blanket statement (this all belongs on a blog) out, albeit marginally.

  If you are offering motives for OP, lets widen the search space to include motives that only incidentally annoy you, even though there is a little bit of (implicit) negativity towards the ratfic-tribe.

It was a failure of imagination on my part, admitted.

  Talking about your intended goal versus the merely foreseen side effects of your post is unlikely to be fruitful so I will happily discard that line of discussion.
#+end_quote

No, it could be plenty fruitful. I don't want to offend, to the extent that I can do that without being completely silent. This is a request not a demand, so I'll completely understand if you refuse, but knowing either 1) where in my post I was most mean, or 2) knowing how I can better convey the non-intendness of any meanness in my header (the fact that you didn't immediately understand what I meant there means it didn't do a good job) would be much appreciated.

Again, this /is/ orthogonal to our topic of discussion, so consider it plenty optional.
