  The world itself dark enough in itself. Even if the world is a better place than in the past, the lives of happy people still contain a lot of conflict, suffering and death.

Exactly! Rational fiction often aims to model what would happen if X, where X is some premise (people get superpowers, a kid gets sucked into a fantasy world, the universe starts running on kabbalah). If conflict, suffering and death happen to real people, they would probably also happen to fake people. In fact, you'd expect it to happen more, since most of the time X increases the capabilities of individuals to effect change, unethical people included.
