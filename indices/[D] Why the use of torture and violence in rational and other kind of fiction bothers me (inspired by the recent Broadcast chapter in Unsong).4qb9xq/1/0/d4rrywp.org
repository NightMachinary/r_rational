I doubt I've read everything that you've written, but I've certainly read most of it, and I'm a fan. Your work, even when violence occurs, is not objectionable in the way Xenograteful is talking about for the Broadcast. The Last Christmas heads in that direction, but it still doesn't go so far.

I think part of the issue with the Broadcast in Unsong is the odd leaps in tone. For example, the Azkaban material in HPMOR gets pretty dark, but it's clear that this is integral to the story and serves to provide core motivations and goals of several major characters. In contrast, Unsong presents the Broadcast bookended in between comedic segments.

If it was more explicitly tied to the motivations and actions of Aaron or the Comet King, etc, it would at least be more understandable. But the story isn't written as a continuous plot timeline, so the result is an appearance of gratuitousness. Being shocking and grotesque for the sake of being shocking and grotesque. It's possible that this was the literary intent of the author, to represent how this broadcast shocked the world when released. I don't think so, though.
