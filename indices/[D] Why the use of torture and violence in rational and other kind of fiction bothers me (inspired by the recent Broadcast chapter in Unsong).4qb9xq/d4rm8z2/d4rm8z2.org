Well the obvious response to this is that since rationalist fiction tries to emulate reality in many ways you can expect at least the levels of horror you find in reality (which is quite a lot).\\
However since many fiction shies away from such things rational fiction may have a tendency to slightly overcompensate, though really not by much.\\
I should also point out that plenty of things in history would be considered a bit gratuitously horrific if they took place in fiction.

There's also the fact that if you are trying to get people to truly fathom what's at stake you may need to actually delve into things in depth. People aren't going to be nearly as affected by horrors that they are merely told about but don't see described.

Lastly it bears mention that it seems as though there's a tendency to be more gratuitous in literature than film because people's imaginations may not be quite as good as actually seeing it on screen. Similarly you might see less explicit horror in VR because it would require less to achieve the same result because you don't feel as removed from it.
