  I am interested by your idea that option #2 emphatically doesn't belong here. I'd imagine that a discussion about what modes of fiction are "pleasurable to read" would be particularly interesting for a community that wants to write well. Engaging with writing involves more than analysis of grand themes and recitation of plot minutia. There's an emotional "affective" component that is often neglected by the more didactic branches of fanfiction (and web fiction more generally). This is largely an artefact of the lack of (professional!) editors.

One could argue that OP's dislike of certain literary tools is anecdotal evidence and thus only marginally relevant, thus explaining [[/u/Altiumbe]]'s opinion that such a thing belongs to a personal blog.
