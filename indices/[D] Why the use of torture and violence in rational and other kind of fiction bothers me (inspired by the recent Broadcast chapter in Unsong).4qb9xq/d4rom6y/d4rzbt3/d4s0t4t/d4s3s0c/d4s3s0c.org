Talking about your intended goal versus the merely foreseen side effects of your post is unlikely to be fruitful so I will happily discard that line of discussion.

I am interested by your idea that option #2 emphatically doesn't belong here. I'd imagine that a discussion about what modes of fiction are "pleasurable to read" would be particularly interesting for a community that wants to write well. Engaging with writing involves more than analysis of grand themes and recitation of plot minutia. There's an emotional "affective" component that is often neglected by the more didactic branches of fanfiction (and web fiction more generally). This is largely an artefact of the lack of (professional!) editors.

If you are offering motives for OP, lets widen the search space to include motives that only incidentally annoy you, even though there is a little bit of (implicit) negativity towards the ratfic-tribe.
