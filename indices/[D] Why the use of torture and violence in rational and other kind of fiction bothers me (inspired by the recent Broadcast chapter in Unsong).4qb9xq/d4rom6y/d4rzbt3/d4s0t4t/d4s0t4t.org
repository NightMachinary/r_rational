I wasn't excusing being mean, I was pointing out I couldn't tell either way. "Apologies if I come off sharp or mean" means "/it's not intentional/" not "/it doesn't matter anymore cause I admit it, right guise/". Being mean clearly isn't my goal, as I could do a much better job of being mean if I actually wanted to be mean. This is the intended meaning of the header.

  discuss the degree to which "rational" stories need to be violent stories

Which isn't at all apparent. This could easily be construed three different ways

- "ratfics are disproportionately dark, and I want to raise awareness of that fact in order to facilitate more non-dark ratfics"

- "I don't like dark fiction"

- "I don't like dark fiction and you should feel bad for liking dark fiction."

- Edit: "I want to discuss the structure of non-dark fics, what they do well, and how better to write them."

Number one is a sound, even respectable reason for creating a thread. Number two belongs on a personal blog, and is completely irrelevant navel-gazing and distracts from the purpose of this sub, which is emphatically not circlejerking about what types of things we like and don't like. Number three is more of the same. Number four was brought in a reply, but I'm skeptical it could even be interpretted as a motive for the OP.

It is my contention that this post is mostly a mix of the first three. To the extent that OP wants to encourage the production of more non-dark fiction, I support him/her, since more things that people like is always good. To the extent OP is just wanting a pat on the pat for liking the right things I don't care, to the extent that this post is about why dark fiction is bad and you should feel bad, I'm merely content to write a short post outlining why every reason he/she produced holds little water.
