Apologies if I come off sharp or mean. I get defensive when people criticize aesthetics I enjoy.

  Torture and violence are things that happen a lot in the real world even now in the year 2016. I just begin to think what the victims would think about if they saw it used in fiction, and whether they'd consider it disrespectful.

In a breath, trigger warnings. Ideally a person doesn't want to see certain content, can just filter the associated tag. Even failing that, if people /really/ don't want to see it, eventually someone'll do something like building their own site where such content is banned. The net effect is not having to see what you don't want to see.

  It's a kind of superstimuli. "Torture porn" is a word for a reason. Like many other types of superstimuli, consuming it and enjoying it makes me feel dirty somehow. And since it's superstimuli, creators will probably try to make it more and more horrifying to make it have the same effect on consumers of fiction as the previous depictions of violence have had. This seems to be a trend in fiction, seeing how bland some earlier forms of fiction were in this regard. Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones have been the most popular shows in recent years and both are really dark.

Superstimuli isn't intrinsically bad, that's a naturalistic fallacy. Science is a superstimulus, modern narrative practice is a superstimulus. Almost any cultural artefact that you and other regularly consume that isn't strictly instrumental is optimized to hit an affective peak. That's good, not bad. Even if my examples don't convince you, I don't think you'd argue [[https://smileyouareon.tumblr.com/][Smile, You Are On Tumblr.com]] isn't a superstimulus, but I also don't think you'd argue it's /anything/ but a good thing.

  The world itself dark enough in itself. Even if the world is a better place than in the past, the lives of happy people still contain a lot of conflict, suffering and death.
#+end_quote

How is this an argument? This is a non-sequitur to me. This is almost like arguing violent video games => more violence, but it doesn't even have the plausible vector of some kind of process. You are taking the darkness of the world as a constant, and [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/28/thank-you-for-doing-something-ambiguously-between-smoking-and-not-smoking/][funging]] against the presence or absence of dark fiction. Your own distaste notwithstanding, people /enjoy/ dark fiction. Removing it would make the world a /worse/ place, not a better one.

#+begin_quote
  I wonder if it's a sign of privilege to enjoy fiction with a lot torture and violence. This is after all one of the longest periods without war in the western world in recent history. I don't think people who've gone through war would like to see the same thing in the fiction they consume. For example the Golden Age of Comic Books wasn't nearly as dark as some of the popular fiction nowadays.

And?

Are you suggesting we allow people who don't like thing to dictate the consumption of media (or lack thereof) that has absolutely nothing to do with them? Granted, making everything as bad as possible for everyone involved /is/ a stable point, but I think we'd all agree allowing others to live and let live is much better.

#+begin_quote
  I become afraid if I will see something like this in the future if a war or some other kind of conflict breaks out, or the world becomes a worse place in some other way. It's harder to enjoy it if you fear it might become reality.
#+end_quote

Have you tried not reading fiction that declares itself to be dark? That Unsong wasn't so marked is a mistake, but I think notably dark fiction declares itself so the majority of the time; for instance see Worm.

#+begin_quote
  Wildbow's stories are probably the worst offenders in this, and I'm not that enthusiastic about them anymore.

More power to you. Don't read stuff you don't want to read.
