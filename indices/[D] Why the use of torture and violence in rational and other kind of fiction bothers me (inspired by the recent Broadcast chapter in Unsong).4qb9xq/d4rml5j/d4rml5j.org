Dude, just chill out. Most of us are capable of relaxing and enjoying this stuff, and I'm pretty sure we're not all irredeemable monsters. Violence may just not be your thing, and that's cool, but what plot device would replace it? There are very few plot devices as versatile and moving as physical violence.

It's important to understand very intrinsically that there is a /difference/ between fictional violence and real violence, just like there's a difference between fictional sex and real sex, and a difference between driving a car and reading a description of a person driving a car. To play on your anxiety for a second: however bad the stuff in stories is, in real life it's a million times worse. Not only that, but the stuff in stories is far removed in terms of accuracy too - fictional characters tend to have a ridiculously high pain threshold. These differences make it entertaining to read violence - it would be a really shitty story if people died from one bullet, like they do in real life, or gave up the location of the rebel base after being tortured. Wildbow's works are less graphically violent and more emotionally subdued. He uses this to move the plot forward, because the characters are constantly seeking higher ground.

I think your speculation about it being a privilege to enjoy torture is wrong. You point out Golden Age comic books, but who's reading those comics? The hardened war vet, or the kid who bought it for ten cents because it was cool? And there are plenty of instances where people traumatized by war enjoyed dark fiction for the accuracy and lessons it conveyed. Saving Private Ryan triggered quite a bit of actual PTSD, but plenty of people praised it for its realistic depictions of war. The same goes for all of the good novels from the lost generation - All Quiet on the Western Front, A Farewell to Arms.
