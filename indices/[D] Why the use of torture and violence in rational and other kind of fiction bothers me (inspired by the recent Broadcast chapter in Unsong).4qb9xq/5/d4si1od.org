Views on rape in GoT from rape survivors. Spoilers, obviously.

[[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/game-of-thrones-has-finally-given-us-survivors-the-rape-scenes-w/]]

They like that we got to see a rape victim confront their rapist.

They don't like dismissive reports of her rape from other fans.

It's used as a lazy tool to show how bad a villain is.

They don't like how it's seen as the worst thing ever that can happen to a person.

They like being triggered and finally getting to feel.

I think you can see from this that there's quite a diversity of views from rape survivors.

I think this says that if you do want to use rape, it should be done tastefully. The negative consequences should be depicted carefully, it shouldn't be overly exaggerated as the worst thing ever or ruining people, it should be a substantive act, not just laser guided rape to show how evil a character is.

  It somehow disturbs me that people are devising imaginative ways to cause misery and torture people, even if it's only fictional.

People do have a huge capacity for cruelty, although TV generally doesn't get that close to the true normal of torture. Part of why I enjoyed worm. Not many stories get really close to the grinding, endless hopelessness of being a fairly powerless and unpopular student in a school which doesn't like you much, where no one cares about your pain.

  It's a kind of superstimuli.

Yep. There's an endless competition to beat the old super stimuli.

  The world itself dark enough in itself. Even if the world is a better place than in the past, the lives of happy people still contain a lot of conflict, suffering and death.

I'd agree with the rape survivor's views on rape in tv- that sometimes you want to be triggered, and that it's a lot more palatable if done tastefully.

I'm reminded of a comment by a friend on why she likes The Walking Dead. It's a world where you can't trust anyone, where you're constantly running. Since that was much of her childhood she appreciates watching a show that closer approximates the emotional reality of her childhood.

With these various traumatic experiences it's fairly common to bury a lot of it, to rationalize it away. It's much easier to get a greater emotional range when you can feel those emotions you locked away again and I for one definitely appreciate the chance to see it when done tastefully.

Soldiers who directly experience war make extensive use of violent video games, especially games like Halo, call of duty.

And many report how without such video games they'd have a lot more ptsd and trauma.

I've not seen any torture porn that really got close to the graphicness of actual war stories I've seen. They have a long way to go before TV things catch up with reality.

Although of course, I'm happy to see more cheerful rational stories as well.
