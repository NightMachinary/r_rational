I'm at the point where I don't think I could be genuinely distressed by much of anything unless someone was really trying. I just assimilated every coping method I've ever read about, and for some reason it worked.

There was this one piece of fiction I read where the main character basically built an entire empire from scratch, and then /lost/, having to start from square one. This was like half the novel, tossed down the toilet. After that, I learned to stop taking losses as hard.
