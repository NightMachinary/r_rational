I want to add another major reason not to use torture in stories:

- It does not work in real life. Most real-life intelligence agencies use psychologically-based interrogation techniques rather than torture because they need information that will turn out true when they check it empirically. Sometimes, they also need the evidence they've obtained via interrogation to hold up in a court of law, as when compelling a mobster or a drug-runner to testify by applying incentives regarding their family, for instance.

I actually also agree regarding the common use of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier?from=Main.GrimDark][Darker and Edgier]] flavoring in fiction, period. There's a very real and palpable difference between /fiction that is trying to be dark/ and the actual darkness of real life.

In real life, your adviser can get gout and your stepfather lymphoma while your wife is ground down into an anxious, depressed, tired, increasingly soulless wreck by her awful job -- in a single year. Yes, that's /my/ year I'm talking about. Meanwhile, in the broader world, the environment is severely damaged, social inequality is off the charts, wars in that one damned region have gotten quite bad, and fascism is creeping up on supposedly developed societies. /Entropy is running/, and right now it's running quickly.

But that's not very suitable for fiction, is it? From a fiction-writer's point of view, all those awful things are just /background details/, and we even sort of expect that no one real person /statistically ought/ to be hit with any great number of personal tragedies all at once. Instead of just being constantly bruised and having bones broken until nothing heals right or completely anymore and pain becomes a constant background fact of life, we expect fictional characters to be healthy and strong right until they are /fucking nuked from orbit/.

Maybe it's good writing for ordinary fiction to have the characters be, effectively, strong and strapping young space marines who suddenly get nuked from orbit and have to fight Lex Luthor's army of undead mutants from Mars to save the world from the Weyland-Yutani company's evil manipulations, but I do think it's bad writing for /rational/ fiction.

Rational fiction ought to inflict its dose of pain, on the characters and on the reader, in the same way real life does. Otherwise, people will keep going through their daily lives thinking that evil comes with a goatee and laughs maniacally about taking over the world, while considering drugs or war or cancer as facts of life to be accepted.
