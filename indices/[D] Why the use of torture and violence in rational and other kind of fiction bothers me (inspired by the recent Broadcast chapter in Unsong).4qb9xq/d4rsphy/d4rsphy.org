There's value in making a strategic decision to avoid dark themes in a work. I don't think there's value in making that decision if it runs counter to a work's integrity. Likewise if the author decides to use dark themes as meaningless superstimuli that don't inspire reader reflection.

I'm waiting for Unsong to finish before I read it, so I'll comment abstractly on the use of torture as a device in rational fiction.

Torture doesn't strike me as a rational choice. It doesn't work. Artful cajoling and psychological manipulation does. A rational work, with rational characters, would employ the latter device. A rational work with irrational characters might employ the former. I'd have no problem with that, with the major caveat that it's shown to not work - in other words, that it's treated realistically.

I'd be happy if rational fiction avoided fetishization. No fetishizing techniques that don't work by e.g. having a character learn the world's secrets by torturing everyone, or by being really nice (might work to a degree, but not on a global scale). If something works, like manipulation, then I'd like to see it handled intelligently, describing the emotional toll on the manipulator if mentally healthy, or showing how to manipulate in a mutually beneficial fashion /a la/ HPMoR and /Lighting Up the Dark/.

In summary, I agree with you in that it's something to which we as consumers and creators should pay attention, but disagree that we should proscribe it entirely. When handled with thought and grace what you describe may serve as a powerful teaching tool.

I do worry though for the desensitized. Does that make them more likely to consider violence justifiable, more likely to credit rationalizations of why real-life violence was necessary?
