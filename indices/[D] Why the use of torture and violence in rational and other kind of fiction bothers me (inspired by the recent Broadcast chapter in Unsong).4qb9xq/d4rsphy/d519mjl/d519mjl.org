  Torture doesn't strike me as a rational choice. It doesn't work. Artful cajoling and psychological manipulation does. A rational work, with rational characters, would employ the latter device. A rational work with irrational characters might employ the former. I'd have no problem with that, with the major caveat that it's shown to not work - in other words, that it's treated realistically.

Yeah, torture is basically the crowning example of dark stuff that /shouldn't/ show up in rational fiction because the characters ought to be smart enough not to use it. If you want to inflict raw pain, torture works; if you want information, get trained by the FBI in psychological interrogation.

Worse, when other factions find out your faction tortured, they tend to bring you up on war-crimes charges unless you are just that imperially powerful.
