Yeah, rational fiction does tend to be overly dark... A attribute this to the writter/reader pool, which is mostly composed of immature 20ish old who feel fustrated IRL not managing to impose their will on the world with their vastly superior intelect! Obviously this doesn't work IRL so they enjoy writting about how they can in fiction. Is it really a wonder if this SI tend to resort to rash violence, usually against someone the authors dislikes IRL...
