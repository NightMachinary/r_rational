I thought the Broadcast worked.

Watching Thamiel subvert the angels or bully Sohu was kind of bad, but it wasn't evil in the same way. Everything else in the world of Unsong is fun. Magic names, Nixon playing the piano, etc... The story of how Hellish Hell actually is important. Otherwise, Thamiel is just the Robot devil from Futurama.
