  Presumably torture gets results, if you have some idea of what the answer is since torture victims would say anything to not be tortured, then they are bound to say the truth too.

The prisoner is obviously going to say what the interrogator wants to hear, which means you'd need to be quite clever to torture a prisoner while still having their resulting utterances be informative evidence rather than plausible untruths you wanted to hear.

There are much more /effective/ interrogation techniques that rely on firm psychological grounding. Real intelligence agencies don't use those because they're being nice, they use them because getting /true/ information out of a prisoner requires keeping their sanity and emotional balance intact /enough/ to avoid its interfering with their testimony when they finally spill.
