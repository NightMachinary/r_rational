  The prisoner is obviously going to say what the interrogator wants to hear, which means you'd need to be quite clever to torture a prisoner while still having their resulting utterances be informative evidence rather than plausible untruths you wanted to hear.

That's why I said confirm things.

Prisoners can't make up names or locations or things like that very consistently. If you have two people being tortured in separate rooms and you ask them to spill the secrets then whatever they say that is consistent is what is the truth. If they make up stuff you want to hear they won't do it consistently.

  There are much more effective interrogation techniques that rely on firm psychological grounding. Real intelligence agencies don't use those because they're being nice, they use them because getting true information out of a prisoner requires keeping their sanity and emotional balance intact enough to avoid its interfering with their testimony when they finally spill.

No true intelligence agency? I didn't say there were not more effective techniques. I said torture can work.
