My evidence is mainly an interview I saw with an American investigator for the FBI or CIA - one of their agencies. He said the best way to extract information is to be reasonable, point out the options available to the prisoner, and sympathetically and approachably cajole them into realizing that divulging information is what they want to do.

I'm really curious how he'd do so if what the person wants most is to not tell their captor anything, and has no other desires. Although I also haven't done much of a research spree and thus rate the evidence as weak, I still think testimony based on a career investigator's expertise stronger than the evidence for torture's effectiveness. If I came across a weightier source that contradicted that investigator, I'd change my mind.
