<nods...> There are going to be things that some people find emotionally satisfying and others find emotionally unsatisfying, for reasons of personal background as well as personality. All are free to stick to what they prefer, and try to encourage more of its type; when something is popular enough, avoiding it may be difficult. Responses to points five and one below:

Point five: '"There are no atheists in foxholes" is not an argument against atheism, but against foxholes.' If life is peaceful enough that people turn to less peaceful forms of entertainment for contrast, this is a good sign. That is to say--it shouldn't be a bad thing that it's a sign of privilege, because privilege is a good thing. We want each generation to be more privileged than the last, privileged to live in a better world/universe than their ancestors had to. Our ideal future descendents are going to be much more 'soft' in that they don't have to deal with the young-person mortality rates that our generation does, and that's a good thing. If they're not privileged, if we keep the same amount of suffering and death to keep the future as underprivileged as the past, that's a tragedy.

Point one: This can be extended to all negative things. Namely, death (where the victim is someone close to someone who has died) or any sort of crime or tragedy. To echo another comment, if you strip out all the truly meaningfully bad things that can happen, you strip out the meaningfulness of people trying to protect something or prevent something. A detective cannot solve a murder (and a reader cannot try to deduce it before the declaration), because of how people close to murder victims might feel. A poor person cannot strive to improve their situation, because of how those who have been poor might feel. A quick thinking person cannot act to save their country from the predations of an aggressive neighbour, because of how people who have suffered in a war might feel. Take away negative aspects and you take away struggle. Take away struggle and you take away the heart of many forms of escapist fiction.

To combine those two, a little: I'd prefer to be in a world where people think about ugly things and have clear impressions of them rather than one where people have averted their eyes from ugly things and are unprepared when they encounter them. To put it another way (and end this post by invoking Godwin's law): even if there are Holocaust survivors who find books which talk about the Holocaust to be disrespectful, there is merit in those books existing so that people who had not encountered it first-hand can know about it and think about it, rather than let it be hidden in darkness.
