I forgot to mention there's also a prophecy that the 'hybrid' (which eventually turns out to be the Doctor + Clara) "Will one day stand in the ruins of Gallifrey. It will unravel the Web of Time and destroy a billion billion hearts to heal its own."

In other words, the Doctor will destroy the world in order to heal his heart, i.e. bring Clara back, something that very nearly happens in Hell Bent. You could almost say he was going to 'Tear apart the stars in heaven' or that he was 'The end of the world'?
