I'm going to take it one notch further and claim that the Whoniverse (yes we really call it that) is if not quite rational, at least hard sci-fi.

Take as the single handwave element a group that gains access to time-travel tech in a [[https://qntm.org/models][Malleable History Model]] spacetime, and from this the following inevitable results occur:

- Said group instantly become capricious demigods by way of modifying their own past.
- Multiple cataclysmic wikipedia-edit-war style conflicts with another time-travel-capable group that rewrite the universe as a whole at random moments.
- Spacetime continuum as a whole under threat on a common basis due to misuse of time-travel tech.
- Causality as a whole becomes sketchy at best.
- 0% probability of major players in any conflict remaining dead once killed
- 0% probability of losing sides in any major conflict remaining defeated permanently

etc.
