Ah, now I remember all the annoying idiosyncrasies that defined the /bad/ and stretched-out Doctor Who episodes.

- kind of a spoiler to recommend it here, but you could also go watch [[#s][███████]] for a similarly designed stable time loop plot.
- if all the other rooms are resetting, shouldn't the diamond3000 room be resetting as well?

  - if the diamond3000 room /wasn't/ being reset, shouldn't there have been massive amounts --- and even that would be an extreme understatement --- of dried blood inside it from all the punch-hard hand injuries?

- if you're going to chisel your way through a hard surface, may as well target /regular/ walls instead of the CGI-ed diamond3000 one.
- since the underwater scenery changes from loop to loop, and the Doctor interacts with this scenery in each default loop iteration, then it shouldn't've really been a stable loop/chain: the skulls would've either overflown the water surface (Doctor dies after jumping out the window and the self-sustaining time chain breaks) or changed Doctor's behaviour largely enough to start changing the default iterations' flow. Same with determining how much time has passed by the position of the stars: “Two billion years, and this is the Hollywood zombie counting!”.
