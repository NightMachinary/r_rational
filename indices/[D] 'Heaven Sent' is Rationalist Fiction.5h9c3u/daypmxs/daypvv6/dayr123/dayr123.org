I guess I worry that foreshadowing- providing hints that have no plot reason to be there- goes too far. If it would have been impossible to solve without contrivances, then well they shouldn't be able to solve it. The reader should have no interest in taking explicit clues from god. The author should find a way to work clues in as a natural part of the world.
