I don't think foreshadowing is the right term for it. It's more like pre-revelations. Before a fact about the past or a character is revealed, there are already hints in the story that allow it to be solved.

An example would be the chapter from Unsong where a drug user gets possessed by something. It features dialogue like "What is your name?" // "KNEEL.", and gives you a hint about the later revelation that Neil Armstrong ("Kneel" Armstrong) became the right hand of God when he fell into heaven. This is especially relevant given Unsong's reliance on pun logic.
