My personal, extreme anti-Clara feelings are that Heaven Sent is good because it doesn't have Clara, while Hell Bent is one huge undeserved love letter to a character and relationship that I never found compelling but kept getting forced down my throat. To me, that kind of made the story pointless even if it was good rationalist fiction.

The only Capaldi episodes I think are /really/ worth watching are *Flatlined*, the only episode where I like Clara, and *The Husbands of River Song* for bringing back the fun and creativity I'd missed from Doctor Who while also developing a character and relationship I wanted to see more of.
