I liked Heaven Sent, but Hell Bent was ruined for me by the fact that I /just hate Clara/. The only episode I ever liked her in was Flatlined, so Hell Bent felt less like a proper send off and more like Moffat refusing to let go of his Mary Sue without giving her as much of a Mary Sue ending as possible. I know the Doctor is supposed to be irrationally obsessed with her, but I never liked that because I never liked Clara.
