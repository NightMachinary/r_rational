I liked Clara initially and steadily less so as the story warped around her, but still not actual hatred. Even in Hell Bent I wasn't truly annoyed until the ending, which turned the Mary Sue dial up to 11.

The only way to redeem the ending in my opinion is to have dire consequences in the next season.
