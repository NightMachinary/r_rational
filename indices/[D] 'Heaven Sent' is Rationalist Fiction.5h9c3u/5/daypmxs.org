  foreshadowing (another trope of rationalist fiction).

Really? It shouldn't be? Reality doesn't announce its attacks in advance. I'm guessing most foreshadowing in rationalist fiction is incontinence. The author knows what's going to happen, cause they've plotted it in advance, sometimes they leak more than they should, can't help themselves.
