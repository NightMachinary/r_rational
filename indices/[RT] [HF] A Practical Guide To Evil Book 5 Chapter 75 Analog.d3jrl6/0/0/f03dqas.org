The White Knight was raised in opposition to the Black Knight Who Was. For decades, the Black Knight demonstrated that no ordinary Hero could be raised to stop him. No enraged child swinging a sword could put a scratch on Black, no matter how powerful their Aspects.

And so the Heavens built a better Hero. Genuinely charming, even with his nominal enemies. Perfectly humble, so as never to abuse his power. Intelligent, to consider that his enemies are allowed to be smart, to think about what a smart enemy of his might do. Inspiring, to collect powerful individuals to him and so build an army.

He would have been a powerful foe for the Black Knight. Too bad nobody with that Name exists.

Now that I think of it, that might have been Amadeus' plan. He'd fought Hanno. He knew what he was capable of through his spies. He obviously recognized the story implied in their Names. He always did avoid getting into stories.

After all, the first time he fell into one, Captain died.

So, in order to survive, he broke the story. Burned up his Name, allowed himself to be captured. If there's no Black Knight, there's nobody for the White Knight to triumph over.
