  The White Knight was raised in opposition to the Black Knight Who Was.

My read of the story is that Hanno was meant to be a foil to Catherine when she eventually became the Black Knight. Black even states after fighting Hanno in the free cities that Hanno didn't seem to have the narrative weight for something like BK vs WK, and that the scope of his story at that time was small, as if he would not be one of the principal actors in the story. That explains why they didn't form a pattern of three.

  Inspiring, to collect powerful individuals to him and so build an army. Genuinely charming, even with his nominal enemies.

While I think the inspiring kinda comes as part of being a hero, we haven't seen him make an effort to be charming. What attracts people to him is that he is not automatically prejudiced, and has the sense of peace to him that comes from the self assurance after giving up his right to judgement to the choir.

Similarly, we have not seen him being particularly intelligent against adversaries. I think his second fight with Black proves that. He spent so much time studying others' battles with Black, and seeing their opinions of him forming his strategy, instead of forming HIS OWN opinions on the matter. If so, he would have noticed that Black always uses tailor made strategies against his opponent, and wasn't above cheating Providence, and always uses stories to get an edge. He focussed only on the Martial aspect and forgot the wider narrative aspect and got victories that were only technically so.

It has been mentioned multiple times that Above prefers their tools to be powerful, but dim, and while Hanno has grown on me as a character and gotten some wisdom, he still, atleast to me, remains somewhat unexceptional for now.

And the idea that Black Burnes up his name as a counter to Hanno, while intriguing, is also ludicrous since Black didn't seem to have a good opinion of WK, and the name being Burned up was Below's doing in order to make him a claimant to the tower.
