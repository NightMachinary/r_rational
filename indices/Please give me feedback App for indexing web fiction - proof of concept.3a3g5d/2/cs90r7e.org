It's a good start - the indexing model seems solid and I like the style. I think there are two critical aspects to get it off the ground:

1. Discovery - if you can get a (moderated?) system of tags and recommendations working, the site has real value.

2. Content - some combination of automated scraping and moderator/admin review. What degree of curation do you want to enforce?
