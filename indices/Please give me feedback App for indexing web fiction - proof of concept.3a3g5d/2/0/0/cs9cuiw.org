  Hmm... I'm torn about this. I want to encourage anyone to write, because that's what's cool about self-publishing in the first place. But it would also be nice to have some kind of list you can trust: everything on it is pretty good. Maybe some kind of "top page" vs "new" thing like reddit.

Maybe have public and private listings? Public listings are curated (to some degree); private listings can be scraped on demand.
