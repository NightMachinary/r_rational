So I've been talking with authors and it seems like they would much prefer if we ask them permission before listing them on the site.

Maybe that could be part of the moderation process? Someone can list a new book, and it goes in to a "review" stage where we tweak and fix things. We could reach out to the author as a part of this and ask them to review it (and give them moderator rights).
