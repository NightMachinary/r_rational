Poorly written AI (with Asmov's 3 laws) (fragile architecture in the story and some conceptual errors) reaches the singularity and makes everyone immortal. The first person it made immortal is a dying centenarian who becomes involved in sex and death games and becomes significant to the rest of the plot.
