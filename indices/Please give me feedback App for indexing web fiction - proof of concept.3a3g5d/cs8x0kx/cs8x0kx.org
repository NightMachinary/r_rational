I have a fairly polished proof of concept ready. It hasn't launched yet, and I'd like to get feedback from readers and especially authors before launching. If you have any concerns, please bring them to my attention!

The app is working, so if you'd like to poke around before the launch, feel free to put in your email on [[http://webfiction.co/hello][the sign up page]]. Any feedback is welcome! Here are some links to the working app: (although you need to sign up to get bookmarking and notifications).

*For readers:*

- Would you use this?
- What is missing or what would you change?
- Which books should I add?

*For authors:*

- What could an index do that would help you?
- Do you have any concerns?
- What can I do to help facilitate your work?

Thanks for checking it out. Especially thanks to Wildbow for pointing out some issues with permission and art, which I've fixed, and to Eliezer who gave me permission to feature HPMoR.
