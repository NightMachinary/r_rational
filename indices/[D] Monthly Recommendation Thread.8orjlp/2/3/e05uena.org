I mean, I wouldn't say that /James and the Giant Peach/ is a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's /so much better/ than /so many things/ that going so far as saying "it is the thing [you] hate most" seems pretty irrational. Have you ever seen any of Michael Bay's /Transformers/ movies? How about /The Emoji Movie/? Adam Sandler's /Jack and Jill/? /Howard the Duck/? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKAwXLVxuZQ][Tommy Wiseau's /The Room/]]?

What is it about /James and the Giant Peach/ that makes you hate it so much?

EDIT: Also, you didn't say "the movie/book/show/game/whatever-other-medium-of-narrative-delivery you hate most," you said "the thing you hate most." Racism? Income inequality? FGM in third-world countries? The holocaust? Death? And "the thing you hate most" is a semi-psychedelic movie about a little boy who travels around the world in a giant hollow piece of fruit with a gang of giant semi-anthropomorphized bugs?

(I understand hyperbole. I "hate" Minecraft/Fortnite youtubers who make clickbait for children, and I "hate" pickles and I "hate" mustard and I "hate" people who think it isn't a hate-crime to put pineapple on pizza, and I "hate" Generation Z's entire culture (what with the fidget spinners and dabbing and meaningless memes and all). Just pointing out how silly it is to say you hate a movie more than literally everything else.)
