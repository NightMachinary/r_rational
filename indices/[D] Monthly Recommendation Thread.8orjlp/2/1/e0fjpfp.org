If you liked Seventh Horcrux, check out [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]] by the same author - it's not on fanfiction.net so you might not have come across it before. It's a similar sort of hilarity, but for the Naruto fandom instead, and has a few rational-adjacent running jokes (especially with regards to doublethink).
