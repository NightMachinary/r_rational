Have you read [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]]? I just finished it and really enjoyed it. It's slightly heavy on worldbuilding as opposed to character development, and I think at least part of your potential enjoyment of it will correlate with how much you enjoy puns, but it's definitely entertaining. If you enjoy feeling like an author is much, much smarter than you are, it will scratch that itch. If you also happen to enjoy references to obscure Jewish trivia, well, happy day.j

I suggest it not because it is very like any of those things you say you enjoyed, but because I've enjoyed those same things and really liked Unsong. Except for Troll 2. YMMV.
