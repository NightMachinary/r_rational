The quote means that Time Braid's differences from Chunin Exam Day are similar to the differences between Methods and Partially Kissed Hero, so it's Time Braid being compared to HPMOR.

Chunin Exam Day (Naruto) and Partially Kissed Hero (Harry Potter) are both really bad, enjoyable maybe if you've spent an entire childhood frustrated at the problems in the respective canon but still aren't old/well-read enough to have taste. They address the problems of canon by incessantly bashing everything that irks the author while making the protagonist into an unstoppable Mary Sue with very questionable morals.

Chunin Exam Day and Partially Kissed Hero are vents for author frustrations and power fantasies. HPMOR and Time Braid are coherent stories with proper characterization and themes and the works, even though a first glance might indicate they're similar to their badfic counterpart.
