  yes Perfect Lionheart's politics and opinions *do* end up making his work just that bad.

Maybe we're talking at cross-purposes. I consider /CED/ and /PKH/ to be "good", /not only/ because they're /cool/ (like /Methods of Rationality/), /but also/ because they're /fun/ (like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7325839][/Not Stalking Zuko/]]). In /CED/, when I see Naruto set up new and inventive ways for Gaara to brutally torture, maim, and kill Sasuke on a stage in front of thousands of cheering Shadow Clones (plus a few confused genin), I chuckle, because that's [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_the_Line_Twice][Crossing the Line Twice]]: it's so over-the-top that it's funny. The Shintenshin-induced incontinence, on the other hand, falls flat because it's not outrageously flamboyant but merely pathetically petty. /CED/ is a /combination/ of hilariously-over-the-top bashing and fascinating ideas (/e. g./, "Lightning-nature chakra actually is an ancient kekkei-genkai combination of fire and air" or "Suffusing a patch of earth or river with your chakra is a good chakra-control exercise"). The same goes for /PKH/, except that /PKH/'s bashing never drops to /CED/'s level of pettiness (and, IIRC, /PKH/'s harem shenanigans aren't as boring as /CED/'s): it remains consistently entertaining right up to the end.

  author's notes in fanfiction are part of the medium

Absolutely not. The story is the story, and the notes are the notes.

  Also lol about nuking ports and airfields and manufacturing centers but not committing horrific acts on the civilian populace; where exactly do you think these locations are located?

That wasn't the part with which I was expressing disagreement in my previous comment.* Rather, I was rebutting your statements that (1) Harry and his allies "*committ[ed]* crimes against humanity" (they didn't) and (2) the people who actually executed those acts were "*lauded* for" them (they weren't).

*Still: Since when does mutually-assured destruction count as "crimes against humanity"? (Unfortunately, I don't have time to research the question at this moment.)
