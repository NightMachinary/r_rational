A crime against humanity is "a deliberate act, typically as part of a systematic campaign, that causes human suffering or death on a large scale." Specifically under the rome statute of the international criminal court, "For the purpose of this Statute, â€˜crime against humanity' means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack: Murder;"

I would dispute entirely that the fic is funny or well written, because I'm entirely convinced that it isn't, but I'm honestly not interested in arguing that particular point here since I only have so many spoons and the other half of the argument, that the "heroes" in his stories are endemically awful, is more important.

I honestly think your line about it in you paragraph isolates perfectly just how nasty they are, but here's a few more: PKH Harry causes Snape to bludgeon himself to death in the middle of a class by torturing him with legilimency. He also goes on to torture basically everyone else who works with dumbledore that he can't mind control away, and uses an advanced form of magical mind control on >50 members of the cast in the form of turning them into fairies that are magically under his control.

CED, meanwhile, has Tsunade, among others, perform the whole laundry list of unethical medical experiments on non-consenting kidnap victims. Naruto Steals family memorabilia and heirlooms and sells them out of entirely unjustfiied spite. Everyone tortures Sasuke (lots of times, lots of the "heroes" doing this), who I migth add is basically innocent of anything at this point, and a minor to boot.

I went to go look for more, but reading through some of the later chapters looking for stuff that I had forgotten was starting to actually make me sick. This shit is absolutely vile.
