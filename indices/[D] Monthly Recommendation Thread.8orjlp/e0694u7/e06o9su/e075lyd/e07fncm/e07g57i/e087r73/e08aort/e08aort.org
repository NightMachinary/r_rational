  The problem with CED and PKH is that they're excellent plot ideas written with good grammar... by someone incredibly awful.

I'm rolling my eyes pretty hard right now. If I avoided fun books written by "awful" people, I wouldn't be able to read /Ender's Shadow/ or /Atlas Shrugged/, would I?

  the protagonist is lauded for committing crimes against humanity like nuking civilian centers all over the middle east and in Russia

False. In the first place, neither Harry nor any of his allies /intentionally/ caused the nuclear war. It just so happened that the Muggles went into a worldwide panic after Hermione (accidentally) and Alice (intentionally) shattered the Statute of Secrecy. In the second place, no one was /praised/ for the destruction of the Muslim world and of several Russian "ports", "airfields", and "manufacturing or control centers". It was merely noted in passing (unless you count the author's Islamophobic rant in Chapter 99, which was entirely contained in an author's note and was echoed by no one in the story).
