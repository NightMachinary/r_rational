I recently had the opportunity to buy [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/41825][the entire 18-book Recluce series]] for $3 per book.* I found the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185253][first]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185200][third]] books to be worth four-star ratings (they included some interesting intermittent digressions into woodworking and metalworking, respectively, in addition to having fun stories), but the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185251][second]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185197][fourth]] books were three-star /at best/, and the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/618243][fifth]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185224][sixth]] books have been two-star embarrassments, with (in my opinion) too much filler and too little action. I've taken a (possibly-permanent) break from the sixth book in favor of finally reading /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711][A Fire Upon the Deep]]/* (four stars? five? I can't remember) for the second time.

Most of the offers are trash even if you deactivate all the checkboxes except "Deals from my Want to Read shelf" and "Genre: Fantasy and Science Fiction", but you rarely /will/ be alerted to a discount on a book, or even a /series/ of books, that you actually want to read.

Reminder: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] is an awesome story. Yudkowsky-sama himself [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/5193644/31/1/][has stated]] (=Ctrl=+=F= "Less Wrong"):

  ...this is almost exactly to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][/Ch[u]nin Exam Day/]] what [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108][/Methods of Rationality/]] is to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][/Partially Kissed Hero/]].

  Well done, well said, and well ended.
