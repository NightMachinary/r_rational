I want to take a moment to recommend the website FimFiction.net, the website for My Little Pony fanfiction. My interest in the fandom has waned, but it's just such an incredibly well designed and easy to use website compared to just about every other content website out there. You can search by total views, total likes, like/dislike ratio, genre, characters, wordcount, it's just so easy compared to everything else. And the quality search function is just the beginning of what it offers. I don't know how much someone who isn't familiar with My Little Pony will get out of it, but I wanted to put this message out there.

[[http://thezombieknight.blogspot.ca/][The Zombie Knight]]: A fic about an alternate universe where there are spirit-things called Reapers that can revive people from the dead and give them superpowers. Very funny, lots of action, good world building. Unfortunately inconsistent, but it's not too bad and the author does a decent job of retconning.

[[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods are Bastards]]: A fantasy novel that originally presents itself as also a western, but besides for one arc is mostly about industrilization and the effects of increasing globalization, interconnectedness, and various social justice movements in addition to the standard fantasy fare. The main plot is around university students who are all learning to be adventures and have appropriate backgrounds, e.g are the chosen champions of gods or one is a pirate princess. There are multiple sub plots focusing on other characters however.
