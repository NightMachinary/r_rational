Fimfiction is great! Not much into MLP anymore but I enjoyed the optimalverse stories and am now hooked on the daily updates of The Maretian ("what if the MLP space programme got stranded on Mars at the same time Mark Watney did?").

It's such a great interface on mobile too - shows you how far through the chapter you are, for example. Love it.
