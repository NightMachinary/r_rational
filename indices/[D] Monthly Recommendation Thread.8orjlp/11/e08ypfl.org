Wouldn't call it rational by any stretch, but I've been enjoying the manga Hoshino Close Your Eyes. / Hoshino me wo tsubate

For a harem rom com, it's got surprisingly good writing. It's about a antisocial loner getting roped into doing makeup for a girl in his class who leads a double life - her pretty popular made up self and her unfettered athletic unmade up aelf. Essentially it's a super hero story from the POV of the secret keeper, but the super hero plot is merely a device to explore the coming of age story.

Probably what I'm most enjoying is the theme of (personal) identity, the different roles we take with various people we interact with, and balancing that with vulnerability in relationships. Echoes a lot of themes in Ward, appropriately enough.

It's probably the best harem rom com I've read snice Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa/My Monster Secret , which is decidedly not rational (all of the characters are loveable idiots - indeed thwir most threatening antagonist is explicitly acknowledged in story as so fearsome be cause they're not an idiot), but it's got one of the best endings in any media I've experienced in recent memory.
