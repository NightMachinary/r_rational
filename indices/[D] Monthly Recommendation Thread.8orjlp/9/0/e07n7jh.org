Funnily enough, such stories seem to be in short supply when it comes to manga. The only two I know of are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toriko][Toriko]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter][Hunter x Hunter]]. But they don't /quite/ fit since Toriko's about hunting food not treasure, Hunter x Hunter doesn't spend too much time on hunting treasure (the characters are often doing something else despite it being their job), and both of them require the characters to be superhuman in a way that Indiana Jones can't. I would LOVE a manga about a treasure hunter who /isn't/ superhuman in some way.
