Have you given [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik%C5%8D][Yokohama Shopping Trip]] a read? It's a 14 volume manga.

Up front, it doesn't outright fit the boxes you selected, but is adjacent to them in a. lot of ways. It's about a gynoid/robot managing a small caf√©. There are occasional guests, but much of the story is about her traveling, experiencing the world around her, and keeping her friendship with her neighbours. the story is very much low on dialogue (whole chapters with but a few words uttered), with lots of scenic images. Much of the science fiction could very well be fantasy (there are streetlamp plants, for instance, and other creatures). On TVT the setting is described as a /cozy catastrophe/ and /humankind in decline/, which appears to be true, but another way to look at it would be mankind passing the baton of exhilarating advancement to their children and leaning back in their rocking chair. There're also quite a few peculiarities in the setting that aren't ever explained to the reader,

So... there are checkmarks in pastoral scenes and slice of life, and science fiction is more conceptually expressed than hard. The pacing is very measured (some might say slow), and consumption shouldn't be rushed.

There's also an OVA adaptation, but I don't remember how I felt about that one. The manga was published outside of Japan only in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, so you'd have to look for translation elsewhere. Incidentally, it also won the Seiun award, a very noteworthy speculative fiction award in Japan (other winners, for comparison: /Japan sinks/, /Legend of Galactic Heroes/, /Empire of Corpses/)

To be frank: YKK is one of my favourite manga, definitely in the top ten and a good contender for first place, so I am a fairly biased in my recommendation.
