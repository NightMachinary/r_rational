If you want slice-of-life, then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6417590/1/What-I-Learned-at-SRU][What I Learned at SRU]] definitely qualifies as a fantastic college AU of Avatar.

There is also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/everyday-life-as-a-supporting-character-monmusu-si.358222/][Everyday Life as a Supporting Character]] which involves a self-insert into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Musume][Monster Musume]]. While shenanigans happen, it's much more focused on daily life.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8603173/chapters/19729273][Tabloid]] is about an OC PRT photographer who explores the effects of parahumans on society. It's heavily focused on world-building, slice of life, and comedy/drama. Fanfic of Worm.
