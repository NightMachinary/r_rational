I've heard a lot about Dune and my school has some copies that I might be able to borrow. I'll need to ask my teacher about it, because he was telling our class that using texts that english teachers know about can make them mark harsher since they have a better understanding of it already (so they can notice flaws) and they have other students to compare us to.

I'll check out Red Mars as well, thanks!!
