I think that's unfair, the end of season 2 shows that they have done some very clever things about the bad guy. As far as the personal struggle, another way I describe the show is "imagine if 8 really good dramas were interconnected and joined" - so I think that's a feature rather than a bug, getting to watch / enjoy each character's story.

The group orgies is something that the show got a reputation for that is pretty unearned, I mean yes they happen but they occupy the same amount of "sex scene" time that something like GoT has in its run time, and I think they're very beautiful / artistic / poetic like a renaissance painting in motion rather than gratuitous.

But anyway, YMMV, and if you are really averse to sexual content then it's not the show for you.
