I'd like some audio book recommendations so I can use up a backlog of audible credits.

I'm in a mood for fantasy /scifi books with fast or adventure-y plots, especially if there's a good narrator. (Dresden Files was amazing)

The big limit is that I like smart characters, but, because of life circumstances, I'll be listening to the book in small chunks and might be splitting my attention between it and kids.

Short witty scenes are great, since I can drop in and enjoy them. I'm going to miss too much to enjoy a sprawling plot or vast cast of characters.
