I recently listened to the audible edition of [[https://www.amazon.com/Orconomics-Satire-Dark-Profit-Saga-ebook/dp/B00O2NDJ2M][Orconomics]]. It was featured on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56r15v/dcrtbook_orconomics/][/r/rational ~1 year ago]], and it's sequel just dropped. It features a dungeons and dragons world taken over by investors, money, and "heroes". [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund][Plunder-funds]], Hero-firms, and a racist (literally! - blame the elves!) class-system have formed oligopolies, capturing the world economy and driving heroes to quest to make ends meet, driving up prices everywhere, and mass-producing relics. I was particularly amused by jabberwock references, like "Vorpal Corp".

It's quite self-aware, funny, and altogether too real fantasy reflection of our own world.
