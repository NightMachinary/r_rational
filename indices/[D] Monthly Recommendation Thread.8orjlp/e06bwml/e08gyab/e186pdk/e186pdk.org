Wow... is the author 13?

And this is not the first (or even second) light novel I've read were mid-20s to early-30s is considered "old" and "once-beautiful".

/Release that Witch/ describes a character named Scroll the same way.

Other than that, I am enjoying the story so far, so I'll tentatively second this rec.
