Hi, if you still need another recommendation give [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77507.Red_Mars][Red Mars]] or [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234225.Dune?from_search=true][Dune]] a try. Both books deal a lot with people reacting and changing their environment, and in both they seem to have a love-hate relationship with it.

edit: Dune in particular would be interesting.

- The protoganist starts his journey by leaving an ocean planet and going to a desert one.
- One of the themes of the novel is this idea that people are products of their environments, and thus the best soldiers in the galaxy come from the most hostile environments.
- Another relevant concept (explored more in the sequels) is the idea that by terraforming the world into a better, more welcoming environment, the inhabitants become a softer, self-indulgent, all-around worse people.
