Yeah, Dune is on the extension english list of texts, so to the marker it will look like I studied Dune in extension english and then used it as a related text in the topic I'm currently doing (which is looked down upon). My teacher says that even the sequels will appear like I was doing extra reading for Dune, and not actually picking a personal text.
