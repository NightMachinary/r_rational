I need an english text of my choosing and I was wondering if our subreddit could offer something nice. My topic is based on landscapes and people's relationships with them, but the landscapes can be any type (urban, natural, homely) of any form, (real, remembered or imagined). I'm looking for something that shows people's interaction with different landscapes and how they are affected by them. Any genre, any text type (except non-fiction, since we are already using a non-fiction text). Even oblique examples such as games and podcasts could work well if they explore landscapes (Elder Scrolls was an interesting suggestion)
