Being written by an awful person doesn't /automatically/ make a book awful - it's not a first order effect - but it does greatly increase the probability because awful politics and opinions getting expressed through the work greatly moves a book closer to being awful. Ender's Shadow is a worse book than it would have been without the politics, and I'm really not sure what makes Atlas Shrugged enjoyable, but those cases aren't what we're dealing with here because yes Perfect Lionheart's politics and opinions *do* end up making his work just that bad.

Two major problems with this counterargument. First off, Harry and co are very explicitly held up within the narration and narrative as the great heroes of this stage; in typical PL fashion his charachters are "the best", and thus all that narrative atta-boying translates directly into narrative approval for their acts. Add in the authorial rants and the approval is pretty blatant; while death of the author does hold sway, author's notes in fanfiction are part of the medium and thus directly impact the story itself.

Also lol about nuking ports and airfields and manufacturing centers but not committing horrific acts on the civilian populace; where exactly do you think these locations are located?
