The problem with CED and PKH is that they're excellent plot ideas written with good grammar... by someone incredibly awful. Like, even leaving aside the story flaws like the complete lack of tension and how utterly stupid anyone who isn't the protagonist or one of their harem members is, or how the story constantly lies to you about what's happening, or all the bashing, or all the really dumb contrivances, the storys' politics are just unbelievably awful. I honestly don't have the time or inclination to reread them to make a remotely comprehensive list, but PKH is the story where the protagonist is lauded for committing crimes against humanity like nuking civilian centers all over the middle east and in Russia.
