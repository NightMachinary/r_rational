[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kansas-city-shuffle-fate-grand-order-dresden-files.536308/]] A great Dresden Files / nasuverse crossover; it's not really rational, but its got consistantly smart characters and a really creative fusion of the settings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon]] In a similar vein, a Nasuverse / Mass Effect fic that I think quite a few people here would enjoy.

There's clearly beena lot of research into the timeframe, to the point that the world just feels real; even the dc elements have a depth to them thats complete enough and with just the tinge of the bizarre that makes it feel like an actual history. Best of all, the infodumps are pretty seamless and well spread out throughout the story.
