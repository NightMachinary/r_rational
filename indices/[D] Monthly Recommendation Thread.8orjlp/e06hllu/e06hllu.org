I'm going to quickly pop in and recommend Sense8, which is going to have its finale released on the 8th of June. I'm looking forward to it and dreading it at the same time. It's a great story by the Wachowskis and JMS and they intended a 5 season arc, but early reviews of the finale state that it's a very good finale.

Episode 4 is widely considered the place where it becomes clear what the series is about, so if you watch it and don't like it at first but want to give it a chance, episode 4 is where it begins to show its potential.

I think rational will like it because although it isn't primarily a rational story, munchkinry is a clear focus.
