It may not be a typical harem but it is definitely similar.

The "No OP powers" is debatable. The author does do a good job of leveling up enemies along with the protag, but the protag wins a bit more often that I would like.

That being said, release that witch is better than most isekais. Uplifting a medieval civilizatoin is straight up [[/r/rational]]'s alley.
