I love the Harvest Moon series, and put a good number of hours into Stardew Valley, which is essentially a Harvest Moon clone. Animal Crossing too, though I haven't played any since the Gamecube era. I've also been playing My Time at Portia, which fills the same niche, though I think I want to wait until it's out of beta and feature complete, because there's some stuff noticeably missing right now.
