I sometimes ponder what the ingredients are to a successful story. I figure TWI has many things going for it: A plot that feeds the demand for the isekai genre. A story and style that's familiar and comfortable to digest for the ravenous hordes of readers from the litRPG/light-novel/xianxia communities (which also happen to be among the biggest commercialized mediums online). A likeable /and/ unpredictable protagonist. A plot trajectory that's mainstream and "safe" for a wide audience (lately it's been very HFY), yet has cliffhangers and plot twists aplenty (readers eat it up).
