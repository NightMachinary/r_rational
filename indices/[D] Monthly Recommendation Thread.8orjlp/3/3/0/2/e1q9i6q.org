If you didn't like the first few chapters, you probably wouldn't enjoy the rest, since I think the main appeal of TWI is the whimsical, charming protagonist and the way pirateaba channels her unpredictability in the isekai.

It's fantasy slice of life junk food, very easy to swallow if you like the main character. Sort of like a light novel, but slightly more rational.
