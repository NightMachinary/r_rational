*[[https://wanderinginn.com/2016/07/27/1-00/][The Wandering Inn]]* is about half Slice of Life, about a fantasy litRPG world that several earthlings have recently been teleported to. Two protagonists that the story switches between, Erin and Ryoka, and I've always thought of it as two different stories with different genres and goals being told side-by-side. Erin's story is very Slice of Life and an absolute joy to read.
