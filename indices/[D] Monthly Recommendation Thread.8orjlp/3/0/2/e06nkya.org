I'll have to give Spice and Wolf a shot; it's one of those things that I've seen recommendations for a fair amount, and put on a list somewhere, but the list got lost.

FWIW, I would consider Glimwarden pastoral in setting, as it takes place in a small(ish) town surrounded by farmland and is a bit cozy in that sense ... but not really pastoral in terms of the archetype. I really /should/ reread it though, since it's been some time (too long).

(There have been a couple of different studies that show writing things down makes us less likely to remember them, which I think is definitely the case for me; stories that mostly living in the brain stay there, while stories that go onto the page tend to vanish.)
