If I can comment on a work in progress, I don't think you need to escalate the level of conflict in Glimwarden as much as you might think.

I really liked the early narrative based on concepts of maturation and finding/making a place for yourself within the context of this isolating, resource-limited world. I also enjoyed the magic system munchkinry and mystery box elements of the increasing threat, but there's friction between those and the early narrative that relies on the status quo as context. My completely unsubstantiated guess is that friction was behind the burnout/hiatus.
