For gambling manga:

You've already read Kaiji and Gambling Emperor Zero, and if you like those basically everything else written by Fukumoto will probably also be up your alley.

If you aren't sick of Mahjong yet Tetsunaki no Kirinji is pretty good.

If the fanservicey stuff like Gamble Fish doesn't put you off Kakegurui is probably worth a try.

For less gambly more mind gamey stuff I liked Spiral: Suiri no Kizuna. For very edgy mind games Tomodachi Game was decent.

Might edit more in later, I feel like I'm drawing a blank for more similar titles.
