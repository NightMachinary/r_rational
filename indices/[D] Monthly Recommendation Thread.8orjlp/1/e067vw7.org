I've recently read through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiji_(manga][Kaiji]]) manga series and I'm craving more gambling style manga. Similar examples would be Gamble Fish, Liar Game, and Gambling Emperor Zero.

I'm also requesting fanfiction of Temeraire. Dragons in the military are so much fun to read about.

I suppose I should provide recommendations as well right? There is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14686974/chapters/33934212][Chili Pepper Mint]] which is fanfic of [[http://sadehall.tumblr.com/][/The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatues/]]/,/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/13/Harry-and-Hermione-Starring-in-The-Digital-Revolution][Harry and Hermione Starring in the Digital Revolution]] has recently updated, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/advice-and-trust-nge.8768/][Advice and Trust]] which is a beautifully written romance between Asuka and Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion where they are actually rational about their Hollywood-like romance.
