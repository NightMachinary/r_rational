For fans of Mother of Learning, or if you are intrigued by the Chinese Xianxia/Wuxia stories but don't enjoy the poor writing, try the Cradle series by Will Wight. His 5th book just came out the beginning of this month, called Ghostwater, on Amazon. First book is called Unsouled. The genre is fantasy/adventure/action, and the magic system is pretty well developed and thought out. Lots of great fighting scenes and humor thrown in, and great characters.

The latest book is creating a lot of hype for his followers, so I am also looking for recommendations of other fantasy adventures people might have while I wait for the next book to come out.
