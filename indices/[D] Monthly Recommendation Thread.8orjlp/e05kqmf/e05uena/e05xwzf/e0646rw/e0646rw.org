I see. That /is/ a thing kids do. I went through a phase when I was 3 years old, where I played /Mary Poppins/ multiple times a day, multiple days a week, for a period of time that I'm not in a position to estimate. I did the same thing with Disney's /Robin Hood,/ and Rob Evans' /The Donut Man/ videos, and god only knows what else.

I edited my first reply just before you posted your reply to my reply, so, yeah, I get "hyperbole." But, objectively speaking, /James and the Giant Peach/ is /not/ trash. /Norm of the North/ is trash. Whatever all this /Minions/ stuff is, it's trash. "Youtube Kids" is trash.

Out of curiosity, had you seen the movie before your cousin over-exposed you to it? What age were you? Have you seen it since then? If so, how long after your initial over-exposure?

Sorry, but I really am fascinated at such an extreme negative emotional response to such a benign movie.
