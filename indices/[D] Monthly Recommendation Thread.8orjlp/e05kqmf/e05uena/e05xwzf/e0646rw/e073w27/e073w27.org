  Whatever all this Minions stuff is, it's trash.

Hey, the original Despicable Me was a great movie and even the spinoff movie itself was still quite enjoyable. They may have gone a teeny tiny bit incredibly overboard with the marketing for all the peripheral minions merch, but those two movies are not deserving of all the hate they get from the internet.
