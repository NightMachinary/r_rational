  I would pick any other movie to watch if it meant I did not have to see James and the Giant Peach another time.

I mean, there's a /lot/ of movies floating around out there.

(Content warning: That's a "horror" "movie;" I've only seen it once (as part of Achievement Hunter's "Theater Mode" show (it's a lot like Mystery Science Theater 3000)) but I'm pretty sure there's a little bit of mild gore; also, that's a link to a playlist with 150 full "movies" (I seriously doubt any single one of them had a budget higher than $5,000) and almost all of them are sh***y "horror" "movies," so if you go randomly clicking around (which you aren't going to do because you're not going to watch that movie because it's /objectively/ terrible and so are all the other ones, but /content warning/ regardless) then don't be surprised if you see something that you might rather not.)

Though I don't know, now that I think about it; you listed Troll 2 and The Room as pretty high up on your list, so you might actually /like/ this stuff.
