Go through the rational faq for recommended works. Some of the shorter stories were great. Branches of the Tree of Time, the MLP one, A Bluer Shade of White. I also enjoyed Shadows of the Limelight and Time Braid. Active stories on here Worth the Candle and Practical Guide to Evil are highly recommended.

One story I greatly enjoy but is not quite rational is Taint. [[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/]]
