What would you do, if you had could create and shape forcefields.

The device doing this would be at least 1/10 of the size of the forcefields. and lets say has the density of steel.

You couldn't create forcefields inside most solid matter. (but you could create knives and drills..)

Just one thing, forcefield generators rarely randomly turn off. You can restart them with no problem. But nobody knows how to fix this. And not fixable.
