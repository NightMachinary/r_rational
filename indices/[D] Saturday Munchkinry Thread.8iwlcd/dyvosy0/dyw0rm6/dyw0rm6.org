Forcefields are usually two-dimensional, and devices three-dimensional, so what do you mean by size?

If you can overlay forcefields for redundancy, you could use them for structures. A material with invulnerability and a redundancy multiple of a tenth of the density of steel might make for good, say, spaceships. Unmanned vehicles like drones don't even need the redundancy, you just lose a small fraction of your fleet over time.
