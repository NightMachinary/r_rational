  Or for cooking utensils.

Hmmmm... now I'm imagining a handle with a set of buttons. Push /this/ one and it's a very sharp knife, push /that/ one and it's a spatula, a third choice makes it a salad spoon, or a soup ladle... or maybe it would be better with a dial for selection and a button to activate.

Never a pot or a pan, though. That's just looking for trouble.

  But I guess you would use it for temporary bridges and roads.

No, I wouldn't. Because the best way to turn a minor emergency into an absolute disaster is to have one of the ambulances suddenly dropped into the river when the bridge vanishes...

Similarly, I would /not/ use it for helicopter blades. Yes, they can be made redundant - but earlier you suggested that two forcefields would randomly fail together maybe once a week, which suggests that I'll need enough redundancy that the generators will nearly outweigh non-forcefield helicopter blades. (Yes, parachutes exist, but they're no good if you're too close to the ground and they're /certainly/ not going to prevent the main body of the helicopter crashing through whatever was under you at the time it failed).
