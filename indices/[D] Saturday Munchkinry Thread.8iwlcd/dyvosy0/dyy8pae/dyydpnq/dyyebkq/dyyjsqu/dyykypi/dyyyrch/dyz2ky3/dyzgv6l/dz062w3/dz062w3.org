  You could, spinning is difficult, since the device would need to calculate how to change everything so you don't cut off the energy transfer of an outer layer.

If I have a hole on the axis of rotation, then that calculation becomes really easy - but then I also have a stationary weak point. Hmmm.

  Anyhow, would you use it for anything else, except shields?

...it would need to be something that it doesn't matter if it abruptly vanishes, without warning. So I can't, for example, use it as a coffeecup, because it could abruptly vanish and spill hot coffee all over me. (Mind you, I /can/ use it as a novelty drinking cup - a handle with a projector that projects the rest of the cup - as long as I don't mind the chance of ending up with water or whatever I'm drinking all over me).

I wouldn't use it for helicopter blades, because if those vanish then I'm in /real/ big trouble. I also wouldn't use it for bridges, roads, vehicles, or security barriers. If it's perfectly transparent, then it could be used for windows, but it wouldn't be as good as glass.

I /could/ use it for arbitrarily sharp knives (with the forcefield projector in the handle) or to create mathematically perfect and instantly adjustable telescope (or microscope) lenses.
