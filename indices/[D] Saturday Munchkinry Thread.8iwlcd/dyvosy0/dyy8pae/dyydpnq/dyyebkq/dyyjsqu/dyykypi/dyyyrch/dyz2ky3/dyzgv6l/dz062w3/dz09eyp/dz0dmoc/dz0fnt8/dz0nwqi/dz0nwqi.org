  Once a week one house of the 82 million would collapse because both forcefield fail at the same time.

[[/twistare][]] ...ah. Whoops. I had totally misunderstood that, then - I thought that /every/ house would experience a double-failure once a week.

Well, then. That changes things rather substantially

  So I would still risk it for pots, pans and similar stuff, but not for my house or car. And I guess there is a higher chance for a lifeboat to have a leak, than for a forcefield to collapse.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but a boat with a leak can still be used to ferry people about. A boat that outright /vanishes/ will drop your entire rescue team in presumably-dangerous waters with no warning and no means of recovery (beyond life-jackets or similar).
