Hmmmm. Then I have a potential (partial) solution for the sudden-random-failure problem.

Let's say I want to protect Item X with a forcefield. So I stick a forcefield generator onto the side of X, which generates a Sufficiently Large mostly-spherical forcefield. (If I can get it to reflect a given wavelength of light, then I can use the internal surface as a mirror and have an actually spherical field).

It's /mostly/ spherical because there's one needle-thin protrusion pointing inwards. On one side of this protrusion is a laser; on the other side is a light detector (not detecting the laser because the forcefield is opaque to it). When the forcefield goes down, the laser (which is independently powered) hits the detector; and the detector controls the 'reset' switch on the forcefield.

So, yes, it can still randomly go down - but then it goes back up again before anyone can react.
