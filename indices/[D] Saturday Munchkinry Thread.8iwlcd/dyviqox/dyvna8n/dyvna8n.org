Fort Knox, going where the Gold should be. (Having a hard to remove mask would make sure I don't get recognised when caught until I can teleport again.)

Maybe stealing from any other secure facility. (Like go in an art museum and shift with painting)

Maybe finding out where Big Diamonds or other crystals were found.

Legal I would consider radioactive stuff, but I am a coward so fck that

Build many homes around the alt earth. (with the stolen money) And lightweight plane. Use weather stations.

If not necessary always act like I can only do it once a day.

Get small people over there and let them produce drugs there. They don't know they are on a different earth.
