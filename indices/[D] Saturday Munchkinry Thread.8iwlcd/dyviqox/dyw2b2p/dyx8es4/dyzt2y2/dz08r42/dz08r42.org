well, it sounds like you are the only one with access to that earth.

Now after you die:

- Nobody can get back.

- Nobody can get medical help

- Nobody can get help in catastrophic events

- Everyone you send there will die there.

Even with consenting adults, that is not okay. And they will have children there. It has many of the ethical problems a one way trip to mars has. (At least after you die)

Then there are other problems like:

- Will the world exist after you die (probably, but who knows?)

- How do you stop infecting tribes people with your bacteria/virus(es?)?

- How do you make sure they don't die there?

- How do you convince a woman/couple to get pregnant from a random man they don't know instead of their SO? Why should a man care about an others child (That doesn't look like him) in a hunter and gatherer society?

- How do you make sure your utopical idea don't turn out to be a distopia?

And your assumption that the benefits are good (aka not evil) is based on your value system:

- are preserving humanity, (many say humanity is a desease)

- given it room to spread, (why should that be good? you just create more humans somewhere not connected to our earth)

- and creating a backup plan for several potential forms of human extinction. (Why should we care about extinctions? If everyone decides to not make children, it would be okay. )

And counterargument:

- You would just make a society fated to 'destroy' a new earth.

- You would destroy a chance to find out how a world without humans develops. (If you are immortal or they find a way to reproduce your ability

And you would do this because you belief it is the right thing to do. Not because for your own benefit.

I mean even letting some eco freaks in and build zero energy or positive energy houses and communities, would be better than just let civilization start from zero.
