  well, it sounds like you are the only one with access to that earth.

  Now after you die:

  - Nobody can get back.

  - Nobody can get medical help

  - Nobody can get help in catastrophic events

  - Everyone you send there will die there.

  Even with consenting adults, that is not okay. And they will have children there. It has many of the ethical problems a one way trip to mars has. (At least after you die)
#+end_quote

The solution is to advertise it widely, and let them know that it is a one-way trip in advance. Colonization has always had this danger. The traditional problems with colonization, the pushing out of native humans, explicitly do not apply in this scenario, because there are no native humans to displace.

#+begin_quote
  Then there are other problems like:

  - Will the world exist after you die (probably, but who knows?)
#+end_quote

Same exact question could be made for the world we live in. I don't know if it will continue to exist after I die. There is no known physical mechanism for it to stop existing when I die, given my understanding of the world, but that is

#+begin_quote

  - How do you stop infecting tribes people with your bacteria/virus(es?)?
#+end_quote

Prolonged physical isolation prior to contact, along with antibiotics. Also, in my variant, I would attempt to take as many people there who want to go, not just isolated tribes people.

#+begin_quote

  - How do you make sure they don't die there?
#+end_quote

I do my best to select communities to come along, not just individuals. The goal isn't to bring one or two people along and leave them there. The goal is to bring people in groups of 50-100, so they can support each other on the other side.

#+begin_quote

  - How do you convince a woman/couple to get pregnant from a random man they don't know instead of their SO? Why should a man care about an others child (That doesn't look like him) in a hunter and gatherer society?
#+end_quote

Let people make their choices. There is a difference between convincing people, and letting them have the choice should they want it. As for men caring about somebody else's child, for the same reason that people adopt. Because they want to. Not everything is about a genetic imperative.

#+begin_quote

  - How do you make sure your utopical idea don't turn out to be a distopia?
#+end_quote

I don't. My goal is to establish a stable population in the other world, with as high of a chance of survival as possible. I don't expect it to be a utopia. I expect it to be human.

#+begin_quote
  And your assumption that the benefits are good (aka not evil) is based on your value system:
#+end_quote

Every choice one makes is based on one's value system. You eat each day because you value the feeling of being full. You talk to friends because you value social cohesiveness. Your statement conveys no useful information, because of course my decision to spread humanity would be based on my value system. There is nothing else that it could be based on.

#+begin_quote

  - are preserving humanity, (many say humanity is a desease)
#+end_quote

Humanity is what gives the universe meaning. Without intelligence to see, to learn, to appreciate, there is no glory in the stars or the planets. And yes, there are those who say that humanity is a disease. I don't hold with those self-hating misanthropes, nor does your statement that they exist lend any credibility to their arguments.

#+begin_quote

  - given it room to spread, (why should that be good? you just create more humans somewhere not connected to our earth)
#+end_quote

One of my favorite books is /The Little Prince/, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. There is a quote “The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen." The uninhabited world is so vast, so empty. But by bringing people to them, by knowing a person here, and a person there, knowing that they are facing challenges. That fills the world and makes it wonderful.

#+begin_quote

  - and creating a backup plan for several potential forms of human extinction. (Why should we care about extinctions? If everyone decides to not make children, it would be okay. )
#+end_quote

Again, I disagree. As beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so would beauty die if there is no one left to behold. Humanity will eventually die. There's nothing that can be done to prevent that. But I want that to be in the tail end of the heat death of the universe, as the last human walks through empty halls, orbiting the last slowly cooling white dwarf. Smiling to themself, thinking back on the eons of the universe and saying "That was fun. Time to figure out what comes next." To look back upon a humanity, a universe well-spent.

#+begin_quote
  And counterargument:

  - You would just make a society fated to 'destroy' a new earth.
#+end_quote

If nobody uses it, then it has been destroyed far more effectively than the presence of humanity ever could. All the potential, every life that could be led, every child's laughter and every grandfather's chuckle lost.

#+begin_quote

  - You would destroy a chance to find out how a world without humans develops. (If you are immortal or they find a way to reproduce your ability
#+end_quote

We can see that in our own past, and the places where humanity has yet to touch. We can see the senseless rise and the senseless fall of species, continents, stars, galaxies. It is intelligent life, so far found only as humanity, that gives meaning and purpose to these mere objects.

#+begin_quote
  And you would do this because you belief it is the right thing to do. Not because for your own benefit.
#+end_quote

Of course I would. Nothing great is ever done believing that it is the wrong thing to do. If you want to convince me, make arguments that my beliefs are incorrect, and I will listen. Stating that I have beliefs and want to follow them, as though the existence of better and worse choices

#+begin_quote
  I mean even letting some eco freaks in and build zero energy or positive energy houses and communities, would be better than just let civilization start from zero.
#+end_quote

I'll admit, I wouldn't keep with exactly the suggestion that the parent poster made. I would bring in as much knowledge as I could, as many books in as long-lasting of formats as I could. As many people who would be willing to make the trip, as I could carry. As many societies planted, along rivers and streams, to build communities and ties together. I would want to plant a world, and then let it go.
