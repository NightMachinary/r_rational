You can mine for gold without actually doing any digging.

Get a 2m x 2m reinforced steel box & go inside with enough scuba tanks to last you an hour. Go to a location of historical gold mines, places with a lower elevation than before the human gold rush. Go inside the box & warp. You will end up underground & a block of stone will be offset to human earth. Get an assistant to move the box of stone that you offset & check it for precious minerals before you teleport back (if the stone block is worthless, put it back into the position where you left human earth from so that it is returned). Repeat until you get something.
