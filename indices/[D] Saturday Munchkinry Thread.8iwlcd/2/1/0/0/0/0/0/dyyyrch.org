forcefields block forcefields, but you can leave holes, so the device can send the energy for the forcefields through those holes.

But the range would decrease (cause you have to go from the device to a hole to the place where the barrier should be.)

For simplicity, you could use 2 forcefields for redundancy. They would be less efficient.

And I still have to calculate what the probability of random chance is. I think if you build all houses in the USA with 2 forcefields, you would have every week one whose forcefields collapse at the same time. Those are without the cases were one forcefield generator was defect (and didn't get repaired). And without the cases were one forcefield is not enough to keep the building/car/plane intact.
