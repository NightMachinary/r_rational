  Yeah, but a boat with a leak can still be used to ferry people about. A boat that outright vanishes will drop your entire rescue team in presumably-dangerous waters with no warning and no means of recovery (beyond life-jackets or similar).

Well, I agree that I would prefer a lifeboat made out of real stuff. I think a forcefield device (50x50x50cm) that is normally used as eating table could have also the setting "lifeboat" or as an emergency tent or anything else. Which would be quite useful on a cruise ship. And I sure as hell would prefer a forcefield lifeboat over nothing. And a forcefield lifeboat for everyone over not enough lifeboats. Lifeboats are special, since the device (if waterproof and able to swim when turned off) would be able to get reactivated and the passengers would only get wet for ~5min. Of course, there are other reasons to not have forcefield lifeboats, like battery life or too expensive.

It would get down to how likely a failure of a forcefield is (1/9000 failure probability for a day, means 99.92% everything will be fine for a week.) If the probability of sinking a lifeboat because of other causes (storm, waves) is much bigger, I would risk a forcefield lifeboat.

Anyhow, what everyday stuff would you make with such a device if it didn't collapse randomly?
