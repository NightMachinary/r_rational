While I agree that a forcefield lifeboat would be better than /no/ lifeboat, I worry that using them will result in some ships having /only/ forcefield lifeboats - and, on top of that, not keeping the batteries charged.

  Lifeboats are special, since the device (if waterproof and able to swim when turned off) would be able to get reactivated and the passengers would only get wet for ~5min.

Assuming that the passengers are conscious, healthy, and in good physical condition - none of which can be assumed in a lifeboat.

  Anyhow, what everyday stuff would you make with such a device if it didn't collapse randomly?

Hmmm. In this case, you have a super-strong building material whose only drawback is that it requires continual electrical power to exist. So this would be best for /temporary/ structures - like bridges that occasionally stop existing to allow a ship to pass, for example, or emergency bracing to aid in the safe demolition of tall buildings. Or, hey, given the fact that it doesn't actually need support (I'm assuming the location is constant with regard to the generator) it makes for excellent scaffolding, without looking ugly.

Also ladders of infinitely adjustable length (up to a maximum) and some very interesting ways to cheat in pinball games.
