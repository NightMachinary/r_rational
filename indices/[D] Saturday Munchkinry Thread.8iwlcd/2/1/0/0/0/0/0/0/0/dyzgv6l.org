You could, spinning is difficult, since the device would need to calculate how to change everything so you don't cut off the energy transfer of an outer layer.

Since the random chance of shut down is low, you probably wouldn't need multiple forcefields. Big ships would have many forcefield segments outside of their hulls. The same for buildings. But buildings have the problem that a terrorist could just wait, that one forcefield collapse.

If you want personal shields, you should be okay with one. Multiple forcefields mean more weight and more energy needed. And not many benefits. It would be cheaper to duck, if your personal forcefield collapses. If you were a soldier you would probably prefer a longer batterie life, than redundancy

Anyhow, would you use it for anything else, except shields?

Like drones, or multitools or as helicopter blades(thats the name?). Or fan or propeller or for turbines for an energy generator. Or as sun sails. Or 'cheap' windows. Or tents for emergencies. (Better 5min wet/cold than the whole night)?

I'm not sure if anyone really wanted a building or a plane or spacecraft only made of forcefields that collapse. But there could be cases, where a forcefield building (with minor material structures) would be the only realistic option (Like after catastrophes)
