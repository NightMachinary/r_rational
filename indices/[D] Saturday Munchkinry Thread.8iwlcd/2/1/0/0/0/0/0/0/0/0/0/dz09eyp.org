good idea, i would use it for travel cups. Or for cooking utensils. (If heat goes through, if not fridges and insulation^{^{)}}

  I also wouldn't use it for bridges, roads, vehicles, or security barriers.

That's why I made it randomly collapse^{^}

But I guess you would use it for temporary bridges and roads. And instant security barriers. And emergency vehicles that can change into planes, helicopters, cars and boat (only for exploring or soldiers in enemy territory)

Helicopter blades could easily be redundant. (easier than wings) And parachutes exist.

the stationary weak point could be shielded with other forcefields or could be small and at a safe location (aka towards ground)
