A neat gadget would be a projector which can produce small objects such as a key to fit a given lock, a screwdriver to fit a given screw and everything you might put in a swiss knife.

If a device of 1mÂ³ gives me hardlight constructs within a radius of 10m around it, the effective density is even lower than I previously stated.

Does pushing against the forcefield push the device? If not, pushing against a forcefield on a spaceship gives you reactionless thrusters.
