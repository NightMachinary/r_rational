The battery for the gadget would be the biggest part and used for the handle, since a 1cmÂ³ cube could produce a 10cm knife edge. A real multitool. I should probably say there is a minimum size, but that is boring. I will just say you won't be able to cut steel with that gadget. Or use a saw for long. (But screwdrivers and keys should be fine. Also, keep in mind that everyone would know this and use keys with magnets in them like some do already in our world.)

I see no reason why the forcefield shouldn't push back on the device. At least like Magnetic fields.

Any ideas what you would do, if you could move/rotate a forcefield? (Maybe by rotating the device.)
