You want a forcefield 10m away from the device, the device has to be at least 1m big. forcefields don't get damaged over time. They collapse if they get overloaded (too much force) or at random. And can be restarted without repairs a few minutes later. How much force is required depends on the energy and the form of the forcefields. A weak forcefield (for umbrellas or such) would collapse if it is hit with a knife. A building out of forcefields would collapse if someone shoots an artillery round at it. Or drives a car fast into a wall. One out of concrete and steel would only partially collapse. Of course, you could still use multiple forcefields, still not optimal.

Steel should also be cheaper to build normal buildings. (of course, if you have to move or change a building every few weeks, forcefields are cheaper). Forcefields can't go through other forcefields, but you could have holes in both (if a forcefield goes through those holes, their range is shorter), or for buildings multiple segments.
