If matter is substituted where you go to, and you can use it to move your body's volume of stone from a boulder, you can use it to circumvent the 140lb limit. A 2 meter radius hemisphere of air allows you to pull quite a few things through--if you want to take a human weighing over 140lbs, for example, just carefully coordinate for them to be in the way of your hemisphere of air when you come back.

If you can't arbitrarily take air, then making a large aerogel hemisphere would be a worthwhile goal. If it only does the substitution trick for solid objects intersecting your physical body, well, I'd consider getting fat to make it easier to take friends there who weigh over 140lbs.

I'd take over positioning beacons and set up platforms for transferring goods fairly early on. I'd take drones as well, mostly as a lightweight way of surveying an area.

I'd be afraid of animals in particular--large animals on the alternate Earth won't be afraid of humans. I might survive the first few encounters by using a gun, but I wouldn't want to rely on that method. Traveling in the other world is dangerous, so I'd mostly travel in our world.

To generate money fast, I'd find rare trees and cut them down. Ebony is 10k per kilogram--that's pretty efficient. Rare metals are also a possibility, but harder to spot with a drone.

A personal goal: de-extinct passenger pigeons. That would be hard given their famously large minimum viable population size, but by stealing eggs and coordinating with ecologists back on Earth, maybe it could work. Or I could spend several days capturing as many birds as possible. I'd definitely, definitely try eating one while I was there. I'd also go look for the legendary extinct birth control herb, silphium--there's probably a market for that on the first Earth.

I'd probably try to set up an ideologically stable alternate population of humans, but I'm not sure how well that would go. As the only conduit, I'd feel very vulnerable to the possibility of people on either Earth deciding to coerce/kill me to obtain/prevent further transfers.

Finally, I'd definitely take a telescope with me when I go camping there. Very little light pollution on empty Earth.
