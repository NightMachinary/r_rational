I was wondering how easy that loophole was to see. I'm not planning to write a story for this question, but I /was/ thinking about what the story would look like, and having a loophole like that allows for plot progression in a way that I find pleasing ... so long as it's not bloody obvious from the outset, and people are left wondering why the protagonist didn't leap to that conclusion from the outset.
