Hmm. It took less than an hour for half a dozen people to think of it, but then again we didn't actually have a brand new world to explore with all the possibilities and initial work distracting us.

In a story I'd be tempted to make the power require a 'push' if solid objects were in the way, such that the more mass there is in the way the longer it takes to jump and the harder it is to initiate. That would be convenient for preventing the MC from getting stuck in a boulder, but it would also make it less likely for them to perform the experiments that reveal the mass limitation is from only one side--it would draw out that revelation, at the cost of complexity.
