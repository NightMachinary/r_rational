I'm glad you asked. I find the passenger pigeon's story particularly egregious among extinction stories: a near-limitless supply of readily available meat, hunted right to extinction. It's hard to imagine just how bad things had to get for that to happen. Here's a summary from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon#Hunting][Wikipedia.]] Reading that, one can't help but think that a valuable natural phenomenon was destroyed--it would be nice to restore it.

My thinking was also affected by a plot point from the first book in a series: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/264946.Hominids][Hominids.]] The series is about connecting to an alternate Earth where Neanderthals survived instead of humans. A Neanderthal's confusion that we managed to kill all the passenger pigeons stuck with me. I'd recommend the series.

I think we'd be more capable of avoiding the extinction of passenger pigeons today, what with the internet, better enforcement of laws, and a more ecologically-minded populace. Maybe we'd even farm the pigeons for meat. Of course, their astonishing extinction itself informs our culture... I consider them a good example of how humanity underestimates its own power to cause disaster.

One other reason: maybe the visibility of de-extincting passenger pigeons would allow me to generate support for other de-extinction projects in the hypothetical world. And indeed, in our world passenger pigeons are already a candidate for [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ancient-dna-could-return-passenger-pigeons-to-the-sky/][de-extinction.]] It would be a lot easier if you could just go grab some, though.
