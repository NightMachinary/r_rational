That's really cool. I'll check out Hominids.

I feel like such an ambition in this hypothetical world would be difficult though. In addition to potentially bringing back an extinct species I feel like a lot of contingencies would be needed to ensure that no diseases are transferred between worlds.

In addition to spreading potentially invasive species to and from worlds, plant pathogens could surely cause their own scale of damage and that's not counting the things that animal pathogens can do.

Unless this teleportation removes any disease I feel like this new world is only going to suffer from the moment humans are involved.
