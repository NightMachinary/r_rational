I'm curious. Why would your personal goal be to de-extinct passenger pigeons, or at least, why that species in particular. I know that their extinction is due to humans but the same can be said of other species as well.

I definitely think it's a cool goal to pursuit and would probably use the powers in the similar way in trying to discover species that that have been lost due to human actions.

I guess I feel a bit surprised to read that here since in my personal experience I feel like most people in the rationalist community are more concerned with the advancement of technology than the conservation of nature, not to say that the rationalist community don't care about nature but that I haven't seen much topic on it being discussed.
