First trip - make switch in a coastal location to limit potential change in land height and switch on top of a mattress held 1m above the ground. Mattress and scaffolding holding it are taken upon teleportation, therefore if land is lower mattress protects me from the fall and if land is higher only scaffolding goes beneath ground. I would also take a gun to defend against any hostile wildlife, though they'd be unlikely to attack an unknown form of animal. The first trip would be extensively videoed to prove I have the ability.

On subsequent trips I would create a mining company and use more expensive equipment to safely travel to valuable sites (gold deposits, places where exceptionally large gemstones were found) and make money that way.
