You'd make a terrifying "suicide" bomber. Walk into the place carrying a deadman's switched concealed explosive, teleport out to a pre-prepared safe zone, and leave the carnage behind. If you set up your bombs to emit blinding light just before you leave, cameras would be unable to catch your disappearing act, and you would go in heavily disguised every time anyway.

This would obviously require you to be a psychopath, however. The other means of making money I can think of involve resource extraction on the unspoiled earth, but it would be glacially slow due to lack of extra labor. If you can find a record of easily-available Platinum ore or something, you could make quick cash by obtaining it, however.
