Geez everyone is talking about being rich and here I am imagining how I'd use it to create a new society on the alternate earth by taking several trips worth of light humans from hunter-gatherer societies who would have the requisite skills and appropriate, simple, reliable weapons and fabrics and shelters. And periodically take frozen sperm across to greatly increase genetic diversity.

I remember reading somewhere that modern hunter gatherers work less and are happier than anyone else, so it'd be fun to test that out with the full knowledge that i can hop back to the real world at any point.
