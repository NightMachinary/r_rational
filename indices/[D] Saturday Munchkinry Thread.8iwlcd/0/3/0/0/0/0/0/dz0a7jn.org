True, I'd have to spend a couple of years talking to anthropologists and seeing what I can find. My very anglocentric view is that maybe there's a tribe that's losing a tribal war that might like access to all their lands, but that's probably a deeply racist view.

Displaced native peoples like e.g. indigenous Australians might be a good target, though I think very few of them live hunter-gatherer full time, and the 140lb requirement is quite onerous for transporting fully grown men.
