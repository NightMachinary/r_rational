There's short-term and long-term safety. Short-term safety is dominated by worries like "how do I make sure I don't get stuck in a boulder". Long-term safety is dominated by worries like "how do I prevent powerful agents from exploiting me in ways I do not like."

Fortunately, short-term safety should be mostly fixed by easy fixes like bringing

- a hunting rifle

- two hours' supply of oxygen

- another person, possibly ex-military, with duplicates of this gear (EDIT: 140 pounds weight makes this tough, but it might be possible if he or she is very slim)

- something to prevent your death when you possibly fall between 20 and 1000 feet (possibly a combination of multiple systems, like a compact parachute and something else)

Although now that I think about it, the safest place to transfer over blind is probably the ocean: go out in a small rowboat about 100-200m offshore, transfer, since your position is preserved relative to sea level you should continue to be in the ocean. After this, row to shore while recording everything, and transfer back depending on how far away from shore you are on Earth Two. Be recording with several GoPros while you're doing this, and when you get back, piece together the videos of the Earth Two with videos of that region of Earth One to figure out if there's super different geography. If there's not, your next trip back and forth can be in the boat, but slightly closer to the shore. Repeat until you find a safe place of the shore to transfer on, and work your way inland until you get to property that is convenient for you to access.
