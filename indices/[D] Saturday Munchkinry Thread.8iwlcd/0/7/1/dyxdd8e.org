It's not a very unique premise. A similar gimmick is used in Charles Stross' Merchant Princes and Empire Games series, among others. There, a small clan of worldwalkers smuggle drugs and deploy into twinned safehouses, with more interesting applications developing later in the series. I don't expect answers to be particularly /novel/, but especially with the parameters as they are, I think it's interesting to think about, which I view as one of the purposes of the munchkinry thread.
