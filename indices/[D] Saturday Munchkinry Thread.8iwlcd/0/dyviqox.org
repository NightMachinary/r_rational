You have the power to move from this Earth to a different, unspoiled Earth where humans died out thousands of years ago. You can take up to 140 pounds with you, so long as the thing you're taking with you fits entirely within a radius extending two meters from your center of gravity.

The other Earth has its own weather, distinct from our own. The landscape is generally the same, except where human intervention has changed it.

When you transfer over, you are not guaranteed to be safe from changes in air pressure, nor are you guaranteed that you will be safe in the environment, or that you will be at a safe distance from the ground. The transfer retains your precise position with respect to distance from sea level, longitude, and latitude.

You can make the move from one Earth to the other once per hour. Initiating the transfer happens at the speed of thought.

If an intersection would occur (i.e. you would transfer into a place that's occupied by a steel girder, block of granite, or another person) the other matter will be transferred to the other Earth that you've just left. This also applies to anything you bring through with you. While this prevents some severe potential catastrophes, transferring to, for example, the interior of a boulder would leave you without oxygen to breathe.

To your knowledge, you are the only person who has this ability.

- What equipment do you take for your first few trips?
- How do you ensure your safety in the long-term?
