Depending on my database, teach the idiots how to do stuff. Like magic scroll printing press. Or how education is good for peasants.

Starting a bank system. That I control.

Find an immortal I like and have him/her as pet and hands

Learn magic (and use Wish). Train mindcontrolled mages until they can make Wish spells for me. (Maybe use shortcut of scrolls)

Make taskforces for specific threats (like group of paladins to fight undead) get enough priests to search all lands for undead.

Get some of the necromancers in a taskforce to fight monster with poison.

And sometime after killing all gods I don't like I ascend to godhood.
