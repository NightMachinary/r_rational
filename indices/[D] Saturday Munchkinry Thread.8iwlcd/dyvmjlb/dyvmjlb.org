TL;DR you are a "magic talking sword", how do you achieve your goals?

You are a sentient sword in a D&D-style high fantasy world, with a twist. You're actually a knife-missile-style drone from a Culture-like civilization. Unfortunately, your flight capabilities are broken, so you must find a willing sack of meat to carry you around and stick the evildoers with you.

Powers:

- Immortality - you've got tens of thousands of years or more, if necessary, to achieve your goals.

- You can talk by sending sound waves through the air

- You can read the thoughts/communicate via telepathy with anyone touching you. You can't use this to gaslight/plant false thoughts/manipulate your wielder in a way that involves pretending your thoughts were originally theirs.

- You are obscenely sharp and never dull.

- You are immune to the magic of the era, whatever that is.

- Limited effectors give you holograms/fine-grained manipulation/pyrotechnics within about ten centimeters of your surface. You /could/ use this for anything from "pretend to be a neat glowy sword" to "record and play back video for your bearer."

You have unspecified goals that at default include "bring peace and prosperity," "disincentivize evildoers," etc. Or, for fun, try to rule the world.
