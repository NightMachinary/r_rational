Well, the obvious first to me would be to pretend to be a weapon connected to a god, and that it is in fact a god and not the sword itself speaking through you.

Once you have gained yourself a loyal wielder (killing "unfaithful" ones trying to wield you using your effector fields) you use your advanced knowledge to guide them into power through your newly made religion then guide your faith through an industrial revolution by speaking through your "divinely" chosen monarchs, burning those who refuse to obey the voice of their "god".

For added emphasis, you can use your telepathic reading to explain in great detail to all in hearing range what makes a person unworthy, beyond merely burning their hand off.
