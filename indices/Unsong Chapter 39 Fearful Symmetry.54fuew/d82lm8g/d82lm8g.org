  imagine the map of the mystical body of God overlaid upon *a map* of the Western Hemisphere

/That's/ what I was doing wrong. I was trying to overlay the Sephirot onto a globe, and all of the parts were ending up in the wrong places or the measurements were wrong. Does anyone know what projection the map is?

I was doing Panama -> North Pole = 9000 km = two steps in the Sephirot, making one step 4500 km. I was confused because Juneau was only ~3500 km from the North Pole and from the midpoint of the north pole and Panama, and Baja California was about the same (~3500 km from Panama and from the midpoint).
