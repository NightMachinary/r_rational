Really?

Set aside the taboos, and the issue of disease transmission (which can mostly be avoided by eating the right parts). When people die, they leave behind meat. Currently, the two most common things to do with that meat are to burn it, or lower it into the ground. Compared to those two options, eating the meat seems like one of the best things you could do with it.

Now, growing humans /for their meat/ is unethical and wasteful on top of that, but cannibalism in general has never seemed irrational - just bundled up with a lot of psychological hangups.

Edit: I actually tried, for a time, to figure out a business model for cannibalism that would work in the United States (for a story). There aren't any outright laws against cannibalism (and if there are, they're on a state-by-state basis which means a potential business could relocate to a favorable legal climate), but there are laws against misusing medical waste and desecrating a corpse. Anyway, the scheme would involve having people sign consent forms for either the event of their death, or the amputation of a body part. I think that at least could be done fairly cheaply, since people tend to discount things that are in the future, and many young people don't think of their deaths as "real". The two biggest questions I had left were the legal hurdles involved (since i somewhat doubt that the business could exist without having an in-house lawyer from day one) and whether there would be a sufficient market for it - neither of which are all that easy to figure out for someone who has only a theoretical interest in the subject.
