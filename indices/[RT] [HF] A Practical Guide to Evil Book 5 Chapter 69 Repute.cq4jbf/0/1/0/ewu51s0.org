There was a bit of discussion on that topic when EE first said that Cat's name as Dread Empress (if there ever was a future with her as Dread Empress) would be Victorious.

It's beyond cool. "Malicia" was chosen because it's never been done before. "Traitorous", "Sorcerous" and the likes are descriptive. "Triumphant" too, she was to win and do so in so glorious a fashion that History would never forget.

"Victorious" is a simple description: "Those who attempt to strike me down fail."
