So...did Masego just forget to mention that the Dead King repurposed the entire city of Liesse just to divine the Wandering Bard's plans? Like, that and the entire conversation they had is pretty damning.

  “I know,” the Dead King said. “And now that I do, I need not lift a finger. I'll tell them, Intercessor, and every last one will turn on you.”

  “Yeah, see, that's the part where you're getting ahead,” the woman drawled. “You knowing. The little shard of you in poor ol' Zeze knows, but you-you? That's a different story.”

  “You failed,” the Dead King said. “The Tyrant spread into the souls, yes, but the Black Queen contains him. I will still have room enough to pass what I know.”

  “Do you?” the Wandering Bard grinned.

I guess that due to the state that he was in, he lost the memory. Bit of a trope, and so under the Bard's jurisdiction. Plus, since the Dead King didn't actually pass on the info to Masego, it could be thought of as an attempt at manipulation, even though the Bard never denies any of it. I guess that if he actually did tell Masego, he definitely would've forgotten.
