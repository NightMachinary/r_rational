None of this would change Tariq's mind. If, like Tariq believes, Bard is ultimately on the side of Good and opposes Keter at every turn, then OF COURSE the Dead King going to go to great lengths to try and figure out her plans! Having the Dead King as an enemy doesn't really hurt your credibility with the Heroes.

As for that particular conversation, it's really not that damning, especially if you're already inclined to give Bard the benefit of the doubt. Nessie claims that he has dirt on Bard that would get everyone to turn on her. Bard completely ignores the question of how damning the dirt is or the response it would provoke in favor of pointing out that he won't actually retain the info. Nessie is the only one making damning claims here, which Bard neither confirms nor denies, and Heroes won't be inclined to look favorably on the words of the Dead King.

Besides, Tariq /knows/ she's worked on behalf of Below before, he just thinks the good she does outweighs that. When presented with this conversation, he might conclude that Nessie had learned about something like the fact that she helped the Sisters become Sve Noc and that Nessie then made poor assumptions about the convictions of Heroes and their capacity for forgiveness. He'd believe /that/ before he'd believe that if he knew what they were talking about he'd side with the Dead King against Bard.

The issue is not that Tariq hasn't ever seen Bard do something sketchy. The issue is that he's seen her do enough good (and enough Good) to outweigh any sketchiness. One more incident that's maybe-sort-of-kinda sketchy won't change his view on things.
