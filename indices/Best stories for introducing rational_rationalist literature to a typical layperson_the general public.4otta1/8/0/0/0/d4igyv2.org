I've ranted about his stuff elsewhere, so I'll leave a case study rather than a long-winded thing. I'll grant that it may be unfair to judge his whole corpus on the three things I've read:

The climax of Elantris requires an entire magical industry full of bona fide geniuses and experts to fail to apply a /literally/ fundamental principle of their whole magic system, and instead all die and go extinct over hundreds of years until some upstart has a blindingly obvious insight after reading an old introductory primer of that same magic system.

This is played straight. Written with a straight face. Whatever---mixed metaphors can't even do it justice. I was /actually confused/ when I got to the end of the book, because I kept waiting for it to start making sense.
