I'm more trying to say ... every story is going to fail for some subset of readers. You could introduce someone to /Metropolitan Man/ and they would immediately say "Yes, please, more like that". So you have to know your audience and pick whichever one you think they'd most enjoy.

What I want is a story that works for everyone, and though I think it would be a difficult thing to write, I do think it's possible. (Personally, I write stories that I'd want to read rather than stories I think other people would want to read.)
