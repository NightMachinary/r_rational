I certainly like unsung quite a bit, but for one it has a rather non-standard narrative, it's kind of rationally irrational. It's not really that far into the story so far, which to me docks it some points as a intro text.\\
Overall I just think it's to far of left field in to many ways to really serve as an introduction to the rationalist genre.

As for what I'd recommend I'd actually say a bluer shade of white: It's really good , it never slows down its pace that I recall, it's easy to read and quite short. Plus it delves into transhumanist stuff which is pretty genre typical. All things I think make for a good intro story for the genre, I would also say the same about the last christmas. I generally think for a intro text it's probably best to stick to easy to get through short work to get them hooked, or at least that's my intuition.

Of course depending on someone's personality you might just start them right off with HPMoR and that has worked for me at least twice (plus it was the work I personally got started on [though this was just by stumbling on it by chance, I then worked through the rest of Yudkowsky's fiction before getting into the broader genre]). Of course as mentioned elsewhere in this thread it has problems for many people though others are absolutely riveted by it.
