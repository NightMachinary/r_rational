IMO it's the first arc and the timeskip at the end that are bad. It's my top book of all time. The first arc isn't even that bad either.

I dunno, it's your list, not mine. I just personally think that Worm is one of the best introductions.

BTW if you end up including HPMOR then include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-Rationality][this]]. It's a revision of the first four chapters and it drastically improves the quality of the beginning of the book.
