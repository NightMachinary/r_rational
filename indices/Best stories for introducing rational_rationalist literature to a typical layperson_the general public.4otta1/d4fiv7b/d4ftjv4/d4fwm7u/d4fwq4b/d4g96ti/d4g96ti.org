If you're searching for an introduction to rational/rationalist fiction, then the candidates should have being rational as one of their most immediately striking features, shouldn't they? Metropolitan Man and Bluer Shade of White showcase it clearly. As for Worm, I get the feeling that Worm is considered rational mostly by people who deliberately went looking for reasons to call it rational because they prefer to think of it that way. Worm is good, don't get me wrong, but it's a noncentral, barely representative example of a rational/rationalist fiction. The traits are just too subtle: they're there if you go looking for them (and are willing to cut wildbow some slack for his feathered magical plot fairy and phlebotinium conflict generators), but as an introduction it sucks.
