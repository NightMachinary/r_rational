I think you're much better off if you know your target reader's tastes in literature and other media /outside/ rational(ist) or not, so that you can pick something more likely to appeal to them in particular. (If you also know how inclined they are to try things outside their established tastes, even better.) Highly technical hard sci-fi survival against unforgiving nature? /The Martian/. Supernatural romance with plot beyond the romance? /Luminosity/. Fandom of a particular work? Find its rational fics if they exist. Not up for long novels? Pick a short story (collection) instead.

Sometimes you do have (or want) to go generic, but that's often not the best option precisely because it limits the specificity with which you can model your audience. There's a reason even huge companies sometimes make ads targeted to very specific groups.
