I recommend [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/][Exhalation]] by Ted Chiang because it's a good short story which perfectly describes what it's like to be a scientist coming up with a hypothesis about the world and testing it. He also has written many other short stories where he changes something about the world and takes it to its logical conclusion which is a major component of rational fiction. I mean instead of rational protagonists, he writes rational worlds.

Also as a short story, if someone who may not be willing to spend too much of their time trying something new, they can spend only a small amount of time without worrying too much about the 'waste'. Finally it's original fiction which is a good starting point for those who don't want to give fanfiction a try.
