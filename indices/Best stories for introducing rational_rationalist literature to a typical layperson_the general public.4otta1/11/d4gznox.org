A lot of Asimov's short stories. For instance, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question][The Last Question.]]

David Brin has also written some fairly rational works.

Eric Flint's 1632 series and most of the anthologies associated with it are also rather rational.

None of these are rationalist though.

EDIT - now that I think about it, I'd strike 'The Last Question' from the list above. The ending is definitely a Deus ex Machina. It's a good thinking story though.
