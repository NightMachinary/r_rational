Really? If that's the case, then is it even possible for someone to write a story like that? I'm wondering if part of the problem is that there might be a contradiction between the "what our community would clearly define as rational" criteria and the criteria of it being inoffensive. Maybe any rational novel is going to disagree with the public on things that they strongly believe in, and that means that rational fic is offensive to them in general? Then again, what about Strong Female Protagonist? And as for works you've written, why not Shadows of the Limelight?

I think maybe the issue with the ending of metropolitan man might be the readers' scope insensitivity causing them to see killing superman as entirely unjustified, no matter what the circumstances, even if it means probably saving the world. So if you wanted to make it more palatable to the public, maybe have Rex imagining the screams and destruction of the world that would happen if he didn't kill Superman. And portray Lex Luthor as someone more sympathetic who is being forced to make a hard decision that no one should ever have to make. I mean really, he /killed Superman/ and he somehow he didn't feel unbearable agonizing guilt over it. It was easy for him to make that decision. Even knowing that it was the right thing to do under the circumstances shouldn't have been enough for that unless he's a psychopath (or partially psychopathic). You could have characterized Lex Luthor as someone who's been forced to make hard choices like this all his life, and so he's become somewhat used to such hard choices and knows how to make them right and how to ignore the pain of it, rather than simply being less empathetic.
