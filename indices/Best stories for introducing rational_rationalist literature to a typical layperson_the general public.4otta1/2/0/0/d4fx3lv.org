FWIW, I partially agree with this. I still get a trickle of reviews in for that story and there's a substantial number of people who immensely dislike it, either because it's more deconstruction than reconstruction, because it has what might be viewed as a downer ending, because it violates a character that they like, it's unpleasantly dark, etc.

... but with that said, I don't have a recommendation for what I would pick in its place. Ideally you would want something that was technically well written, thoughtful, moving, accessible, tightly plotted, and inoffensive, all while clearly hewing to what our community would clearly define as rational. I don't think I've read that story yet, and I definitely haven't written it.
