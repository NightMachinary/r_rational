Chiming in late here but I think it may be easier if you list some of the reasons/things you didn't like about it. I, for one, enjoyed it because it scienced up Superman in a way that I personally have never seen done before. It also isn't from Superman's perspective (another rarity in superhero fiction) so we can see the effects from a normal person's standpoint. Reading the Metropolitan Man made me feel the way I would imagine I would've felt if I lived inside Metropolis when the Man of Steel came around, with a lot less insider knowledge obviously.

Overall, it's an interesting take on a popular concept. I didn't fancy the ending myself, because I'm a fanboy, but from a cynical, rationalist perspective, I /understood/ it. And that's honestly something that happens with a lot less frequency. It's easy to find endings you like; it's much harder to find endings you actively disliked but can see as being the best option from the character's perspective.
