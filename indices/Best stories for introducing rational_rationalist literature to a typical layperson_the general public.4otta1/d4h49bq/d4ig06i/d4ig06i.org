Too long, did not read... Just kiding, i've read your post, but it really is too long: i cann't up or down arrow it since there are too many topics boarded in the same post. Promoting HPMOR instead of better works will likely attract immature readers not seing it's flaws ( which is fine ) and repulse more allert readers (which is less fine). HPMOR was enjoyable because at the time we couldn't find much rational read. Hopefully now we got better. There is no point promotting inferior work just because historically it sparked this subreddit.
