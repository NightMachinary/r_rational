I mean even for the former goal, doesn't the work which /actually introduced/ most of us to [[/r/rational]] (in fact wasn't HPMOR a major factor in the reason [[/r/rational]] was created? I think that it was...) have the most proven track record in introducing people / gathering a cult following?

Definitely true that some people passionately hate it. Are those people actually good writers though? (The while point of this is to generate good fiction for me to read right?)

PS thanks :)
