In a way you're right, and I wish you had posted this earlier so that more people read this comment, and hopefully gave you some upvotes. One thing I'll note though is that we may be talking about different things here. HPMOR may be the best piece of rational fiction, and might be the best at showing people that there is this amazing new type of fiction they've never encountered before, but it's undeniable that some people really passionately hate it.

It may be that HPMOR is the best introductory text for sorting people who will love rational fic from those who won't, but not the best go-to text for introducing random people, if the goal is to use the story that makes it most likely that they will want to read more, or to use the story that has the highest chance of increasing the size of the rational fiction community.

I think this post is about the latter goal, whereas your comment is geared a bit more towards the former.

P.S. Your post wasn't too long. I was interested to read the whole thing, and the concern someone raised about bundling too many claims is a wrong one. Upvotes aren't for agreement, so there's no reason making a bunch of claims should stop people from doing so. Thoughtful comments like this are the sorts of things we should want more of, and should want more people to read even if they are likely to disagree, since it is at the very least clearly advancing the conversation. If someone disagrees with one of the points in a long comment, well, that's why we have replies.
