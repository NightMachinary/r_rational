The Martian is a great gateway/intro into the type of stories many would consider rational.

If your friend is familiar with the Naruto-verse, Waves Arisen is also a decent rational fic.

In general, most classic sci-fi short stories and mid length stories (see: Asimov) are very rational. A more little known one would be The Metamorphosis of the Prime Intellect, although that is quite graphic and probably not for your average reader who may be turned off by that stuff.
