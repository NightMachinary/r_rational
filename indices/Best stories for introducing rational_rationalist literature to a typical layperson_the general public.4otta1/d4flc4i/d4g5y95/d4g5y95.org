Having read The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect, I wouldn't describe it as especially rational. The universe it presents doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, and the "moral" of the story contradicts its actual plot. It's one of the eminent singulatarian pieces of fiction, but It's not really rational or even that well written. There is (or was) supposed to be a sequel to the book which retcons the entire ending (as it should), so I think even the author agrees with this to some extent.
