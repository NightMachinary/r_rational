HPMOR was the perfect introduction for me because I found it to be unique, particularly the protagonist. I thought of Harry the same way I thought of Sherlock, Ender, and Lelouch; someone who isn't normal and arguably isn't sane but that's what makes them interesting beyond how intelligent they are. It helped that I thought the story was self aware of how unusual the protagonist was, and also because I had never read LessWrong before so I found Harry's speeches to be educational.
