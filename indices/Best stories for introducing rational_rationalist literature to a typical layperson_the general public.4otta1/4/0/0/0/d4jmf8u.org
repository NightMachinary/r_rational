I think maybe you are missing part of the distinction I was making between the two goals. HPMOR did a really good job of making /us/ want to read more rational fiction, but it may not do a good job of making /the average reader/ want to read more rational fiction, which I think is more the question posed by the OP.

Edit: Or maybe you are saying you don't want to grow the community by adding people who wouldn't like HPMOR?
