Looks like we're all contrarians and no one's going to bother defending the /obvious/ choice (no one's even mentioned it, except comments saying why it /wouldn't/ be a good choice, which is a sure sign that it's actually the obvious intuitive choice or they wouldn't even have brought it up in the first place.)

So okay, I guess I'll be the defender of the obvious: The best introductory story is HPMOR: the story which I'm pretty sure introduced the vast majority of us to the genre. I'd wager over 30% of this subreddit, and probably over 60% of it's founding members who were here from the beginning were hpmor inspired.

Hpmor may not be the one with the most broad appeal, but it is certainly the one which will best predict whether they're likely to appreciate the sorts of stories on [[/r/rational]]. I feel like if someone doesn't like hpmor then they just don't really get the genre. I think Yudkowsky is the current top writer by the standard of the "Rational" genre, for giving us standards we didn't even fully realize we had.

I'll happily add to the chorus of Ted Chiang (particularly Exhalation) as the top story when operating under the broader standards of fiction in general while yet still falling under the genre of "rational". (Bearing in mind, that simply by being sci-fi Chiang is already rather at the margins as per the standards of general fiction)

But the standards are different between genres. Exhalation is a better sci/fi fantasy than hpmor. hpmor is a better rational work than Exhalation. (Analogy: Lord of The Rings is a far better fantasy than Harry Potter. But Harry Potter is a far better story, by the standards of fiction in general, than Lord of the Rings. And HG Wells wrote better sci fi than Verne, even if Verne wrote better stories by the standards of his day - although I think the modern reader prefers Wells because modern tastes appreciate the sort of worldbuilding that Wells broke new innovative ground on much more.)

For instance, good sci fi / fantasy isn't about the things that make good literature, at least it wasn't until sci fi became so popular that the landscape of fiction started shifting. For instance, before sci fi, world-building played no part in how fiction was evaluated, despite the fact that mythology and fantasy works did in fact worldbuild, I bet it wasn't until sci-fi hyperspecialized in worldbuilding that worldbuilding was a thing that people identified. If you don't care about worldbuilding, if you think it's masturbatory or silly or something (a lot of people do!) you don't really get sci fi. So a lot of amazing sci fi was not considered to be good writing at first.

Same with good rational works - plot and world-building aren't necessarily the point. When you read hpmor certain things - which are marks of good literature in general (just like worldbuilding is a mark of good literature in general, but until sci fi it was more an understated, implicit sort of virtue) become way more salient because hpmor hyperspecializes in them. If you don't like munchkin, hacking, impertinence, impatience with the status quo, breaking invisible rules that the other characters don't realize exist they have been following, hyper-logical people that are /aware/ that they're hyper logical and openly ruminate on their own internal states at the reader, even the "preachy" exposition of concentrated "morals" (except it's often epistemic "morals"), then you don't get the rational genre.

HPMOR has clearly broken some sort of new ground here, and it's the work which currently best illustrates where that new ground is, and that new ground is what the genre is defined by.
