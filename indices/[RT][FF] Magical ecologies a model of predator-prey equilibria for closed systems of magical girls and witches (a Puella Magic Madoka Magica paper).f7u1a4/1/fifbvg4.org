Great read. However, given your conclusion about win rate, I think a your discussion of witch populations viability is either questionable or needs further elaboration why or why not over hunting resulting in unstable populations are a concern.

I would also disagree with your choice to exclude witch self reproduction as a factor as that is another source of witch population growth and field experience tells us it's significant.
