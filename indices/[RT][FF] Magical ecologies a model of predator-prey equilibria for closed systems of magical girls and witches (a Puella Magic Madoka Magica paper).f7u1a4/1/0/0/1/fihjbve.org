I do agree with [[/u/SimoneNonvelodico]] - the show doesn't /actually/ show familiars becoming witches. In Episode 5, Kyoko reprimands Sayaka for killing a familiar instead of letting in grow into a witch. But this is at a point in time before they find out that magical girls actually become witches themselves.

So it's entirely possible that Kyoko is under the mistaken impression that familiars grow to become witches.
