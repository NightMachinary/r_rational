This.

This is the type of writing that fits this sub /perfectly/.

Though there's one thing bothering me about the model: magical girls have variable potential, subsequent power (and powerset), personality as well as a growing body of experience and skill to draw on (as well as trauma, which reduces their effectiveness), which also most likely does influence the resultant Witch. And that's without considering the socio-economic ramifications of being a Magical Girl, of the way they form and dissolve groups, for purposes of teaching/hunting/companionship, or how is it influenced by local ecology.

Now, I am pretty sure that most of those variables would massively complicate this model without providing much of a benefit to general predictive power (as it mostly makes difference in vastly anomalous situations, see Madoka Incident^{\}1])), but it's something to consider for any future research attempt.

EDIT: In fact, I can see why Incubators as a whole have a severe problem with understanding human motivation and psychology.

Can you /imagine/ the amount of work that would have to go into making a specific model of Puella Magi ecosystem on a human-inhabited world? This model wouldn't even have any use outside of Earth! It's pretty much a complete waste of computational resources for Incubators, which could be used for literally anything else, like better entropy management models.
