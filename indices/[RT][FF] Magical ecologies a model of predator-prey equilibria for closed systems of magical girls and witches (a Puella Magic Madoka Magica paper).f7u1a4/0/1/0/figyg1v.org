I'd say there's issues in both of them. This paper ignores the interaction entirely, whereas the previous one assumes it scales only with the witch population.

This is really a 3-species system. Humans are eaten by Witches, then Witches are eaten by Magical Girls. Humans can properly regulate their food sources via farming (so we can ignore what they eat), but the other two aren't organized enough to do so on a large scale. Familiar->Witch maturation rate is strongly dependent on the available human population, particularly since humans will flee the area should too many humans begin to die and most witches' labyrinths are not very mobile. Magical Girl->Witch corruption has both a constant term (it costs magic to keep the body running in everyday life) and the proportional term (it costs a lot of energy to fight a witch).

Most importantly though, is that Kyuubey can adjust many of the statistics as needed. Contracting more Magical Girls, purposefully respawning "dead" witches as required, making Magical Girls sad to get more Witches, all sorts of things. With that the only real threat to systematic instability is Magical Girls organizations, which it has made sure are never able to get off the ground.
