  With that the only real threat to systematic instability is Magical Girls organizations, which it has made sure are never able to get off the ground.

I think the other real threat are exceptional singular witches like Walpurgisnacht or Gretchen (aka Witch!Madoka). Exceptional magical girls would usually run out of witches to hunt and succumb to Soul Gem decay; exceptional witches can just go on and on until they destroy an entire planet. Kyubey's never been shown to be able or willing to destroy excessively dangerous witches.

Also, as I said, I ignored Humans because they vastly outnumber the other two species. Basically if witch population density and killing rate are fixed, then witches will be only a small drain on the human population, as will be magical girl recruitment. In general, since both parameters can be controlled directly or indirectly by Kyubey, it is always possible to make it so that Humans (or whatever host species is used, really) aren't drained out at a rate that will cause them to die off or even notice too much what's going on. However in case of singular events like super-strong witches they should be accounted for as death counts will be significant.
