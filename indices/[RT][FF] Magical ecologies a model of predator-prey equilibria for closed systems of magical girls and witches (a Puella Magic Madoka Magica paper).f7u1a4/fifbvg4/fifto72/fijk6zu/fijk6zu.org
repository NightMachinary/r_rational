The authors do seem to miss a fairly significant paper, which is canonical even though rather obscure: [G.Urobuchi, et al, Madoca Magica Portable, 2012] ( [[https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica_Portable]]). The paper deals with various counterfactual scenarios. Some of them do feature familiars turning into witches.
