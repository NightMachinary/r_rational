Oh, absolutely, this is what I would refer to as a 'mean field' model.

I had considered a more advanced model. One way to implement what you say would be to have a Monte Carlo model with individually instantiated Magical Girls and Witches, each with their own stats (randomly selected with some kind of distribution), and have them move across a board randomly, and do battle if they meet. Then it's possible to observe the emergence parameters like /w/ - which would simply be the result of comparison between respective combat strengths - and /b/ - a function of the density of population. We could see limit effects as the number of battles might stop being linear in M and W if we go into an overpopulation regime (a bit like the perfect gas equation stops applying when the excluded volume becomes significant). And we would see random fluctuations (if only because M and W would be discrete, not continuous, variables).

It's definitely possible. I didn't do it because it would become far more complicated and really, I didn't have /that much/ time to spend on this today. Plus I think the results wouldn't be too different, unless we consider further mechanisms such giving magical girls or witches experience and thus the ability to level up, which could generate a singularity if one becomes so strong they start winning every time.
