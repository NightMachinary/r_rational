We are grateful to the reviewer for their constructive comments and criticism. We include here our response for the benefit of both editor and referees.

Concerning the witch population viability, I do not think the conclusions about the win rate are a problem, or imply that unstable populations are a significant risk. As one can see in Eq. 4, the only case in which the witch population diverges is for a value of w -> 0. This is not only undersirable, but in practice almost never the case, if the agent selects magical girl candidates with a modicum of competence, and provides them with the needed support. For the ideal case of w ~ 1 the witch population is well defined. I therefore fail to see why this should constitute a significant risk to the stability of the population. 'Over hunting' is not a concern: if w = 1, then all magical girls succeed in killing witches, but that only means the average magical girl has less chances at a grief seed, which shortens their life and thus accelerates the regeneration of the witch population. The equilibrium is a dynamical one; the only thing that changes is the specific fluxes that determine it.

Concerning witch self-reproduction, I did not consider it due to my understanding of the literature. There are occasional mentions of the process of familiars turning into witches; however, I was unable to find any direct examples of this within the canonical references [G. Urobuchi, PMMM 1-12 (2011)]. It is possible that references from other materials exist, but they are unknown to me at the moment. Given the circumstances, I did not consider this phenomenon as fully documented, or relevant enough to matter. The existing references do not give me grounds to believe it to be a real phenomenon, rather than a myth spread among magical girls who are unaware of the origin of witches as products of their own decay process. Given that many agents consider it useful to withhold such information from the local magical girls, and even purposefully avoid dispelling misconceptions or disclosing key knowledge that might cause major alteration in behaviour, as part of good breeding practices, I can not in good faith say that I have reason to believe the fabled self reproduction of witches is a real phenomenon at all.
