You have a good point about megawitches, and that's explicitly demonstrated in-show via Gretchen in the doomed timelines. For that it seems as though the solution is simply that they're rare and localized: they're a Walpurgisnaught level threat which is annoying and destroys local ecologies but insignificant on a global scale, except for the exceptional case of Gretchen where it's still localized to a single planet (until the final timeline at least).

It's certainly true that the witches aren't enough to directly hit the human population, but there's a multiplicative effect due to humans fleeing areas with high "mysterious death" rates. Even a few dozen humans dead per day would be a massive effect. Incubator control over statistics collection is an important issue I hand't thought of, however. Magical girl recruitment is definitely not significant compared to human population, but it seems to take many humans to create one witch.
