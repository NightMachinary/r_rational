So I'd ask him "What easier relatively successful ways could I and the empire use to get favors or requests from various gods including you?" If there are other gods who Loki knows desire something and would aid who he could ally with that would be great, knowing exactly what Loki wants him to do to win favors like the cannons, answers and such would be helpful.

"What plans and schemes do the Liches have that are interesting to us?"
