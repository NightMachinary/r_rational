Since not-answers don't count against me, no reason to not shoot for the moon, at least to start out with - that's just good strategy. Besides which, each not-answer gives information, because you know that it's something that Loki can't or won't answer. I guess I would also see if boolean operators would work within my questions, so that I could get some more mileage out of them and acquire information, but I am guessing that wouldn't fly - still, no real penalty for trying, and hopefully he'd like my pluck. As for what I'd actually want answers to, with the caveat that I'm not thinking /too hard/ about the precise wordings (I'm not sure if you've seen the Open Source Wish Project, but you need to be very clear about what it is that you mean, even if you have a guarantee that the answers will be truthful, complete, and non-deceptive).

- Among all the things that I don't know, which piece of information would be the most advantageous for me to know?
- Are there any potential useful allies that I do not currently know about, and how can I meet them? (possibly rephrase so that can't be counted as two questions - I'd be more specifically interested if there is dissent within the undead empire that can be leveraged)
- Which of the people within the humanoid resistance is secretly working for the enemy?
- What is the most easily accessible single point of failure for the undead army?
- Where are all of the liches phylacteries located? (Which is hopefully considered a single question - figure that out first before blowing all of the questions on this one)
- How do I turn the undead empire against itself?

Rumsfeld gets a lot of flack for it, but the unknown unknowns are a very real thing, and those are the most important to ferret out if at all possible - it's just a matter of phrasing the question such that Loki is compelled to give you answers to the questions you don't know that you needed to ask.
