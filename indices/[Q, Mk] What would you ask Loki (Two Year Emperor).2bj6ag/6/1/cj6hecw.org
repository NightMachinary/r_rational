I've been sort of operating under the assumption that the word of a god actually means something - which is backed up by a whole host of myths and legends in the real world, and stories told in many versions of fantasy worlds. Hell, a decent number of the stories about trickster gods involve them being tricked by humans, so I think there's some precedent for him being bound to his words and deals - he's just allowed to be slippery about them. Besides that, he's involved with Jake already, and has at least some incentive to keep on playing the game in order to maintain relations.
