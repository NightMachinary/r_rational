I would argue that it wasn't a Band of Five the same way that, say, The Calamities or the Woe are a band of five, or the band of five composed of both heroes and villains that made up the Five Stories.

It's a band like Bard has been part of, not a Band like Cat has been part of.

Still, I suppose there are benefits to having a band of five just at a tactical level even if it's not riding a story. Five people lets you cover all the major archetypes and party roles
