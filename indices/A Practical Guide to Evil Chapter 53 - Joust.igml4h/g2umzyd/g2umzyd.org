I hope I didn't miss someone else's thread, this chapter has been up for a while. Pretty exciting one too, what with Cat on the brink of a Name and all. I always like how smart the Dead King is. Tries rolling his vulture once an enemy jumps on it, and then just cuts his losses the second he knows the Knight Errant is doing more harm then good.

​

The new Name has almost come into fruition, and it's been a long time coming. It seems to be closely tied to her new role as a leader and arbiter of Named, and it may give her the power to hold sway over villains even if she loses the Night (which I personally suspect will happen once the war is over).

​

And for once, the Summoner actually pulled his weight pretty well. Archer and Huntress didn't try to kill each other either, so it's kind of amazing how well this little Named voyage went. A little odd that they didn't grab some random Name to make it the full five, but time was of the essence.
