I don't understand why they can't charge a fee then use that fee to refund those who don't get it.

Only in a very minute amount of time lines will the refund cause their firm to go bankrupt right?

The profit model is wait twenty years send back 99% of what was requested and keep the rest right? Since they could stay liquid just using the fees of new clients to pay off old clients because they won't have any other liquid demands until twenty years later or whenever the first time travel back is due.

Also how you gonna trust that business when you have no verification they did send anything back and have no incentive not to rip everyone off
