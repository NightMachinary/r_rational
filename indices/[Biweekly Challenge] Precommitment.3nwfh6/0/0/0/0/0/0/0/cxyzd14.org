The service that they offer is precommitment (which was this week's theme and the point of the story).

  You might make a commitment to do it, but after you saw that the electronics hadn't arrived in the warehouse, you'd break that commitment. Or maybe you'd do what some other people do, which is to say â€˜Well, alright, I'm going to just send it next Sunday, not today', but when they don't get a shipment from the future on Sunday, they push it back again, and never end up going through with it. So that's why we exist. We don't have a stake, so we just do whatever we were told to do. You make a commitment that you can't unmake.

This is (by implication) a world in which time travel has already been demonstrated a number of times, meaning that it's timeline #432454990 instead of timeline #1. This business probably couldn't exist without prior instances of time travel, but it still has to survive its own subjective first timeline.
