  Right, but there's absolute zero reason for the pre-commitment company to be the same company that does your time travel. Because if you hold the money for 20 years then you'll have it.

Maintaining control of the money means that there's no precommitment on your part, only commitment.

  Also why would anyone even do this? It's not like the other one where you net gain to all universe versions of you. You create another version of you by sending something to them (if it's causal timelines) and then lose your own wealth for their gain minus the fee.

While it's not a net gain for all versions of you, it's a net gain for the average version of you, which is why you'd do it. The reason that you have to do it via precommitment using a third party is that you would logically back out if you knew that you weren't going to be the beneficiary, which is what the guy tries to do in the story. Precommitment is used in order to completely eliminate the possibility of doing otherwise.
