Timelines are causal. In other words, timeline one causes timeline two.

For the scheme to work, the company has to survive the first timeline in order to spawn the second timeline. Unfortunately, if the company is giving refunds, the first timeline is the one that they're going to go bankrupt in, and then there's no second timeline. So it's not a minute amount of timelines go bankrupt, it's 100% of the timelines.

The reason you'd trust the business is that they've got a track record, one that was presumably hard-won in other timelines. That, or some kind of transparency and/or oversight.
