I was imagining that the casino owner didn't care about the other universes beyond his own reality (as well as having no interest in fairness); even if you don't care about a casino as much as your own life, if you've been living without thinking or caring about other universes you're not going to be happy about being suddenly driven into debt even if you're assured that practically all other yous are still well off--if all it takes is a casual word to get the whole thing derailed for certain and make sure you haven't lost anything significant by the next day, that casual word (that others aren't going to know about) is going to start looking pretty tempting. If there are casino owners which have several casinos or several liquid funds then they could just pay the debt with that instead of with the casino, so in that situation we can imagine that the gambler would have planned to continue the doubling until they were forced to give a casino to cover the debt. If you're still unsatisfied about the psychological aspect, you can rewrite your head-canon for the gambler to be aiming for a debt harder to accept, in order to maintain the theme of the gambler 'trying to bite off more than he can chew' (looking at a fair many-worlds perspective and missing the unscrupulous self-protecting perspective of the single-universe person versions he's effectively picking a fight with). --Ah, and I just remembered another thing: in addition to that the casino owner doesn't think of himself as gaining anything even if parallel versions of himself gain money, keep in mind that, though the gambler is convinced of there being many worlds, the casino owner probably doesn't know (or care) whether there are actually multiple worlds or whether the gambler is just being incredibly lucky.
