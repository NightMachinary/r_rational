Hyuuga are hardcore.

Would a version of the Hyuuga that didn't have a "main family" function better? The main family strikes me as such a security hole. If everyone were sealed and their lineage and governance was like any other clan (Not that canon ever elaborates on clan governance), with their brainwashing Hyuuga-worship, it seems like it would be much stronger.
