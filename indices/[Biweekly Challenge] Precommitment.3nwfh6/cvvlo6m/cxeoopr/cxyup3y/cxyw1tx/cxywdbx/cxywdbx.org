If something got sent back from the future, then it's not the first timeline. For someone to be in a timeline where something got sent back from the future, they need to be at least in the second timeline (because the thing that got sent back was sent back from the first timeline).

Under this model of time travel, the originating timeline never experiences any travel from the future, only travel to the past.
