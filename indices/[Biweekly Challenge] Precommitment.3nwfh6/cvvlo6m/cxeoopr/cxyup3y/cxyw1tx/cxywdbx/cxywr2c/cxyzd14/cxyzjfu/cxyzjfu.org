Right, but there's absolute zero reason for the pre-commitment company to be the same company that does your time travel. Because if you hold the money for 20 years then you'll have it.

You can precommit using fixed bonds or tons of other relatively non-liquid assets.

Also why would anyone even do this? It's not like the other one where you net gain to all universe versions of you. You create another version of you by sending something to them (if it's causal timelines) and then lose your own wealth for their gain minus the fee.
