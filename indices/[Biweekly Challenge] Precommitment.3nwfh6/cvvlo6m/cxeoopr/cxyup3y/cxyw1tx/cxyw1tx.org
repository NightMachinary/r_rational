  For the scheme to work, the company has to survive the first timeline in order to spawn the second timeline. Unfortunately, if the company is giving refunds, the first timeline is the one that they're going to go bankrupt in, and then there's no second timeline.

This only works if the first timeline has every single person not getting their thing sent back from the future... which if that is happening then something is wrong.
