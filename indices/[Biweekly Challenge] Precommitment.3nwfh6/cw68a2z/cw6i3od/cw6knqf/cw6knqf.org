Actually, I've only just created an account, so I don't have much experience with how the reddit infrastructure works. I've enjoyed reading [[/r/rational]] fiction for a while now, and been regretful that I couldn't see a way to make comments without registering, but it was today that I first read through the Biweekly Challenge runners-up, started musing about what I would/could write for Precommitment, had an idea, wanted to write down the idea, wrote down the idea and created an account so I could post it.

(Do you need to post to vote?) --Looking at [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/voting]] , voting should instead be the grey arrows to the left of the comments (I think), in which case what prompted your question?

(Hmm, only one day left until voting ends in any case, so I'm very late for this. Nevertheless, I'm happy that it has a chance to be read by others (rather than stewing in this head eternally without exiting).)
