I disagree that they wouldn't take that risk. The guy is basically paying more for the casino than it is worth (all casino games are house favoured), only one casino does badly Al other casinos do better.

The casinos owners don't care about the business in the same way a person cares about their liveliness.

The casino as a multi universe company is profiting from this and would do well to encourage all customers to give all their money on a 1/slightly more than casino is worth odds.

Edit: actually what would happen would be special consolidation entities where you pay a fee (your wealth) for a chance of getting money. If you lose you kill yourself so you're happy, and the net value for the business is positive due to the fee.
