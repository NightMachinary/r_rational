There's something interesting going on in the background there, and I'm not sure what...

Is the casino cheating, somehow for some reason? Double-sided coins are mentioned. Is there a mob involved, probably running the casino, and maybe they're double-crossing the guy with the brain box? Then I start to wonder, "to what end?" What's the significance of the on-screen box going red? Presumably a loss.
