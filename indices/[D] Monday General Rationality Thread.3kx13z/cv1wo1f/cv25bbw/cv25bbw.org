The biggest impact I experienced from increasing my physical fitness was increased emotional and mental stability. I started sleeping 8+ hours a night instead of the 5 or 6 I had been before. Whether due to exercise or physical fitness, my insomnia faded. I found I could concentrate for longer periods of time, and didn't suffer from fatigue and irritability at work. I also became active in a soccer league and have other ways to bleed off any assertiveness or competitiveness I feel, which may be why I never observed the effects you did. In general, as my outer strength increased, so did my inner strength.
