Okay, I see what you mean about the second point (although I still think that 7B+ AIs competing with each other to enforce only partially conflicting utilities sounds an awful lot like human society), but I don't understand why you think that having only one AI which is allowed to recursively self improve which then copies its improvements into the others to ensure a level playing field would cause the creator to have an ill-defined UF.

Could you elaborate?
