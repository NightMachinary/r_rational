What about hypothetical situations where you don't possess the technology to alter someone's DNA or develop a suitable drug? If a person is incurably violent, and someone at the state (or some other) level decides to assassinate or imprison them, isn't that strictly better than the null action (letting them pass on their genes / go on to commit violent acts)? Aren't we looking at a trolley car problem? To be sure it's better to save everyone in the trolley car problem, but isn't the choice to protect the most people generally the correct one when no other option exists?

I'm not sure I could push someone in front of a trolley or support a eugenics policy that involves killing people in real life, but that has to do with a sense that mistakes would be made / other choices would usually be available, not that the specific hypothetical has a different answer.
