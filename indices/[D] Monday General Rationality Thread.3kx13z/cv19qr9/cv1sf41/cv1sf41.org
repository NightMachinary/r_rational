It's not just unforeseeable consequences. It's that to start down the path of designing people, we need to start making blueprints of what humans should be. Moving from the Is to the Ought is likely what people are scared of. Even in the case of Down's Syndrome, it's not crystal clear that life with Down's is worse than life without Down's.

Another way to frame this would be Sartre's existence vs essence. People are fine rolling the dice for a new existence (traditional baby), but since we have a hard time choosing our own essence, we have a hard time choosing an unborn being's essence, and thus, its existence (eugenics).
