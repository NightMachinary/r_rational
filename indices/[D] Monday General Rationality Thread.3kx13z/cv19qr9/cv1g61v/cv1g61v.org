Another point: most people aren't willing to accept any form of eugenics whatsoever, but they seem to have no issue with regulations and limitations on adoption. I'm not 100% sure that's inconsistent, but it's suspicious. In general personal rights end when they start to affect someone else, and if you're a bad parent and you choose to have a kid either biologically or by adoption then you're infringing on the rights of someone else. To me they seem about equivalent.
