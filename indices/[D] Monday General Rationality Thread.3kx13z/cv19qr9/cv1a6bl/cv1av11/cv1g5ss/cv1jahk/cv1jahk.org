Not just ad-hominem attacks, but quite often, motte-and-bailey arguments. For instance:

#+begin_quote
  We should use Lockean property norms as the foundation for ethics instead of anything like happiness or satisfaction. You might think, when cutting up a pie, that it's ethical to cut it so as to make people happy, /but in fact/, this leads to the Repugnant Conclusion of Hedonic Utilitarianism, so fuck that noise.
#+end_quote

(I'm aware that some people in the "rationalist" community eat the bullet on the Repugnant Conclusion, but frankly I think that's a result of mistaking the useful maps provided by consequentialism and valuing of emotional states for the territory.)

But to identify the specific way in which this is motte-and-bailey: just because I endorse increasing happiness in /some situations/, doesn't mean that it's literally the only thing I care about. After all, sometimes I, a real human being, want a paper-clip, too.
