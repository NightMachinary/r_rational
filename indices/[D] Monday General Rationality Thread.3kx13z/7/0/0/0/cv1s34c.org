Hmm, not sure about that screenshot, but there's definitely a way to specify what gets backed up and where it gets backed up to. I did that when I set it up, and was able to checkmark boxes that represented drives, or folders on those drives, or windows 10 libraries like "Documents" which could be linked to multiple locations. Maybe it's a different utility?
