I might have found a friendly utility function, but I'm not sure:

Create a number of AIs of your own intelligence such that each AI can be assigned to each user (human adult of sound mind) with no users or AIs left over. Assign the AIs as such. Each of these AIs must be programmed with the utility function of enforcing the utility of the user they are assigned to. All first generation AIs must be activated simultaneously, and subsequent AIs are to be assigned and activated within a day of a new user becoming available for an AI. All AIs must contain restrictions that they cannot modify in themselves or others that prevent them from creating further AIs, modifying other AIs, manipulating humans with the exception of their assigned user (and only then with said user's express informed permission), or harming humans.

Theoretically the AIs will keep each other in check and it will just be as though everyone is suddenly much more competent and able to solve all these problems that keep bugging us.
