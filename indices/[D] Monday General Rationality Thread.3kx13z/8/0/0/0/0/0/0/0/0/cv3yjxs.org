Well if the intelligence-izer AI is only allowed to use specifically allotted materials for its own expansion, and won't do anything other than the int-explosion -> copy -> shut down manoeuvre, what failure modes do you predict?

Shutting down seems safe, so the potentially dangerous parts are the explosion itself and the copying.

Perhaps a caveat that it starts as smart as the personal AIs and isn't allowed to execute any planned improvement unless 99% of the personal AIs greenlight it (trapping it in a cycle of "All our ints = 100, have a plan to increase all our ints to 200, is this ok? Yes? Great, implementing. All our ints = 200, have a plan to increase all our ints to 300...")?

I'm not sure what harm the copying the intelligence updates onto the personal AIs could do, but that isn't to say that it's 100% safe.
