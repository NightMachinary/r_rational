Hm.

Fair criticism.

The first one we can fix by ammending that the AI creator AI is allowed to increase its own intelligence explosively, but the personal AIs are capped at the intelligence of the creator (maybe unable to design intelligence improvements themselves and only allowed to copy improvements from the creator?) Or if the creator has no incentive to get smarter, have an AI whose job it is to get smarter and then modify all the other AIs to be as smart as it is.

The second one I'm not sure how to address, but I will point out that AIs can't manipulate their users without informed consent so they won't be making many changes to their user's utility functions. And most people do not want to rule the world, even if they /think/ they do. /Especially/ not at the expense of friends. So I imagine it would look less like everyone suddenly trying to take over the world and more like constant jockying for a bit more control over their social circles and trying to break into better ones. Which is pretty much what we have /now/.
