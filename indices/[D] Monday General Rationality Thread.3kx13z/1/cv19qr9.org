At the end of a longish argument about eugenics online, I eventually got around to asking about "base framework" with one of my opponents with the following question:

#+begin_quote
  If you had a slider in front of you which could change the number of children conceived with Down Syndrome, would you:

  1. Increase the number of children conceived with Down syndrome.

  2. Keep the number of children conceived with Down syndrome exactly the same.

  3. Reduce the number of children conceived with Down syndrome.
#+end_quote

The response I got back was that just because we /can/ change something doesn't mean that we /should/. Which, if I'm being charitable, is an argument from unforeseeable consequences.

I've been trying to figure the human psychology aspect of this out for a few days now. It's partly a sour grapes argument, I think; we cannot actually move a slider, so moving the hypothetical slider is bad. It's partly a naturalistic argument. But ... I don't feel like either of those should actually convince someone who is thinking about it, they should be the sorts of arguments that just happen as a gut reaction.

I never really drilled down to an understanding of how my opponent's logic was failing, or what base framework they were operating under where their logic is sound. I'm thinking that it's related to the arguments against longevity, but distilled somewhat in that many of the more common objections (immortal dictator, boredom) are knocked out.
