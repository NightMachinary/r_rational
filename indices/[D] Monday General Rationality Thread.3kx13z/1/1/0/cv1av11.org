Yeah, I was expecting some other line of argument about how of course it's option three but the real world is more complex than a simple slider, which I completely agree with. The purpose of thought experiments (to my mind) is to find out what you actually think about things; once you've established that yes, you'd pull the lever to move the trolley over on its tracks to kill one person instead of killing five, we can start to have a conversation, even if that conversation is just about how we behave in certain hypotheticals versus uncertain reality.

(Another argument I was anticipating was that caring for people with Down syndrome follows some kind of marginal utility rule such that reducing the number of people with Down syndrome would increase the cost-per-patient of existing Down syndrome patients, in theory leading to a reduced amount of care for them. Similar to how if we reduced the number of blind people by 99% we might expect that blindness accessibility would become less important to us as a society, making it worse to be blind.)
