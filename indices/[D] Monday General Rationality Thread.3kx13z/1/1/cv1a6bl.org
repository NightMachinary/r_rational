I think that the guy probably had a "set" established in his mind by the previous eugenics discussion, so that he couldn't treat it as simply a slider that could only effect the number of children born with Down's Syndrome. If the slider had no other effects (including letting the same people have the same number of kids, but some that would have had Down's Syndrome would now be normal) there's no rational objection to moving it down as far as it goes.

On the other hand, in the real world, this slider also implies:

1. Reducing the number of children born to people who might have babies with Down's Syndrome. Even if those particular babies weren't always effected.

2. Creating the slider implies creating other sliders, that do things like (for example) reducing the number of black children born.

You can assert that it's a pure thought experiment with none of this related baggage, but they're aware of it anyway so accepting the legitimacy of the experiment is hard for them.
