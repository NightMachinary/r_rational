You need to make a verbal distinction between parents choosing what sorts of children they want to have, presumably according to their own moral views (which will on average be kinda-sorta ok, at least not /deliberately damaging/, despite not being very actively /optimizing/), rather than people talking about state policies designed to /eliminate unwanted populations/ (eg: the first half of the 20th century).

The former, on average, turns out ok. The latter are making a moral and intellectual error: that "badness" is an ontologically distinct /thing/ that can be /removed/, rather than simply being "the quality of being outside the small subset of states of affairs we deem Good."
