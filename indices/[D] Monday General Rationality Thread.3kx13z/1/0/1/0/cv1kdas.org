  The latter are making a moral and intellectual error: that "badness" is an ontologically distinct /thing/ that can be /removed/, rather than simply being "the quality of being outside the small subset of states of affairs we deem Good."

I don't really understand this as it applies to state policy. Or rather, I don't see how this is an error. How is "removing badness" substantially different from "changing the state of affairs from outside the subset of good to inside the subset of good"? How does one framing lead us to moral or intellectual disaster while the other does not?

I mean, let's say that there's some crime, like murder. How do the state's actions look different if they say "that's bad, let's eliminate murder" or if they say "that's outside the small subset of affairs we deem Good". I feel like in both cases the conclusion is the same, but then how does the distinction help us?
