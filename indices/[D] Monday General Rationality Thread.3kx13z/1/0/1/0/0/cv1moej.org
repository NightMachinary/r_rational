  I mean, let's say that there's some crime, like murder. How do the state's actions look different if they say "that's bad, let's eliminate murder" or if they say "that's outside the small subset of affairs we deem Good". I feel like in both cases the conclusion is the same, but then how does the distinction help us?

Let's switch the crime. Let's say it's drug-pushing. We can:

- Attempt to cure the systemic poverty that makes hard-drug usage a tempting, profitable vice, based on available literature ranging from Rat Park studies to economics.
- Stop using drugs to fund clandestine agents.
- Try to rehabilitate addicts.
- Give out free drugs everywhere.
- Just lock people up for decades at a time per offense.

Now let's try to figure out where the "causal cursor" in each of these proposals is, /where/ we're proposing to intervene:

- Very, very broadly. Multiple points of intervention up and down the history of any particular incident. Actually quite likely to work, in a fashion, /because/ it requires that /many different/ interventions /all fail in conjunction/ to raise the rate of further crimes.
- A very specific policy change. Attributes chief causal-power to the state and its clandestine agents. May yield a successful intervention /sometimes/, but also prone to winding up on [[/r/conspiracy]] ranting about Jewish lizard-men. Requires very specific information to figure out where the problem is /vulnerable/ to intervention.
- Intervenes on the criminal /after/ the incident has /already/ occurred, once we have the information that addiction treatment for /this/ person might be effective.
- Makes the problem worse, but certainly intervenes in a way that /affects/ the problem and involves no bad assumptions about causality.
- Assumes that the problem is that we're dealing with Bad People, and that if we only take away Those Bad People, our problem will get better, all else being equal.

The last option, being the one we took most strongly in real life, involves assuming there's an Essential Quality of Badness, whose quantity in the broad society must be reduced by just locking away the people who possess it. Any of the other four options becomes more visible when you take away the bad metaphysical assumption (which we are, unfortunately, very biased towards making by the Fundamental Attribution Error).

A very similar principle applies to Assassinating Terrorists, except that all the options besides "Kill it with drones" and "do nothing" are considered Completely Beyond the Pale.
