  Hypothetically speaking, if 99.9% of people with a certain gene displayed violent aggression resulting in assault or murder, then ... yes, we might actually improve the problem by removing those people from society in some ethical way.

See, here's where I run into a direct conflict of values, and therefore proposed actions, with both 20th-century eugenicists and the whole general category of genetics-based racists/categorists-in-general.

If allele X very reliably leads to social problem Y, /then we figure out how to engineer that allele away, or we make a drug to help with the problem, and then we offer it to people/. In fact, we maybe even offer the drug /before/ we convict someone of a crime when they've got that allele, at least under a certain severity, on grounds that they should have the chance to reflect, with sound mind, upon their actions, and decide whether they endorse their crimes/whatever as /part of their moral character/, or whether they've just got a physical condition they'd /like/ to treat or cure.

This includes "disadvantages" such as, say, purportedly having low intelligence. If some people committed a lot of crimes because they were genetically prone to low intelligence, low self-control, and high degrees of violence, /that would be something we could help/, by tracking down the biological roots and /curing/ them.

But when people go on about these supposed "disadvantages" while never pointing to a biological root amenable to curative intervention, I suspect they're engaging in motivated stopping because they're just prejudiced douchebags.
