This only works as an argument against state-sponsored eugenics when people don't /actually/ possess some Essential Quality of Badness. Hypothetically speaking, if 99.9% of people with a certain gene displayed violent aggression resulting in assault or murder, then ... yes, we might actually improve the problem by removing those people from society in some ethical way.

Speaking less hypothetically, if there are people with certain genetic conditions which result in a large state obligation (else social ills) the state might be justified in seeking to eliminate or reduce those genetic conditions from society where possible through ethical means.

Or in other words, the fundamental attribution error doesn't apply when the thing you're attributing really is fundamental.

(Which is not to say that there aren't some damned good arguments against state-sponsored eugenics, just that I consider this particular argument to only apply to a subset of state-sponsored eugenics e.g. eliminating poverty or crime as was done in the early 20th.)
