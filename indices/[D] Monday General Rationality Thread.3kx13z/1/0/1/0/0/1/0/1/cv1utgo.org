Not genetic, but permanent for the individual: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder#Primary_disabilities][Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]] *will* make you more prone to learning disabilities, violent behaviour, and give you poorer impulse control. And a whole slew of other generally agreed upon undesirable symptoms. It's not genetic, but it's most certainly something the mother can decide to risk or not risk. I, and many others, feel that society should apply /strong/ pressure to discourage drinking while pregnant.

Less obviously bad but actually genetic, some forms of dwarfism are dominant traits, and ones I would not mind the state using laws to wipe out (although we fortunately have the technology to help these people have children without passing on the bad allele).

I agree it would be bad to set up a a eugenics program where we base our decisions on melanin expression, or probably any other program that would stop a high percentage of people from breeding. But if we start out with fixing what's 'obviously' bad as and when we can, we can delay making any arbitrary lines in the sand until we have a fuller understanding of what 'grey zone' alleles do.
