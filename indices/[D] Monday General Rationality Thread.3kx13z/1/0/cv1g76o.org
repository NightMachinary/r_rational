In general in these arguments you'll find your partners don't argue against you, they argue against all other versions of the issue they've heard before. Like, on a basic level if you handed expecting parents a switch and said "press yes to have a Down Syndrome baby, no to not have a Down Syndrome baby, and do nothing to have a 1/1000 chance of a Down Syndrome baby" you can very reasonably expect people to pick not having a Down Syndrome baby, and you can definitely expect them not to press yes. Or if there was a shot you could give the mother, for example, that reduced the rate of birth defects with no side effects, most mothers would take it, just as most mothers don't drink or smoke during pregnancy even if they want to. People who are recessive carriers for certain diseases often have their partners get tested before having children, etc. On an individual level, when actually confronted with a choice that looks a lot like eugenics, or have similar outcomes to eugenics, people choose eugenics.

The #1 way to convince someone that eugenics is okay is to talk about individual instances of eugenics. People like each piece, but the name throws them off. In this way, Obamacare and eugenics are the same. (You won't believe how long I've been waiting to write that sentence, heh). Tell someone you want to make private health insurance more available on the free market without being tied to an employer, they nod along. Say that you think that parents should be able to keep their children on their insurance a little longer, and that sounds great. Call it Obamacare though and people fetch their internet pitchforks. ---E ---E ---E. Same goes for eugenics.

If it were cheap, safe, and easy to do in vitro fertilization and test the fertilized eggs for things like Down Syndrome and implant one without it, I would do that 100% of the time. I would not want to curse my child.

tl;dr: Obamacare is eugenics
