  On an individual level, when actually confronted with a choice that looks a lot like eugenics, or have similar outcomes to eugenics, people choose eugenics.

Note that this is true even when the eugenics is /terrible/ - I'm thinking of all the countries where sex-selective abortion and infanticide is causing issues, but I'm sure there are other examples.

In general, I think you can expect people to take an option that will help/improve life for /their/ child, and not to care at all about "altering the slider" on the general population. You can only get people to care about the latter through explicit argument; which will fail, because the eugenics movement has such a poor track record of making defensible decisions.

"This time it'll be different!" is hard to make /sound/ convincing without an obvious Schelling Point that's shifted, no matter how obvious the solution may be.
