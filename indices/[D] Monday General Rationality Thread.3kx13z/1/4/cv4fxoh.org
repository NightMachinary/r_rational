This is already a choice the world is making and the answer is "decrease as much as possible" Discussing it in hypoteticals gets waffling answers, but when prospective parents get a positive result on a prenatal diagnostic for downs, they go "abort->retry" at over 90% rates. Given the choice, people with genetic diseases will use IVF technologies to guarantee not passing them on in overwhelming numbers as well.

Generalizing from this, we can conclude that the problem people actually have with eugenics was the violence against existing human beings, and that the future is probably going to look a lot like GATTACA, the movie. And this will not be controversial.
