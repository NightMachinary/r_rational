  Have any of you signed up for 23andMe or a similar personal genome sequencing service?

I've signed up for it. My wife did too. We also gave it out as a gift to our immediate family.

For me personally, it didn't contain anything unpleasant, but that was a risk that I was comfortable with going in. My wife is a carrier for a single one of the ~52 inherited conditions that they check for, but since I'm not a carrier, the worst that's going to happen is one of our children will be a carrier.

I view the service positively and don't really think that I would be worse off knowing less ... but again, my results came back mostly positive.
