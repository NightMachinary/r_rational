I'm all for a company benefiting from their R&D and making a profit, but I'm against the idea of monopolizing the testing process.

Myriad is infamous for setting this precedent: patenting a gene like BRCA-1 and then jacking up the price to make a profit rather than letting it scale to the level of other gene tests? ugh.

That said, I've talked about it with my fiancee and we are signing up for 23andMe.
