So basically, yes; if 23andMe discovers that you have some mutation that proves to be the cure for cancer, they're the ones who can potentially profit from it.

I'm against patents on genes, but more generally speaking I'm in favor of data-mining large samples of user information to advance the state of the art in medicine (that they're using the information to do genetic research is what I would consider an incentive to use the service, rather than a reason not to).
