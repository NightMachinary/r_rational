[[/u/alexanderwales]] and [[/u/blasted0glass]] -- do you know if the Terms and Conditions signs over your genetic dataset to 23andMe?

i.e. if you have an unusual mutation that turns out to be a cure for breast cancer, can 23andMe then copyright your mutation and make it their personal intellectual property and upcharge patients for the privilege of this happenstance service?

I don't think there's currently a term for it, but it'd be a form of genetic speculation by getting a wide gene pool sample and then data-mining it for something useful (and then profiting off of a gene that is the property of a person, not a company)
