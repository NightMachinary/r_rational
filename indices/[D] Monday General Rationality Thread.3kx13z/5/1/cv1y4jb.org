Uhhhh infohazards aren't /really/ that kind of thing. In fact, most so-called infohazards are basically scifi hypotheticals.

Get the genetic testing, or wind up kicking yourself when it turns out you're Ashkenazi or something. Sorry, I just don't feel weird about it because "among my people" (literally: among my ethnicity), we're all so inbred that getting genetically screened before you're allowed to marry someone is normal. It's for the health of your children!
