the example i was taught in medical school during ethics classes had to do with: "what would happen if you found out that you had Huntington's disease?" even if it's illegal for health insurance companies to discriminate against you for this genetic pre-existing condition, the law doesn't protect you against unethical life insurance or disability insurance companies.

Granted, my situation is different, but I still had to jump through a bunch of hoops when I applied for disability insurance (and would I have been better off not knowing so much? ... or not disclosing it?)

edit: Also, my partner is Ashkenazi. And we already know some of her genes. But I'm of mixed Asian-descent.
