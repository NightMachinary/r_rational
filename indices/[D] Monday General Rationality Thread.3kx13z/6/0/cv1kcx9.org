i've been turning this one over in my head for a while. the way i'm picturing it, the central conflict becomes slavery. literally everyone in the galaxy accepts slavery of sophonts, both biological and mechanical. the clone war has two sides both using massive disposable slave armies. neither side is anything like what we'd consider 'good' or 'evil.' mind control isn't good, and lightning isn't evil, and what does it mean to bring balance to the force?

boy genius anakin skywalker is a roboticist who has created fully functional living people (in a +cave+ slave hovel) (with a box of scraps). he knows what droids are, and what slavery is. he's made one person to handle "human-cyborg relations," a great diplomat and polyglot, C3PO, and another to always be prepared and able to connect with any computer system, R2D2. then some wizards show up and tell him he's a wizard too, and he has to come with them to train to be a wizard. but as he travels with them and sees more of the galaxy, he realizes that these arbiters of truth, justice, and the galactic way are merely Light, not Good. meanwhile, Dark wizards have subtly taken over the highest echelons of government, with complex plots to use a manufactured war as a pretext for a full takeover. their words are seductive, but the reversal of foolishness is not necessarily wisdom.
