Question. I had a discussion with an interesting guy today, and came away from it somewhat at a loss. Emotionally, I feel that if advanced technology mapped out my brain and made a clone, that would not be me (although we would be very friendly, I'm sure). On the other hand, if I was cryogenically frozen and then restored to life in 200 years using advanced technology, that /would/ still be me. I know we replace almost all the atoms in our bodies over time and ship of Theseus and continuity of consciousness is broken every time we go to sleep and all of that, but I still don't /feel/ that a foreign mind identical to mine is me. I'm not quite sure where to go from there, since feelings aren't very good arguments.
