*How does a practicing rationalist apply physical fitness to his/her life?*

Personally I think my current active lifestyle is actually causing me to be less rational, and I'm not exactly sure of what I should be doing about it.

3 months ago I made a conscious decision to make my body more physically fit, and more objectively "beautiful". I proceeded to spend 1-2 hours per day doing high intensity weight training, and I altered my diet to be high protein/low carb/low calorie. The changes actually came on rather quickly. Noticeable strength increases, noticeable muscle definition, and a large boost in self-confidence. I believed (and still do believe) that incorporating this new lifestyle was a rational and optimal life decision. It's no secret that there are strong correlations between how attractive a person is and how much opportunity/leniency they get offered in life, the aforementioned self-confidence boost, and beyond that there are the latent longevity benefits from simply being a healthier person. At least, that was my thought process going into it.

I have now realized that there are adverse effects as well. Increasing the protein in my diet, and daily rituals of high intensity physical exercise have obviously (though to be perfectly honest this was only obvious for me in hindsight) increased my testosterone levels. And that has been nothing but trouble. My higher testosterone levels have majorly increased my sex drive and my aggression. My daily thought patterns have become riddled with notion of sexual and physical conquest that I simply can't ignore, no matter how hard I try. I truly believe it's affecting my ability to be a rationalist.

Don't get me wrong I can already see the obvious answers to my conundrum, "work out less, eat less protein, seek out a testosterone decreasing medication." But I want to use this opportunity to brainstorm the more broad question that I asked at the beginning.

"How does a practicing rationalist apply physical fitness to his/her life?." Successfully pursuing physical fitness requires a daily time investment (sometimes in the range of 1 or more hours), and it can alter your emotional/mental stability (as discussed in my post). Both of those things are rather valuable assets in life.

I'm seriously just looking for some advice. Does anyone else here regularly concern themselves with physical fitness? How do you balance it all?
