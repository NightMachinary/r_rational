Uhhhh.... I lift weights for one-to-two hours each session, three times a week. I've been starting to do cardio for 30 minutes on the elliptical machines again, and was pleasantly surprised this evening to find that I was actually in very good cardiovascular shape -- apparently biking to and from work was /actually helping/.

It's hard to give advice because, maybe because I only go three times per week, or maybe just because I'm /me/, I don't have as much trouble as you seem to do with the testosterone. Actually, one of the reasons I'm starting up with the additional cardio again is because I sorta want the boost to my sex drive and general physical energy again.

But do you really have trouble with exercise changing your personality overmuch? I dunno. Maybe try swapping some of the protein for fresh vegetables?
