If you're copied, it's vaaaguely like being split into two identical copies, which is kinda like going through a quantum "split" - that is, the odds that "you" would end up as a particular final product is about 50/50.

(This can be readily, if somewhat underhandedly, proved by imagining it has already taken place - what are the odds you're Rhamni-A vs Rhamni-B right now?)

Whereas if you stop, and then later an identical copy is created to resume where "you" left off, it's roughly analogous to being "paused" or frozen in time somehow; which is roughly analogous to unconsciousness or deep hypothermia.

So it makes a certain amount of easily-formalized sense to be much more suspicious of promises that you'll be copied and the copy will be rewarded/tortured, vs discussions of possible afterlives/resurrections. After all, there's a chance that the /other/ you is the one who survives, and you're the loser.
