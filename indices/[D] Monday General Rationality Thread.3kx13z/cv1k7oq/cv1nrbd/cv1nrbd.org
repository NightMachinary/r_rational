I deal with this by defining me as "my mind state and all descendants of my mind state".

Once my mind state has forked, the two forks are no longer "each other", but from the point of view of the "me" that has yet to fork, they are both "me".

So if I commit to frequent backups of my mind-state, then there will always be a time in my future where a copy of a descendant of my mind-states (i.e., "me") exists. The last version of "me" that doesn't get backed up because he died before the next trip to the upload clinic only gets a second-best "there's a copy of me that's three months old that will continue to live, I guess I'll think of that as losing three months of memory" as you do to make peace with yourself, or not... but the version of me that committed to the regular backups is still safe, because that last missed appointment is still in my future.

(of course this all falls apart because I can't backup my mind state, but it's the thought experiment that counts)
