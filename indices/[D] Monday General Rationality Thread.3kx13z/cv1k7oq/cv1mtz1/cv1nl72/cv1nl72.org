I suppose, where I'm going with this is: From the perspective of the me here and now... Is there in any meaningful sense a difference between the prospect of a mind like mine causally connected through cryogenics to my current brain, and the prospect of a brain constructed according to a map made of my brain before death which is then allowed to rot away? Because other than using different atoms, I don't see how they are meaningfully different. They are both descended from the everchanging squishy machine that is 'me' right now. For that matter, the map could equally be used to simulate me in a computer program. But those do not /feel/ intuitive. So does cryogenic freezing preserve anything meaningful that we couldn't get by using extreme resolution mapping of neurons and their connections?
