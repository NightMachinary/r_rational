Well, plainly you're just using an inadequately physical definition of "identity". What do you mean by the word in each case?

Plainly, two parallel copies of the same starting state, each one given subtly different interactions with its surroundings, will diverge. As far as we know, they both also have experiential content in the first place, even if it was two copies of the same experiences.

Just as plainly, one of you is causally continuous with the original you, and that's the original you, and the other one's causal history "branched" at the point of cloning. This is, of course, presuming that the cloning process is "bio-punky-y" instead of being "transporter-y", so that there isn't a physical process that destroyed a "first you" and created both "new yous".

Overall, who said that words and intuitions designed to apply in common cases apply equally well in corner cases? Suss out what you /really mean/ in precise terms, and the question should become answerable.
