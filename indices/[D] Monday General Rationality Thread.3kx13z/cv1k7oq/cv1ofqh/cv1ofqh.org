What you have to realize is that feeling itself, the feeling that you are you, is what is in fact suspect. Its something our brain's generate and its very useful for long term survival to have a concept of self that persists through time. Its embedded very deeply within the architecture of the mind and is only really conceivable from within that biological framework. Its not real though, its an illusion our minds generate.

The fact of the matter is, we don't exist in a persistent sense. You bring up the Ship of Theseus and replacing the atoms in your body, but the problem is even more profound then that. There is no part of the brain in which consciousness is generated. Rather, consciousness arises when the massively parallel system of neurons in the brain are acting in unity. Just like how the pixels on a screen can forms words or images when in unity, consciousness arises from the interactions of all these discreet and tiny pieces. And just like a computer screen, the image changes over time. Different neurons fire, leading to different patterns of thought, and a different image forms. We are literally different people at every second, as what we do changes. The sense of existing through time is entirely illusory, generated within the brain.

Its okay to have that feeling, its natural, and useful outside of edge cases involving mind-cloning and other such weirdness. But there's an easy way to demonstrate the limitations of it.

Lets pretend I kidnap you and take you to my mad engineering lab and knock you out. While you're unconscious, I make an impossible magical perfect copy of you, down to the fuzzy quantum scale, and set you both in an empty room to wait for you to wake up.

At this point, you and your identical copy wake up (at the same time of course,) and are left to figure out your situation.

In this scenario, can either of you figure out which of you is the 'real' you and which is the copy? You have the sense of being you, of always being you, and of being the true you. The other you in the room unfortunately has the exact same feelings, being a perfect copy of you. In his mind, he is exactly as certain as you as to his identity.

The trick is to realize that the sense of self isn't a neutral, passive observation, but is an active and persistent force, something your brain is generating constantly as its chief tool to navigate the world.

So which is the 'real you' ?
