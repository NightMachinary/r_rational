I just finished reading Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy, and I absolutely love his approach to learning about philosophy, which he describes as follows:

#+begin_quote
  In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held. Contempt interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the second.

  Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever. When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd, we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to understand how it ever came to seem true.

He follows his own advice throughout the book- even with philosophers he absolutely hates, like Nietzsche. In general, he only brings in his own opinions and rebuttals after he's made the most convincing argument he can in favor of a philosopher's work.
