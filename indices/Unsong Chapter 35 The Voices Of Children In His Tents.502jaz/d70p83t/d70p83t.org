...I am kind of puzzled by the fact that the Comet King, who apparently can understand placebomancy, thought this would work. Maybe the genre he views his placebomancy is from antiquity where spawning a massive army would be viewed as a valid strategy? Even so, and then the invincible super army of Demihumans curb-stomped hell seems like a really lame story ending. Plus placebomancy should make conservation of ninjutsu a thing.
