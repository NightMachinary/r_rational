Wait, why would he stop having kids? Just because they'd die agonizing deaths? But if that increases the chances of pushing hell back, even by a bit? Wouldn't it be worth it? This seems kinda OOC to me. Also, I'm uncertain about this, but it seems to me that if he had had more kids, the prophecy wouldn't come about. Or, if he pre-committed to have more kids no matter what, the prophecy wouldn't have come. After all, the prophecy was about a world where he only had four kids. I'm not entirely certain about how prophecy works, but i think if he pre-committed had more kids and keeping one in a constant coma in his palace or something, the prophecy couldn't have come true. TL;DR: letting a prophecy deter you from a course of action seems like a bad idea, as if you do, the negative outcome will only come to pass in the world where you were deterred, but not necessarily in the one where you continued. You have no information about the potential world where you continued with the action, so you should just go with your original decision.
