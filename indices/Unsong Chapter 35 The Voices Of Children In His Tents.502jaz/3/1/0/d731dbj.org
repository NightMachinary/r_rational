That sounds terrible o_O Not just in the "I'd hate to live there" sense (hell we probably don't have free will in the real world anyway), I mean as a story. I know some people don't mind spoilers, but I would grow utterly bored with the books once it was clear the characters could do nothing to change anything important.
