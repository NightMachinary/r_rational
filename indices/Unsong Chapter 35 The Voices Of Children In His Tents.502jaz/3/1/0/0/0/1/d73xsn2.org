How prophecy and free will work in Erfworld is weird -- scratch that, the physics of Erfworld are weird in ways that put Unsong to shame. But I don't think anyone in-story really knows how the prophecy/free-will stuff works. Prophecies come in both the "You will one day serve under dame Olive Branch" and the "In five seconds dame Olive Branch will be /there/, above that rampart" varieties. There is one story about a side that tries to use prophecies to its advantage -- removing key soldiers from a city fated to fall to the enemy and so on.

  if you try to manipulate Fate so that it turns out well within the bounds of prophecy, then terrible things happen anyway.

In retrospect that was based off a single incident where the plan to manipulate Fate worked out ideally -- at the same time a third party coincidentally enacted a long-planned operation to cause a different Terrible Thing to happen. Not like in HPMOR, where that one attempt to manipulate Prophecy leads directly to spectacular failure.

There's a different story where a seemingly-terrible prophecy comes to pass, but its worst effects are (eventually) mostly negated by the protagonist's agency. IIRC there's also an incident where a particular person was Fated to die in a fire -- so someone else did something vague, and actually changed that Fate to death by suicide. Said character ultimately died in a fire they themself started. So there's that.
