I suppose all that's left on the true-false/taken seriously-ignored graph is a prophecy that everyone takes seriously that is completely false. If it's a prophecy on the side of the protagonist, it's going to be a downer when everything falls apart. If it's on the side of the antagonist, well...what's different from the villain saying "I'm going to conquer you" and a false Oracle saying "he's going to conquer you" after all is said and done? Narratively, I'm not sure it can be useful, outside the misinterpreted prophecy trope.
