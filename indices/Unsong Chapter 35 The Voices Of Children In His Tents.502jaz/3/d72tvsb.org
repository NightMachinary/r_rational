One of my greatest hopes for this sub is to produce or direct me to a story that actually uses prophecies to make the story better, rather than undercut agency, spoil plot points, and artificially entice readers.

I'm still on board and enjoying Unsong a lot, despite some criticisms expressed by others, but this chapter ending is going to bother me for awhile. Here's hoping it leads to an ingenious twist, but it's a feeble hope, tired from repeated disappointment. And even if it does, I'll probably still think the story would have been better without it in the first place.

God I hate prophecies. Just... so, [[https://m.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z5ooe/d_goddamn_do_i_hate_prophecies][so much.]]
