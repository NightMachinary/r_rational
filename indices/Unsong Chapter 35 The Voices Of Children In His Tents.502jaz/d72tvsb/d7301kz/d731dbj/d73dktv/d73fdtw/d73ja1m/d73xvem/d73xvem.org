  The less you know about what is to come, about your Fate, then the easier it will be for you to get there, the less...you and others will have to suffer, to lose. That quote is from Delphie, Wanda's boss in the prequel story. But then, in book 3 there is one incident where Wanda's view on prophecy is rebuffed by an actual prophet.
