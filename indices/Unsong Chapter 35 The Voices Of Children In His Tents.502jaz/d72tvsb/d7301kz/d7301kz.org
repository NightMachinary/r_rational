I'm suddenly interested in thinking about how prophecy affects stories. I read Erfworld a lot, and there at least there's a depressing "the future is written" vibe where if you try to fight Fate terrible things happen, while if you try to manipulate Fate so that it turns out well within the bounds of prophecy, then terrible things happen anyway. There's precious little to do but hope that your Fate is a pleasant one.

  The less you know about what is to come, about your Fate, then the easier it will be for you to get there, the less...you and others will have to suffer, to lose.
