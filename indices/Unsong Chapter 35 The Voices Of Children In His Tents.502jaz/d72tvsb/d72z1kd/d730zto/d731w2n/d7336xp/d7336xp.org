Right. A well respected prophet telling a villain the wrong thing to make them overconfident and fail is a nice twist, but it adds very little to the story, especially in a world where he had no reason NOT to belive the prophecy since prophecies are real in his world.

And heroes rushing to edit a prophecy that fortells how the villain wins before he reads it so he's misled... Well, that wouldn't actually change anything, since prophecies are inviolate regardless of whether they're read properly or not.
