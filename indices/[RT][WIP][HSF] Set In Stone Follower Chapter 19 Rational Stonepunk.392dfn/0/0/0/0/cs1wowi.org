Sorry, was a bit busy yesterday. Don't worry too much about the grammar. I'm just going to highlight some things that pop up and some light googling should sort you out. You only need to brush up on three tenses and one mood for your story.

First sentence requires *past progressive tense* use. Use this if the action directly ocurs. I was planning the meeting in her office when Brian entered. (The planning is occurring when the second action takes place). Here the planning action occurred in the past and led to the suggestion. That's *past perfect tense* (or possibly *past perfect progressive tense* )

#+begin_quote
  I suggested (placing the pit) on the western edge of the road only because I had planned to scoop up the land on that side.
#+end_quote

Second sentence highlight your second common tense problem, counterfactuals, and requires you to use *subjunctive mood*.

#+begin_quote
  Had there been a cistern close to the road I would have established a little roadside market where wagons could have watered their animals and people could have bought seeds, produce, eggs or swine culls.
#+end_quote

The third sentence requires you to use past perfect tense to improve your timeline's order. Also consider switching away from your use of 'turning away and stalking back to camp'as a *Verbal* . That can confuse readers who mistake if for present progressive tense and believe he's still stalking back to camp.

#+begin_quote
  My preference: Somehow I had managed to not throw them back at her but had placed them in my own pouch before I had turned and stalked back to camp.

  Also correct: Somehow I had managed to not throw them back at her bu had placed them im my own pouch before turning and stalking back to camp.

One, last note. Try a book by Virginia Tufte: Artful Sentences. She's probably the best person to read to improve your writing style. I think it'd be a good match.
