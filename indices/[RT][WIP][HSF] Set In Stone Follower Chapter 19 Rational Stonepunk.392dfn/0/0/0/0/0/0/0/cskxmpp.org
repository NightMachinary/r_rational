I agree. Plot, structure, and dialog are my biggest concerns right now. Grammar is on the horizon, but I know my writing is coherent enough that grammar isn't a major distraction to most readers. That's not going to stop me from poking at that book you suggested, but it's not at the top of my list.

Right now I'm writing a fanfic to explore what I learned from a book about plot and structure, and reading a book about how to write clear, hard-hitting dialog, which I also plan to begin implementing.
