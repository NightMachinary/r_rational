Don't worry about it. Grammar mistakes tend to be more noticeable when you read in editing/critiquing mode as oppozed to simply enjoying the story, reading in your normal manner. They also tend to vary from context to context, formal grammar is probably less suitable for two 12 year olds cracking jokes than it would be in an office scene. Playing it by ear, as you are doing, is generally okay.

Still, 'proper' grammar forms the bedrock of the everyday material we read in the news, in books and most formal communications. It'll be what your readers are most comfortable with across regions and fields with different language variants so brushing up and ensuring a consistent and familiar grammatic style helps you deliver your story better.

Just don't go worrying about every little old rule.
