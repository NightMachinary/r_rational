Beginning to close in on the doorway to what my new book calls 'Act III'. Yes, I've bought a book on plot and structure. I'll mention the name of the book, and the author, but no linkies. It's on Amazon.

'Write Great Fiction - Plot and Structure' James Scott Bell

I highly suggest it. He avoids using strange literary terms, and uses plenty of examples of solid writing.

He also gives a name to two classes of fiction that I now recognize that I have been struggling to differentiate.

Commercial fiction vs. literary fiction. Just understanding those two terms helped me understand what I was doing, a whole lot more.
