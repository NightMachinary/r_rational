Thanks!

The first sentence had an extra 'was' and was a bit repetitive with the word 'west' so I adjusted the wording.

I also poked around in the sentences around the other two sentences above, and found one questionable verb which was changed. It's been over 25 years since my last English class - did I find the problems?
