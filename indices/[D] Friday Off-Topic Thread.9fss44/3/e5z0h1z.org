[[https://money.cnn.com/2016/07/08/autos/aaa-cheap-gasoline/index.html][Apparently]], discount-branded gasoline is significantly worse for engines than is gasoline distributed by established brands.

What gasoline stations do you pass on your daily commute? In my ~1.5 hours per day of driving, I see:\\
- Morning\\
- - Established\\
- - - Lukoil****\\
- - Discount\\
- - - U. S. Gas (2)\\
- - - US Petroleum\\
- Afternoon\\
- - Established\\
- - - Citgo*\\
- - - Wawa****\\
- - - Sunoco\\
- - Discount\\
- - - U. S. Gas (2)**\\
- - - Amera

There also used to be a Conoco station on my morning path, but it closed some months ago. There's one other closed (and being demolished) gas station on my morning path, but it's been closed (and had all branding removed) since before I started commuting (~1.75 years ago), so I don't know to what brand it belonged.

*I use this Citgo station because it comes soon after a Wendy's restaurant, so I can eat a Junior Bacon Cheeseburgerâ„¢ while my gasoline is being pumped, rather than (1) messily and dangerously fumbling with the well-stuffed burger** while I'm driving or (2) spending a few extra minutes on parking at Wendy's.

**I find the Junior Bacon Cheeseburger (beef patty, lettuce, tomato, and bacon) significantly less flat, and therefore more difficult to handle, than the McChicken (chicken +tendie+ patty and shredded lettuce). (From my afternoon path: one McDonald's is accessible directly from the highway; one Wendy's requires a minor detour; and a Burger King, a McDonald's, and two Wendy's restaurants require major detours.)

***Yes, I directly pass /four/ U. S. Gas stations (not to be confused with U. S. /A./ Gas). (Two of them---one on each leg of my commute---were Citgo until a few months ago. Maybe the change has something to do with the upheaval in Venezuela, which owns Citgo.)

****Lukoil and Wawa are established gasoline brands but are /not/ part of the Top Tier group that was tested by AAA.
