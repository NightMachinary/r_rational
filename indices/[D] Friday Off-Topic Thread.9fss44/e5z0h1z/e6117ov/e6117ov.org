On the burger handling note, I agree that the mcchicken is easier to handle. I don't mind squishing a burger, I think that could work with a junior bacon so long as there is not too much mayo.

Also, I want to share a link re: commuting. [[https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/06/the-true-cost-of-commuting/]]

It's obviously not going to apply to everyone (the driving could be necessary for the job itself, cannot relocate house, etc.), but I think it is helpful to consider the time costs alongside gas and mileage costs when budgeting for car driving.
