We don't have the equipment to do that and don't know anyone who does, and we don't have the money to hire someone to do it.

As it were, over the last 20 hours the predictions for this area have changed a lot, it's heading a bit farther southwest than they thought it would and it's also going to turn north slightly later, which means it'll have been travelling over land for longer by the time it gets here so it'll be a bit weaker and also a bit farther away. At the time I made that comment, a lot of spaghetti models showed it heading more directly west and turning north sooner, which would've put it significantly closer to our house after having traveled over land for less time. The official forecast had the thing pointed on a direct path from the ocean to the city I live in at one point, so I freaked out a bit (it would've had to have made landfall at Myrtle Beach for that to happen and it ended up happening farther north near Wilmington, but it still could've turned south and followed the coast before making landfall again). We're still going to get a significant amount of rain and wind (and my grandmother's house is still almost certainly going to lose power for an uncomfortably long period of time), but we're not going to get hit by a full-on tropical storm, just a tropical depression. I think the tree'll be fine, it's old enough to have gone through this level of weather more than a few times.

And now having typed all this and then checked out the local news, it looks like 10,000+ customers around the Charlotte area have lost power and a notable number of trees are down. So who knows? This stupid storm has been weird and hard to predict this entire time.
