Thanks. Power came back on literally like 5 minutes ago, it went out less than half an hour after I posted that last comment, we were only without power for right about 24 hours. Florence apparently went WAY farther west than they thought it would, it barely grazed us. They were predicting Sunday was going to be the worst day for this area, but it looks like the worst already passed with just a little bit of strongish wind and slightly more forceful than average rain.
