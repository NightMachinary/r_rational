I live somewhere within a 50 mile radius of Charlotte, North Carolina. Florence is obviously not going to be as bad here as it'll be in other areas of NC/SC, but if it follows its projected track, it's going to be to our southwest, putting us in the northeastern quadrant of the thing. That's the part of the storm you're not supposed to be in, and it's projected to still be a relatively powerful tropical storm by the time it hits us. There's a strong possibility of 10+ inches of rain and 50+ mph winds, and being to the northeast of the center means there's a non insignificant probability of tornadoes forming in the area. Hugo came through the area in '89 a few months after I was born so I don't remember it, but I've seen pictures and heard stories. I have memories of Fran in '96 and Floyd in '99. Trees are gonna come down, and we're gonna be without power for at least a couple of days, possibly longer since restoration efforts are going to be focused on the areas to the east and southeast that were legitimately decimated. /And/ we're living at my grandmother's house at the moment, and because of where she lives it's always taken her a week to have her power restored after these big events, so there's no telling how long we'll be without power.

Speaking of living at my grandmother's house... If these emmer effers would've closed on our house at the end of July like they were supposed to instead of getting /two/ extensions, we'd've already moved and we'd be living in New York right now. Our house faces west (technically "west by north"). There's a 50 foot tall tree about /five feet/ in front of the house. I /think/ the wind should be blowing from east to west, so if the tree gets knocked over it'll fall away from the house, but I'm not certain, and the possibility of tornadoes adds to the uncertainty because there's no real guarantee of which way the wind will be blowing in localized areas. They're living in the house and renting while we live at my grandmother's house (we're making a $30,000 profit and we're going to use part of that as the down payment on the new house so we can't actually move until after closing) and the power's going to be out for a significant amount of time so if the tree falls we might not know about it until several days later. If that goddamned tree falls on that goddamned house... We're going to be fine, but I'm incredibly anxious at the possibility of this goddamned storm effing everything up.
