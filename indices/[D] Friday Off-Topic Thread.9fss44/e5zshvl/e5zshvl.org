I went out to investigate crashes at some faraway places in the nice, pretty, photogenic, lush, part of the state I live in.

As promised, here's some photos I took. I lost the ability to put captions on the pictures, so the ones that don't have captions are assorted road sections, wildflowers, and a few photos of kangaroos running in front of our car. They're similar to deer in the USA in that they are often hit by cars and damage the car. We probably had about 5 run in front of us, and I caught two of them with the camera. They are generally only active at dawn and dusk, but on the second morning we left the hotel at 6am, so that's why we saw so many.
