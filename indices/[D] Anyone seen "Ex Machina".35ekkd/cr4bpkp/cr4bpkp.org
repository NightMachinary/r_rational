My suspension of disbelief was broken during Nathan's description of the first "power outage" and his ass-backwards "security". The guy is supposed to be a tech genius and he hasn't heard of two-factor authentication? For that matter, a simple password without the use of key cards would have prevented the the security breach that happened. And he paid a "fortune" for the power system at his remote mansion, but he hasn't heard of the concept of isolation or air-gapping, or at least root-cause analysis for his /extremely frequent/ power problems. And for some reason, when he is running on backup power, his security systems and computer shut off? A $100 UPS could have saved his computer and his cameras. Ugh.

Ignoring the plentiful technical blunders, I didn't find the human characters at all interesting or engaging, and the plot was slow, boring, and utterly predictable.
