Depends. If the first AI is a brute force "We managed to simulate an accurate enough map of a human neural connectome to get something that thinks out of the server farm" it would probably be very human indeed. Because it mostly would be. Probably not meaningfully the person it's based on, as that would require more fidelity than is likely for the first prototype.. but "A human being, more or less".
