My primary complaint is that the AI seems a little TOO advanced for the presumably modern setting. The thing that makes that even worse is that it's supposed to be one of the earliest successful models. I have no problem with the idea of emotional computers being made eventually, but the first stable AI to be made most definitely will not be as human in mind as she is portrayed.

Still, it's a pretty good movie, if you have enough suspension of disbelief to go around.
