Not rational, per se. But a much more intelligent portrayal of AI in movies than I am used to. I especially liked the fact it avoided the usual romantic cliche at the end.

Watched it on a plane with a bad audio connection, so some of the finer details may have escaped me. So, I apologize in advance if the following comment is cringe-worthy/offensive, but it bothers me and I have to ask:

The movie basically seems to be an anthropically aesthic version of the AI box experiment, with a drastically dialed-down non-self-modifiying AI. So, is it just me or does the AI inventor genius (Nathan ?) have a superficial resemblence to EY ? I realize, of course, that Nathan's actions are very contrary to EY's stance on uFAI, etc. and again I mean no offence.
