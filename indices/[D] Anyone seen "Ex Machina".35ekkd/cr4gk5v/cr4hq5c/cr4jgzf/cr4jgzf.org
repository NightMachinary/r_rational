  His ultimate goal (at least, I am inferring this from his reveal to Caleb) was to observe the interaction and PoV from both sides as his AI used the tools at its disposal to manipulate Caleb, which worked pretty much exactly as it should have.

Sure. But what does this /gain/ him? /Why/ does he want to observe this specific interaction? He's built this massively complex, horrifically unethical situation, so that he can... build a machine that is /even better/ at manipulating humans? If his *goal* is unfriendly AI, he's going about it in a /ridiculously/ convoluted way.

Some of his actions /do/ make sense in the context of the film. It's the context itself I take issue with.

(I highly recommend the novel [[#s][Blood Music.]])
