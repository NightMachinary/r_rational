Would watch again/10

Not really mind blowing, given the slow pace, but it introduces a few concepts those unfamiliar with AI probably haven't seen in other films.

It's not particularly a thriller, as the trailer might imply. I wouldn't say the main character was irrational or holding the idiot ball, but suffered from a lack of genre savvy I'd expect any AI researcher to have.
