Nathan holds the idiot ball in a major, major way.

SPOILERS BELOW

1. Nathan is aware of what Ava is doing with the power yet continues to use a power-down locking system. Even if the power outages are totally fake, her actions are at least somewhat unpredictable. She might /really/ damage the house power and security system.

2. He attempted to physically combat /two/ AIs with microsecond-resolution expression-reading capability, unknown(?) strength and speed, with /very high/ electrical requirements, more than capable of modifying themselves into super-Tasers, constructing weapons, etc etc. I grant that he knew their designed capabilities and perhaps made them physically weaker than himself (and he is a strong man), however this was a really, really stupid error and he deserved what he got. (I was very disappointed by how ineffective the fembots were; even at a lower strength level they should have pwned him like Batman versus an elderly drunk.)

3. The whole test protocol was doomed and stupid from the start. Empathy for the AI as victory condition? People are wired to experience empathy. We attempt to release suffering lab animals or factory farmed animals; even /lab plants/ are occasionally stolen and replanted. /Of course/ any remotely normal human being is going to empathize with the vulnerable, attractive prisoner. There's a fair chance a given test subject would release the AI with no verbal interaction or personal bonding time at all. The only "test" here with the benefit of hindsight, is "is Caleb a psychopath /who doesn't bother to fake niceness/?"

4. Perhaps this is an explanation - Nathan is psychologically fucked up to an absurd degree. He appears extremely depressed, is drinking himself to death, thinly maintains a false personality that is a caricature of an alpha male "dudebro", and keeps the gruesomely injured hyperrealistic bodies of nude women (who he knows had /self-awareness/) in his /bedroom/. His only human contact is Caleb. Apparently he has abandoned all self-checking. (Granted, this may be a reason for the rest of the idiot ball actions.)

And there's more.
