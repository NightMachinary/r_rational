It was worth watching to be sure, but it wasn't great by any means. Likely nothing anyone on this sub hasn't already seen.

For the portrayal of an AI, top notch (for a mainstream movie at least). That's about all it has going for it though. The movie itself leaves much to be desired. Two dimensional characters with not much of a plot to speak of. Technical inaccuracies are enough I would not consider this HSF.

My biggest gripe is that the humans are shown as having to make stupid mistakes for the AI to take advantage. Ideally, they should be portrayed as making highly intelligent, sound, considered, informed decisions, taking every precaution imaginable, and still being played like a harp by the AI. This would have improved my opinion by an order of magnitude at least.
