Honestly, whenever I see movie AI researchers, I sit there gawping, "Do you want a hegemonizing swarm? Because this is how hegemonizing swarms start. And what's the #1 rule of successful research into very powerful technologies? Hint: NO HEGEMONIZING SWARMS EVER."

EDIT: Upon checking TVTropes, apparently this film contains the more anthropomorphic kind of robots, so that above objection doesn't apply.
