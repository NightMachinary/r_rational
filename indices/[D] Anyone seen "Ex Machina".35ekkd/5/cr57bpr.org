I was excited to see an AI shown with more fidelity than most movies (having seen Age of Ultron yesterday and being slightly annoyed).

I think the cinematography was great. I thought the characters were all interesting, and I'm not sure what people mean when they say "two-dimensional characters": Only Caleb really is, and that's arguably for a plot reason (i.e he was chosen); Nathan and Ava both showed a lot of complexity.

Also, I think it was well paced, and I loved the way it was pretty much split into different "acts" by the session/day number. I thought it progressed well, and the character dynamics over that span of time were pretty good.

I love the premise. Some scenes were just incredibly good, like the first scene where the power goes out, and the scene where Caleb cuts himself open to make sure he wasn't just an AI. Also, the climactic scene.

Something about it struck home with me. Maybe it's that I like slower-paced films, maybe I'm just a sucker for love+artificial intelligence (I did really like Her...), but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and am intending to see it again as soon as I have plausible reason to (a friend is coming back from college in a couple weeks...).
