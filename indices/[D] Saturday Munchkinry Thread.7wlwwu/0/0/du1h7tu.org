Doctor here. "Do no harm" sounds good, but prevents all sorts of useful things like surgery (gotta cut first), most medications (pesky minor side effects) or any significant good act with manageable but extant physical downsides.

Even something that tries to encode empathy like, "You experience whatever you inflict on others," would have horrible consequences, as I couldn't do minor procedures, or goodness forbid I have the compounded GI side effects of all my patients' medications simultaneously.

If I were to define a moral impulse, I'd have to think of what might make a society functional, even if it doesn't align with my values. Which I can't even begin to get at currently. Sorry if this wasn't as helpful, but should hopefully point out some failure states.
