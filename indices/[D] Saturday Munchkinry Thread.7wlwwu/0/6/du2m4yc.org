"Good acts are henceforth broadly defined as actions which meet at least three of the five following criteria:

1) Actions for which you have evidence or logical reason to believe will increase the net well-being (knowledge, happiness/enjoyment, positive social bonds, and physical/mental health) of the sum of all sapient beings you are aware of.

2) Actions done to others which you would reasonably want done to you if your roles and circumstances were reversed (considering all plausible alternative options), provided that you also believe that an average and reasonable person would similarly agree if they had the same knowledge of the circumstances.

3) Actions which, if done by all humans under the same circumstances, would (when considering all likely consequences) lead to a situation or environment that humans would prefer overall to the current situation or environment. Additionally, include any actions which, if not consistently done by humans under the same circumstances, would reasonably result in a situation or environment that humans would not prefer overall to the current situation or environment (again considering all likely consequences).

4) Actions which, considering the circumstances, would reasonably be taken by or approved of by at least 4/7 of the following people: Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., George Orwell, Noam Chomsky, Susan B. Anthony, Lu Xun, and Nelson Mandela.

5) Actions which limit the risk of plausible disastrous changes which could threaten the continued existence of the human race (e.g. nuclear warfare, global climate change, mass outbreaks of infectious disease, gamma ray burst extinction events, massive asteroid impacts, etc.).

Note: Disregard any expected punishments for the action in question while making these considerations if the action of the punishment itself (considering both its implementation and its reasoning/intent) would not be classified as a good act by at least 3/5 of the listed criteria."

This is essentially a cobbled together polling system between act utilitarianism, the golden rule, Kantian ethics, what would Jesus do (substituting with a poll of modern secular figures), and an added mass-extinction prevention criterion.

This seems relatively solid to me, but I invite others to find holes.
