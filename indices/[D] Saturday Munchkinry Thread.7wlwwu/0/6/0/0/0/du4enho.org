  Criteria 3 could conceivably lead to xenocide, but you'd need a human race which prefers (some or all) alien races to be dead.

You'd just need a human race which believes it would be better off if the aliens aren't there. Which could come down to xenophobia and a fear that they are "taking our jobs".

  It seems likely that the most plausible and egregious examples would emerge from ignorance rather than simply disliking ugliness.

Point taken

#+begin_quote
  I don't actually have a solid gut reaction to that, in terms of whether it's good or bad, though I'm leaning towards calling it a less-than-ideal good choice.
#+end_quote

I think that the original criteria would be improved by replacing the references to "humans" with references to "intelligent life". This means that exterminating an alien race for spurious reasons suddenly becomes a lot harder, because people are first forced to think of the aliens as moral agents in and of themselves; (5) suddenly screams against the interstellar war instead of weakly supporting it, and even (3) no longer pulls so unquivocally against the aliens.

In the example you gave (of the aliens of threatening appearance but unknown benign disposition) that change would merely make people a little less trigger-happy; not force their hands off the trigger entirely.
