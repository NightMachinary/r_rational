Criteria 3 could conceivably lead to xenocide, but you'd need a human race which prefers (some or all) alien races to be dead. It seems likely that the most plausible and egregious examples would emerge from ignorance rather than simply disliking ugliness. I have a hard time imagining we'd massacre a slug-race just because they're ugly.

However, if we made first contact with an alien race which looked and moved exactly like the aliens from /Alien/ but we hadn't yet deciphered their communications and determined that they were an otherwise peaceful and productive federation, and they were currently in the process of preparing to launch ships from their planet's surface /en masse/, I could totally see criteria 3 justifying pre-emptively nuking them from orbit. Criteria 5 would also probably call for their mass extermination with that set of information. Even criteria 1 might call for their mass extermination under those circumstances.

I don't actually have a solid gut reaction to that, in terms of whether it's good or bad, though I'm leaning towards calling it a less-than-ideal good choice. It's clearly regrettable that we don't yet know enough about them to know that they are not a threat if we don't attack, but we have to make decisions with the information available to us. If we don't believe we have time to get more information, then we are forced to make immediate decisions in the most reasonable manner based on what we know so far.
