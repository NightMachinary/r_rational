  What definitions sounds good from getgo but could have horrible consequences if actually brought to life?

Literally every one. You do realize that this is (subtle) mind control on a global scale right? That's a horrible consequence: everyone getting their free will (partially) overwritten.

And then there's the standard AI utility function problem: you tell your AI to maximize the number of living humans, and it puts them all in tiny nutrient boxes after removing all organs and limbs and body/brain functions that are unnecessary for survival. The same things could easily happen here, with humans thinking that chopping off other people's arms and legs and making them live in tiny nutrient boxes (where they can no longer hurt themselves or other people) is an act of great goodness. And as far as I know, no one has solved the AI utility function problem yet. So whatever you put would probably have the same kind of horrible consequences as a rogue AI.

The worst part is that you can't refuse, or the power could go to an idiot or a villain. You can't even write "remove this gene from your body" since they could kill themselves trying to remove the gene. You could write something impossible, like "draw a square that is a circle", but even that could have horrible consequences down the line, if our technology one day progresses to the point where the impossible becomes possible, and now the entire human race is turned into a paper clip maximizer, endlessly converting all the matter in the universe into more squares that are circles.

I'm somewhat tempted to just write "kill all humans" and have the human race kill itself to spare whatever sapient alien races are out there in the universe, but even that would have horrible consequences, since the mind control isn't complete. People who want to be "bad" would refuse and could survive all the "good" people rampaging about. And then all good people would just die out and the surviving human race becomes one of extreme villainy.
