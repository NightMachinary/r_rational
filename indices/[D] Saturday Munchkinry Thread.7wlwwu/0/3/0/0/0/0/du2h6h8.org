  Now you might be thinking "Mind control doesn't exist!" but that's because you're thinking of supernatural powers. There are plenty of mundane ways to mind control people. Hit someone and you just made them feel pain in their minds. Torture to trigger anger. Set up fake escape attempts to raise their hopes then crush them to hit them with despair. Lie to them about the state of the world, fake messages from their friends and families as if they have been cruelly abandoned. Most people's ethics are malleable enough to crumble after sufficient duress.

Yeah see this seems like it would have no chance of success given the evidence on the effectiveness of torture and brainwashing. Brainwashing /just doesn't work/, if it did then there would be good evidence and it would probably have been used extensively in areas from criminal rehabilitation to the obvious military/political uses. Also if I'm kidnapped I'm obviously not going to believe any of the information they tell me.\\
Not to mention if I'm kidnapped you need to remember people don't just do/believe anything I say, so if I'm obviously being coerced then they're not going to take that as a real indication of my values. Plus given the surveillance in my compound there's no way they would be able to kidnap me without it being obvious I was kidnapped.

Furthermore how exactly are any of the tiny number of psychopaths with no ethical system whatsoever supposed to coordinate an attack with any hope of kidnapping me given I have a level of security greater than world leaders? Another thing to note is that psychopaths can be identified based on brain scans, so even if a psychopath knew enough about psychology to manage to clear all psych examinations as well as the background checks (an incredibly dubious proposition). They would still fail the brain scan. Not to mention a psychopath smart and successful enough to get a meeting with me and pass the security checks still doesn't have any clear way to kidnap me, and if they were smart enough to get in in the first place they're unlikely to be crazy/dumb enough to just want to kill me.

As for people faking my messages without trying to kidnap me, that would require coordination between many psychopaths since I would have many different advisors and people around me (all of whom would be fully vetted), and all my actual messages would be delivered via single take videos possibly even live video (plus the people in my council would probably think of many other safety measures).

More generally the scenario you're proposing is extremely implausible because it involves lone psychopaths defeating security measures substantially greater than those used to protect world leaders, that alone should have set off some alarm bells. Because sure some sort of scheme like you're describing might be /somewhat/ plausible if you were talking about government entities, however when you're talking about at most a handful of coordinated psychopaths the whole premise becomes utterly absurd.
