  Also security wouldn't need to be that amazing, because the only people who would be trying to harm me would be crazy people (since even psychopaths not bound by my ethical rules still wouldn't think trying to kill me would be worth it unless they were completely insane) so protecting against lone crazies shouldn't be that hard and neither would vetting my visitors to be confident they wouldn't try to kill me.

Erm. This may be the single most optimistic thing I have ever read on this sub. As a high-functioning psychopath, I can tell you that once you activate the DNA rewriting power, you will become the single most delicious target for pretty much every bad guy in the universe, and everyone will know who you are since you had to publicly reveal yourself as the beacon of morality.

Step 1) Kidnap pope vakusdrake.

Step 2) Mind control pope vakusdrake to twist his moral system to your liking.

Step 3) ???

Step 4) PROFITS! *MASSIVE* /WORLD-SHAKING/ PROFITS!!!

Now you might be thinking "Mind control doesn't exist!" but that's because you're thinking of supernatural powers. There are plenty of mundane ways to mind control people. Hit someone and you just made them feel pain in their minds. Torture to trigger anger. Set up fake escape attempts to raise their hopes then crush them to hit them with despair. Lie to them about the state of the world, fake messages from their friends and families as if they have been cruelly abandoned. Most people's ethics are malleable enough to crumble after sufficient duress.

But you might be thinking "I'm the embodiment of willpower! No torture shall sway me from my path!" But the villains wouldn't know that now would they? Not until they have kidnapped and tortured you fruitlessly for ages. And they are more likely to just kill you rather than release you when they finally give up on changing your mind.

And then there's the smart ones. The ones who will just fake your messages for you. The one who will blow up your benevolent organization of protectors, kidnap you, then claim to be a benevolent organization that is keeping your whereabouts secret to protect you from the evil terrorists who blew up your previous benevolent organization. They will then spread messages of "morality" that are allegedly from you, swaying the world's ideas of good and evil to suit their villainous whims.

Whatever goals they have become easy as pie to achieve. Want money? Broadcast a message from pope vakusdrake that the most goodly thing to do is to protect you, and the most goodly way to do that is to donate money to this super benevolent organization. Want a person murdered? Broadcast messages about how sinful a being they are, and praise the awesome goodly goodliness of excessive vigilante justice. Want a country or company destroyed? Broadcast messages shaming their activities, inciting riots and wars as you fill the world with "righteous" anger. Want to fulfill your omnicidal cravings? Broadcast the moral joy of honor killing, mass murdering everyone and everything in sight, ending with a graceful suicide.
