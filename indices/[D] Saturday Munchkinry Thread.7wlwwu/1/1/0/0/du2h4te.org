+The cultist could be basically good in that he believes killing someone sends them to heaven...+

Hmm, so this is kind of the middle ground then? You can't modify value functions, but everyone's value functions are already mostly good and already mostly agree?

Well first, is literally *everyone* basically good? Or are there still some bad people? If bad people still exist, you are now uniquely capable of genocide-ing them all, cleansing humanity of their evils, because your power makes you a near-perfect evil detector: if you can't convince someone of something, that means they have non-standard desires, so they are the not-basically-good people. Though you would have to off yourself afterwards you evil genocider you. And if there are false positives that would really really suck.

Luckily, there are less evil detector uses. Arguments depend on premises, and not all premises are value functions. Some premises are knowledge. For example, you could split an argument into two parts, A and B. Then, when you tell people B, only people who already knew A will be convinced. With sufficient sophism and trickery, you now become an awesome lie detector, *Huzzah!*

...except since everyone is basically good, you can just convince them that lying is bad anyway. Damn it.

Erm...erm... have I mentioned I'm terrible at thinking of morally good things to munchkin? I'm... I'm not basically good. :( Please ^{don't} ^{^{genocide}} ^{^{^{me.}}}
