You don't get to modify people's value functions except in as much as a rationalist version of themselves would do so to enforce self-consistency. I don't see this a major impediment because I take Scott Alexander's view on human nature;

#+begin_quote
  I believe human nature is basically good even though people's actions seem based on selfish and amoral motives. This is no more contradictory than the King being basically good, even though all his decrees will seem based on selfish and amoral motives. If the King has no access to accurate information, but can only make decisions based on information gleaned from biased sources, then the biases of those sources will be reflected in his words and deeds.

If this isn't your model of others, I can see your objection, but for sake of this question I would ask you to put that aside.
