It's possible.

Most people don't factcheck though. Most people don't have access to vast information or counterarguments at hand. Most people take whatever belief they carry around as if it's true and make up arguments for it if challenged. You just have to present them with enough evidence that the probability of their assigned probability in your belief beats out competing theories(of which they don't nessesarily have any of) and you're set. According to your text people don't STAY ideal rationalists after accepting your proposition.
