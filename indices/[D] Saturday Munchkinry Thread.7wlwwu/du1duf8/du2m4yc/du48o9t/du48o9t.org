Hole: Imagine humanity meets an enlightened alien empire (think the Federation from Star Trek). Someone suggests that humanity should go to war with them and wipe the aliens out, on the basis that the aliens are /really ugly/. For some reason, it is possible for humanity to do so. Would such a war of annihilation be a good act?

By your definitions, this could easily pass criteria 3 and 5 (mainly because the aliens are not counted as humans and thus (criteria 3) their immense suffering is discounted next to the minor inconvenience of humans having to deal with interacting with really ugly aliens and (criteria 5) an alien race could one day very easily threaten the continued existence of the human race (sure, they're peaceful /now/, but...).)

If I could persuade myself that I would want to be killed if I were as ugly as the aliens, then the interstellar war can pass Criteria 2 as well and be considered a good thing.
