Possibly outside of the scope but I figured it would be fun to give it a swing anyway.

You gain the power to create a baseline definition of 'moral goodness' which then are woven into the DNA of all humans, such that this is where they derive their individual meaning of what constitutes a Good act. Assume that humans have a tendency to favour doing Good acts over other acts. Mutations might occur. This is a one shot offer that can't be reversed once implemented. If you don't accept the offer it is offered to another randomly determined human.

What definitions sounds good from getgo but could have horrible consequences if actually brought to life? Which definitions would you apply?
