  Yeah see this seems like it would have no chance of success given the evidence on the effectiveness of torture and brainwashing. Brainwashing just doesn't work, if it did then there would be good evidence and it would probably have been used extensively in areas from criminal rehabilitation to the obvious military/political uses. Also if I'm kidnapped I'm obviously not going to believe any of the information they tell me.

The issue isn't whether it has no chance of success, but whether people believe it has a chance of success. Thanks to years of TV conditioning, people think that torture works. So they will go ahead and torture you.

(Also, are we sure that torture doesn't work? I mean, those studies were analyzing torture's success rates in terms of whether it successfully extracted information, but that isn't the goal here. The goal here is to break you, and I would be surprised if torture can't accomplish that. Torture doesn't work for extracting information because it makes you hate your torturer more and want to shut up in order to spite them. But here they want you to be more filled with hate, so you hating them more is exactly what they were going for...)

  Not to mention if I'm kidnapped you need to remember people don't just do/believe anything I say, so if I'm obviously being coerced then they're not going to take that as a real indication of my values. Plus given the surveillance in my compound there's no way they would be able to kidnap me without it being obvious I was kidnapped.

I did present a simple way to achieve that. Kidnap you, then claim to be a benevolent organization that freed you from your kidnappers and is now hiding you to ensure you won't be kidnapped again. Evidence of your support can be faked. And even if some suspicious nerds find proof of video/audio editing, the "benevolent organization" can just say "OF COURSE we edited it! We wouldn't want you nerds finding out where pope vakusdrake really is from the background noises/lighting now would we?" And then they can turn the tables on their accusers, and accuse them of wanting to jeopardize pope vakusdrake's safety for nefarious purposes. And if your personally chosen advisors come questioning, the benevolent organization can just say that those advisors were clearly in on the first kidnapping, since they mysteriously failed to stop you from being kidnapped. With sufficient charisma, there are plenty of ways to blatantly lie to the masses and trick them into giving you support.

And again, the problem isn't really whether their evil plans will actually work, but whether they "think" it will work. Plenty of people carry out stupid plans with no hopes of success all the time, just because they think it will. And this plan looks pretty workable to me. The "benevolent" organization wouldn't be able to convince everyone that they really represent you, but they have a good chance of convincing a decent fraction.

  Furthermore how exactly are any of the tiny number of psychopaths with no ethical system whatsoever supposed to coordinate an attack with any hope of kidnapping me given I have a level of security greater than world leaders? Another thing to note is that psychopaths can be identified based on brain scans, so even if a psychopath knew enough about psychology to manage to clear all psych examinations as well as the background checks (an incredibly dubious proposition). They would still fail the brain scan. Not to mention a psychopath smart and successful enough to get a meeting with me and pass the security checks still doesn't have any clear way to kidnap me, and if they were smart enough to get in in the first place they're unlikely to be crazy/dumb enough to just want to kill me

  As for people faking my messages without trying to kidnap me, that would require coordination between many psychopaths since I would have many different advisors and people around me (all of whom would be fully vetted), and all my actual messages would be delivered via single take videos possibly even live video (plus the people in my council would probably think of many other safety measures).

  More generally the scenario you're proposing is extremely implausible because it involves lone psychopaths defeating security measures substantially greater than those used to protect world leaders, that alone should have set off some alarm bells. Because sure some sort of scheme like you're describing might be somewhat plausible if you were talking about government entities, however when you're talking about at most a handful of coordinated psychopaths the whole premise becomes utterly absurd.

Ok, my bad for using the word psychopath. That was a not-so-comedic exaggeration, I don't literally mean that only people with mental problems will target you. There are plenty of people who are evil even with perfectly healthy brains. (Or at least, indistinguishably healthy brains). Even if you exclude all the people who are accidentally evil or evil because of duress, there's still plenty of people who do evil things even though they know they are wrong. There are rapists, murderers, thieves, shoplifters, embezzlers, corrupted officials, etc. etc. everywhere. Do you honestly think none of them are really evil? Or that they are all mentally ill psychopaths? Do you think none of them are capable of coordination and intelligence? I mean, organized crime is literally a term that exists, and criminal gangs of all sorts have been around since the dawn of civilization. If evil people weren't capable of intelligence and coordination, evil would have been eradicated millenniums ago.

Because the problem is, evil people don't have to be pure evil. They can be good people in some situations and giant assholes in others. Just look at all the racists, sexists, anti-LGBT, anti-religious group X, etc. etc. out there. While with people of their own "in-group", they can be perfectly good, while they turn into demons against people in the "out-group", or "traitors". And they have no problem working together with their in-group gang up on the outsiders. Is it inconceivable that some extremist group among them would think of kidnapping you, in hopes of getting you to denounce the muggles or whatever group they hate? (Or faking a message of you doing so?)

P.S. Also many governments act *a lot* like organized crime gangs, even in today's world. So I would not be terribly surprised if a government "rescued" you from your benevolent protectors and then locked you away.
