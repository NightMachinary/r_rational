  Because the problem is, evil people don't have to be pure evil. They can be good people in some situations and giant assholes in others. Just look at all the racists, sexists, anti-LGBT, anti-religious group X, etc. etc. out there. While with people of their own "in-group", they can be perfectly good, while they turn into demons against people in the "out-group", or "traitors". And they have no problem working together with their in-group gang up on the outsiders. Is it inconceivable that some extremist group among them would think of kidnapping you, in hopes of getting you to denounce the muggles or whatever group they hate? (Or faking a message of you doing so?)

See the issue here is that I have the ability to totally rewrite people's genetic basis for morals and even the most evil individuals generally have some moral lines they won't cross. So by making the ethical system I ingrain such that deliberately violating it would seem like the worst thing imaginable, I will be able to affect anyone with any moral instincts whatsoever. So yes given the full extent of my power here I really do think only psychopaths would be a concern.\\
As for your stuff about people compartmentalizing their morals. Well given a lot of the stuff in the genetic slate is specifically about getting rid of that sort of tribalism/self deception, that wouldn't be particularly viable even if my ingrained genetic ethics weren't already so firmly ingrained as I previously described.

  I did present a simple way to achieve that. Kidnap you, then claim to be a benevolent organization that freed you from your kidnappers and is now hiding you to ensure you won't be kidnapped again. Evidence of your support can be faked. And even if some suspicious nerds find proof of video/audio editing, the "benevolent organization" can just say "OF COURSE we edited it! We wouldn't want you nerds finding out where pope vakusdrake really is from the background noises/lighting now would we?" And then they can turn the tables on their accusers, and accuse them of wanting to jeopardize pope vakusdrake's safety for nefarious purposes. And if your personally chosen advisors come questioning, the benevolent organization can just say that those advisors were clearly in on the first kidnapping, since they mysteriously failed to stop you from being kidnapped. With sufficient charisma, there are plenty of ways to blatantly lie to the masses and trick them into giving you support.

Except the security measures I mentioned would deliberately have laid out safeguards for that sort of things. So people would already have been explicitly told beforehand to watch out for those sorts of tricks (for instance being told to disregard edited videos of my commandments). As for their ability to deceive the world in such blatant ways, the rationality I previously mentioned I would include in the moral programing is also going to make people far less likely to be fooled by that.

Also I would like to again bring up my previous point that I have security better than that of any world leader, that utilizes techniques from the best and brightest security experts across the world. So it seems rather implausible that some small group is going to not only beat that but actually capture me (and killing me wouldn't do much good since most of my values would have already been set in place as the standard).

Also given my previously mentioned /heavy/ ingraining of my genetic ethics system within industrialized countries (or anywhere with any money) it would be plausible to do brain scans to look at people's neurology and how they react to the idea of my values being violated (which would ordinarily elicit a pretty strong aversion response). So by those means the tiny minority of people who have no morals whatsoever could be easily identified and kept under surveillance (and also kept from breeding). So that society can function vastly more efficiently given there being no longer any need to safeguard as much against social defectors.
