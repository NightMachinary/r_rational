  However if you need to give more detailed instructions then I would encode a desire for everyone to adopt my ethical system, this would result in me being well protected and constantly questioned to try to puzzle out my exact ethical system.

  Also while I'm at it I would stick in a clause about treating my personal well being as substantially more important than any other single persons (though not so much more important that this allocates so many resources towards myself as to cause significant suffering or anything like that). Plus I would put in something that would make people treat my opinion with a massive amount of reverence, so that I can have disproportionate influence over how the world will reshape itself in light of the changes I've made. Of course that might turn out to be somewhat unnecessary anyway since I would probably get a massive amount of reverence due to the fact I'm literally the standard for ethics.

If by well-protected, you mean imprisoned, then yes.

If by constantly questioned, you mean constantly interrogated against your will, then yes.

As the single point of all moral goodness in the world, your existence becomes too valuable for you to make your own decisions. Everything takes second priority to your continued survival, including your own free will. You will be imprisoned in a secure facility where you can't die in a random car accident. You will be prevented from meeting anyone directly so you can't contract whatever dangerous diseases they are carrying. (You can still be interrogated from a distance!) If you refuse to tell your captors all about your ethical system, horrible things will be done to you to make you talk.

Basically, this will result in the same kinds of problems as coding an AI to protect your mind.
