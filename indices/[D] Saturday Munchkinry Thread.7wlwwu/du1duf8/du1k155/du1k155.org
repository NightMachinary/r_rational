You know, I wonder if incorporating some aspect of "preserve this gene as-is" would lead to strictly "better" worlds as well? Something to off-set a mutation leading to an "immoral" phenotype beating out the original and thus progressively leading to species collapse due to too many "immoral" genes in the right place/at the right time leading to species extinction, etc.
