It's a little unnecessary. For any sensible morality system, preventing itself from changing means that it fulfills its goals better. If your morality says "prevent people from dying", then any change to your morality means that more people will die, as you are no longer working towards that goal. The exception would be if the person is not just bad at executing their morality, but actively harmful to it.
