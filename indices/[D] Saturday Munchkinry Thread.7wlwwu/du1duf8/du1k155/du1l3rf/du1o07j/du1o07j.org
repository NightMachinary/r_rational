Would that not be an assumption though? I feel like it just depends on how you define the morality system - if you don't throw in an intrinsic call to avoid change, there wouldn't be anything to do that. Especially with morality - say you have an immoral agent playing in a Prisoner's Dilemma where they know all their opponents always pick 'moral'. The immoral agent has an insane advantage, and I would expect they'd have a higher fitness (and thus natural selection favoring perpetuation of the 'immoral' mutation). Hence the need for some degree of rooting immoral out or lowering its fitness (such as sexual attraction to morality, thus favoring perpetuation of the stable moral gene).
