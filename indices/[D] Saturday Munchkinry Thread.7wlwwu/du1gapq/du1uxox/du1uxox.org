The best solution here would seem to be to convince people that people believing true things and being rational is a good thing. Then use the evidence that you were able to convince them so easily to make them understand that your abilities are supernatural and other people will likely view them as mind control.

Once you've done that then you can count on any altruistic person (hell even if they're purely self interested you can keep anyone from betraying you by giving them the argument that they would end up being better off in the long run in a world where nearly everyone was made rational) helping you towards your goal of pseudo-world domination. From there it's just a matter of turning influential people to your side and using them to get access to even more powerful people. Rinse and repeat until you have control over all world governments and most other large organized power structures.\\
Then at that point you can have world governments start distributing your arguments on a mass scale and while there may be some resistance it will be short lived given the ability to so easily turn people to your side if you can force them to listen to your arguments.

As for what to do once you've cemented control you could likely make good arguments for ethical systems like that presented [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/24/the-invisible-nation-reconciling-utilitarianism-and-contractualism/][here]] (and in the articles linked at the beginning of the article). While people may to some degree differ fundamentally in values I think that variation is a lot less than people think once you eliminate differences in actual beliefs (for instance many authoritarian beliefs would evaoprate in the absence of religion).\\
When it comes to governments I might incorporate something that captures many of the advantages of [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/352406.html?thread=3948950][Futarchy]], [[https://medium.com/@ryanberen/ophelia-against-moloch-1ca15b0ee395][for instance this person seems to have come up with a good starting point.]]
