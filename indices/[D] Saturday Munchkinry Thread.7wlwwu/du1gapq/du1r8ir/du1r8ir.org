Hmm, this needs some clarification. Arguments rely on premises, and premises may not be shared.

For example, I could convince an idealized rationalist that murder is bad, because the idealized rationalist (presumably) has a utilitarian set of desires and with that as the premise, murder would conflict with his desires and so should be avoided.

Now suppose I tried the argument on a cultist who likes ritually murdering humans to honor his imaginary god. Would he become convinced that he should stop murdering? Or would he become convinced that he should stop murdering if he has a utilitarian set of desires? In the latter, since he does not have a utilitarian set of desires, would he continue murdering anyway?

If the latter applies, then your supernatural argument powers are weak. Hopelessly weak. They only work on people whose premises sufficiently align with those of the idealized rationalist. They won't work at all on people who are fractally wrong or have stupid objectives, which is probably the majority of humanity.

If the former applies, then your supernatural argument powers are extremely OPed. You get to force everyone to behave as though they have utilitarian desires, even if they absolutely do not. You can go to prisons and rapidly rehabilitate (via mind control) every villain and criminal you meet, convincing them with the argument that they should be good people because being a good person is a utilitarian thing to do. Heck, depending on how your superpower works, you may not even need to meet them in person. Broadcast your arguments on TV and ads and all over the world. Blast them out with giant speakers. Mind control the entire world, forcing them to behave exactly like idealized rationalists even if it goes against their every desire.

Oh but watch your back for deaf people, who will be trying to murder you and end your reign of tyranny.
