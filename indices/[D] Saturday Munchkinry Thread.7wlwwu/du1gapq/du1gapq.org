You have the power of Good, Convincing Arguments, whereby anyone you converse with will be convinced by your arguments as much as a rationalist in their position would be. Though they are reliably convinced by good arguments, their intelligence is not augmented, so they may not understand why they are convinced (though they might convince themselves they do when you are gone), and they cannot themselves magic up better arguments.

Your powers are most evident when talking to the particularly deluded, like cult members or the mentally ill, but are also obvious when talking about controversial topics like religion, politics, or cryogenics.

Your powers do not give you any particular ability to be right or create good arguments, except that if you fail to convince someone of an argument you know that an idealised rationalist would be equally unconvinced. The person you are conversing with will weigh the arguments vocalised on their own merits, not compare them to other arguments not known to them, even arguments a rationalist would likely think of.

An ideal rationalist is defined as someone who has very good ability to make effective, unbiased, assessments of the quality of an argument. This does not come with additions to the raw knowledge base, except those that are directly relevant to accurate cognition in general. An ideal rationalist is only superhuman in their lack of cognitive biases; in other respects, they are constrained to human-tier intelligence.

How do you minimax this?
