Assuming people are as informed as they are now and don't have enhanced intelligence then this is a slightly weaker form of mind-control. You simply find good rational arguments and refrain from mentioning any equally good opposing arguments. Most people don't know why they think like they do so they shouldn't have any good arguments lying arund by themself.
