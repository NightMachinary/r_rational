Go into business repeating people's arguments to the audience they want to convince. Become wealthy, make connections.

If there were some argument that I believed to be reasonably correct and vital to broadcast as widely as possible, I would record a video of myself explaining it and then, I dunno, tell some engineer at Youtube why it's in their best interests to put it on trending for a couple days, or something equally devious. If it's an argument you only needed to expose one person to, like the POTUS or something, that should be a lot easier.
