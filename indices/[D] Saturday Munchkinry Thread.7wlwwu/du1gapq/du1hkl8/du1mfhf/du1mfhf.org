This is an OK start, but I have some concerns with the plan. Firstly, I don't think you've come close to minimaxing this; the limit seems to me to be closer to the range of "singular ruler of an enlightened world" than to "moderately rich". You've done nothing to protect your identity; people aren't going to shrug it off when an entire audience is unanimously convinced, so you open yourself up to a lot of danger doing it in the open. Lastly, using your powers to advertise products honestly seems rather uninteresting, and it only works if you have good reasons for your position.
