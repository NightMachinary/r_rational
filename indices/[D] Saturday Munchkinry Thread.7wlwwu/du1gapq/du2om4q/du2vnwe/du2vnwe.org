I would bet most people discard atheism, alternative political arguments, or cryogenics because of biases towards holding their group position. Even if they still played themselves religious because their value function was heavily skewed towards "outwardly agree with the local ingroup", they would believe the convincing arguments for atheism. If you convince the whole ingroup, they could even stop pretending.

Note that a value function of "believe false things" doesn't bypass these powers; it just means they're upset when you convince them of the truth.
