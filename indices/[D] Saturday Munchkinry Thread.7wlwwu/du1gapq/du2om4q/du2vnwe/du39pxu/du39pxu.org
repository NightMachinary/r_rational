Wow. That's incredibly offensive. And pretty ignorant, too.

The kicker is that you used "cryogenics" as the third controversial topic instead of "sex", to make it the traditional big three. (Cryogenics isn't controversial: only the fringe group of nutters who subscribe to the idea would think so.)
