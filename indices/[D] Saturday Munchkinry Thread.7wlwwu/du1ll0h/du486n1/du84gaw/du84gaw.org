That's a good question, and highlights an ambiguity in my phrasing. The goal of the machine is "display the user's mental image", but the methodology it uses is closer to "approximate the image the user wants displayed on-screen". Meaning that the machine would display whatever the mathematician would consider a decent approximation, likely some sort of projection or embedding.
