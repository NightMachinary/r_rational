I would like to note that I think many people are massively overestimating what such a machine could do. For instance trying to communicate using only pictures is likely to be absurdly difficult if the two parties don't share a great deal of language to begin with, and would probably be worse than trying to use google translate when it came to talking to people who spoke other languages.

It wouldn't work for lie detection either since it only picks up /images/, as for mindreading that's pretty questionable as well since people's thinking is mostly too abstract to comprehend just by seeing the mental images that went through their head.
