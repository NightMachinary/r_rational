Does the picture have to be 2D? How does the machine display the picture? On a monitor? A hologram?

If the person's mental picture changes after it is fully displayed, does the displayed image immediately change, or does it also take time to gradually render? If the changes happen sufficiently fast, you can create movies with your machine, where your imagination is the limit. You would need voice actors to dub the otherwise silent images, but many movies already work like that anyway.

How clear does the mental image have to be? For example, if I think about a fractal, and you use the machine on me to display a fractal image, do you really display the full fractal? Or just what I, with my limited brain power, can imagine the fractal looking like?

Can you hook the machine up to some kind of gaming machine, and thus create a thought-controlled video game? Even with just the rough outline, that would already be pretty cool.
