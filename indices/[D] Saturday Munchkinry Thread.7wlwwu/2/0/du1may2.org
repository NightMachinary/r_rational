Communicating with people with the various handicaps that prevent normal communication. Stephen Hawking is a prime example, as he is limited by an interface I forget the details of, but I remember being extremely slow.

Communicating with animals, especially those who can't learn human forms of communication due to either anatomy or intelligence. I'm sure just about everyone with a dog wants to know what they're thinking, and being able to communicate with dolphins would be really interesting since they obviously can't learn sign language and we haven't worked out how their "language" works.
