Good point. Maybe instead of "mental image" it'd be more like "the image the subject wants to appear on the screen"? My thought was that it'd initially be created as a tool for making art. Speaking loosely, the image would start out like those recent programs that produce very rough scans, and then make small changes to the image, monitor which changes result in an image that appeals more to the subject, and then use that information to improve the image, whether through a genetic algorithm or other means.
