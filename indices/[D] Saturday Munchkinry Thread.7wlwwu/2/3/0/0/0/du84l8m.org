More or less, yes, with some room for error. It locks onto whatever visual image is most prominent in the user's mind, and tests a few small perturbations to see which elicits the most positive response.

It's theoretically possible that this would lead to, say, a cure for cancer appearing on the screen instead of the intended image, as that would get a more positive response, but such a possibility is vanishingly improbable given the fairly unintelligent hill-climbing algorithm the machine uses and the abundance of much closer local maxima.
