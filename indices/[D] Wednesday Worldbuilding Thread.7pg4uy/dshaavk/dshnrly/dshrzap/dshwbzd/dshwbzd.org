Well, the restrictions mean you'll be much more interested in self-buffs and the like. There are also some spells that are only cast on yourself yet grant information about your environment: /commune with nature/ can locate all people within 20 miles and /lay of the land/ gives you free knowledge of the surrounding geography. Both are considered personal spells.

I'm always a fan of stacking carrying capacity and movement buffs: /ant haul/, /aspect of the stag/, /longstrider/, and maybe /bull's strength/ and /cheetah's sprint/ for short distances.

Movement tricks: /water breathing/ or the more powerful /ride the waves/ let you sneak places via waterways, and if people aren't used to magic they won't consider this possibility seriously; /earth glide/ allows slow movement through the ground; /air walk/ isn't nearly as good as flight but is still impressive in a magical dead zone. The more expensive /geniekind/ can give you a 60ft fly speed.

/Echolocation/ for getting around in caves/utter darkness.

Combat: /spit venom/ is a nice surprise for a close target; stack /aspect of the stag/, /thorn body/, /ironskin///stoneskin/, and maybe /aspect of the salamander/ for regeneration, defense bonuses, and melee attacks. /Raven's flight/ and /vermin shape/ are effective get-out-of-jail-free cards when nobody expects a shapeshifter.

Here's the kicker: /absorb toxicity/ is a personal spell that lets you transfer the absorbed diseases/poison to somebody else. Combine with /greater contagion/ cast on yourself and you can now inflict your choice of (non)magical illness on anybody you can touch, and it *can't be cured without magic*, which is not available to the victim!
