Well one obvious tactic would seem to be to attempt to protect yourself from scrying and thus allow you to safely cast spells outside the dead zone. Without referencing the books, my best guess for making that work would be exiting the dead zone inside a lead box then having a contingency/readied action immediately cast various anti-divination spells.

Once you've done that then the possibilities for exploiting 20th level spellcaster abilities are basically endless, so I won't go over those here.
