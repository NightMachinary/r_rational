I've had some...interesting revelations about Fantastic Racism against AI lately. I always found the idea of humanity creating sentient life and then not giving them the same rights as humans to be absurd, then I learned about how American companies treat employees that aren't considered Americans. Undocumented day-laborers, terrible working conditions in developing countries, and even ties to human trafficking syndicates for overseas mining and construction. Apparently slavery isn't as old fashioned as I thought.

Black Mirror's normalized abuse of uploads pushed my suspension of disbelief even further, given that the AI had once been human and all of the humans seemed to believe they were still people, until I remembered how common abuse and discrimination of women and LGBT people really is. Plenty of humans believe that other humans exist to be treated less than human and there is insufficient protection for them against people like that.

So I guess this is just my advice on where to look for inspiration when writing Fantastic Racism in sci-fi. If you don't know how to write the mindset of an abuser, go look at where the actual abusers hang out.
