Heya [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I'm pretty new here. Started with being linked to HPMOR via [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]], which led to reading Rationality: From AI to Zombies, and I've chewed through most of the weekly challenges now and a lot of the "major works."

I really like rationalist fiction because it is a powerful weapon in the ongoing memetic war; when it's done well it spreads useful information that may even immunize against bad information. I'm now inspired to try my hand at a rationalist fanfiction of One Piece, but I'm still at the planning stage. *Warning - Some One Piece spoilers from this point on.*

The first reason I want to do a rationalist fanfic of One Piece is that it already has many of the rational fiction elements described in the sidebar: the characters and their desires are usually the drivers of plot, factions (Navy, Pirates, World Government) are nuanced and defined by their values, characters solve problems through intelligence and resources (The Straw Hat crew commonly uses deception, disguise, and planning during all the episodes leading up to Luffy finally beating up the Big Bad, and many antagonists do as well), and the world has consistent rules that it sticks to (for the most part - still not clear why Shanks lost an arm to a Sea King if he's such a badass). Because of this, I think it will be easier to reshape the story to universally fit those characteristics while still keeping to the broad strokes of the original plot.

One Piece has a lot of strange aspects that are left mysterious. Devil Fruits are the first example of this - as far as I know, the series has yet to explain their origin or why touching the sea or seastone turns them off - but there are more: world geography (The world is mostly islands, but humans evolved there? No way.), some of the strange abilities the characters have even without Devil Fruits (Nami's weather sense, Zorro's very super-human strength, Usopp's intuitive ballistic accuracy), super-size animals (Sea Kings, giants), and the explicit mystery of what happened during the Lost Century.

I have ideas about how to plausibly explain all of these (though some of them are going to be like the invisibility cloak in HPMOR, basically hand-waved magic/sufficiently advanced technology), and I've chosen my explanations with the goal of pushing the story into areas of concern to the rationalist community, in particular existential threats. *My first request for responses, then, is for ideas on other themes to include to maximize the memetic impact of the story.*

Besides these explanations of fantastic elements of the world, it wouldn't be a particularly good piece of rationalist fiction without the characters using rationalist techniques and methods that the reader can emulate. HJPEV started off knowing most of the techniques that he used through the series and mostly applied them to the wizarding world as he became exposed to it. I'm envisioning a different path for Luffy, one where he learns these techniques as he journeys through the world, and combines them with the powers he's been granted from the Gum-Gum Fruit to increase his agency in the world. Current plan is to try to line up plot points in the show as best I can with the ordering of R: A to Z, as that is an example of an ordering of those ideas that conveyed them well (to me, at least). *My second request is for ideas on how to order introducing the various rationalist methods.*

Finally, I wanted to present a couple of my ideas for interesting spins on character powers from canon: in particular, Luffy and Nico Robin.

Luffy's Gum-Gum power, as demonstrated in canon, gives him the ability to stretch his body. He seems to be able to control this, though flashback episodes to his time as a kid with Ace and Sabo show that he did not immediately get the kind of control that he demonstrates even when rescuing Zorro in the first few episodes. I plan to make some of his more remarkable new uses of his powers (Gears) rely on rationalist revelations.

I plan to add a twist to the Gum-Gum power, however: it will give Luffy's /mind/ similar flexibility. This will allow me to make Luffy a satisfying rationalist protagonist while still being a total goofball most of the time: the first mental Gum Gum power he discovers is the ability to "store up" thinking ability while he has his mind in a relaxed state. When he "gets serious" as he's observed to do in canon, he's going to be tapping this resource.

Nico Robin, in canon, is substantially older than the rest of the crew (except Brooke), and tends to be the most reflective member of the crew. Her power of temporarily creating controllable copies of her own body parts is typically used to make stuff out of hands, or to grow arms on other people to put them in headlocks. These copies don't persist, so it doesn't seem like she could clone herself, but there's no apparent reason that she couldn't copy her brain repeatedly. All this extra thinking meat isn't much good if that processing power isn't properly applied, though, so that's going to have to be her character development arc. She's likely to become a mastermind figure/advisor to Luffy, since her powers are less versatile in direct confrontation. *My third request is for feedback on these ideas - do they seem like something that would make an interesting story?*
