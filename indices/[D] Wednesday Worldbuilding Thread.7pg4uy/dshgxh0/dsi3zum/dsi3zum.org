If Luffy could "store up" thinking power, why not other aspects too? Like speed, strength.. (ref Mistborn).

I think the main reason Robin doesn't make a brain-copy is because she have to directly control the things she made, controlling a few hundred extra hands or mouths is one thing, but control other brains (minds) is a whole other bag of rubish.
