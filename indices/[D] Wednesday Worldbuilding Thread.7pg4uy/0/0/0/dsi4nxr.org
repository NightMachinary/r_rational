Luffy canonically stores up big punches before his fight with Crocodile, and has vastly more strength than his quite skinny frame would suggest - and not just his rubber powered punches, but lifting huge boulders or moving ships. And the Feruchemical similarity did not escape me, it's at least partially where I stole the idea from.

Robin will copy the parts of her brain that control her power, first.
