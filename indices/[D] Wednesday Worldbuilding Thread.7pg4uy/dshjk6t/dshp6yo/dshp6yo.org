  At the moment the only one I got down is the notion of souls existing as an entity in a transhumanist-esque community in which people agree to temporarily forgoe their memories when they enter the world. Of course brains then must be transistors can, and brain injury doesn't affect personality.

Maybe talk to some religious-type folks who actually believe in the existence of souls, because otherwise this will just fall flat and feel insincere.

  I am playing with having the world actually be made of 4 elements, air, water, fire and earth, and am exploring the implications.

In order to do this, you have to face down the atomic theory. Understand that even in antiquity, proof of the existence of the atom was available; the only trouble was that they didn't have the mathematical sophistication to understand it. In order to avoid breaking (my) suspension of disbelief, you'll have to reconcile the atomic theory with the 4-element theory of matter, creating some kind of bizarro chemistry. Which means you'll also have to deal with the chemistry of the ancient world: chemicals like lye and lime are essential, and you're going to have to explain how they work.

Or, you could do like everyone else, and sidestep these problems or lampshade them if they ever come up.
