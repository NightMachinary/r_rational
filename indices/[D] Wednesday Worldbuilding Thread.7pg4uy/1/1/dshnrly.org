What is the effect of the dead zone on non-spell magical abilities like a druid's wild shape, thousand faces, and the like? Because 20th level druids are nearly unlimited shapeshifters and can even turn into things like Huge elementals.

And is the dead zone defined by a clear boundary? Is it some sort of ruin, or merely an otherwise unremarkable region where magic does not function?

Regardless, druid seems like a solid choice. Water and food are nearly free even with the reduced mana - /create water/ and /purify food and drink/ are 0-levels and /goodberry/, /hidden spring/, and /dream feast/ are 1st-levels. Some combination of the above can keep you going indefinitely regardless of surroundings.

If shapeshifting works fast travel is easily available with intelligent choice of form - air elemental, albatross, various raptors, etc.

/Expeditious construction/ and /expeditious excavation/ are nice 1st-level spells that help with making a secure fortress.

Should be fairly straightforward to make a base and stay well-supplied. After that, do whatever you want. Is the goal to escape the field/defeat your enemies?

Edit: 20th-level druid has a base of 4 slots per spell level, which is 8100 mana using your cube-sum equivalent, and 810 mana within the dead zone. A 9th-level spell is 729 mana, so everything is potentially available to you if you're conservative with your high-level casts.
