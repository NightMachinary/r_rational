Aside from the extremely limited usage of spells, all other supernatural and spell-like abilities are suppressed just like they would be in an anti-magic field. Druids would not be able to shapeshift, though they have some pretty amazing extraordinary abilities which would still work, like immunity to poison.

There is a boundary with the dead magic zone sharply transitioning into a deadened magic zone, then sharp transition from deadened to normal magic zone. On the ground, there is nothing to indicate which zone you might be in other than warning signs that people have placed near common border crossings. The region within the zone looks like a sparse grassy plain with farms, towns, rivers, streams, small hills, etc. Beyond the zone lies thick grasslands, forests, jungles, etc. The zone is about as large as France or Spain.

Remember that your spells in this area can only target yourself, everything beyond your own body lies within the antimagic field. For example, /dream feast/ would work, but /create water/ would not. You could cast /levitate/ on yourself, but not on anyone or anything else.

The goal is simply to exploit this limited spellcasting ability to the maximum in a region where people are otherwise unfamiliar with magic and unprepared for anything you might do with it. If you can imagine the action making your GM go "Oh shit", you're on the right track.
