At least for me, the complexity of 3.5 does make it a more interesting setting than 5e. Imagine taking the path used with 5e to the extreme - no more rules or mechanics whatsoever, no classes, no feats, no levels, no numbers to remember, every DC is set by GM fiat when the GM perceives more than one way that events could go, and the dice lend surprise and tension to everyone in the game. I can imagine that being fun, but it would be difficult to share the experience with others since there's little common ground between players with different GMs. It would also be somewhat difficult for a player to surprise the GM with a brilliant idea.

Now imagine going towards the opposite extreme, with a small library of nuanced rules for every action and situation. If the players have mastered the rules, it will be relatively quick and a lot of fun, and players with different GMs can share stories of their experiences with each other relatively easily because the games maintain substantial common ground. Of course, the drawback is that a larger ruleset makes it less likely that players will actually master the rules, so the game could turn into a slog of constantly looking up rules. As such, players could easily and frequently surprise the GM with brilliant ideas drawn from infrequently-used rules.

Obviously, the ideal is somewhere in the middle. A ruleset small enough that mastery of the rules is achievable for a large number of players, but broad enough to ensure a great deal of common ground, and enough space for players to surprise their GM with clever exploitation of their characters' abilities. For me, the ideal is closer to 3.5 or Pathfinder than to 5e.
