You awaken to find yourself in a D&D 3.5 or Pathfinder world. You're a 20th level spellcaster (class of your choice), but you've been exiled to a country-sized dead magic zone, in what seems like an otherwise mundane late medieval to early Renaissance society. You are certain that if you leave the zone, you will be subjected to scry-and-die tactics and constant attack. You realize that although your spellcasting ability is severely limited in this area, it's not actually gone. With a decent spellcraft check (DC = 15 + spell level Ã— 4) you can actually manage to cast a spell on yourself, but only yourself.

Treat everything beyond your own body as though it is inside of an antimagic field. Note that teleportation, scrying, and plane shifting are impossible. All magical means of communication (sending, dream, etc.) are also impossible.

The number of spells you can cast is also limited by a shortage of available 'mana'. Your normal available 'mana' is equal to the sum of the cube of every spell slot you possess (e.g. for each level 1 spell slot, add 1^{3} = 1, for each level 2 slot, add 2^{3} = 8, etc.). Each spell costs that same amount to cast. Within the dead magic zone, you can only use up to 10% of your available mana.

How do you munchkin your ability to use magic in a dead magic zone?
