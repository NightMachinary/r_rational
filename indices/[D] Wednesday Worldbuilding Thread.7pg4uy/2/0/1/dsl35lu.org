When I saw the souvenirs, I immediately began rationalizing how they couldn't actually be people despise the show's insistence that they were because I psychologically couldn't process the amount of empathy I'd have to feel for that much suffering.

I think it's equally important to condemn a lack of empathy as it is to recognize how much effort empathy takes and what leads us to prioritize other expenditures of effort. Dehumanization is absolutely unacceptable and we must fight it both within and without.
