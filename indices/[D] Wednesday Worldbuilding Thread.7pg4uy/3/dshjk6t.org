I am playing with the idea of making a world with radically different natural laws and am looking for inspiration. Is there any self-consistent setting you think I could look at?

At the moment the only one I got down is the notion of souls existing as an entity in a transhumanist-esque community in which people agree to temporarily forgoe their memories when they enter the world. Of course brains then must be transistors can, and brain injury doesn't affect personality.

I am playing with having the world actually be made of 4 elements, air, water, fire and earth, and am exploring the implications. Surely things that can burn contains fire, as the fire escapes when you ignite it but that's the only one that's super obvious. Where does the fire go afterwards though? Does it linger around in their air until plants can suck it back in to grow more?
