I suggest [[http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html][Unicorn Jelly]] for a story that is set in a world with very different natural laws that still sort of give a recognisable world at a human scale. Even if the forces that cause this are different, and the large scale structure and geometry are drastically different. For instance: there is no gravity, just a constant downwards force called Linovection. There are no planets, but triangular world plates, which don't fall due to other fundamental forces. But if you fall off you just keep falling. [[#s][And then]]

Be warned that while the story will get to dealing with the universe-spanning catastrophic threat eventually, it does start off slowly and at a much smaller scale.

And then there are the sequel/spin-offs/side-stories. [[http://pasteldefender.com/to%20save%20her%20000.html][To Save Her]] has alternate universe travel, and [[http://pasteldefender.com/chapter001.html][Pastel Defender Heliotrope]] has an entire new universe with similar but unique physics (there is a reason they are similar which is eventually revealed). And then eventually also gets to travel between different universes and near the end have a [[http://www.pasteldefender.com/226.html][multiversal map]] which is a minor spoiler Unicorn Jelly and a major spoiler for the other two stories.
