Hmm true you should be able to do that. Nice exploit.

And yeah relative to your previous speed and velocity, so relative to the moving train/spaceship.

Still would advice against throwing 200kg with 50kmh into a thing that keeps you alive (spaceship). Maybe with a custom made spaceship that could be possible. If I think about it, without/with less gravity opposing the flyer, he should be able to push the spaceship faster from the inside and than get pushed by the spaceship faster -_- not what I wanted
