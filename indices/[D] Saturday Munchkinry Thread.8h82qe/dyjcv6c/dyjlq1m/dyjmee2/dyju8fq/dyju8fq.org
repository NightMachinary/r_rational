Even with teleported competition, I think it is still a fairly high value activity because it isn't something that a tech equivalent can achieve. Many other flyer jobs can be performed adequately (or better) with a helicopter.

For fighting, a good generic attack is simply lifting an enemy into the air and dropping them, preferably using a hook or net on a tether. Dropping enemies into prepared containment where appropriate. Otherwise, could be a good sniper (depending on equipment) or serve as generic mover of more effective friendlies.
