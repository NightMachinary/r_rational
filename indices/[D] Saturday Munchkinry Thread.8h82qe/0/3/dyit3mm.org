What if I leave myself a note?

What if I give notaries A, B and C the following instructions, during which they are not to communicate beyond a single number per interaction: I give A numbers. At a predermined time, A transmits the last received number to B. When B receives a number n, he looks up the nth winning lottery number and transmits it to C. When C receives a number t, he tells me to wait t minutes.

Tell A 1. Ask Maps for the time I'd take if I drive such that I'm at the rest stop at the predetermined time. Note the answer. Repeat with 2-6. Deduce lottery numbers. I should forget this scheme in each hypothetical world that splits off after a Maps query. I may need to give C some means to incentivize me. Do the notaries also forget?
