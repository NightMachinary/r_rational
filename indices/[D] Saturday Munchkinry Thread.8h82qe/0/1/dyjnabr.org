Construct a private travel route lined with traffic lights (which you precommit to obey). Have the traffic light controller cause the i-th light to stay red for 2^{i} minutes (or whatever the min resolution is) to encode some data as a binary sequence. For example, have the traffic light controller encode the current value of the NASDAQ index. Now your map app can give you that value at different times in the future. Your ignorant self need only drive the route and obey traffic lights.
