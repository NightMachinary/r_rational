Assuming that the alternate reality it looks into is the same every time, then all you've got is a gps tracking what you would've done if you hadn't noticed Maps' precognitive capabilities. I don't see "Oh, I would've gone to the dentist a day earlier" as particularly useful.

On the other hand, if it simply searches for a "nearby" alternate reality where you don't know about Maps' precognition (and does so anew each time), then you may be able to exploit this. For example, by locking your garage so it opens at a time that depends on the the winning lottery numbers (to be released tomorrow). If the "nearby" AU that Maps looks into is one where, eg. you suddenly and randomly forgot about Maps' precognition, then the original you would get accurate information about the winning lottery numbers by checking Maps. (Assuming that amnesia-you didn't break the window to get out or rammed through the door or something). Rinse and repeat until all desired numbers obtained.

Alternately, hire a guy to sit in aforementioned garage, give him your phone, and get accurate results (until he catches on, but you only need to win the lottery once, then you can hire lots of interns to do this exactly once each). Of course, this only works if the phone searches for an AU where the person /using/ it doesn't know about its precognition, not if it searches for an AU where /nobody/ knows about its precognition.

Once you are rich, use this to get the detailed long-term information on anything you care to know, up to and including more efficient ways to exploit Maps.
