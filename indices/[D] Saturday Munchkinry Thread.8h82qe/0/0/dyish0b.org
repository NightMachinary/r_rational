I work in road safety so my question is, what does it show if you die en route? Assuming it says "never", I'd use it as a way to protect myself from the thing that is the [[https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-death/deaths-in-australia/contents/leading-causes-of-death][third most likely to kill me at my age]] (assuming I'm not pregnant, because apparently the #1 cause of death for pregnant people is /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_pregnant_women][murder]]/!?), by which I mean, obsessively use it for every single trip and cancel the trip if it shows me being dead.

(For people not wanting to click the link, leading cause of death for people age 25-44 is suicide, followed by accidental poisoning and then traffic collisions; heart and liver disease make up #s 4 and 5--if you're aged between 15-24 traffic accidents is your #2 cause of death)

I'm sure someone else has something much more munchkiny, but that was the first thing that came to my mind.
