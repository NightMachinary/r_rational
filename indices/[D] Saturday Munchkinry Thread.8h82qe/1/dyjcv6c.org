Your Power is flight (Think Superman, or the Martian Manhunter or Wonder Woman or any Lantern). You can fly lets say 50kmh. You can lift lets say 200kg additional stuff. Everything more will force you down. More weight means faster down. You have limited invulnerability towards damage from falling or flying into stuff.

Your flightpower doesn't make you produce an opposite force. You can lift a closed container, while you are inside. You can fly on other planets and in space (but is hard to tell there, you still can change your speed only up to 50kmh.) And you can leave the planet with your own flight. (and an oxygen tank)

So how would you use that power? And how would you use it to fight?

Btw you live in a universe, with somewhat similar physical laws. (No faster than light Superman or Flash, no spontanious mass change) But there are other people with powers. If you saw it in a Comic it probably exists there in a weaker form. (Like near invulnerability, laser eyes/hands, regeneration that needs energy and mass, ) And normal humans are a little bit more resilent
