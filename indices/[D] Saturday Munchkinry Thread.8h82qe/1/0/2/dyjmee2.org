Nice, just not sure if that is really the best thing for the flyer in this setting.

Not sure if a teleporter wouldn't be more useful/cost efficient for NASA. (ISS is 400km high, so 8hrs flight time.)

And I thought more of a fight between 2 superpowered people. (Or maybe a group)

btw with more weight, you would be acceleration would be worse (still 50km/h limit to change of previous speed/velocity, cause screw physics).
