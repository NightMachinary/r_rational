Well low earth orbit(LEO) starts at 160km so 3h flight (+3hrs back.) It all clearly depends on Tech level and other powers available.

Sniper is always a good choice. (If guns is an option, and here yeah.) No matter if you have speed, strength, magic or no abilities. But I think flyer has a bad power for that, since snipers want to be behind cover and unseen. I guess he could land, shoot, fly away (50kmh is not bad) and repeat that. But if there are no guns, than sniper with bow and arrow is a real good option. (Fly just high enough to be out of range and shoot/drop arrow down.)

The hook/net with a tether is a good idea. Nobody should expect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog][people to act rational or in there own selfinterest]]. But a tether would keep most supers from retaliating. Also consider flying them/dropping them on high voltage lines. (they probably wouldn't get fried without being grounded, but they would have problems to leave) Maybe a automatic release for stuff over a weight limited would be smart. (So the flyer wouldn't get stucked. Also a way to have a cape, without being sucked into an engine.)

With generic mover you meant flying around other people so they can hit where it hurts?

I think 150kg of a pointy material at 50kmh would be quite painful. (and maybe more, if the flyer is okay with ramming the target) Mainly used horizontally, since flying up would make the flyer a target for any ranged enemies. All depending on acceleration.

I'm not sure about the helicopter being better. But any jobs I can think of (maintenance and VIP transport) would probably not pay more than one day flying a satellite into LEO. (Except if they can send bigger satellites higher for less money.)
