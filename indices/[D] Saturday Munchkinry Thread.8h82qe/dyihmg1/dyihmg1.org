You've just discovered that, through some unknown process, your Maps app always knows /exactly/ how long it will take you to reach your destination; if you get a flat tire on the way, that delay will have been factored in ahead of time.

However, there's a catch. Since discovering this, its accuracy has decreased slightly. It seems that it looks into an alternate reality where you don't know about its supernatural accuracy as a defense against the simplest "park at a rest stop so your arrival time spells out the lottery numbers" attacks.

Is there a way to exploit this system even with the aforementioned limitation?
