I think you're confusing "glaringly discordant" with "not explained within the available tiny snippet," but that edges on being defensive of the text which is not a good look for a writer (so I'll leave it at that).

Essentially, this amounted to me writing a teaser trailer for myself, to see if I even wanted to play in this sandbox, and I was happy enough that I shared it. I agree that it's not complete in the sense of being a fully realized and internally coherent rational work; hence the "ish."
