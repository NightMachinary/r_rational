I interpreted it as Peter giving him something during the chase to continue the 'game' so Rob would last until the clifftop for a satisfying conclusion rather than in the woods. The boys got random magic before without explanation. Also Rob isn't giving up Detect Magic; it went away after dropping the rock but he's still blind.

Or it's not magic he was seeing but rather blood and another one of his friends had been chased into the mermaid pool before Rob.
