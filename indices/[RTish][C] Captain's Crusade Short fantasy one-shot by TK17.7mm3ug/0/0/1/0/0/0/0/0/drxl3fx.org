Yes, it's literally all a dream. I'm talking about the "explanation" of plot holes or the Deus Ex Machina where things get so tangled that it requires some divine being to fix it or the revelation that it was all a dream and not "real".

If it was literally the Boy's "dream", then why would he set in motion a plan to distract himself when he could just do that thing instead?
