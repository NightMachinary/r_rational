From the point of view of someone trapped in it, there's no way to know, short of observing glitches, being told by someone else, or through completely unbelievable genius levels of deduction that magically hit upon the right track.

It's rational because it attempts to explain why the Captain even bothers to fight against the Boy, why he would be interested in catching the kids instead of just killing them all, where more adult pirates come from if only kids can get to the Land, and why he /wouldn't/ want to just go out and "finish it".

IE: Fixing glaring plot holes from the original work.

That being said, it has a few of its own.

1) He loses his eye, but gains a permanent kind of /Detect Magic/ vision. How and why?

2) His /Detect Magic/ eye sees a path that leads him to the boulder and stops. He interprets this as doing something with it, which he does. What "path" is the eye seeing, aside from the "Plot"? How does this work? Why does it *stop* working? (He sees no more path after that.)

3) Why does he need to get his eye back? The Shaman says he needs both of them, but there is no reason, on his part or the Captain's. If anything, he would prefer to stay how he is, as he can /Detect Magic/, allowing him to see the Boys even at night or behind cover (I imagine it's good for spotting fairies, too, which would be quite a useful ability). He is literally trading away a very useful ability in order to become a cripple, with no good reason other than "This all-knowing character says so."
