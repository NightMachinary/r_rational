Were there references to fairy dust at that point?

It still doesn't explain the "Plot Path". Some intelligence (in the real world that's the writer) has created this path to cause a certain event to happen. But where does this knowledge come from?

That part is still glaringly discordant with the rest of the story. I suppose if the story were to continue it could be retconned that a fairy had given him that path, and then that could lead up to a reveal that a certain fairy (likely T) was trying to continue the game by playing the kids off each other... but doing that removes his agency as something "new".

*EDIT*: Also, what's up with the gator and the loss of body part granting him another one and 'free stuff'? Is that the Shaman's power? Is it the gator, and if so, is it somehow sapient in and of itself?
