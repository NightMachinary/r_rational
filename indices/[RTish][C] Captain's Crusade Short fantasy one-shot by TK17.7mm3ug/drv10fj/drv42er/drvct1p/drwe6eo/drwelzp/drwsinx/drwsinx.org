Sure, but if I'm doing that, then all plot holes are merely "not explained within the available snippet" of the medium.

The path was created by something with intelligence. We don't find out and he doesn't question it. In normal stories, that's fine. In rational ones, the character should at least express the curiosity as to "why" weird stuff happens.

That's why it's glaring, to me. YMMV.

That being said, it was still a /REALLY/ good story, and one I enjoyed immensely. I've seen all sorts of media where they try to portray the Captain as having been a good guy, but this take is unique and far more believable.
