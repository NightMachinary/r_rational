how sapient are pokemon in this story? i noticed in the last chapter red's squirtle rolled its eyes in annoyance. that seems more like a mammalian response than an amphibious one, tbh. i would expect an annoyed amphibious turtle to blink its eyes and just stare at its trainer incomprehensibly. not to roll its eyes. that seems like a very mammalian and possibly very human sort of body language. are pokemon in this story just powerful animals? or do they all have a level of intelligence and self awareness similar to humans?
