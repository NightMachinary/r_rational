Pokemon in this story are sapient creatures, of intelligence /roughly/ comparable to that of a human child - the age of said child depending on the species, but seven or eight would be about the baseline. Maybe five for Weedle/Caterpie-type 'mons.

Edit: Except Magikarp. Nobody knows whether Magikarp is sapient, since it automatically crit-fails everything it ever attempts.
