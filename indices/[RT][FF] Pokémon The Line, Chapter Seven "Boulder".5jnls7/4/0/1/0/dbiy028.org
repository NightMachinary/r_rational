Pokémon and other stuff -- braised Tepig, Rowlet dumplings, Grilled Magikarp, Bounsweet Cab (maybe these can be milked though, or bled?) and smoked Farfetch'd were mentioned in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/5/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line][Chapter 5]] (the former two being starters in other regions, like Squirtle is for Kanto), and I imagine it's socially acceptable to eat many others. I wonder if there are Pokémon CAFOs or if they're all hunted? Not too far off our world, then -- compare to people who eat [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_intelligence][dogs]] or [[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10angier.html][pigs]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_intelligence][cephalopods]], which can probably build up a command repository as large as that of most Pokémon (and often score similarly to young human children along various metrics purporting to measure intelligence, accurately or not).
