Really digging this! Like Red, I also got stuck with the convoluted plan, which means I need more practice in thinking beyond what the narrator tells me. Enjoyed the conversation with Brock and the set up for the next arc. I'm looking forward to see what we learn from being on the road withba capable Leader. :)
