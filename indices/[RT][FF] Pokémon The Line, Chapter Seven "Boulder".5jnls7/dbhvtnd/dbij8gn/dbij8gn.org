Hope you enjoy it! I've been reading through The Origin of Species lately, about halfway through at this point and really, /really/ enjoying it.

Fun fact: at the beginning of this chapter, when I was banging my head against the wall, trying to figure out why on earth Rock-types were vulnerable to water, I started skipping ahead through Origin and Ctrl-F'ing "rock" to see if you had already developed a reason.

You're doing the Lord's work, mate. Thank you!
