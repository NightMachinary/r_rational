And with that, Arc I is complete!

The last few weeks have been a hell of a learning experience, and while I'm overall pleased with how the story thus far has come along, there's been a lot of lessons on what to do better going forward.

I'm planning to write up a bit of a postmortem of Arc I in the next few days, analysing what I liked and where things went wrong. The next chapter won't be going up for a month, as the last few weeks have taught me that I cannot maintain this pace indefinitely while juggling my other obligations. I'm going to take this time to get properly ahead of the update schedule, and hopefully provide more space for the kind of editing that would have caught some of the larger issues (particularly in 'Reclamation').

I also need to catch up on my correspondence.

Thanks to everyone who's provided feedback and advice so far. I look forward to posting more in the new year!
