The conclusion is a bit odd. In a world where people are still asking themselves what comes after death, it's quite impossible for the Ouija board to work - hence the entire experiment simply does not work. Of course, the quite likely result is then the death of Control - from realizing her sister sacrificed herself on a lunacy, general depression, etc.
