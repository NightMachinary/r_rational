Kinda why I slipped it in, it's a great channel where the videos just casually discuss the disassembly of a solar system, and how to almost live forever. For a few trillions years at least.

I recommend the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef-mxjYkllw&list=PLIIOUpOge0LvT-g_LNsfX_2ld0pn-CDSZ&index=36][Megastructures]] series! Great one to start off on.
