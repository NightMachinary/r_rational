Cons: definitely HFY and not rational. Issues with scale. The tech disparity doesn't really make sense even given 2000 years, after all most species follow Prothean and eezo tech because it's generally the superior option. Pros: Not as bad as it could have been. I rather liked the invasion of the Bartarians as there was actual thought put into the defense by a competent commander. He took the tech asymmetry seriously and leveraged what advantages they had, such as using FTL for hit and run tactics and using the alpha relay to send reinforcements to an unexpected location and considering how politics affects the goals and tactics used. The depiction of cyberspace isn't quite as cringe inducing as is typical.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't really worth reading.
