I'd argue that the tech disparity is justified because of the numerical advantage. The other races had discovered AI and uploads, and were at that point likely far ahead of humanity. However, their banned AI and decided against uploading, which limited their population growth. On the other hand, humanity was warned about the reapers, which pushed them ahead - which probably contributed to their willingness to embrace the upload.
