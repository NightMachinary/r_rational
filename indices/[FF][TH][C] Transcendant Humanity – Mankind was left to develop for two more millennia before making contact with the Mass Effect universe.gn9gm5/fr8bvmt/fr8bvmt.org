I'm posting this since it appears that after some few years of laying fallow that the story has been picked up by its author and completed. They published eight chapters in February and March and ended on a note that feels "this is done"-y.

As the OP description tells you, /Transcendant Humanity/ is a transhumanist story taking place in the /Mass Effect/ setting, but effectively adjusting the timeline to the year 4xxx, adding about two thousand years of technological development for mankind. Something like the Prothean Beacon was found, but it was basically just a warning:

"We came. We Watched. We studied you in your infancy, and hoped to see you grow into kin.

"But THEY came. THEY destroyed us. THEY wiped our race from the stars, until only those of us here remained.

"THEY can trace our technology, so we are leaving. THEY will not find you. You will be safe.

"Trust not the Gates, nor the Keep.

"Grow Strong, Little Ones. Save yourselves, and avenge us."

Thus humankind develops technology like mind uploading and materials far in advance of anything the Council races can field, and it grows, while remaining limited to Sol, until the inevitable first contact comes after unearthing the Charon Relay.

One can easily classify this story as a [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]], due to the large technological disparity between the Transcendant Humanity and the Citadel Council, but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that humankind didn't have access to any eezo until they found the Charon relay, and even then they developed their own, eezo-independent technology rather than blindly jump into mass effect technology. While one of humanity's advantages is its technology, the Council is partly interested---and fearful---for Sol's industrial capability, housing about 100 billion corporeal humans, and close to a trillion uploaded humans. That humankind is in the process of building a Dyson shell, which was the reason Charon and Pluto were being dismantled in the first place, doesn't help either.

I suspect this story is probably known to many subscribers of this subreddit (and I might have found it here, even), due to its transhumanist streak, and while one may argue that characters might not be up there on the competence scale, I feel that they mostly remained believable and thoughtful in their decision making.

Given that some seven years after it started it is now complete (at least I assume so), I figured you'd like to know about this.
