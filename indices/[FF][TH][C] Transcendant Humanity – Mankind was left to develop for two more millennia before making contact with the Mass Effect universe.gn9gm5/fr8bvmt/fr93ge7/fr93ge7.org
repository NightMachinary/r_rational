So I've been following this one before the long Hiatus.

It's a good story, but it's always been more of a [[/r/HFY]] story than a pure [[/r/rational]] one.

Overall I would give it a recommendation as a good read, it's got some well executed rarely used scifi tropes, and it plays with a lot more of them. It's a good story for a basic execution of the ideas.

It is not the best story when it comes to characterization, the point of view jumping around and eventually floating out to a view of treating nearly all of Humanity as a nebulous character towards the end.

I do have to commend the author for coming back and at least writing a finish after the long Hiatus, that's difficult to do even if the style does change as a result.

I would argue though that the ending is rational, even if it seems somewhat fantastical. The Matrioska brain, methods of conciousness divergence, networking, and ship methods are familiar to people who follow [[/r/IsaacArthur]] and the long-term transhumanism explored in his video expose's. This story is nice for looking at those ideas from a fictional perspective, but again it's a light touch on the ideas. Some stories like House of Suns and anything Banks has written hit specific ideas more directly.

This isn't a perfect story, but I'd still give it a recommendation.
