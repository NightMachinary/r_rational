Don't be silly. You don't read rational fanfic to sympathise with the characters, you read it to stroke your beard while the main character says a lot of things about science and society that you already agreed with

But being serious, the basic premise sounds good enough that I'll at least try this, and I'll see if I just tag out later on

EDIT: Yeah, this is just HFY wank.
