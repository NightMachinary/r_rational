Does anyone know where they can buy tickets to the Secular Solstice?

This is the very first year since they started that I can be in NYC during December to join the celebration and I want to buy tickets for it.

But the [[https://secularsolstice.com/][website]] I found says it ended for 2017 and I can't find any tickets to buy for the 2018 celebration. Anyone have any more info on this?
