I think of it as rational-adjacent. The same goes for Harry Potter and the Natural 20. It's something that most of the same people like, but the lessons you'd learn from it are very much not applicable in real life.

I suppose what it comes down to is that they have consistent internal logic that the main characters rationally respond to, but said logic is so far from real life that it would better serve as examples of what not to do.
