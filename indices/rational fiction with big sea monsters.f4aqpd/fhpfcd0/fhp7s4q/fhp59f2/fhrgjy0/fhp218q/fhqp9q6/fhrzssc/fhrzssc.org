The Face of the Waters is a pretty fucking excellent sci-fi book set on an alien planet by Robert Silverberg that's (almost) entirely ocean. It stars a group of humans stuck there because the natives won't allow them to build a space port, scratching out a barebones living extracting necessary elements like metal and iodine arduously out of sea water and kelp.

It's not so explicitly designed to be rational, but it features great world building, and the sea monsters are fucking spectacular, and although they're fairly mystical, they all make a good deal of sense.

I will point out that the philosophical end left me pretty fucked for a bit, but I consider that a plus.
