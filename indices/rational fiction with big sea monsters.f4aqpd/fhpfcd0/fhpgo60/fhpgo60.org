There are some Worm fanfics which feature at least somewhat rational sea monsters:

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/queen-of-monsters-worm-x-godzilla-crossover.28934/reader/][Queen of Monsters]] -- a giant sea-going turtle from the Godzilla universe which makes the Endbringers look tiny. Died early. ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/consolidated-snippets-thread-worm-and-other-things.670087/page-5#post-53479087][All Hail the Queen]] is another, more complete, Worm x Godzilla crossover, but the monster isn't exactly a sea monster.)
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/water-worm.38093/threadmarks][Water Worm]] -- Taylor's mind takes over Leviathan's body. Amusing at first, but eventually runs out of steam.
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylor-varga-worm-luna-varga.32119/threadmarks][Taylor Varga]] -- a few of Taylor's forms are those of sea monsters. An acquired taste. Also, longer than /Worm/.
