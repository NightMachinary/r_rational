I don't know if I'd classify China Mieville's works as rational in the strict sense, but I've read Perdido Street Station and The Scar, and they both feature interesting, thought-out characters inhabiting an intricate, carefully constructed world. The characters have definite motivations and pursue them reasonably well. Important characters sometimes get plot armor (but sometimes don't...) and the focus is often more on showcasing cool monsters and places than worrying about their feasibility, but the plot never relies on someone holding the idiot ball and even the most villainous characters have perfectly understandable, albeit immoral, goals. I'd say the stories are rational-adjacent, essentially.

In your case, you'll want to check out The Scar, a story replete with sea monsters, some of which are enormous. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep this sufficiently vague, but the sea monsters play more interesting roles than just, e.g., as a final boss or background prop. They're involved in the plot.

Minor heads up: The Scar occurs in the same world and chronologically after Perdido Street Station but can definitely be read independently (the two plots are remotely connected in ways you'll appreciate if you've read both but are in no way essential to understand).
