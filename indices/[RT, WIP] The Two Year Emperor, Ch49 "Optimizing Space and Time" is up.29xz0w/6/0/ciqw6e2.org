Hm. Not a bad thought, actually. Thanks. :)

One thing I hadn't realized: Polymorph Other is *wildly* broken. Permanent duration? Any creature, not 'any willing living creature'?

Turns out that Polymorph Other is a 3.0 spell (2YE generally runs on 3.5 rules); I didn't know that until after the chapter was online, so I thought about it and then said "meh, whatever." You could do all the same things using Polymorph Any Object so I figured it wasn't critical. Still, PAO is 8th level and PO is 4th.
