Left a review (I know, wow, right?) wherein I speculate on balanced binary trees and possible logistics issues.

I still can't help but wonder... what's the velocity of a commoner railgun, really? If you transport someone five kilometers, they arrive six seconds later. If you transport someone five hundred thousand kilometers, they still arrive six seconds later. A light year, and it's still just six seconds.

So where are they, during the course of the turn? In transit? They must have some experience of being transported. Either time is stretched out for them, so they experience the turn of every person who is transporting them every leg of the way even though they themselves only formally get one "turn" (booooring) and each person transporting them only experiences that one turn in between (so time is local, not global), or... they teleport. What's the experience of traveling by commoner railgun?

What happened to E=MC^{2} ?! Why is time twisting like a pretzel?

EVERYTHING JUST BREAKS DOWN. /SOB/

D&D is seriously so broken...

Edit: Also, correction for my review - it shouldn't be called a tertiary tree. I think the proper term is ternary /or/ trinary.
