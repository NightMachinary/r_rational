Eh, I like the gods thing. It makes me think that there must have been some /previous/ two-year-emperor that put the fear of gods into them.

I did some more searching around, and it turns out there /are/ rules for money weight. According to [[http://dungeons.wikia.com/wiki/Gold_Piece][this wiki]] the offcial rules are that 50gp weighs one pound, in second edition and up (first edition it was 10gp to the pound.) So I guess whether goldshot works in TYE would depend on whether they honor that rule, or go with the more common unwritten weightless-money house rule.
