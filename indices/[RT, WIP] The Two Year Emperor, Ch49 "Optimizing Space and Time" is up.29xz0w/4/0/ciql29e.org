Ooh. I like the idea of cannonballs made out of gold. I'll have to use that -- I'll credit you when I do, though.

The locate city bomb is actually the reason that I added the "no such thing as metamagic" rule to the world: doing so eliminates so many abuses. It's not like casters aren't overpowered enough, you don't really need to give them new and highly abusable mechanics on top of that.

Metamagic is a good example of a problem I've struggled with throughout the story: when Pun-Pun and other game breakers are a thing, how do you make it so that the characters can be smart and exploit the rules, but can't use these game breakers? You can't just say "well, they didn't think of it" -- these people are literally superhumanly smart, and Jake has read plenty of internet posts about exploits.

I have a solution that I've been using: when you exploit too badly, the gods smack you for fear that you will ascend. This is literally Deus Ex Machina, and readers may or may not like it, but it makes perfect sense given the overarching plot arc. (Which involves things that haven't been revealed yet.)
