Yep, ternary tree.

Let's see...once GrÇ«fhamr is organized as a balanced ternary tree of 50,000 nodes, 1/3 of all nodes are in each subtree. Given that you start at an arbitrary node and need to travel to another arbitrary node, 2/3 of the time you will need to travel to another root-child subtree, which means the root is a huge bottleneck (the city is also far less defensible the way it is now, but that's a separate issue).

There are only a few nodes that are of particular interest, however: the exit (root node), the bathrooms (distributed fairly evenly throughout the tree; each cluster has one), the waste disposal vats, the water creation plants, the store (of which there will soon be more than one since redundancy is good), the food engines (much less important now that the store(s) are there), the war room, and the homes of any friends.

The friends are the real problem. Before, people would have mostly been friends with their neighbors, so very little travel would have been required. With all the nodes being moved around so much, people are now thoroughly scrambled and friendship groups are no longer near each other, requiring far more travel. In practice, most people will simply lose touch with the old friends and make new ones. How often are you willing to walk ten miles to chat with your old neighbors?
