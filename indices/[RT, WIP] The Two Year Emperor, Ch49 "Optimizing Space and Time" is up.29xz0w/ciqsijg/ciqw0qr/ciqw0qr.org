Yep, still updating every Saturday. (And, <shameless>if you felt like dropping a few reviews for chapters you particularly liked, it would be much appreciated.</shameless>)

Yes, if they found a vampire who used to be non-evil, they could destroy it, resurrect the original person, and that person would be back to their original alignment. Of course, the trick to making tiger soup is in catching the tiger....

Yes, the HoOA trick would work on a lich. The chances that you could get a lich to hold still for it are minimal, though. The method they used on Colburn would be very unlikely to work on, say, Hammond or Afi. Colborn is an arrogant jackass who assumes that he can muscle through any problem. Afi is an enormously powerful caster who has been around for tens (rumors say hundreds) of thousands of years. He's got backup plans for the backups of his backups of his backups, and he's not going to be caught by such a straightforward trick.
