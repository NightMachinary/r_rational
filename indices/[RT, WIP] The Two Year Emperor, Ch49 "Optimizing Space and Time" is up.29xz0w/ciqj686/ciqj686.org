All this bending of space gave me a thought...

We're in the D&D world where adventurers impossibly carry around tens of thousands of gold coins in their little belt pouches, and the gold weighs nothing, right?

But are there any rules anywhere for the weight of -raw- gold, like gold ore or something? Or even if not, the world would probably accept non-money gold as being a physical object that must be hauled around, no?

'Cause if there is, you could rig up a wallet with a fire trap or something hot enough to melt the gold inside the pouch. Think that'd count as changing the gold from an abstract unit, to a solid mass of suddenly very heavy molten gold?

You could make some -really- awesome cannon shot with that, or make orbital strikes even more deadly. Hell, maybe you could even make it so that the sudden appearance of so much mass in so little space collapsed into a black hole! (There'd be no risk of it devouring the world, since it'd evaporate almost instantly, but it'd give you one hell of a boom and completely annihilate whatever the goldsphere was plopped on, for much less magic than a sphere of annihilation, probably.)

Also, I kinda wonder how well GrÇ«fhamr would react with a [[http://ihititwithmyaxe.tumblr.com/post/22331104288/breaking-d-d-3-5-the-locate-city-nuke][locate city bomb]]... The explosion could be centered on the entrance hole, no? And if you had a second guy there to close the passage up on the same round as the mage casts (readied action?) then the townspeople would be safe from the blast... I think
