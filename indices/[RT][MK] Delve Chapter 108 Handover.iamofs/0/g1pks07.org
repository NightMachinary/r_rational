Well, that wrapped up a bit faster than I thought it would. Now we're suddenly out of crisis mode and back to "what should I do in this world" mode.

I think the only major unresolved thing is the empire army. I don't think we're at risk of the barrier going down and them invading, so they must be off doing something else now.

Well that and the relationship stuff with Ameliah. I guess that's an unresolved thing too.
