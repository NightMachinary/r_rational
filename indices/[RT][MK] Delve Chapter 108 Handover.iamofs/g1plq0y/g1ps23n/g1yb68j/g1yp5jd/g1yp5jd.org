Yeah but the watch treats the guild with a general distrust as a rule. Not sure how much they want to make Rain stronger as he's already rank 3 as a danger rate. If he anyone deserves it it's him, but there's always a concern that the watch will shortchange him in the name if greater good and ou boy really doesn't have any leverage anymore.
