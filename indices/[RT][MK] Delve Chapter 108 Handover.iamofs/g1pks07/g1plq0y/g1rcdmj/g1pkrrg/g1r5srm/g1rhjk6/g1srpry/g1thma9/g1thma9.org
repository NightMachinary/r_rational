I'm not someone who particularly cares about builds in litRPGs because for me these are supposed to be stories. And if the story the author is trying to tell requires the MC to be at level 5 for 40 chapters that's fine as long as the plot around that is interesting. One of the problems I see in Delve when it comes to Rain's personal growth is that we have been constantly introduced to characters that were /way/ beyond Rain and are putting him in uncomfortable situations because of it. Rain's response to said situations has usually been "I'm gonna get stronger so that this doesn't happen again" but he hasn't really. Whether that's due to the way that the plot is structured or Rain's personal procrastination is irrelevant it still sucks to constantly read about how everyone even remotely important treats him and his friends as stones on the side of the road.
