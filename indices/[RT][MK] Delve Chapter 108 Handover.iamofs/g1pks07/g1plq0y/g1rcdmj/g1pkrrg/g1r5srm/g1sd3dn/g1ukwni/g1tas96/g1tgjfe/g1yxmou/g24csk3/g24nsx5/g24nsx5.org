Janus is the old mage dude, forgot his name.

I have a couple of issues with litRPGs that focus on and fret about that story's system mechanics.

Like, we as readers cannot interact with the system in any way so we can't personally verify anything that we're told. Can you tell me the specifics oh what points in strength means to a person? What does having a 5 in STR mean? A ten? Twenty? Fifty? What about something specific like 327? Do points in STR equate to muscle mass? Probably not but then what? The amount of pounds you can carry comfortably? The amount of pounds a person can put into an attack? Their grip strength? All of those? None?

And even if you know the specific details of the system the author can literally change what the numbers mean later on because they needed to. Where before a person with 20 in STR couldn't lift that huge stone for whatever reason later on another character with a 20 could because the story needed them to. Not to mention that maybe the calculations are wrong and the author would have to go back and redo them to make them make sense. Leaving the people who tried to keep track feeling kinda foolish.

Whereas I can play Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's Gate and see what the numbers mean when I interact with them and what they mean in story. It's why I liked the books that are written in official campaign books of TTRPGs. Whether that's in Eberron(D&D), Golarion(Pathfinder), Shadowrun, or the Ninth World(Numenera).

The characters stats are implied but never stated. But you know they have stats. Meaning that sometimes that strong character can struggle to bear that load that a weaker character holds easily, or a show character can move just fast enough to stop that arrow. But at the same time that strong character can and usually does throw people around like they're children and that slow character can never be on time for most scenes.

TDG does this well because while the characters are given /very/ specific abilities, that's not all they can do. So even if James gets "Crossbow +1" it doesn't mean he can't shoot a flying paper mask out of the sky with a pistol, and when he is get the Accuracy ability that massively increase his ability to hit things it doesn't mean he can't miss .
