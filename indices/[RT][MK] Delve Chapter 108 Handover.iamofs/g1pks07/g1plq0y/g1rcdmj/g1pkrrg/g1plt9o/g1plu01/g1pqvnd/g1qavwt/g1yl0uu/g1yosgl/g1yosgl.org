Eh, I was referring more to her actions in chapter 62, where she almost suffocated him to death, let him fall onto the ground head first, threw Jamus into a wall, threw Carten /through/ the wall and out into the streets where he could have crushed some innocent bystander, and basically forced Hargrave to ban her from the guild before she could escalate further.

And Hargrave isn't here to protect them anymore.
