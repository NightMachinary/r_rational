  “Does the teleporter work?” Tallheart asked, staring in the direction of the Stumper.

  “Yes, as of around two hours ago. Bartum gave me a drawing of a guardian by the name of Dunwich. That was enough for me to let him through the barrier, and then I gave him control of it. It's better that way.”

It's not 100% clear but I think "it" here refers to the barrier rather than the teleporter. Rain never had control of the teleporter anyway.
