He definitely should get something out of it. The too Watch dog, the Warden herself, said that Fel Sadanis is a really important city, and if it falls into Empire hands, the war is lost.

There's no way they wouldn't offer a level 25 blue for control of the city and the actual barrier device, which only Rain could find, should Rain offer those terms. Plus, Rain is pretty much the most dependable, capable, and trustworthy Guildie there, so there shouldn't be any possible negative consequences of handing him a blue. The rank shift in Fel Sadanis should more than make up for that blue too, as there should be more and higher leveled blues there afterward.

Delve is quite the rational story and Rain is always a min-maxing person, he'd be a fool to miss out on such an overwhelmingly helpful benefit. Even Velika got a high level blue once she got the city, with the Warden physically there, hell, there should be no issue with Rain actually getting a level 50+ blue with all the help he provided.

If he doesn't get a blue, there better be some really good reason, because he's been stuck at the level cap with virtually no major improvements for half the entire novel, and without a free blue it looks like it's going to take a lot longer before he finally passes level 25 and becomes op.
