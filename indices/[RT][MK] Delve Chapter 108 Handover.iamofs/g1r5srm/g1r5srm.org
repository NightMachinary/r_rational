God I hope - something - happens besides character dialogue/ monologue soon.

The system is such a neat idea and well written concept that I want to see explored more, but the main character has been level capped and made no progress for so long. Like half the book at this point.

And the character writing is absolute bottom tier cringe. Every character has the exact same voice. Every character is the same snarky, edgy teenager, with dialogue barely indistinguishable from any other character.
