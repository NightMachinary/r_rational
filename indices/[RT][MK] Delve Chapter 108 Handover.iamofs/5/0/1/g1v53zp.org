Huh. I get the complaints about characters, (even though I find them adequate), but I think the worldbuilding is quite interesting. I like how the system shapes the society and vice versa.

Also, the scripting is satisfying my thirst for progress for now. Rain is gaining powers outside the scope of even the highest level natives. And sychronization is progress as well. Complicated multidimensional progress is a feature. (Kittens game beats swarm simulator.) All that being said, while I am no longer salty about the recent lack of levels, it would be nice to have some soon.
