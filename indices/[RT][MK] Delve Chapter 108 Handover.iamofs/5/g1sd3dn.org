This is the the chapter where I think the story drops in quality.

Spoilers for future Patreon chapters and the current chapters of The Daily Grind.

From Rain's plan to start a guild, to how the end of this arc is handled, to how Lavarro and the Platinum Plate are handled to how Velika and the Citizens are handled. It just feels like a bunch of storylines were cut short and skipped while Rain's overarching plan was put on the fast track despite how ill-prepared he is and the story suffers because of it. His plan isn't even necessarily a bad one but he knows so little of the world that attempting to create a group with the intentions to upset the general current order is incredibly rash. And you would think one of his friends would tell him that especially when you consider all the things that they've gone through that are directly related to the state of the world. And it feels even worse when you consider that there is currently another story going through what is roughly the same arc, at least when it comes to the starting a group with the intentions of changing the world, The Daily Grind.

In TDG James has started a guild(or an Order as he calls it) , but the reasons for it are equal part desire and necessity. A huge group of people were just rescued after being abducted from Officium Mundi and the results of said abduction and rescue means that there are now literal dozens of people whose life were screwed with by what can be considered a minor eldritch horror and were erased from the minds of everyone they knew and now have to be reintroduced to society while at the same time these people were exposed to true magic in a world where it was thought to not exist. Many don't want to just give up on that. This means that the people who want to go back to their lives need financial and emotional support while the people who wants to keep diving into the extraordinary need physical and emotional support. Support that as far as he is concerned only he and his group of friends can provide. There's more but whatever, you get it. The reason he hasn't explored more of these places is because despite spending nearly a year searching he hasn't found one yet even with their abilities so the world literally couldn't be explored.

Not to mention the other issues I have with SeneschalSoul's style. None of this is some kind of PSA demanding that people stop reading Delve and read TDG, I just think it's unfortunate.
