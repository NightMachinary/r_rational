That's fair I guess. Comparatively TDG starts slower than Delve in terms of general plot but I think it's character development is way stronger despite having to spread that development among 3 main characters and 3-4 side characters. I cared more about James' boss than I did most of the side characters that were encountered around the same length of time in Delve, and more than the old mage dude in Rain's party. It also means we got to see more of Officium Mundi and it's effects on the world through James and co then we do in Rain with the dungeons and blues.
