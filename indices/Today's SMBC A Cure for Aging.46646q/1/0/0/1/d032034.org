Agreed. I'm actually not really sure why this was posted/upvoted, as there doesn't appear to be anything rational about it. My suspicion is that this post's popularity is because of the comic's end-of-death premise (which this community and the larger rational/LW communities have latched onto) and because images and quick humor are easily digested by readers.
