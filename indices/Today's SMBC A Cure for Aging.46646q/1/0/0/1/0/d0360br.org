I definitely posted this more because of the speculation on a topic that the community finds interesting than a feeling that it was rational. However, I don't think the steps he chooses are arbitrary and non-sensical. Out of the infinite possibilities a premise like this spawns, the author picks the ones he thinks have the most potential to be funny and absurd. I definitely think that there are some points that even I hadn't given thought to during discussions on immortality: the biggest one being that infinity does weird things to human value systems.
