It's a standard motif of SMBC to take an initial idea and then follow it from absurd next step to absurd next step (e.g. just clicking on random comics, I came upon [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2584]] ). They're not really supposed to be plausible.

That having been said, this particular comic I felt a bit less funny than others of the same motif.
