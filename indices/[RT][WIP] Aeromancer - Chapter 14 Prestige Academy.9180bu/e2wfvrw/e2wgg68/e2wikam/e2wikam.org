Thank you kindly; I've read further and I do like that I can come into the story 14 chapters in and not be completely lost, your writing is carefully descriptive and it seems you work to maintain the balance between level of detail and story momentum.

Found a false negative, right before Seti goes into the opening ceremony with his new threads"... a memorable moment at Prestige Academy would forever be tainted by the fact that he *wasn't* dressed shabbily"

I've been told before that it's better to have active (imperative) rather than passive (subjunctive) writing so I cut it down and took out the past tense and would (I really don't like could/should/would/subjunctive. If I have something to say, I need to say it, otherwise I'm going to annoy people by beating around the bush)

"Lovely... a memorable event at Prestige Academy, forever tainted by his unshapely dress."

Couldn't think of a good word to juxtapose his dress with prestige itself, obviously you probably won't want to use my sentence because *that's not fun/autonomous* but I hope it inspires you to continue improving your craft. Developing a passion is a worthwhile endeavor and while progress is oftentimes hard to measure from day to day I'm certain if you compare your first chapter with your most recent you will notice at least partial refinements to your prose.

Thanks again for writing!
