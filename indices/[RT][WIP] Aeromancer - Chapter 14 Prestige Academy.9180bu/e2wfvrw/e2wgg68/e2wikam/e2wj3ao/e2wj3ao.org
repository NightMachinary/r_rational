This was well thought out, thank you!

The moment you said that you don't like using could/should/would, my first thought was, "Dang, how in the world can someone write without those words?" But then you showed me an example!

It's something I'll try to keep in the back of my head while I write, but I should mention that improvements for me may move slower than others because English was my worst subject in school, and I wasn't born in the United States!

As a reward, have a bunny: ()() ( '.') (..)(..)

EDIT: The bunny isn't decapitated if you're on mobile.
