As Yoda once said, "How embarassing, how embarassing"

As for the META talk, it was the /outcry/ that quiets down when the anti-meta shows up. I watch a lot of Starcraft and Basketball, so I have a some idea of when rule changes happens, balancing, and so on. But with zero rules actually established for the sport, I won't go any deeper here.
