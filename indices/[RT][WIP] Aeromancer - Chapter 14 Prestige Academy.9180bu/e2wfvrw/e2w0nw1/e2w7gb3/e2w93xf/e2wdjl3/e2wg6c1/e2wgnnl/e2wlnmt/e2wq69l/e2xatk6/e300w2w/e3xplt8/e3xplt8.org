Hi, just read all available chapters in RR. Some gripes from otherwise very good work.

Seti challenging people into challenging him sounds like decision at the heat of moment. If you spend some time rationalizing his decision before he said what he said would make it more rationalist. But that's minor, as in trying to fit your work into this subreddit. It's more pressing that this scene hold much similarity to Shokugeki no Soma (because Soma left the deepest impression on me). I think few deliberations is warranted to make it feel a bit different. I read at other reply stating that that's possibly his niche doing backlash. If that's your intention, it would be great. But I checked chapter 12 to see if 'the suspiciously a backlash' has a tell similar to 'the definitely a backlash.' I see none.

I've seen you used the term butler quite freely. I always thought butler is not dissimilar to the head of staff, attend to strictly the master/mistress of the house. Using the term chauffeur or footman would be nicer, but servant would be appropriate catch all if you prefer them stay low profile.

Your molding so similar to shaping exercise of Mother of Learning (or similar stuff from other works). Not a problem. But explanation around them is lacking. While I, who adore MoL, instinctively know what you're trying to do with it, I imagine others would not. So, expansion on concept?

Reading your works left me with the feeling, "Hey, I've read this kind of stuff before." several times. I was reminded with Harry Potter and Worm, among other. I suspect it's because you played your tropes straight. I guess you could do with some play-around. But in moderation. As your execution is excellent as it is.
