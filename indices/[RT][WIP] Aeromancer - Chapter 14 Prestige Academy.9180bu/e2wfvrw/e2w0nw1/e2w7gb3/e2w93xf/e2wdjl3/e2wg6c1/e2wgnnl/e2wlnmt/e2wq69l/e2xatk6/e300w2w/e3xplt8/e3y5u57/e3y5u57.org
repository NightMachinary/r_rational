I'll try to answer as much as I can,

  If you spend some time rationalizing his decision before he said what he said would make it more rationalist.

This is an issue with web serials, as this is addressed directly in the next chapter. But before that, I'm attempting to make a rational fiction, not a rational/ist/. A lot of people have their thoughts on what the MC did, but a few others correctly guessed that this was a result of his niche backlashing on him. One portion of a rational fiction is that the rules are consistent, so things that happened can be guessed by readers who keep things in mind.

  I always thought butler is not dissimilar to the head of staff

Right you are, I'll have to address and edit those portions later.

  Moldings...But explanation around them is lacking.
#+end_quote

This will be addressed directly once the aeromancy classes start in Prestige.

#+begin_quote
  Tropes...I guess you could do with some play-around.
#+end_quote

This would be like reading a fantasy story with elves and dwarves and telling the author to mix it up with more unique and less cliche races. What I'm writing is a story that I myself would like to read so I include tropes I enjoy. Tropes in itself isn't a bad thing, though some may be more annoyed than others with certain ones simply because they've seen it so often.

Thanks for reading what I have so far!
