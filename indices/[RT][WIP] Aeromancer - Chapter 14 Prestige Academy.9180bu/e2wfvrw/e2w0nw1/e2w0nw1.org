And this chapter officially brings me over the 100k words count! Considering that I've never written stuff before, and I get bored easily, I can only thank the support and upvotes that made me think, "Hey, someone likes this!"

That helps me keep writing.

Anywho, here are some links for stuff:

Top Web Fiction is still pending for my story, so no voting allowed for that yet.

My [[https://www.patreon.com/Gelifyal][Patreon]] is there for anyone wanting to donate.

I've also recently added the story to [[https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19004/aeromancer][RoyalRoad]] for those who prefer that over FictionPress. Please note that it's currently one chapter behind, but will catch up next week. And if you'll transition to RRL, please rate and review!
