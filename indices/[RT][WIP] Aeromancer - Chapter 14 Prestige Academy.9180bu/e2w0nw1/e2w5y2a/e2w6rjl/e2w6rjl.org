I know the details behind every major incident in the story, who lives and dies, the big plot twists, and how the story ends. I have an idea of in-between stuff, but those are subject to change as the story progresses.

For example, I have a checklist of things I want to see happening in Prestige, but am willing to cut some of those out if I think it hinders the story more than helps.
