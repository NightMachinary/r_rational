I think it is because Tyronn (Tyrone) is a traditionally black name in the U.S and he is a inarticulate sports star. His race was never discussed. Tyrone is also a traditional Irish name and from the way he spoke I assumed that he was whatever Irish derivative existed in this world. Beyond that I do not think that Tyronn is a stupid or one dimensional character either. He might be arrogant and have a black and white view of the world but Seti failed to manipulate his emotions meaning he has more willpower or self control than other people at the exams.

I think the assumptions [[/u/sampatrick15][u/sampatrick15]] makes about Tyronn in this series, as well as his friends, is pretty damn racist. He should really take a second to sit down and consider editing his comment.

His name is [[/u/sampatrick15][u/sampatrick15]] so he could be taking about the stereotypes against Irish people. In all seriousness it is probably just a coincidence with the names. I seriously doubt the author had any prejudiced intent by naming a antagonist Tyronn.
