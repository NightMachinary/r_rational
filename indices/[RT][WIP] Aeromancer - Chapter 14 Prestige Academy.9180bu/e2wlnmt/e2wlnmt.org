I liked the chapter more than the last one! it was a good chapter, thanks!

I have two questions/points of feedback. First is that you mention the META and anti-meta in the sports game. You say that a Most Effective Tactic Available team becomes so prevalent that fans want rule changes, but that those rule changes do not happen due to anti META teams. This means that the sport is not that old, or widespread. meta and standard types of play become stagnant with older games, and do not rapidly change in sports that don't change the rule-set. This is because sport games are mostly symmetrical. Video games, whilst the game itself is asymmetrical, the players are not. So even if the META changes, players can always adapt.

The sport you are describing is different. You have an asymmetrical game, because you have a variety of mancers on each team, and not just that, niches and tiers also make a massive difference. I don't think you could ever get a true "meta" in the sense of team composition. Top players can't change mancy type on a dime, and top teams would not just swich out every star player they have simply because some other team did well with a new composition. You play your strengths, and try to come up with counters with your team and players. I don't know how many players a team has in reserve and how switching players work, because that can shake up the game massively as well. This variety could make a single team dominate for a while, but I doubt that a single composition could dominate the sport for a while.

The second question is the pins. The crafter got a large C on the pin for crafter, and Seti got a large E for Exceptions. How does this work? We have the following types of mancers:

- Aeromancer
- Electromancer
- Pyromancer
- Hydromancer
- Geomancer
- Crafter (did they have a mancer title?)
- Vivamancer

This works, All the mancers have their own letter, but why does Exceptions get the E? I'd put that letter firmly in the Electromancer group, because they were there first.

It might be a minor change, but I'd give the Exceptions the X, it is not used for the mancers, and also serves as a discrimination mark, because they simply get an X, something associated with wrong answers.
