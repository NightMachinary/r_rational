Don't know about this specific movie, afaik it has a lot to do with the safety of the actors. And no you can watch some hema fights if you want, they tend to be much cooler than what you see on tv. They are faster though, so you can't use it for padding with a 5 minute filler.

Real life fight with weapons are 1-3 parries and it's over, 30 seconds to a minute ordeals not 5-10 minute talk and dance around for no reason tv fights.

Besides the responsibility of making a scene good or interesting to watch is with the directors. Michael Bay has his way of making movies exciting, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the only way or the best way.
