I'm a HEMA nerd and when my hema nerd friends say the combat is good I believe them. It's supposed to be historically accurate, as far as that goes for a choreographed sword fight on tv, and that's /really/ rare.

I seriously do not understand where most fight choreographers come from, or what qualifications they need but over 95% are tremendously bad. In a few years things will improve as people become more informed on this area but for now we should appreciate when they do a good job, which is rarely the case.
