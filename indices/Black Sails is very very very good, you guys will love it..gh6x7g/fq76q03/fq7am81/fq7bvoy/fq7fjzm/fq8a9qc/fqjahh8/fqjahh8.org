The usual "Flynning" swordfight is intended to look cool and exciting to an audience that doesn't know anything about real combat rather than be in any way realistic. (There was a film version of The Count of Monte Cristo that tried to have more realistic swordfights; they didn't look quite as cool as the fake ones, or so I heard.)
