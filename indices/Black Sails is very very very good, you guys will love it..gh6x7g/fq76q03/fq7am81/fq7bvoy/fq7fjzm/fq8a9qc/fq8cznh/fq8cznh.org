Historical European Martial Arts. They are people that study and practice 'lost' weapon based martial arts, based on surviving manuscripts and illustrations from their specific periods. Basically armed combat and history nerds that practice or are interested in how historical combat actually looked and worked.

Basically europeans had a very extensive martial culture going back thousands of years, but most of it was weapon based so it was lost when they went out of use, unlike the asian ones which were mostly unarmed and survived because of it and other factors like a higher cultural focus on tradition.

It's basically martial arts applied and optimized for warfare, with none of the fluff, traditional strictness, and made up nonsense like qi that's commonly seen on eastern martial arts. Like an earlier version of MMA but with weapons.

If you like fantasy combat and rationality it's a subject you're going to love learning about. It's particularly useful for writers and other creative people that are interested or already working on something on that genre.
