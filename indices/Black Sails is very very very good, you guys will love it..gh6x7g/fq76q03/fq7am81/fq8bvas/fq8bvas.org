The comparison to Game of Thrones is very apt. I've seen season 1 - 3 (because I can't find the last one online).

The characters are very three dimensional and their relationships incredibly interesting. Very often characters are met with difficult choices and you're actually invested in what side they choose. Decisions have consequences. Characters lose and grow.

Absolutely minor spoilers (season 1) /I especially love Flint's and Silver's relationship. Very few shows manage to pit two mastermind type characters versus each other, while making both of them actually seem smart and also LIKEABLE (aka non-pretentious). The way their relationship develops is so very well done and my favourite part of the show./

if you liked Game of Thrones and Black Sails, I also 100% have to recommend The Expanse. GRRM worked with the authors before and is also a fan of the series.

It's a little less character- and more plot-focused but very similar in narrative structure to GoT, with scenes jumping back and forth between different plots.

I personally had to warm up to some characters first but from season 1 onwards I was sold. All the plotstrings just start falling into place.
