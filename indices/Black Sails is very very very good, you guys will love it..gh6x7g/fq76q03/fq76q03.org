Some more info for anyone interested:

Black Sails is a prequel series for Robert Louis Stevenson's /Treasure Island/. It follows Captain Flint and John Silver through the events that lead to the treasure being buried on the titular island in the first place.

The production quality is very high, and some of the battle scenes are extremely explicit (there's one in particular I'm thinking of). The plot is mostly driven by different characters trying to achieve their personal goals by whatever means available to them. There's relatively little use of the Idiot Ball, from what I remember of the first two seasons.

It's definitely not rationalist but it's borderline-rational. Chancy plots tend to work out more than they should. Diplomacy and scheming sometimes work out very well, and at other times fall apart completely. I'd definitely recommend it as worth a watch if you like pirate stories. It's free on Prime Video. (Edit: This is in the UK; I'm not sure about other regions.)

Content warning for multiple graphic depictions of sexual assault, and other general unpleasantness involving torture and death.
