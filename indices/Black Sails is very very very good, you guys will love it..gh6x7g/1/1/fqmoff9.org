  I remember watching 1 episode and then forgetting about it, as I often do.

The weakest part of the series is its start. I watched like 3 episodes and left it for a while. But was convinced to go back and finish it and now it stands as one of my favourite series of all time.

I'd say it doesn't really get into its stride until episode 5 but from there on it is just amazing.
