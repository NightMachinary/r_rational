Thank you.

I've seen the Zombies use weapons in the show before, so it's not that hard to pass out axes and have them chop trees. I've seen them drag bodies in the show before, so it's not hard to command them to drag the trees. Attacking the ends to make spears and such seems relatively not-difficult, the weapons made for Giants can be crude so long as they are functional. I suppose the 'intelligent' crafting will have to be left to the White Walkers... *or*... I can 'convince' captured warm bodies to do it for me. I'd need a way to grow more troops over time in case things go bad anyway, shouldn't be too hard to find some quislings who value their life over their honor or somesuch. After the fight is over, they can be put on the equivalent of a 'reservation' to produce goods (and, over time, more potential troops/craftsmen). I'm an Undead monstrosity, after all, so I don't really value them as people.

I will be riding my Chariot. No reason I can't spend brain energy commanding it when its the lynchpin of my plan and will be doing most of the work--and, you know, I will be on top of it using it for cover and visibility.
