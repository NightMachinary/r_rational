It all depends on how many zombies the night king has. Or more importantly, how many you think he has. There just really isn't a good strategy for dealing with potentially infinite numbers of zombies. Or even just a few hundred thousand.

The only really viable one is neutralizing the opposing dragon and hiding behind walls while your dragons burn as many as possible. If you ever get into a situation where your soldiers are fighting zombies hand to hand, you've lost. It's just simply not possible for a single soldier to kill zombies in the 1000-1 ratio that would be required short of having something like the Wall.

It might be possible to mine the entire field. If you could wait till a huge chunk of zombies are all on the field in front of the castle and set the entire thing on fire at once, you might be able to kill enough of them to make a difference.

There's also the problem that I don't think all those troops and horses will fit in the castle at once. I think they were forced to marshall in the field since otherwise they would have just been packed like cattle in the courtyard and been unable to fight if the walls were breached.
