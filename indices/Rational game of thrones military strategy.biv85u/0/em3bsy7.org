My perspective is that the entire battle was a mistake on the part of the Night King. The defenders have extremely limited resources and essentially non-existent supply potential. It seems like setting up a siege in which the Undead characteristics of the Zombies could be most effectively leveraged against the living need for resources and lack of internal discipline would be the most efficient way to dispose of the inhabitants of Winterfell. This approach also has an advantage in that it cannot be countered by the ridiculous intelligence asset that is Bran. Knowing that the Night King has sent out his forces to kill every living thing within close march of Winterfell in order to make it impossible for the defenders to resupply doesn't provide any solution to the lack of food and the inevitable disintegration of unity that will occur once everyone starts starving to death.

There is also the fact that the Night King should not have been anywhere near the battlefield. His control radius is undefined but logic dictates that it must be absolutely massive if it is not totally unlimited. If the Night King had simply waited out the battle in a defended location far from any concentration of enemy forces than this would have been an easy victory. Arya is incredibly skilled but her infiltration ability revolves around her ability to take on the form of the people that she killed. There really isn't any way for her to get in a position where she can kill the Night King as long as he avoids the chaos of battle and takes the reasonable precaution of having a guard of White Walkers.
