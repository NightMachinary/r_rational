There is no avoiding the fact that Arya's ability to kill the Night King was just an example of "PLOT! SHOCKING TWIST", exacerbated by their decision to show none of her approach to preserve surprise. Even though the Night King was foolish for positioning himself in such vulnerability, or even caring at all about Bran (who was shown to be more or less useless), he only died because of plot powers, so its fair to mention it.
