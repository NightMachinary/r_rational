I love defensive strategy, and I'll take a crack at this one. Going to make some assumptions in mine, steal some ideas and insert some of my own. Note that the below are /assumptions/, not assertions. Changes to them will change the scenario dramatically.

1. *Defenders can't run*. Maybe they can't outrun the horde or maybe they aren't willing to abandon the North; either way, the scenario is defending Winterfell, not the surrounding countryside.
2. *Attackers can't siege*. Maybe the dragons and Bran's omniscience are too much of a threat for a protracted war. Maybe Bran gets more powerful over time. Either way, the Night King wants to win this fight /now./
3. *Animals have limits*. Zombie animals are somehow more difficult to control or create than zombie humans, to the point where it's not worth it to animate rats etc. If this is not true, then I think the humans just lose, period (but see Bonus below, for speculation).
4. *Obsidian has limits.* It takes more than a sliver of dragonglass to outright deanimate a zombie. Not /much/ more; any kind of moderate to severe wound, but not a mere scratch. This matches more closely what we see in the show. Zombie giants and dragons take proportionally more killing. (Although this /would/ explain where all the undead giants and mammoths went...they got pecked by ravens with little obsidan beak covers! Or nicked by an obsidian arrow!).\\

I use these assumptions because they make the battle more of a true siege fight and less of a contest in exploiting loopholes. They needn't be true, but they do balance things nicely. Now to the fun stuff.

*/Preparations/*

*Obsidian:* I have a limited amount of obsidian, so I will minimize the amount that gets used as projectiles until I've armed all my troops with it. In a fight like this, arrows get one shot, spears get lots of stabbing. In rough order of priority: my walls get a ring of obsidian spikes in downward-facing strips at the top; any undead deanimated by them will fall to the ground below. Infantry get spears and /pikes/, as long and durable as we can make them. Cavalry get obsidian-tipped spears and, if possible, their mounts get obsidian horseshoes. They also get knives to stab undead who grab their horses. Some heavy infantry like the Unsullied also get short swords, making them a cross between a phalanx and a legion. Wooden shields get small obsidian spikes in strategic places, as does armor if possible. Some shields also get a row of obsidian on the bottom, for bashing down on crawling, not-quite-incapacitated undead. Some may also get obsidian shards at the front or bottom of their boots for similar purposes. Obsidian crampons, yay! After all this is handled, any extra shards get made into arrowheads. If I can manage a few ballista bolts, so much the better for giant-sniping or dragon-shooting, though I don't think I have ballistas or the knowledge of how to make them. I'm tempted to implant obsidian flakes in my troops, but medieval medical knowledge renders this unlikely to work out well for me.

*Traps and Defenses:* Unless the all-seeing magic dude tells me it's a bad idea for magic reasons, I abandon the Godswood and wall it off from the castle. It's too isolated to properly defend, and the trees give cover for undead attacks unless I'm willing to set them on fire. I dig /several/ fire trenches, with the first one being just close enough to the wall that any ramp-made-of-corpses will fall in the trench before it gets all the way up my wall. Anything flammable and expendable, including furniture, gets commandeered for use as flaming barricade or catapult ammo. Catapults go on the walls or towers, obviously, and never stop firing. With as many undead as the enemy have, I'm actually worried about getting buried in corpses; anything that helps me with that gets top priority after protecting the walls. Mostly it just involves /lots and lots of fire./ Anything flammable enough to be made into a fire arrow becomes one.

*Troop Dispositions:* Cavalry harass and pick off small groups outside the walls. Light infantry with long spears guard the walls. Heavy infantry defend chokepoints where they can phalanx up and hide behind large shields and a wall of obsidian spearpoints. /There are no non-combatants./ (I'm looking at you, crypt-hiders). Any human being who can physically hold a stick tipped with obsidian and poke things with it will do so, because if they don't they will die anyway. Most get at least one spear and at least one dagger. Anyone so old, young, or sick that they cannot move around well enough to fight can hide in a central part of the castle, and even some of /them/ get a knife. A small guard of regular troops can keep an eye on them in case isolated undead get through. This guard is composed mostly of people I can't afford to lose if we /win/ the fight.

I exhume and burn all corpses in the crypt, because I'm not an idiot.

*/Fighting/*

First, a few days out, I harass the dead. Bran helps identify key targets for dragonfire; we do our best to steer clear of wights throwing spears, but we use our dragons to firebomb them whenever possible. We stage a preliminary defense at the aptly-named Last River, the only major river between the Wall and Winterfell.

TaltosDreamer pointed out a lovely use for my cavalry. Guided by Bran and accompanied by my dragons, the Dothraki and any other horsemen or mobile troops I can spare will head to the river. They clear some of the snow away and pack it into makeshift walls, we set up some siege equipment. A few trebuchets and a skeleton (heh) defense, supported by cavalry. When the dead try to cross the frozen river, I dragon them to melt the ice. The Dothraki make passes along the south side of the river, killing any who emerge from the water until the undead manage to cross in large numbers. Maybe the wights re-freeze the river with Magic Ice Powers. If any get within bowshot, though, cavalry archers will send a few volleys of obsidian-tipped arrows at them. When things get too dangerous, we dragonfire the few makeshift catapults and retreat (I have the good ones at Winterfell).

Once at Winterfell: Gates remain closed and as blocked as physically possible once I know the attack is imminent. Cavalry avoid the main siege except to come in as reinforcements; I do not expect them to do well in a protracted fight. Dragons attack /large/ groups, thinning the undead numbers, but most importantly they fly /together/, never losing sight of each other. Fireballs should be visible even in a blizzard. If the frost wyrm shows up, they attack it together, maybe with obsidian claw-tips. Their riders have obsidian-tipped spears to throw.

I put troops on the walls first, inside the castle second. Irregulars guard chokepoints within the castle and runners tell them when and where to retreat, if necessary. I have few archers, because regular arrows do next to nothing against the undead and obsidian ones are hard to come by. But I still have /bows/, and anyone who can use one will be ready to pick one up and shoot at any giants or white walkers that come within range. Fire arrows target giants first, blobs of undead second, corpse-piles third. I light fire-trenches when the assaults on the walls get too thick and I need to slow down undead reinforcements. Hopefully the deanimated burn as well as the animated, and I can burn away much of the piled bodies that will otherwise threaten to bury the defenders. Even if they're not as flammable, dragonfire will do nicely to prevent corpse-ramping, that stuff burns anything.

If the undead take the walls, they probably win, but just in case I'll have a few reserves in the castle proper, ready to use chokepoints to hold off as many undead as possible.

*Bonus*: suppose assumption #3 is false. If the Night King can animate microscopic things as well, just blow some undead parasites into the castle. Dragonglass that, bitches. If he can only animate animals, then I suppose a hundred billion tunneling zombie bugs will do. Who needs a dragon? Either way, humans are doomed. Even with fire and dragons, they just don't have a defense against massive swarms attacking from everywhere. There might not be a ton of bugs in the cold North, but there's enough; and birds and rats cause similar problems, as RynnisOne pointed out.
