A few points:

- don't fucking charge them. They're zombies, they won't get demoralised. Use the Dothraki /the day before/ for scouting and hit and run tactics if possible. Have them run like hell if the zombie dragon shows up.

- KEEP THOSE TREBUCHETS INSIDE THE WALLS. SERIOUSLY.

- more defences! They're zombies, they're stupid. Put trenches, fences, anything you can conceive of between them and your walls. Make them trudge through a lot of unfavourable terrain while you rain fire on them from the top of your walls.

- in general, really... just don't fight an open field battle. Why would you do that? Or if you do, don't put your forces in front of the walls, keep them on the side so you can then squeeze the dead /between/ your infantry and the walls and butcher them.

- Bran is the best scout of the history of ever. Use him in combination with the Dothraki, strike at /any/ weak point, any isolated group of undead.

- the dragons were used pretty alright, just large sweeps to incinerate undead is pretty much what I can think they'd do best. Well, you could also load them with saddlebags full of obsidian shards and do some carpet-bombing I guess.

- burning oil and such on the walls. The defences were abysmal.
