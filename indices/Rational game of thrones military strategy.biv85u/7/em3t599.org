The real question was why defend at all? When the entire plan relies on the night king breaking through your defenses, seems kind of pointless. Assuming Bran knows that the night king will want to kill him personally, wheel him outside and set up a trap with Aria. Maybe even have Aria pretending to be Bran, and when he gets close stab him.
