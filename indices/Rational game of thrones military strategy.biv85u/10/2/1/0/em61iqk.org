Ah, yeah, saw them now in OP's post. Honestly I think 2 is a stretch, Melisandre is the only one that routinely performs magic, the other is more of a spellsword I'd say. But neither is especially consistent or useful, they won't be fireballing undead any time soon. Honestly I'd just not count them for anything useful at all. Mostly, they provide fancy pyrotechnics. They also have the genuinely useful ability to resurrect the dead, but it only works when their God decides to do so for its own mysterious purposes. So, basically, when plot demands.
