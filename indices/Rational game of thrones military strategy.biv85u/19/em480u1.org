I didn't watch game of thrones.

I /assume/ you don't mean literally infinite shock troops. You should actually only get as many zombies as there are corpses, and we can generously assume you've been stockpiling corpses for a few decades, maybe even a century.

I'm also assuming the white walkers can psychically micromanage the zombies to do semi-complex tasks. If they can't do that they're totally doomed, humans stomp, gg. If you insist on ending humanity you should maybe consider the long game and pretend to ally with the humans for a while because right now, this ain't happening unless you totally wipe out the knowledge about the obsidian thing.

My strategy as the zombies fighting the canonical humans would be to 0) guard or destroy obsidian mining locations at all costs 1) farm animals for their corpses to increase the number of zombies, focusing on /small/ animals, not giant fire breathing dragons that can be one hit KO'd by an obsidian needle 2) hide the 12 white walkers in well defended locations where humanity will hopefully never find them 3) continue the snow storm to make agriculture impossible 4) destroy any wild edible plants and animals that survive the climate change 5) kill any humans that are spotted outside of their shelters and strongholds 6) try to bomb any shelters and strongholds from underground.

The ocean food sources should be destroyed as much as possible. Ideally we would do this using Zombie Fish but we can't swim, so that's out. Maybe it can be made cold during just the wrong times, or fertilizer or poisons can be poured in.

My strategy as the humans fighting the canonical zombies would be to 1) make sure you have humans stationed on nice island surrounded by water, with a nice volcano which will stay hot during a snowstorm where you can mine /proper/ amounts of obsidian. If you don't have more obsidian than you know what to do with, you should probably get on a boat as fast as possible because you are toast. 2) Everybody needs to have obsidian-tipped everything. Crush the obsidian into a fine powder and scatter it everywhere. The zombies shouldn't even be able to walk on the ground. 3) the warg needs to find out where the white walkers and knight king is 4) manufacture explosives and have the warg posses a bird and drop them on the locations of the white walkers and knight king, send assassins, etc 5) make sure to give that ridiculous zombie dragon an obsidian tipped mosquito bite /just in case/ they manage to figure out a use for it.
