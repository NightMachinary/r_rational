  I mean, why? Flamethrowers are 1st century tech.

That would be wyldfire. It exists in the GoT world, but it's rare and dangerous and only some alchemists in King's Landing have prepared meaningful amounts of it. Right now, it's completely out of reach for the resources and knowledge of Winterfell, so for all practical purposes, they have no access to anything like flamethrowers (flammable oil too is not among the resources at their disposal).
