  I assume you don't mean literally infinite shock troops. You should actually only get as many zombies as there are corpses, and we can generously assume you've been stockpiling corpses for a few decades, maybe even a century.

Not infinite, but still a ridiculous amounts, from the looks of it. Certainly enough to vastly outnumber the defenders, multiple times over. At one point they literally toss themselves on a fire trench to smother it with their bodies, and the ones behind them march on. They're just that expendable.

  make sure you have humans stationed on nice island surrounded by water, with a nice volcano which will stay hot during a snowstorm where you can mine proper amounts of obsidian. If you don't have more obsidian than you know what to do with, you should probably get on a boat as fast as possible because you are toast.

It's unclear if there are any volcanoes at all in Westeros. Never seen one. The obsidian is called "dragonglass", probably because it can made by glassifying sand and rock by, huh, dragons. Luckily, they DO have dragons, two of them. So it'd be curious to see if they /can/ produce dragonglass by breathing on rock, or if that's just a fancy name for a naturally occurring mineral.

By your description the ideal place to mount a defence would be Dragonstone. Nice fortress on an island with high cliffs, basically impregnable, has a deposit of obsidian in its underground. The problem is, it's so far South, if the dead have arrived that far you've basically already lost some 50% of your whole country to them. I can see that not being a sacrifice they're willing to make. But there probably still were better locations than Winterfell, especially considering that supposedly the Night King is interested in killing Bran, so you can draw him into a fight on the terrain of your choice.
