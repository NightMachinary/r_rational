I havent seen the show, just read the first few books up until Snow was assassinated by his men.

I just went by the original post and did a bit of research to see if they had archers and seige equipment (it would be crazy if they didnt, but the OP didnt list them). I thought the OP said 2 fire wizards?

I dont think of GoT wizards as game changers, so I mostly put the fire wizards in supporting units I already feel have a good chance on their own to succeed.
