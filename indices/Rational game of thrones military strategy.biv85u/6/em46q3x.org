Considering /last/ season was a list of how-not-to-do-ancient combat (Off the top of my head mounted troops cornering spearmen on a hill and winning, giants running up and kicking things instead of tossing spears or cabers, etc), it should be no surprise the combat in this one wasn't very rational either.

But nevermind that, I want to be a rational villain. So, pretending I'm an undying necromancer fey with massive amounts of resources listed above, what would be my strategy? Note: I use the term White Walker for the fey creatures of the Night King, not the Zombies.

1. *Dragon*. I have a dragon. An undead, blue-flame-breathing dragon that doesn't need food or sleep. Unlike the real dragons, which need meat or the ability to forage for it, mine doesn't really care about any of those things, and can just circle the place from the air for an indefinite period.

   It will be my Chariot. I shall ride upon its back, ready to infuse it with necromantic energy should it be wounded, and use it to provide me a bird's eye view of the battlefield so that I can direct my troops. In addition, I will be carrying at least four archers, strapped and/or hanging from its legs, who will snipe targets below me when in range. The Dragon will never fly into bow range of the enemy troops, but my archers can shoot just fine. Depending on carrying capacity, it may also be carrying a tree branch or two as a giant caber, one end dipped in water then frozen to serve as a bomb to deal with enemy siege engines and/or massed troops (after the siege is gone). More will be prepared on the ground for if I need to reload. Incidentally, as I am in the air, I don't have to worry about magic ninja assassins. Any flying foes that aren't dragons (warg'ed birds and the like) can be dealt with by the Chariot with its own abilities, or shot at by the archers if they can.

   Should the enemy choose to send an enemy dragon, I will start with the high 'ground' and note its approach. As it struggles to gain altitude, I can choose to either gain more myself until the foe is too tired to fight, or I can choose to cause mine to bank at which point I will throw one of at least three of my prepared dragon-killing ice spears I am carrying. You know, the same kind I used to kill /this/ dragon while it was alive. If that is not an option, and the opponent is somehow faster, I will have my Chariot dive toward it while breathing blue flame. As the dragons must actually breathe the fire, the ascending dragon will have issues as its breathing will be labored while trying to gain altitude. I will not allow mine to stay in a fight, but it will dive beside the foe (giving me another chance at an ice spear) and use its now-superior velocity to head toward one of three pre-prepared landing areas where /White Walkers/ will be ready with more ice lances as a trap for when the foe follows.

2. *Giants*. Unlike the stupid warm meatbags who used these things to walk up to shield walls and kick them, my Giants will be my primary form of assault and team support to my armies. My rank-and-file will strip the land of trees, then they will be crafted into mighty bows, arrows, and spears for my massive minions. Now I have walking siege engines. Each will also have a caber crafted for the purposes of throwing at massed infantry or rolling at any cavalry stupid enough to sally forth and attack them. Yes, the front lines may jump it, but the rest wont, especially if its bounding across the ground. Archer Giants will prioritize enemy dragons, if they appear, followed by enemy archers whose weapons can reach the giant, then enemy cavalry, before anything else. Archery Giants will also carry a backpack wherein an Archer Zombie is placed to serve as a 'tail gunner' in case something sneaks up on the Giant itself.

The two biggest Giants, however, will have a different use. Some of those trees will go to make a mighty mantlet, a portable wall of tree trunks all strapped and nailed together to be carried by said giant on its back. As it is not alive, it has no pride to insult, and so it will slowly walk backwards from my army toward the enemy, serving as a piece of mobile cover from which a lieutenant White Walker and its zombie minions will assault the foe. These attacks will be coordinated, with the siege giants attacking any enemy ranged weapon wielders when they show up to attack the walking walls. Once they reach the walls of the castle, the Walking Walls will pull loose the straps that attach the wall to their back and push up against it with their hands until it falls over onto the castle wall, forming a 'ramp' for use by the assault force. At this point they will run as quickly as possible back to my armies to grab another such wall or for later deployment as necessary. Good luck to the defenders if they try to push the ramp off, as it weighs far more than what most humans can manage, especially while fighting for their lives.

1. *Animals*. While the forests were being clear-cut for 2, the White Walkers were being sent to kill every single living creature they could get their hands on. The smaller, the better. Those mice and badgers hiding in their dens from the cold? Dead. Insects, spiders, slumbering serpents, rats, whatever. I don't care. Everything dies. This serves two purposes... the first is that it denies the enemy Warg any useful intelligence. The second is that it creates terror troops.\\

All animals encountered will be slain and brought back to be processed into Zombies. They will then be 'fed' to the primary assault Zombies (the ones that storm the walls), filling up their stomachs and esophagi to the brim. The Assault Zombies will, of course, be ordered not to chew. Whenever the Assault Zombies are slain by dragonglass, the tiny zombie animals will be released immediately to spread chaos into the enemy ranks. It is much harder to hit a swarm of insects and/or rats than it is to hit a single zombie. If the Assault Zombies are killed normally, the animals will dig and claw their way out, possibly resulting in there being a time delay for them to do so during which the enemy has moved on and the tiny, much more dangerous Zombies, can attack everywhere else. If it's possible to give them 'programmed commands', all the tiny creatures will go toward the food stores if they can sense them (rats should be able to do this just fine), then go into 'stalking' mode for any living that are around.

Any big animals or ones with better movement methods will be saved for their potential combat role. Bears join the siege, birds used to distract or assault enemy archers and/or go after living birds and carry them back, etc, etc. If there are enough of them, they can simply be sent as a disposable wave once the Mantlets have been converted into ramps.

1. *White Walkers*. My sapient fey lieutenants will serve to enforce my will and ensure that the battle goes as close as its can to the existing plan. White Walkers will have a buddy and always travel in groups of two or three. Depending on total number, there will be at least two groups for offense, and three groups for defense. The defense groups are also where my 'dragon landing zones' and aerial ammo stockpiles are located. All White Walkers will carry at least two dragon-piercing ice lances and a hunting horn at all times. Dragons and plucky heroes are their main targets. If they face a foe they can't handle or one of the group is slain, they are to blow the horn and attempt to escape. I will reinforce from Chariot's back.

2. *Snow storm magic*. This exists for two purposes. At first, it is held in reserve for the off chance that the enemy decides to use *both* dragons at once against my Chariot. Again, as they are mortal and mine is not, they will quickly succumb to the elements while I play keep away. If their controller is wise, they will retreat and the battle continues. If not, then as soon as its obvious that they are unable to put up much of a fight, they will get attacked, downed, and converted into minions.

Assuming the foe spends a long time and doesn't use both dragons, then this will be the second stage of the siege if the first fails. The snow will be continued for absolutely as long as possible, while the second wave of undead slowly low-crawl beneath it until the entire area around the castle moat is a Zombie Minefield. An obvious, though smaller force than before will be sent to attack the castle (or fake a parlay), and when the enemy rides or otherwise comes out, the ground will rise up. If they don't take the bait, a conventional attack is started and once the enemy is committed, the entire area rises up and attacks from all directions at once while the aerial bombardment begins.

--------------

Using this strategy, there's really very few options for the defenders other than retreat. There are just too many options for the Undead, when used properly, that the living can't counter. Yes, magical insta-kill weaponry is nice, but it doesn't matter too much when you are having trees dropped on you from above while being shot with sharpened telephone poles by enemy giants or swarmed by zombies that explode into /even worse zombies/ when slain, not to mention the whole issue of trying to purge the food stores once the animal zombies get in. The living can really only use a hit-and-run strategy that employs the dragons as cover to stop things from getting out of hand, but even they need to eat and rest.
