Ideally in an armored, fireproof, crash-proof hollow disguised to look like heavy plate. Any opposing force which manages to get a good look at your dragon will assume that you are not personally riding it, and continue to deploy anti-you measures on the battlefield.

Bonus if you can get your White Walkers and any zombies to resemble like you in any way, even if it's just dressing up, making it further unclear where you may actually be.

There may be some advantage to be gained, too, if your dragon 'bombs' the castle with some of your vermin-filled zombies. Or they can be flung from catapults. Up to you if you want to have the outer zombies wrapped in a ball of... I don't know, inflated and sealed water skins?... to cushion the landing and make the bigger zombie able to survive the landing and thus inflict assorted kills/damage afterwards, or at the very least attract the attention of the defenders and pull them away from the walls etc. Might not work if the fire mages or some other fire source can get to your zombies before they explode, though. (Less of an issue on the battlefield proper.)
