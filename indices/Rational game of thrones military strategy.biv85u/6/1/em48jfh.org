Total domination. I like it. The only flaw is that your non sapient zombies can't be ordered to do anything complicated like crafting or archery and etc. they really only have one mode and that's run and kill vs vs standing still. So you would have to have your walkers doing those things and you only have a little over a dozen of them. And if you want your dragon to be doing complicated things as you mentioned, you have to be personally spend the brain energy to order it constantly.
