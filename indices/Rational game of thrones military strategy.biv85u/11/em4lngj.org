I thought the plan was actually reasonably rational - Brans plan, not anything anyone else did. The only way to thread the needle of the future was to lose really badly so the Night King drops his guard - the Night King who was being smart in generally staying back and only coming forward to counter the dragons, and a one off unnecessary risk with Theon. They were never going to win the battle, the entire thing was a sacrifice to assassinate the Night King.
