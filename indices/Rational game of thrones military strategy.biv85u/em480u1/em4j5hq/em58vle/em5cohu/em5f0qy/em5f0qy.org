  dragons are still your only way to destroy significant numbers of undead in a short time.

I mean, why? Flamethrowers are 1st century tech.

There are only /two/ dragons, and a dragon can be killed with a single well placed harpoon. Simultaneously more, and less fragile than the zombie dragon depending on whether dragon-glass is involved, but still. Large animals don't stand a chance against any sort of technology.

If the enemy manages to maneuver you into a spot where you have no chance but to use the dragon for direct combat, that's intentional and it means they're about to put you in checkmate. You should let the castle fall before you let the obsidian producing dragon die. The moment you've lost dragonglass production, humanity goes from "probably gonna win" to "probably doomed".
