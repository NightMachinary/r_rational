OK so this is what I would do:

- Break the obsidian into hundreds of thousands of shards and load them onto catapults. Catapult them en masse into the zombie lines. Since even the slightest cut will utterly destroy a zombie, the shards can all be pretty small fragments - it may not be good at penetrating armor, but most of the zombies weren't wearing any face armor anyway.
- Craft a thousand or so repeating crossbows (they're really not that hard to make). This would allow even the untrained to shoot obsidian-tipped bolts at the rate of 6-10 per minute, to take on zombies once they get close.
- Have obsidian shards jutting out from the battlements at close, regular intervals all around the castle walls, such that any zombie trying to climb over them will get cut by one (just like if you were to try climbing over razor wire). Since obsidian disintegrates the zombies, the obsidian will remain in place to cut the next zombie that tries to climb over.
- Arm the melee troops with long chains made out of obsidian shards. Since a single cut from obsidian disintegrates a zombie, swinging such an obsidian chain would allow one to disintegrate dozens of zombies with a single sweep. Have phalanxes of melee troops armed with these weapons and the zombies will all be disintegrated before they can close to melee range.
- Encircle the castle with fields of swords and other scrap metal all within a meter of each other. When the zombies have fully surrounded the castle, use Melisandre's contagious set-metal-on-fire spell to cause all this metal to catch flame, burning any zombies caught in the field.
- Also - keep the gates shut the whole time. Better yet, place a boulder right behind the gates (and have it be half under the ground so it can't be moved at all) so the gates can't be opened no matter how much force gets thrown at it.
- Wrap a whole cache of obsidian shards in a cloth bundle, then stuff it in one of the dragons' mouth. Have that dragon search for the night king then spit out the bag of obsidian shards and at the night king, and blast it with fire. As the cloth burns to scrap and disintegrates while in free-fall, all the obsidian will rain down on the night king as an unavoidable shower of death.
