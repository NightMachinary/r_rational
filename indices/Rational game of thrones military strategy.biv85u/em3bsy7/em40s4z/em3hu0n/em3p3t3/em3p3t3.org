Defense: Flee. There's no hope to stop them, lay as many traps as possible to kill as much as you can. Dragons ignite everything flammable, force the undead to slow down or burn. Fast retreat, as much food as able to carry. If you trade lives, you lose. Get to the Vale, the Twins, any place with massive geographic defenses besides 16 foot high walls. Harrenhall, if it's possibly repaired. There's no way their leader will show up until everyone is dead besides Bran.

The dead will chase, make them suffer. Slow them in any manner possible. Elderly, children, they're lost. The North is lost.

Once a proper base is secured: prepare to burn it and flee as soon as a breach occurs. The Vale doesn't have this luxury, but should be best to defend. Your best bet is to spread the enemy army and guerrilla fight it. Every victory is a retreat, since your location is always known at that point. Find the White Walkers and Arya those bastards.

And for God's sake, armor the Dragons against ice spears.

Undead army: Night King stays comfortable at home, the range is apparently able to hit King's Landing. Spread the force thin. For every town or lightly defended castle: surge and kill. For every well fortified location: what's one more year. Surround and wait. Maintain visual on the two dragons, and keep the White Walkers in groups that can't be hit. Send the recently deceased further south, as traps for refugees or those whom are kind. Find graveyards. Ten wights snuck in King's Landing is over 800,000 more wights, after losses.

If they perform guerrilla tactics, circle them. Shoulder to shoulder, tear down trees. White Walkers where fighting occurs. The only survivors are babies and pregnant women, to increase White Walker ranks.

Even dragons eat. Nothing lives. Salt the earth if desired.
