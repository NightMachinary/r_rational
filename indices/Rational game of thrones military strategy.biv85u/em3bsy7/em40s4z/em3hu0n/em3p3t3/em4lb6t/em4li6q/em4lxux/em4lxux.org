  That's why you evacuate them

Not doable.

  d it's easier to kill an extra village of undead slowly than fight an unwinnable battle.

Fair point.

  And yeah, hard sell. There's not really a choice. They can't keep up. They'll fall. I didn't say to kill them, that's the undead's job. Killing them personally is better (kinda) but wasn't added as part of the plan.

You would lose the northern armies, (which admittedly was not a lot) as they wouldn't abandon their families, but you would have the unsullied and Dothraki who could have retreated south with the bought time and found some proper walls. A battle would be forced by the night king pretty fast though.
