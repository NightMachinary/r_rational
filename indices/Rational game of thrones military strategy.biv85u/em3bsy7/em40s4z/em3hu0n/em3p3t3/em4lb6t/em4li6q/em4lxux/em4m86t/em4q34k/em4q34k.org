  Everything that slows you down or forces the fight is too risky to wait for.

I mean, there's a difference between "effective military strategy" and "ruthless plan to maximise the odds of victory no matter the cost". Usually you want to win /for the sake of something/; if you sacrifice huge chunks of that something, there comes a point where victory becomes meaningless. The objective is to save human lives, not to kill the Night King because we don't like his face, and sacrifices be damned. Have you read/watched The Promised Neverland? There's an interesting dilemma they face that's very similar to this one.
