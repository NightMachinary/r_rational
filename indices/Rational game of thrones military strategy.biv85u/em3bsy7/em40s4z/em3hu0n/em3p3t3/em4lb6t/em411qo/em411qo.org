I like this answer the best, but one problem. The main castle in the Vale, (the Eyrie? however it's spelled.) is too cold to stay in even in a normal winter. So you'd probably be pretty boned if you went there. Also, in regards to the ice spears, considering it blew through like an entire dragon, not sure any armor that wasn't valyrian steel would help much. Maybe obsidian would help?
