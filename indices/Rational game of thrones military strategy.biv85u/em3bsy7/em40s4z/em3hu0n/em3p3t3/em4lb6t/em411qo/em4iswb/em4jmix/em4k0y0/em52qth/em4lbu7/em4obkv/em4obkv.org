Or maybe the reanimation requires a fuckton more magic energy and so has a dramatically lower radius? Otherwise it's like saying that the radius you need to transmit to a distant receiving device and the radius you need to use the same transmitter to cook an egg with microwaves is the same (supposing communication with microwaves, which is a bit weird but bear with me for the metaphor's sake).
