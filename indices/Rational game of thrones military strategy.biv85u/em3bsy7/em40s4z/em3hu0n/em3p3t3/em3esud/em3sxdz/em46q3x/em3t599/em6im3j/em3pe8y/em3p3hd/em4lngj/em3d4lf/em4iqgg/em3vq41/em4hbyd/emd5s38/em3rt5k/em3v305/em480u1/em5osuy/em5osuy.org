I haven't seen this strat yet, but there are some long posts so sorry if I'm stealing someone's idea.

As NK, ignore winterfell and just sweep all the way south, murdering literally everyone else in westeros. Leave behind a couple walkers and thousand wights or so to dig in in a big perimeter around winter fell, literally buried like landmines. They carry on a guerilla style effort to keep winterfell from being effectively provisioned, but stay hidden and spread enough to not be good dragon targets. They just distract and delay while the conquest of all the people without obsidian a and magic finishes.

As living, uh... Pretty much gotta kill the head off that pyramid scheme. Anything and everything towards killing NK. Maybe rapid retreat south with full scorched earth (killing or assimilating everything alive) like someone else suggested with the main body of troops. Figure out if you can effectively stealth from white walkers. Conscript all faceless men? Idk. It's grim if NK does the smart thing and buries himself under miles of sea ice, even if Bran is actually omniscient.
