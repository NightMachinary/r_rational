Because at that point their ridiculously ineffective suicidal Dothraki charge had reached the enemy and they didn't want to risk hitting one of their own and denying them a long, protracted death at the hands of the undead with a swift and painless one. After that, well, the trebuchets were lost since for some reason they were put in the front line of the battle formation. You know, the very thing I learned not to do simply by playing Age of Empires 2.
