I thought we had Trebuchet and archers too?

I would have setup an initial battle at a river, long before my castle, with my most mobile troops (calvary) setup to transport my archers and act as defense. Any frozen parts of the river will be unfrozen with one dragon using dragonfire when the ice walkers try to cross, then a few volleys over the river to burn off more zombies.

Meanwhile, the other living dragon will deal with the ice dragon. I would have Bran Warg the other living dragon with the sole intention of luring the ice dragon into a whole company of dragonglass archers/spearmen/fire wizard.

As soon as the ice dragon is down, full retreat guarded with unopposed dragonfire.

At Winterfell, I would have set a group of archers to assassinate white walkers with flaming arrows. My Trebuchets would be on my walls tasked with filling chokepoints with fire.

Bran will be identifying White Walkers and keeping me up to date on my Calvary. Any time he discovers a White Walker, a few volleys from my archers should fix that problem. The fewer intelligent zombies, the better.

Meanwhile my dragons are lighting things on fire unopposed. Never staying still and focusing on areas away from the Night King. The forest would be loaded with any spare cooking oil in key locations to make sure my dragonfire is extra destructive.

I have weeks to prepare, and I need a lot of firewood for zombie burning...I would harvest with an eye towards building criss-crossing roads for some units of the calvary. Their job would be to sweep in groups back and forth after the main army passes to cut into enemy reserves. The endless zombie horde is mostly mindless and the Night King is going to have his smart zombies at the castle to organize the battle. The dragonglass armed calvary should do excellent until their horses get tired. I would likely make the loops extend far enough out the calvary can walk their horses with less worry of being mobbed before charging back in. The outer edges of the loops would have exits back to the far side of the castle for when the enemy figures out a counter to my plan.

The rest of my Calvary would have been drilling so they know the open ground around the castle very well. When a signal goes up, they sweep in to crush the zombies against the castle walls from behind, then they pull out as quickly as possible. This way I can pick a wall and focus charges on that wall if any side is getting over-run.

I would put Arya in charge of a crack assassination unit specifically tasked with finding and killing the Night King. This unit would contain one of my fire wizards.

My phalanx will be spread across the walls to ensure no zombies breach those walls.

Giants are a problem, but a unit of my best javalin throwers would be tasked with spreading around the walls. Their orders will be to take down any giants as quickly as possible.

My enemy doesnt have any seige equipment (unless my dragons and Bran failed to kill the Ice Dragon) So breaches will likely come from giants or massive zombie numbers tearing into my gates. I will have some large wagons built with a wooden wall on one side, reinforced with stone blocks. If any breaches occur in my walls or gates, the will be used to fill the breach and/or reinforce my gates if not needed elsewhere.

My remaining fire wizard will stick with me and be used as part of my reserves where needed.
