Here's stuff I came up with on the fly and I literally have no experience whatsoever. I mean humans are still going to lose but it won't be an absolute shocker that they survived long enough until the night king dies.

1) maybe start with the catapults. Go nuts with the catapults. Have catapults up on the walls for max range. Don't cease fire. Why did they cease fire ?!?!

2) have bran use warg skills to accurately track movements of zombie army and night king. Have him tell humans where to attack and where Arya to go.

3) Arya has the “transform into anyone” superpower teased way too much for her to not at least try to pretend to be a wight or a white walker to get to the night king. ( with perhaps a bran warged raven showing her the way ) making her eventual success at least semi plausible.

4) unsullied need to make phalanxes! You can't have them teased to be super amazing at making phalanxes and then have them be really shit at making phalanxes! Larger shields! Sturdier formation! Move as a block. Back troops take over as front shields as the front troops get slaughtered. Back troops with shields up in testudo formation. Obsidian studded shields and spears! Zombies only have the strength of one man and a single obsidian scratch kills a zombie. Yes they would eventually be over run but at least it wouldn't be insta kill.

5) put your troops behind the trench. Make multiple trenches. Make it like really really easy to set on fire. Why rely on unreliable fire mages if you have literally anything else?

6) if we have fire mages anyway, any luck we can get them to set fire to some pre determined locations really far away in some nice fire traps that we can get bran to see when the optimal amount of zombies have crossed over.

7) this is extra retcon, but Tyrion would look less like a dumbass and actually have his character be smart and useful if he got several tanks of wildfyre from Cersei as a show of faith that she's going to “legit help with the zombies I promise” before her eventual betrayal. That way that stupid suicide mission from last season would at least have something good out of it. Wildfire would have been hella useful for a blackwater pt two hello Tyrion but whatever.

8) since were having dragons fight the other dragon, obsidian mouth guard? If that's too crazy then maybe one of those obsidian spiked collars that you put on sheep dogs to protect them against wolves.
