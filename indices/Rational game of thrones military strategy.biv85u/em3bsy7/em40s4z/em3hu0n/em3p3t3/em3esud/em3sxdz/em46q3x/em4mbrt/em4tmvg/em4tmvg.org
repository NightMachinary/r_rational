The Chariot has limited carrying capacity. I choose to use that for offense, rather than bothering with unnecessary defense. It is out of bowshot, and trebuchets and the like can't be aimed 'up', so there's no real need to bother with armor.

In addition, I am on /top/ of it and all the enemy will see is the bottom. They will likely infer I am up there, but I've already got this covered. If the Chariot has been up-armored or obviously enhanced, it's even more of a clue where I am.

I don't care about body doubles. My goal is to lure out the only weapons that can feasibly defeat me--the enemy Dragons. Everything else is secondary. I can lose my entire Zombie army and it be worth it if I can take the enemy's dragons away and convert them. The White Walkers are using the buddy system, so any visits from ninja assassin girls will result in one being iced before said girl gets shanked by the other or its coterie of minions.

Aerial bombing with infested Assault Zombies is a /marvellous/ idea, though, thanks! Don't even have to worry about it too much as most of the physical damage done to a living creature from falling is meaningless. Just have to ensure that they spread-eagle on the way down to increase drag and prevent snapping of the 'long bones' (those in the arms and legs) so that the limbs are still useful after impact.

*EDIT*: After consideration, it's possible the enemy might Warg might try some shenanigans with birds (like having crows carry pieces of obsidian to scratch at Chariot). Ergo, half of all birds (and all bats) I have my minions kill will travel around Chariot providing air cover. The bats will serve as perfect short-range target acquisition for anything really small that somehow made it up there without being seen. May even send a couple with each White Walker once the presence of a stealth assassin is confirmed.
