IRL, Greek Fire existed, but it was a closely guarded secret of one country. If the undead had attacked 600 AD Britain, they wouldn't have had flamethrowers.

And the situation is... complicated. This is a continent that has been in a state of civil war and disarray for years now. There is no unified government behind this - in fact, the currently reigning queen (who has the wyldfire supply) is also plotting to backstab the northerners, hoping that the dead will weaken them so she can inflict the final blow. Shortsightedness in the face of an existential threat is a major theme of the show.
