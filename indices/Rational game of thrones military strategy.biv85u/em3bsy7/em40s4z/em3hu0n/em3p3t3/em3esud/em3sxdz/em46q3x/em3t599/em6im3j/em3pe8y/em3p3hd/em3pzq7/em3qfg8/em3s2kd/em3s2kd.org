I haven't seen the show, only the books, but it's plausible he can't. Bran's powers are descended from the children of the forest, and are Westeros/Ice affiliated magic. Dragons by contrast come from Valyria, and are Valyrian/Fire affiliated magic. They contrast each other strongly and I don't think Bran could take one over. If nothing else dragons have strong wills and are fairly intelligent, making them hard to take over.
