Who would the fire wizards be? I can only think of Melisandre, and she's hit-or-miss at best, what with her being basically a cleric or warlock, by D&D standards, not a wizard proper.

The river tactic is nice but the problem is if the terrain around Winterfell is such that it allows it. I don't think there's any significant rivers north of Winterfell. Still, could have made better use of the time before the battle, and especially try to fight /during the day/, at the very least. That was really giving the undead the field advantage.
