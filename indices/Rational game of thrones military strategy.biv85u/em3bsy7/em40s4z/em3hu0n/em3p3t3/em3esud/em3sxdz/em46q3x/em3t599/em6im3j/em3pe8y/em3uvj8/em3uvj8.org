I like many of these ideas but dragonglass doesn't disintegrate zombies (as opposed to white walkers), it just 'kills' them, so you'll still have corpses everywhere. That was part of Jon's demonstration to Cersei in King's Landing.

(Fun fact: in the books, dragonglass doesn't even kill the zombies.)
