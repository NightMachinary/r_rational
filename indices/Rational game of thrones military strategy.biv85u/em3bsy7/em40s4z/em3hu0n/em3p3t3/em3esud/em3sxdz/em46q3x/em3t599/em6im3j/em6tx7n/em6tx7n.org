The best part about smart strategy is that it makes it much more cinematically intense when all your carefully laid out plans get overrun one at a time just to the sheer number of zombies. We can still have Arya specifically tasked to assasinate walkers and the night king since it is a known weak spot that if a walker dies, all the zombies it controls die. Hound and Beric can still tragically die getting Arya to the night king and when the castle is breached and all hope is lost and several beloved main characters have died, Arya still gets her hero moment without it seeming like a deux ex machina.
