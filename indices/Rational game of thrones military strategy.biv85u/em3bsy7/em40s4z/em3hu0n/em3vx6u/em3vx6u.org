Agree that the actual war was too short and too much time spent on "surviving in the castle". I understand the producers since big battle is a LOT more expensive then having Arya fighting 10 guys with makeup and little CGI. I believe this is also the reason the dothraki charged, having to film with all those horses must have been a nightmare.
