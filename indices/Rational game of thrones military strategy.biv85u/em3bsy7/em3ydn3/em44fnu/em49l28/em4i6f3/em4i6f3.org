Attacking resolves it faster though. Sieging gives Dany time to kill zombies, retreat in the fortress to give food and rest to her dragons, wash, rinse, repeat. Attacking puts pressure on her to do many things at once, address the most pressing strategic objectives, and possibly strain her dragon to the point of exhaustion. And even if she survives, if she can't prevent the zombies from killing everyone else (say, Sansa, Tyrion, and most importantly Bran) that's not much good for her.
