This is a solid, logical strategy that does not account for Dany and her dragons, whom could have, with enough time, incinerated any massed undead enforcing a siege. Incineration is a complete loss of resources for the Night King, and could have theoretically caused any engagement without a counter present to become a net loss by its nature. The only potential counters the Night King had for dragon fire, barring any mistakes on Dany's part (like landing her god damn dragon in the middle of an active melee), were the Night King himself and his converted dragon (which was not especially effective in practice.)

So, at some point, the Night King did have to force a battle, and participate in it as a counter to Dany's dragons. And after Dany's dragons were down, the Night King would have essentially won, so why would he wait to claim his prize? It's not like he knows Arya is a magic goddamn ninja assassin.

- Note that although the Night King's Wights may have had some spear chucking dragon-counter potential, this was not demonstrated in the series to my knowledge. Closest we got was spear-caddy-Wight.

- The side-strategy you've proposed of 'Spread Out and Kill Everything' is a solid, and would likely be the most destructive possible strategy, but it would seem the Night King put a higher value on killing Bran than spreading undeath. So that was a no go. I'd also argue that this strategy would leave the Night King's assets vulnerable to roaming (human) warbands and Bran's omniscience. The 'Command from Afar' strategy you've proposed would have the same weakness.
