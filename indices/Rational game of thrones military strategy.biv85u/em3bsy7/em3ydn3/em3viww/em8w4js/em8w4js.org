I'm not really sure if the Night King is capable of doing anything more complex than a direct attack. His backstory is unclear, but he seems to have been created by the children of the forest to kill humanity. Effectively he's a magic version of an unfriendly AI, but without the ability to grow his intelligence, just to grow his army.

As far as I remember he hasn't done anything strategically clever in the series that hints he has a full human mind going on. The smartest trick he ever pulled out was to kill the dragon with the ice spear. I think he is better understood as a force of nature kind of villain, whatever intelligence he has is secondary to his overriding need to destroy humanity.

Also, For untold centuries his strategy of massive wight army has been successful, so he has had no reason to innovate even if thats possible.
