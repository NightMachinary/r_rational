The whole episode was a clusterfuck where everything was so... ugh. edit: I should add spoiler warning, I guess?

I am going to approach this a bit differently because your premise is not without a flaw. [If I, as a Night King, have /literally/ infinite zombies, then the answer is simple: assault the fortress with infinite zombies, until everyone succumbs to sleep deprivation. Okay, the zombies aren't /really/ infinite. Well, then siege the castle until everyone starves, gg easy]

So the problem, I think, is that the writers tried too hard to paint a bleak picture and screwed the pacing. To give you a perspective, it takes about seventeen minutes from the Dothraki charge to lighting up the trench /[okay, as a side note about that. I remember just a week ago someone said that the Dothraki charge would be the stupidest thing possible, because duh, zombies have no morale. And OF COURSE, this is exactly what happens. WHYYY. Ahem, moving on.]/ So they fight in the open for almost twenty minutes. And the castle walls are breached in... three minutes. Three.

Just. What.

But that's not the worst part. After the walls have been breached, /they survive for another 35 minutes/. HOW.

So the better half of the episode is basically nonsensical running around the castle, and important characters don't die left and right. I could /almost/ hear the Benny Hill theme during the library scene. It seemed so offkey.

Instead of this, the damn castle walls should've not been breached until the last 7-10 minutes. This would be a rough outline:

1:00-10:00: buildup as it was. Melissandre does her thing. Dothraki are in reserve.

10:00-20:00 first clash, as it was sans the charge. Edd lives (for now)

20:00-30:00 retreat&trench shenanigans, Edd dies.

30:00-35:00 zombies try the walls and are methodically slaughtered. Not a single soldier dies, morale is high

35:00-40:00 white walkers act as some bullshit artillery to crush walls with magic. Dothraki charge (from the flank), both units are wiped out

40:00-50:00 more zombie slaughter, this time with casualties because walls are damaged, undead giants bla bla bla. Mormont girl does not get a kill and dies (seriously, stupidity must be punished). Let the man with the best beard do the giantslaying. Berric dies. Aerial battle starts (it looked very good, when they went above the clouds, should've used that imagery some more)

50:00-60:00 Castle defense starts to crumble. Aerial battle intensifies.

60:00-70:00 NK (crash)lands, raises the dead, chaos ensues. Crypt shenanigans.

70:00-75:00 Grove scene, Theon dies defending, not charging like an idiot.

75:00-the end. NK dies, outro continues as it was.
