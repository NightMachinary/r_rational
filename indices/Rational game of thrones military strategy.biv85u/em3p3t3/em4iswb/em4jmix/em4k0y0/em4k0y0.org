Do we know that the wights need to be 'in range' of the Night King to stay alive? I think the 'range' that really matters here is that of the Night King's resurrection powers. I simply assumed that was the limited one, and once they're resurrected, wights simply self-sustain (until the Night King is completely obliterated, apparently).
