That's why you evacuate them, and it's easier to kill an extra village of undead slowly than fight an unwinnable battle.

And yeah, hard sell. There's not really a choice. They can't keep up. They'll fall. I didn't say to kill them, that's the undead's job. Killing them personally is better (kinda) but wasn't added as part of the plan.
