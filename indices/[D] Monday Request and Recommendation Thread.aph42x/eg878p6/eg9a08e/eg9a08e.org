I didn't enjoy Russian Doll: if you're looking for logic it's not here it's pop-timelines pseudophilosophy. I kept waiting to really understand the characters and get to like them but never got there. I'd recommend watching the first and if you like the MC continue, if not bail.

Kaguya-sama is fantastic, and I expect the male MC to hit close to home for a lot of this sub.
