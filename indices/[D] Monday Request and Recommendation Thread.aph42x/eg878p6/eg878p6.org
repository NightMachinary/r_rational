Recommendations from previous threads that I worked through this week:

Master Assassins - Okay

Murderbot Diaries -- Pretty fun

Russian Doll -- Pretty good

Love is War -- Pretty good and pretty fun

*Master Assassins* (Novel): Best to throw out any preconceptions the awful title gives you because it's definitely not that kind of story. To some degree this feels like one of those genre fiction novels that gets a pass on not being particularly eventful or exciting because it has some mild literary ambitions that it vaguely comes within sight of. Not an awful lot happens, in many respects it's a travelogue. It explores the idea of family and what it means and it does an okay job, I guess, but it's fairly well trod ground that it doesn't shine any new light on. The characters are well fleshed out, not overly intriguing and only act stupidly when the plot demands it on the rare occasion. The worldbuilding is novel though there's not too much of it. The prose is fairly nice.

*Russian Doll* (TV): Character focused time loop drama. I really enjoyed this show. The characters were unique and their behaviour and dialogue was very often believable. Unconventional, quirky characters that aren't caricatures is uncommon in my experience. Great pacing -- the show is only eight sub-30minute episodes. Worth noting: do not watch for an interesting exploration of time loop mechanics or any form of competence porn. Also, the protagonist is not the most likeable of characters though to what extent will, I suspect, vary a lot for different viewers.

I recommend not watching the trailer.

*Murderbot Diaries #1* (Novella's): Short, easy to digest adventure sci-fi. It's about a security android who's hacked it's governing module, granting it 'free will'. What it decides to do with that is laze about on the job as much as possible by binge watching the future equivalent of netflix and avoiding human contact which it finds awkward and embarrassing -- a socially awkward combat bot. It doesn't suffer some of the pitfalls that you get from a lot of adventure fiction such a generic characters acting as the plot requires for cheap drama or conflict. It does suffer from the pitfall of none of the action being particularly original or clever and the 'mystery' is pretty pedestrian. Still, the characters are enjoyable and the premise is novel. I'll likely read the next one in the series.

(okay, I read the +next one+ rest of the series) Murderbot Diaries 4 > 2 > 3 > 1: Solid improvements on the first novel as the series continued. Plot's more engaging, new and existing characters more fleshed out, the wider universe feels more substantial. For short, light adventure novels they have a lot of heart and the dry wit is great.

*Kaguya-sama: Love is War* (Anime): With only a specific few exceptions i've discovered that anime just isn't for me and I think I enjoy this show so much, at least in part, because it's almost a self aware parody (in a non sneering way) of the exaggerated stylistics you get from many anime but that I tend to not enjoy -- dramatic voice overs, exaggerated proclamations, epic music, ridiculous reactions, training montages - all in the body of a rom-com. In the latest episode there was a detailed analysis of the social dynamics involved in a boy and girl sharing an umbrella in the rain, a list of scenarios in which such sharing is broached or occurs and detailed planning and scheming by the two main characters to instigate such a scenario without looking like they were doing it because they liked the other. Completely ludicrous. Utterly delightful.
