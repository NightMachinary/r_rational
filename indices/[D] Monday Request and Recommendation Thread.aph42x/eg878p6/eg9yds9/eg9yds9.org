I'm several episodes into Russian Doll and am pretty annoyed with the main character's incompetence.

Sure, I can understand how the first time you tried to say, "Help! I'm caught in a groundhog's day loop!" you'd fuck it up and sound like you're babbling.

But the show has had the MC give that talk to like 5 people. And every time the explanation is incoherent babble, and failing at theory of mind.

Like, there's a scene where the MC puts marker on her hand, resets, and then goes up to someone else going "Hey! Look at my finger! There's no pen mark!"

Its so bad that I spent a couple episodes unsure if the MC was losing memories between loops.
