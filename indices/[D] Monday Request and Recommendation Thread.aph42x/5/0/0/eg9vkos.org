I think I have a solution for quickly filtering out by word count, but it'll take until tomorrow for me to figure if it'll work. I'll let you know by tomorrow night.

All I need to know is, is the word count greater than 30K the only thing that you want to filter out? Or are there other undesirable qualities you want to get rid of?
