I've been watching and enjoying /That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime/ recently -- would recommend as a feel-good portal fantasy, it's a bit more serious than the last one I watched (/KonoSuba/), and with a greater focus on... civil engineering, I guess, over adventuring.

Otherwise, these last 4 days I hosted a prospective PhD student, and we'd coincidentally shared a few literary tastes (e.g. we both adored Diana Wynne Jones). Over the years she'd read a few works liked by this subreddit (e.g. /Worm/, /HPMOR/), but otherwise had never heard of the "genre" and enthusiastically requested recommendations. What would be a good "introductory" text? (I'd already sent some recs [[https://i.imgur.com/qSZsohG.png][this morning]], avoiding the Naruto/Pokemon fandoms since those weren't really her jam -- likewise, if anyone knows of good DnD podcasts (she liked e.g. [[https://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone][TAZ]]) or online multiplayer games, do say).
