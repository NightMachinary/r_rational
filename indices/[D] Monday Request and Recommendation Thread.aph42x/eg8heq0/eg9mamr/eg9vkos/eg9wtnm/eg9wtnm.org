If you can filter by word count without having to check threadmarks in all the different works that helps a lot!!! However, if you are going by the word count listed in the threadmarks section keep in mind some of the longest ones look like fragments because they are posted from an older thread of the same story in a way that messes up word count. Ex. Security by Ack which is 6th one down in the SV 2.0 thread is >200k words but has word count listed as 190. It might be worth missing these to save time but idk how common it is in longer/multithread fics.

I would also like to eventually merge the names of the fandoms that are written differently so once you find one you can find them all but that is lower priority and probably needs a different solution.

I would also like a way to go back and find the <30k fics once they get updated to 30k but again that probably needs a different solution. Once things are sorted in a spreadsheet people can just check if a newly >30k fic is already added and post it in threads on each of the forums if it isn't.
