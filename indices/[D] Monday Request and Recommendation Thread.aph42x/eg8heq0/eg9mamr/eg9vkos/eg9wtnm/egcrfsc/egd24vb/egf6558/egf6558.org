After almost two days of non-stop downloading, it's complete!

Here's the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kF5aaDuY8JGwsZQVzvPV7Nx1CghUw09M4qpepQP-GfQ/edit?usp=sharing][spreadsheet]] of all 364 stories with more than 30K out of a whooping 1346 books! That's 27.04% or a little more than one fourth with a worthwhile word count. Note that I didn't include the rest of the stories below the cutoff.

Anyway, that spreadsheet also has a fair bit of miscellaneous data for people to sort and play with. Here's another [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xbLAfJtyyJNlXfQYg-yKUYBB2iIxRzDsce8xJYRRQfE/edit?usp=sharing][spreadsheet]] with only the urls that people can just copy and paste into FanFicFare to download everything right away.

Note that some stories were duplicated across the three sites, so the actual number of stories is probably a bit lower.

EDIT: Note that anyone with that link can edit the spreadsheet. If you think someone has messed with it or deleted stuff on it, PM me and I'll send you the original version.
