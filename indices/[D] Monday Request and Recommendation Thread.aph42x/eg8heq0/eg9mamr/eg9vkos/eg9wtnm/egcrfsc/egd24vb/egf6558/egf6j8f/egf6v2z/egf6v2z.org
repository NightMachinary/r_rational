Feel free to do it yourself. I don't even have an account on SV or SB. QQ is only because it's required to view the stories and I don't even know where it's best to post it to on that site.

Anyway, I'm going to tidy up the spreadsheet that only has the links. Calibre isn't very good that outputting links or metadata to cvs in a nice human-readable format.

EDIT: I add to the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xbLAfJtyyJNlXfQYg-yKUYBB2iIxRzDsce8xJYRRQfE/edit?usp=sharing][spreadsheet]] that only had the urls to also have the author and title of the works.
