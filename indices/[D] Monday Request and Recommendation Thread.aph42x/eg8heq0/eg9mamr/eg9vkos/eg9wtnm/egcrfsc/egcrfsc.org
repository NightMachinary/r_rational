Okay, it took some experimenting, but I've cracked it....mostly.

I have an [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-selected-links/][add-on]] that allows me to highlight text on a webpage and copy the selected links. So I highlighted and then copied all of the links in all 4 archives.

Then I opened [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]], and clicked on the plug-in [[https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3084025][FanFicFare]].

This results in calibre downloading all of the self-insert stories from all of the archives.

In reality, it was easier to break it into multiple batches at a time to download. It even worked with stories like Security! where there is no index and only links in the first chapter.

It's only half way done, but once it's finished (probably by tomorrow) I can get calibre to generate a cvs doc with the story title, author, link, word count, chapter count, and any other miscellaneous info that I think you could use somehow.

Unfortunately, fandoms are trickier to tag because calibre only adds in tags that the original author tagged to their stories and not every author added such tags properly.

Anyway, I'll post it as a shared Google Docs tomorrow once calibre finishes processing.
