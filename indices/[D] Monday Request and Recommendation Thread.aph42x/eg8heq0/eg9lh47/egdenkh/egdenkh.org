You might want to try skipping a chapter if you're feeling bored. I do that sometimes, and often I continue until I get curious enough to read what I missed.

In any case, I'm surprised that you stopped part way through. To me, it's one of those fics which is gripping enough so that if you're drawn in by the first few chapters, you'll read until you're caught up. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

Would you mind sharing (in a spoiler) where you stopped liking it? I'm really curious, because this fic is definitely one of my most favorite SIs.

EmptySurface also stopped updating the FFnet version, and moved over to AO3 instead. The link is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][here]].

The rec for this fic the you saw is probably mine. I keep recommending it whenever I see "Naruto SI", because I like it so much. I'm probably gonna stop doing it whenever [[/u/Addictedtobadfanfict][u/Addictedtobadfanfict]] posts, though, since I did it several times, and he doesn't like it. Shame :(

It's kinda odd, since he likes Sanitize, for example. This fic is probably an intersection between that and some other fics he recommends, in that it contains many elements from different ones he mentions, but not all. An intersection, really.

I do kinda wish he put it up as, "I tried this fic and didn't like it very much, but /many many/ other people recommended it to me." Maybe mention how I find it's the only hurt/comfort fic that I like/does it well.

I'm a big fan, as you can see. :D
