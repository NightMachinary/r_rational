I stopped reading after the third time someone close to her died. It felt like she was just going through the same trauma again and again without it building to anything or being meaningfully different every time. It became a slog.

I've read a lot of stuff between Hear the Silence and now, though, and don't remember it very well. If it gets better or does actually end up paying off please let me know and I'll try to get back into it!
