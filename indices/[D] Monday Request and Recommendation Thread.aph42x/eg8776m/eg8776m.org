I recently took a stap at rereading twig by wildbow and I had forgotten how much I like that the protagonist is an experiment and is good at manipulating people. I am requesting recommendations for stories in which the main character is either an experiment and ones in which the main character is a skilled(but fallible) social manipulator.

Aside from Twig I am familiar with Super Minion but not much else.
