I ate through it. Moderately pleasant read. I enjoyed the climax in the story but it felt like the protagonist didn't really get much resistance and whatever resistance he got was because he was really short sighted. There should be ranged attack chakra techniques in existance that had a good scaling with the amount of chakra you can pour into and the chance that they were in the library was pretty great. It also doesn't really feel like he earns his victories except maybe the one with syrup, though it was unclear why the syrup change didn't have chakra to absorb.
