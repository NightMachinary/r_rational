i just caught up on slime this weekend and it's not bad. It's light-hearted and I like the whole nation-building thing. Sometimes it seems a little too simplistic, with everybody being very willing to forgive and ally up, but at least one can't say they're being irrational. But I'm sad that Shizue died, since she was more interesting than a lot of the characters that came afterwards (like Milim)
