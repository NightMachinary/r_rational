yep -- for my wife and I, something non-competitive and casual/easy, with at least a basic story (so some sort of campaign is a must, rather than e.g. just team deathmatch or w/e), that doesn't require much in way of fast-twitch reflexes. Games we've enjoyed have included the Divinity: Original Sin duo, Borderlands II, Diablo III (though wife /hated/ Grim Dawn, go figure), Portal 2, Guacamelee, Magicka 2, Lego LotR (though not the other Lego games), The Division, Unravel, and Portal 2, to give a sample (also -- nothing scary, esp. zombies. Dead Island was ok, Dying Light was not). Currently we're playing Far Cry 5, with Ghost: Recon Wildlands up next. Of the current gen offerings we only have a PC, but will probably get a PS4 sometimes soon-ish. Also open to older titles (via e.g. emulator). Either online-only or couch/splitscreen are ok, but with a preference for the latter.

For the visitor asking for recs -- specifically, she has a weekly DnD game (hosted online) but sometimes some of her friends can't make it, so they (4 people in total) fill their time with online games, but specifically Jackbox Party Pack. She doesn't really play games otherwise and wanted recs for good options. So probably nothing too technical and more pick-up-and-play-ey, but I figured D:OS would be fine given their familiarity with DnD.
