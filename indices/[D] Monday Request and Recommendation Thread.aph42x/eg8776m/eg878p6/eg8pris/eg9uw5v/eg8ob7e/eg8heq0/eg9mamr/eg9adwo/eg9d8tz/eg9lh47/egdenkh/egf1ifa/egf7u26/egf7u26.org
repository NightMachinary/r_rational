Yeah, you probably stopped at a low point.

The only people close to her that die are her mom and the other two on the genin team. We know that some get pretty hurt, but for sake of getting you to read it spoilers, no one else close has died. There are some extras that die, obviously, but let me tell you, no one cares about them. And I'm the type to get sad over minor characters dying. So don't worry about that.

You probably dropped it at the lowest emotional point in the story. Imo, the story is consistently amazing throughout, but in how exhausting it can be to read it, you probably stopped at the most exhausting point.

Don't worry about it though, I do that with fics some times. I stopped reading Pact for a year because it was so stressful, and I haven't had the guts to actually read Twig yet. Also, the other time I often drop good fics is when they use awkward comedy, like how many sitcoms are. I just cringe too hard and stop. It's never as bad the second time around though. It's definitely worth reading those fics (assuming they're good anyway).

I'd wholeheartedly recommend for you to continue it. I've mentioned that it's the only hurt comfort fic that does things well, and I definitely felt the same thing you do in your spoiler. After that point though, it really does become more about rebuilding. One chapter had a crazy battle in Uzu, where in a chapter or so afterwards, the war stops. That's the second culmination of the stress on Kyo, with the first one being the death of her team. After this point, it's more of dealing with a world becoming more peaceful, but not wholly peaceful. She still gets hurt, but it's really more physical. No more deaths. It's pretty fucking good after this point.

So yeah. Go for it. Make sure you read my spoilers; you should be fine where you are. Remember to read the AO3 version, too.

Happy reading! :)
