I know I am clogging up the recommendation thread so I didn't comment last week for this reason. I also add noteworthy self-inserts I come across each time I post so there is always something new.

It's not like I am picking any random self-inserts to add to my list. There are so many self-inserts out there with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Archive-for-Self-Inserts-and-Original-Characters/117072/][the archive for self inserts and original characters]] alone having 10,000+ self inserts in it's collection. The problem is 99% of the self inserts available are unreadable trash. I go through like 20 self-inserts a week. I won't stop till my list reaches 100 until I find the 1%. I'm swimming through the great pacific garbage patch trying to find diamonds in the rough. If you see a self-insert added to my list you should know you are in for something out of the norm.

Also, the snake report is not a 'self insert' or fanfiction. I would classify it as an isekai. Self-inserts are suppose to have omniscient knowledge in the universe they are self-inserting in such as Juniper Smith in Worth the candle. Self-inserts in fanfiction are a whole different ball game because the readers are invested and know the universe of the fanfic they were self inserted in. That's why a lot of people are picky with self-inserts because when a self insert does stupid shit in the fanfic you are familiar with and gets away with it, you know the self-insert you are reading is irrational overlooked trash.

I just want to double back and recommend [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/frost-dragon-ball-si.6837/][Frost]] because it's easily one of my top 5 self-inserts of all time that I found a week ago. If you are into Dragon ball Z at all you would love it. I had to go through so much porn in questionable questing to find this self-insert. I would consider it rational adjacent.
