EDIT: IT IS COMPLETE [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kF5aaDuY8JGwsZQVzvPV7Nx1CghUw09M4qpepQP-GfQ/edit?usp=sharing]]

Removed the doc link and replaced, Xamueljones created an automated version so no one needs to add to the list. Hooray for our tireless army of robot laborers!

I made a google doc called "Insert all the fics" to try and improve the SI rec threads from SV and SB. Have been meaning to do this for a while but there are way too many for me to do this on my own:

Here is the sufficient velocity SI archive. Brace for impact:

The problem with these is like 95% are abandoned or fragments and the authors update but don't sort it by quality. I have tried a couple of times to find something good in it and given up around letter C.

If a couple of people volunteered to look through sections by letter we could make a new thread with just the longer ones without going insane. Limiting to stories with threadmarks greater than 30k words would get rid of at least 3/4 of these and make it way more manageable. Then it could be sorted by live/dead (updated last 6 months), and by fandom and then repost it as threads on all the forums. At least a handful of these have to be good but they are buried too deep in fragments, weird fandoms, and long dead fics.

I created a document and will do a section if other people will help. If people are interested we could probably commandeer people on SV and SB to help also.

Stage 0: improve the instructions in the doc, adding ways to search, and a way to give assignments so people aren't writing over each other or out of order

Stage 1 would be posting the titles/links of the ones >20k and the length.

Stage 2 would be filling in the other details

Order to go through threads would be SV thread 2.0 alphabetically by author name, SV thread 1 same way, SB thread..., QQ thread.... (same order as posted above)

Alphabetical within each section by author letter since that is how they are currently divided and allows people to split up the work. The list could be resorted by other metrics once it is in a spreadsheet.

Link any other rec threads you have heard of on SV or SB!
