Also, paging [[/u/Addictedtobadfanfict][u/Addictedtobadfanfict]] because I want you to see my response to the guy responding to you.

  I think your definition of SI is overly narrow and not the way it's commonly used. SI with knowledge of the setting/universe before taken there would better specify what you want in my opinion.

Even that definition is kinda narrow to me.

To me, an SI is the insertion of the author into an already established universe. Whether they retain knowledge or not doesn't matter, it's still an SI. (Also, there's the FI fics on SB, where the only difference is that a friend is writing it. This is interesting because the Author being inserted doesn't need to have knowledge of the work itself. It's still not isekai.)

An OC-SI is like an SI, but instead of the author being inserted, it's an original character instead. Again, they don't need knowledge of the material.

The only difference between an OC-SI and an Isekai, to me, is that the world being inserted in an Isekai is an original world, so that the fic itself is also original and not fanfiction. As far as I can come up with another difference, the ROBs in SIs are typically more out of scope than ROBs in Isekai, though both genres don't require a ROB.

Isekai will usually have a more generic protagonist, to be an audience surrogate, where an SI will typically be less generic and more like the author.

I actually prefer SIs without knowledge of the target universe, because then the fic often reads like time travel fic. That is, both time travel fics and typical SIs feature protagonists that meddle with the original plot, but I don't read SIs for a time travel story. I read SIs for someone with a reader/outside perspective on fictional universe.

For this reason, I like SIs that meddle with plot less, which is why I like fics like Sanitize or Hear the Silence so much. Other fandoms (besides Naruto and maybe Worm) typically have bigger universes, so the authors make up their own plots (Young Justice and Star Wars fics in particular). This means that even if the SI knows a lot about the universe, it's fine anyway. This is primely demonstrated in WTR, which is amazing despite Paul's crazy knowledge of DC and YJ canon.

This also means that I'm more fine to see the plot of those universes messed with, because I haven't been tired out by previous fics messing with their plot. Compare that to Naruto and HP, where I've read enough time travel and/or SIs, so that I really don't care about interfering with canon plot that much.

So yeah. SIs are complex and I have very particular opinions about them.
