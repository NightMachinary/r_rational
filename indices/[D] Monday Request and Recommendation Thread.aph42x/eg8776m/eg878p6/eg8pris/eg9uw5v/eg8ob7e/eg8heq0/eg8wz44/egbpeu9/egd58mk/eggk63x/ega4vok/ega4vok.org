I'd like some recs for One Piece fics that don't just run through the stations of cannon with minor variations.

And for once, I actually have some relevant recs of my own to offer! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1331586/Velkyn-Karma][Velkyn Karma]] has a bunch of quite excellent One Piece fics. Of particular note are:

#+begin_quote
  On this island, it's personal. The inhabitants don't just steal your body; they feed on your dreams.
#+end_quote

The Straw Hats try to figure out how these monsters work while doing their best to avoid being eaten.

#+begin_quote
  Sanji knew how difficult it was to survive the hell that was starvation. What he hadn't expected was that he'd need to get his nakama through it, too.
#+end_quote

The other Straw Hats, largely directed by Sanji, try to help Zoro through the aftermath of starvation. Velkyn seems to have done pretty well on his(?) research here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7614748/1/The-Panaceam-Report][The Panaceam Report]]

#+begin_quote
  Enemies might come and go, but information lasts forever.
#+end_quote

Sequel to Mindshattered. Further explores the aftermath of Zoro's ordeal as he and Sanji are forced to work with the source of it.
