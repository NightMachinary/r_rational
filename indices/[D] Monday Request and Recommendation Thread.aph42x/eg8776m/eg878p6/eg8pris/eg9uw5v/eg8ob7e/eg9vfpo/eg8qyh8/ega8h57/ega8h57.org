You're pretty much right when it comes to the "Only good Xianxia" With the exception of Parts of Issth (Namely Lord fifth Totem arc, Ke Yunhai "A father's love is like a mountain" arc [one of the best arcs in the genre]Planet Feng Family Arc, Nine lives arc[another of the best arcs in the genre], ) and A Will Eternal (unless you don't like the MC, some people don't) which really is more of a parody of the genre and written in more of a comedic style (which is seemingly where wuxia/xianxia makes more sense, as comedy, NOT serious).

​

You'd think I'd include Savage divinity in the "One of the best stories in the genre" list, but fuck no, that book is garbage. The only reason why people like it, is because the MC gets beat down a lot, so that people can point and say "SeE, ToTaLLY N0t WiShFuFilLmenT!1111" except for the fact that the enemies are just all the negative tropes of the "young master, all the way up to old ancestor acting like fucking unrealistic retards" all rolled up into one without the Catharsis of the asshole MC beating the shit out of these fucktards. Rationally, an empire like in the story fill of idiots like this would have fell to demon invasion #123412345123 before the story even started. Then the author himself is so self-rightgeous about it that he doesn't even recognize the flaws(as opposed to WildBlow which is why even though I don't like Worm, I'll recommended it)Fuck that guy.

​

Hell, some people would even argue that the Author doesn't really know HOW people would act in clearly abusive worldy situations. . .like the whole damn world outside of the village. You can break S.D.'s story in 2 minutes, How? After the first "Young Master" arc where he ends up losing an arm and a leg, he would NOT leave the village EVER until he's strong enough to kill any young master plus his clan, plus some old ancestor plus anyone else that would screw with him, thing is, The Author has no idea how to make this interesting, so after TEASING that he was going to do this, the author makes up some silly bullshit (oh he can get a monster heart for his new weapon [something that REALLY ISN'T WORTH DYING OVER {Yes, he and his clan SHOULD have died after that adventure for the heart, but *Muh Plot Arm0ouR* card was activated}]) and his adopted mother was all like "yeah you should go" Then after almost dying again from more stupid world shenanigans, he doesn't even GET the item he almost died for! (Yes I know he go the elixir, but honestly not even close to worth it. AND they should have died. . .if you were being rational) That book pissed me off, I think I got to around chapter 97 before I binned that dumpster fire. Sorely disappointed after all the fan boys jizz all over reddit for that book. Jesus.

If I wanted to see someone get Beat the fuck up by fake assed irrational characters, I'd read 50 shades of Grey.
