Naruto and quality don't mix too well. Maybe I'm just biased by the sheer quantity of trash on fanfiction.net. Some people tried for objective recs over here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-best-damn-fics-youve-ever-read.23098/]]

For ongoing or complete fics, I recommend Vapors, Dreaming of Sunshine, Time Braid, Of the River and the Sea, Dirt and Ashes.

Dirt and Ashes I can upload the ebook if you are interested in grim, absurd and violent.
