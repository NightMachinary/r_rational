Lightbringer by Brent Weeks has manipulators. It's not the focus of the work, but when it comes up the Guile family absolutely earns their name.

Glimwarden by Alexander Wales is unfinished, but has a delightful manipulator as one of the three main characters.

Seconding whywhisperwhy's recommendation of Lies of Locke Lemora.

Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card is at least one of these things, but I will not spoil which. Bean vs Sylvester would be a crossover fic I would love to read though.

The Murders of Molly Southbourne by Tade Thompson is about an experiment with some very weird side effects.

Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes is about an experiment, and one of science fiction's classics.

If we included superhero stories where the main character is an experiment we could be here all day, so I'll just go with Vicious by V.E. Schwab and leave it at that.
