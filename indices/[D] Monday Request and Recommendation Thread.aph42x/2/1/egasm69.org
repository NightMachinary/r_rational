One of my favourite DnD podcasts is Critical Role, which is currently on its second season (same players, but entirely new characters and story). It's slightly more manic and mechanically-focused than TAZ - I know they pretty much abandon combat fairly early one but its still a common feature in CR. Additionally, there's twice as many people involved in CR than TAZ, and I know that put one of my friend's off because they struggled to distinguish voices.

Still, Matt Mercer is a fantastic DM and storyteller, all the players are voice actors who know how to make unique and interesting characters and take the story in fascinating directions. I'd highly recommend it, though I've only regularly watched the second season.
