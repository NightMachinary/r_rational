I don't really have any suggestions for split screen unfortunately.

Action: Left 4 Dead 2 (maybe too scary?)

Vermintide 1/2 - if you want a newer Left 4 Dead

Monster Hunter: World (I haven't played this one, but if a monster hunter game grabs you they're absolutely massive world's)

Survival/Base building: Minecraft (Always highly recommended)

Don't starve together

If you get a PS4 get one of the Just Dance games, even if you don't normally enjoy dancing it's a blast with friends.

I addition to these you could honestly jump into any modern MMO together since they aren't very competitive outside of PvP.
