Just discovered [[https://mangadex.org/title/8466/darwin-s-game][Darwin's game]], which is a relatively standard, but competently done, "Japanese people get pulled into a death game where they're forced to kill each other to win" manga. I wouldn't call it rational, but the characters are neither idiots nor implausibly smart-- the author gives agency to non-MC characters, and while you have your standard Holmes-like "smart" characters that make fairly implausible leaps of logic that turn out to be true, they exist as both allies and enemies.
