The unfortunate running joke of the series is that Rain is some-how got talent less and thinks all his wives has talent, and his wives are jealous of his talent. I have been waiting all these chapters to get some good progression only to find a depression bonanza justified entirely by "The specters are talking mate" and then get layered with "floofs" as a band-aid. I am guessing some other readers messaged him with me when it got out of hand and he goes and makes a flippant comment in the next chapter instead of realizing the over saturation of filler cute nonsense.

I am so tired of this nonsense shit, but I can't stop reading because within that garbage is a story that I got hooked on from the start. I am too invested into this story to back out now, especially because RRL has a tendency to have authors who drop their story outright. I just want to read a finished story man.
