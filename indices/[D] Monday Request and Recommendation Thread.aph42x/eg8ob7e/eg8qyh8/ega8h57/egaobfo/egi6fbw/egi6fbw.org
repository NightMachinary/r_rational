The writing with savage divinity is like a rollercoaster ride and it's been going on a downward slope since last thanksgiving. The OP keystone shit came out of nowhere with no foreshadowing at all and I highly suspect the author only added it in because he is heavily addicted to path of exile. I also started skimming/skipping the MC, Rain, chapters because every time he talk he takes one step forwards and two steps back. There is angst for plot development but there is also angst for being a whiny little bitch and Rain's angst is the latter.
