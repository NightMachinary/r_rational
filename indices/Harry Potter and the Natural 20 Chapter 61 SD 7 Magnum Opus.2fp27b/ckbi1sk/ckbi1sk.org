It seems likely that the various Milo pseudo-relatives will cease to believe that they are his relatives, as I can't think of another reason for the first segment. But what purpose would that serve? Milo seems set to meet Bellatrix fairly soon, and after that he'll probably return to the HP!World, and I can't see the army siding with Bellatrix now her control is broken. Anyone have any ideas?
