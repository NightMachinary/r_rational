D&D Philo stones are one use. You can make a potion of /True Ressurection/ by crushing it up and mixing it with an existing healing potion, or transmute 1000 lbs of lead into 1000lbs of gold.

The ratio in our world is about 20,300:1 Gold:Lead value, so that nets you a mere $20,000,000 US per stone. I can't help but feel that 'bring back the dead, time limit : 200 years' is worth more than that, especially since there are many ways to get more gold, but not a lot to get /true ressurection/.
