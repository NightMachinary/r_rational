The frogs attacking immediately before the boss fight is strange. Ten minutes is roughly forever in sword fighting time, so I don't think this will be a 3 way fight. It feels like this decision is strictly inferior to whichever of 'attack long enough beforehand that you have time to heal up' or 'attack literally during the boss fight' they prefer.

My current guess is that they just attacked as soon as they got here, not caring about the boss fight. They big mad about the first ambush, basically.
