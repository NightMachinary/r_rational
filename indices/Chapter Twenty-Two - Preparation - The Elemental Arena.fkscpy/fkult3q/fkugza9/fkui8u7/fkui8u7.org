Some thoughts:

- Merchants can answer technical questions about the game, albeit with an NP cost after the first few. Maya needs to make a list with the other players present and abuse the heck out of this.

- The first settlement scored every member of species D in the region a + 1 to Earth Affinity. This implies that other Prime skills may have similar rewards.

- By appearances, Nathan's settlement may get hit by a "bonus" Boss, which will spawn to attack the frogmen.

- Additional merchants will probably have a brief Q & A period for players, much like the weapon merchant.

- The ability to sell weapons for NPs is a clear reward for player creativity. It also allows for NP transfer between players, albeit with a significant loss. Since /Equipment Fusion I/ bears some resemblance to /Buildings I/ skill, it looks like there may be a hidden reward for obtaining the third recipe, or perhaps selling a third weapon type to a merchant.
