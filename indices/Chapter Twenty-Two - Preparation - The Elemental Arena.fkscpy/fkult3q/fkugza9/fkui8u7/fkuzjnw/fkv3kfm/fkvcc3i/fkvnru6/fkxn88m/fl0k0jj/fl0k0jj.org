Good point!

/Maps/ can be used to do this as well (have some volunteers move to form simple configurations). The Group function is something that can be used this way as well. Having someone leave a group provides simple binary information (assuming they didn't die). If the nicknames are shared (rather than per player), the players could even update nicknames to text each other.
