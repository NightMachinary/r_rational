So, this weeks [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77tvnc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/doplh1b/][Munchkinry Thread]] got me thinking about a successful world where everyone bodyswaps each day at a certain time. Specifically, what security would be in place to prevent identity theft. I'm going to describe the security system I've designed, and I'd like anyone who's interested to figure out how to steal someone else's identity for longer than a day. Here it is:

 

Like I mentioned in the previous thread, security is currently based on 3 things- what you know (password, verification questions), what you have (badge, phone, key), and what you are (fingerprints, face, etc). Swapping bodies means you're guaranteed to lose what you have and what you are each day, and its easy to steal someone's identity if all you need to do is get a few pieces of info from them. Because of that, my security system will focus on reestablishing security based on what you have and what you are each swap, as quickly as possible and without the possibility of interferance. To do that, you'll need to remember 3 pieces of info- a ID number, password, and security phrase. I'll explain how they're used throughout the explanation.

The system is centered around what I'll call "swapping pods", or "pods" for short. Everyone will be /required/ to enter one of these before the swap. Anyone who isn't in a pod before the swap will be killed, through poison gas or some other method. Because it always happens before the swap, their mind will presumably be permanently killed as well as the body, so not entering a pod actually threatens you.

When you wake up in a pod, you are trapped inside until you go through a few steps. First, you enter your ID number and password. This verifies who you are, letting the system connect you to your previous bodies & activities. The pod takes some sort of biometric verification- DNA, eye scan, fingerprints, etc.- and adds this body to your life history. Then, the pod prints up an ID card that lasts for that day only. This card will be the equivalent of driver's licenses and credit cards today. If you need to prove who you are or pay for something, you use the ID card. If something needs a bit more security, you can enter your ID number on a keypad, similar to entering your PIN today. You don't want people to have your ID number, so you only enter it at those keypads and don't tell people it, but if they get it somehow (fake/unsecure keypad, looking over your shoulder) it's not the end of the world. Your password, on the other hand, you /never/ use except in a pod- it is pretty much your identity.

At this point, you have all 3 facets of security (information, object, and identity) for the day, so the pod will let you out now.

This isn't direcly related to security, but I will point out that the pods would serve other purposes as well. After you verify who you are, they would give you a quick orientation, telling you where you are and what sort of work is available for you to do nearby (customized to your experience). It would also be able to immobilize the person inside; the /only/ way I can see babies surviving and developing in this world, assuming they swap bodies as well, is to keep them in the pods and going through some sort of training program. It almost certainly wouldn't work in real life and has a host of other issues, such as the fact you can't identify the same baby over multiple swaps, making it extremely difficult to know what stage of development they need, but it's the only idea I can come up with.

Back to security. One danger is people making fake pods, tricking other people into revealing their ID and password. That's where the security phrase comes in. When you wake up in a pod, you need to verify it's authentic before giving it your password. To do that, you enter your ID number. The pod will then display a collection of distinct words (no articles, pronouns, etc.), one of which is taken from your security phrase. You pick the one that is, and then it shows several more words, all of which are from your security phrase. If, at any point, you don't see the words you're expecting, you know you're in a fake pod. Sit back and relax, because you're going to waiting the day out until you swap again. This system also lessens the chance that someone can steal someone else's security phrase from a real pod. They need to know the other's ID number, guess the right word, and then they're still only rewarded with a part of the security phrase. People also go through this process when they first get into a pod, to ensure they don't accidentally get into a fake one and then have someone else wake up in it. The process before you swap can be simpler, though, since real pods could check your biometrics and just show you the whole phrase, so both of you completely trust the other.

If someone does manage to steal all 3 pieces of information, you still won't necessarily have lost your identity. If someone tries to use your ID/password, then the system will see 2 people claiming to be the same person. If that happens, it keeps them in the pod until one of them can verify they're the real one. It does this by asking questions about their history- converstions they've had, where they worked, what they bought, etc. These questions would be from multiple days- an identity thief might be able to get the information for 1 day by watching the victim, but they'd have an extremely difficult time doing it over multiple days because they might end up on opposite ends of the world. Once the system is sure which body is the victim and which is the identity thief, it kills the thief and lets the victim go. If the thief has learned so much about the victim that the system can't differentiate between the two, then it flags the identity as being compromised, erasing it and making both people start a new life.

As a side note, the system will also know the identity of the identity thief. After a few minutes, everyone except for the two should have successfully identified themselves. This system can make a list of the identities of everyone who made it to swapping pods before the swap and then remove the identities of everyone who has already identified themselves. This leaves 2 identities- the vicitim and the identity thief.

Finally, the security flaw that hasn't been addressed yet is killing your victim and then stealing their identity. If there's nobody else identifies themselves as the victim, then the identity thief is free to claim their identity. To combat this, the system checks everyone one when they get into a pod. If they don't check in, they should be dead, so they shouldn't check out after the swap- if they do, it's an identity thief. To prevent a thief from waiting until someone enters a pod and checks in to kill them, the pods could monitor their vitals. Again, if someone dies before the swap, they shouldn't identify themselves after the swap.

So, that's the system! Let me know what I've missed, what weaknesses there are that someone could exploit to steal someone else's identity. The one exploit I see is that if you learn enough about them that the system can't figure out which of you is which, you can erase their identity (and yours in the process), but you shouldn't be able to actually benefit from who they are.
