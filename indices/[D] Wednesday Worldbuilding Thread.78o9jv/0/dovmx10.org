You live in a world where people reincarnate after death and have memories of their past lives. Reincarnation is completely random in regards to which baby one is reborn as, and people reincarnate on a first-died, first-born order.

New souls only appear when every other soul is currently alive and thus only when the world-wide population equals or exceeds prior population levels in human history. The interval time period between one's death and rebirth is inversely dependent on the number of world-wide births. So the more births there are, the sooner someone can be reborn.

People can 'permanently' pass on and stop being reborn, but the mechanism is unknown and many people don't believe this is possible.

Everyone is reborn as babies without any knowledge. Memories slowly return over the course of the first five years of life. People don't have any better recall than we do.

What kind of civilization, society, or world do you think will develop out of endlessly reincarnating lives?
