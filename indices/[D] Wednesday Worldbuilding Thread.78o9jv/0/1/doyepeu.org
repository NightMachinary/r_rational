I've put some more brain-time on this:

Professions. People will get /very/ good at what they do. Not just farmers, weavers, and sailors, but soldiers, politicians, and assassins. And some that are world-changing, like mathematicians, scientists, and inventors.

Two phases of civilization: Diaspora and Unification.

During diaspora, it will be impossible to pick up one life where the last left off. You'll be born to a new tribe, probably a meritocracy. Those who bring the most new and useful skills to the tribe attain the most privileged positions. Possibly.

After unification, it's possible to travel the world and see the places you lived in previous lives. You really can bury treasure in one lifetime and dig it up in another. People will sort by generation: those who have been around the longest will have the most skills and be the most valuable to society; and they'll have the means to ensure their dominance.

I think there are a few diaspora era stories worth telling; but there are a whole ton of unification era stories to be told. When you can spend a few dozen lifetimes performing a long running plot, and be around for the payoff...

I'm curious how religion might be shaped in this world. A prophet in one generation should be around in the next, and the next... and a thousand years later might show up in the original society.

Diaspora era news: people sitting around the fire telling each other stories about previous lives. Hearing stories about a place and culture, and then living there in the next life.

Literature: Odysseus, where the hero died, and his reborn self embarks on an adventure around the world to his previous homeland to reunite with his wife.
