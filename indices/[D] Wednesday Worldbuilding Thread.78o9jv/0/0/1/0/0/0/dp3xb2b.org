  Also from a purely pragmatic perspective: keep in mind that the respawn timer is pretty harsh, whatever goals you were pursuing would have to be put on hold for 15-ish years at minimum. Might still be worth it for very long prison sentences or if conditions in prison are really bad, but it's hardly trivial.

It could go either way. 15 years might not be an issue, if one is thinking on very long timescales. Or a 5 year old body might be acceptable. Alternatively, the respawn might have enough inherent risk to be worth putting off until necessary.

Then again, prison might be /really/ bad. Torture, brainwashing, drugs. A committed prison system could do a great deal of psychological damage to a prisoner. Maybe criminals will be better off killing themselves as soon as capture becomes inevitable.

And then there's the whole reincarnation system itself that is ripe for abuse. Imagine a technological civilization where every human is accounted for. The rules for reincarnation have been worked out to the smallest detail. Births and deaths are recorded precisely, so that each and every soul can be tracked perfectly. If the system wants someone /out/, it can make sure they can never hide, will always be identified at birth, and kept in a permanent coma for life. Multiple lives. Or until reformatting is complete.

Or maybe we can start putting people into the matrix. Or is that where they already are, and reincarnation is just the system's way of handling in-system death?
