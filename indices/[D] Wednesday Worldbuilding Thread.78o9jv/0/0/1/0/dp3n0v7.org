  Better question: How do you prevent people from maintaining power and control across generations?
#+end_quote

You don't. I'm curious about the mechanisms used to maintain power, because those will dictate the structure of civilization.

#+begin_quote
  you have to solve it very early in mankind's existence
#+end_quote

No you don't. Since this is the worldbuilding thread and not the munchkinry thread, this is a feature, not a problem. Now, if you want to write a story about overthrowing the system...

  some issues with people attempting to commit suicide in prison
#+end_quote

Some? Just some? A prisoner will have two choices: wait out the sentence, or respawn. Then again, if no one is quite sure whether reincarnation is certain, maybe some people won't be willing to take that chance.

How about this: the 0.01% peddle the myth that the cycle of reincarnations can be broken (by bad behavior, suicide, etc.), while meanwhile munchkining the crap out of the system.
