  Dynasties. How do you maintain power and control across generations?
#+end_quote

Better question: How do you prevent people from maintaining power and control across generations? Our society currently has an emergency mechanism to remove the corrupt from power in that we can just wait for them to literally drop dead. It's a pretty crappy mechanism, but it has save our asses quite a few times over the course of history. If you remove that mechanism, crappy as it is, you'll have to provide some kind of substitute or risk having all power coalesce into the hands of the 0.01%.

It's certainly not an insolvable problem, but in this scenario you have to solve it very early in mankind's existence, when people will be much less well equipped to handle questions like this.

  Criminals. How do you punish someone? While murder may or may not be a serious offence, other things still will be. But the death sentence is kind of like a get-out-of-jail-free card.

There are plenty of countries on the planet that don't use death sentences and the justice system of those countries seems to operate just fine. You might have some issues with people attempting to commit suicide in prison, but that can be accounted for.

Depends a bit on how difficult it will be to keep your previous identities a secret, but I think a bigger problem will be how to give someone a second chance after committing a high profile crime. Would the person being reborn as Hitler ever have a chance at a normal life?
