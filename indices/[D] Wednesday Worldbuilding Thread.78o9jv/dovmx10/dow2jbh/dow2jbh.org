I've actually been toying with exactly this premise for a while now. [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/32615/Youjo_Senki][Because reasons.]] [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/34104/Knights___Magic][And crappier reasons.]] I /really/ want to do something with this idea. I don't have many answers, though. Just lots of questions.

To even begin developing a setting, you have to go back all the way to prehistoric times and build from there. How does society even develop? Do concepts like tribalism and patriotism even make sense? Do people take more risks than otherwise, knowing they'll be reborn? Could that lead to an accidental existence failure for the race as a whole?

How does culture develop when all societies are mingled at an intrinsic level? At what point do people start developing multi-lifetime romances? (Are people reborn as the same gender? Or is that random?)

Languages (spoken and written): Just one? I imagine the first language to develop will immediately disperse throughout the worldwide population. Could there be a mechanism for more languages to develop? Kind of like dialects?

Dynasties. How do you maintain power and control across generations?

Criminals. How do you punish someone? While murder may or may not be a serious offense, other things still will be. But the death sentence is kind of like a get-out-of-jail-free card.

And the big one: Parenting. Are you getting a rookie, a veteran, or a psychopath?
