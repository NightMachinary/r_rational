  No you don't. Since this is the worldbuilding thread and not the munchkinry thread, this is a feature, not a problem.

That's entirely fair, I can see how this would be an interesting setting for a dystopian sci-fi/steampunk/fantasy/whatever story.

  Some? Just some? A prisoner will have two choices: wait out the sentence, or respawn.
#+end_quote

Don't know about this. Committing suicide is a lot harder than a lot of people assume and hanging yourself (the primary way in which prisoners commit suicide in the real world) is particularly unpleasant. I can imagine people shying away from it as long as the prison conditions aren't too brutal, especially if they have gone through the experience before.

Also from a purely pragmatic perspective: keep in mind that the respawn timer is pretty harsh, whatever goals you were pursuing would have to be put on hold for 15-ish years at minimum. Might still be worth it for very long prison sentences or if conditions in prison are really bad, but it's hardly trivial.

I think from the governments perspective, you have two decent options:

1) Keep prison conditions bearable, maximum sentences below 20-25 years and give people a realistic shot at a second chance when their sentence ends. That should be sufficient incentive for most people to just sit out their time.

2) Completely the opposite approach: Create a prison where prisoners are under constant surveillance and/or don't have access to sharp objects or ropes and/or are constantly handcuffed and/or are tied to a bed. Given sufficient technology, you could even just keep them in a coma forever. Now all of those options are a lot more labour intensive than just being the good guys, but they do work even for extremely long sentences and or miserable conditions.

  How about this: the 0.01% peddle the myth that the cycle of reincarnations can be broken (by bad behavior, suicide, etc.), while meanwhile munchkining the crap out of the system.
#+end_quote

Oh, yeah that's a good setup for a story and it comes with the side benefit that if your main characters aren't amongst the 0.01% it saves you a bunch of exposition early on as you can have the reader learn about the rules of the setting alongside the characters.
