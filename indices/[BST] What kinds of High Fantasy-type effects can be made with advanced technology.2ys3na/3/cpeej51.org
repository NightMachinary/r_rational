There are no stars in the night sky. [They're actually still there, just hidden behind a nearly-opaque wall of solar collectors. Optional ring of satellites around the Earth's equator - rings might be a bit of a sci-fi hint.]

There's a known afterlife, you can talk to the people there, and sometimes bring them back. [Automatic uploading of the dead, any who don't choose true death and can't cope with leaving Earth get a virtual afterlife to enjoy.]

Medicinal plants that are far more potent than anything existing today. A properly mixed magic potion can regrow lost limbs. [Genetic engineering and/or nanomagic.]

Sentient animals and humanoids.

Telepathic communication and thought-controlled magic items. Remote viewing.

The aftermath of various poorly-phrased "wishes" or favours granted by powerful entities - unageing children who wished for eternal youth, monsters that will first interrogate you to determine if you could be an enemy of their master, whatever the hell the result is of someone saying "I wish the events of the last three days had never happened!", things like that.
