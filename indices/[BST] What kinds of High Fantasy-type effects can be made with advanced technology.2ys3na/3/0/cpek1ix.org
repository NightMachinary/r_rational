  The aftermath of various poorly-phrased "wishes" or favours granted by powerful entities - unageing children who wished for eternal youth, monsters that will first interrogate you to determine if you could be an enemy of their master, whatever the hell the result is of someone saying "I wish the events of the last three days had never happened!", things like that.

Nah. The Powers That Be don't allow that kind of thing. They actually quite fully understand what you're asking for when you pray to them, but they really don't like being called-on as gods, so they'll tend to answer prayers in a way that /does/ fulfill anything genuinely good in the prayer/request/wish, while also seriously trolling the person who thought to just /ask for stuff/ instead of accomplishing things for themselves.
