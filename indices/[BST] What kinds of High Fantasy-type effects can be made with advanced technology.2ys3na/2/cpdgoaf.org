well this really really reminds me of the tabletop rpg [[http://www.numenera.com/what-is-numenera/][Numenera]] only it's not 80yrs after singularity but a couple decades after the 8th!! singularity. its great to play and though it feels like a typical medieval setting the wizards are called nanos and get their power by interfacing (either by genetic luck or careful study) to the pervasive machinery that lies dormant in the planet, many enemies are clearly the result of biotech or something more esoteric, and fighters can get armor and weapons from iron, steel or impossible to duplicate ceramic and plastics (not that they know those terms) if you want to read some of it (i'd recomend the magic item list) here's the corebook [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/4hvcbl27eyfisw3/Numenera%20Corebook.pdf?dl=0]]
