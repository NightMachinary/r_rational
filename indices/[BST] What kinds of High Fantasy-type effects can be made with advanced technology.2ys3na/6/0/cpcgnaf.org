  Suitable effects might include explosions. Medical cures for thought-fatal/incurable conditions/diseases.

I think weaponry and medicine are too firmly classified as "technology" in the public mind for these to work. Anthropologically, I can't think how even a /really/ backwards society will have regressed /so/ far into ignorance by the 22nd century that they won't remember there was ever any such thing as a bomb or a surgical implant.

Ok, the /really/ rural, backwards, religious-fundamentalist /nutjobs/, the people who are considered insane even by a backwards society, might not remember those things. But the early-industrial sections of society will plainly remember that, once upon a time, there were such things as technological means of fighting and healing.

  Voice projection.

But remembering how theatrical special-effects work is done is harder!

  Summoning the sun during the night.

A sufficiently large ball of plasma in LOE would accomplish this. Very nice. It'll be a nice way to signal that Shit Just Got Real, as the /powerful people/ have just arrived and decided to announce themselves.

  Appearing to survive or shrug off mortal blows/wounds. Mass teleportation. Extreme strength. Armor or weapons of glowing light.
#+end_quote

Other than teleportation, which is known-impossible, these are all good suggestions. Advanced materials science could give armor or weapons that look cool and/or provide protection/striking power well into the fantastical. Sufficiently small computers and nervous-system interfaces could make /talking/ armor and weapons, that can possibly even "guide the hand" the way a magic sword might be supposed to do.

I think I might even have once seen a science publicity article about a material that looked like a lightsaber.

  Hovering in the air.
#+end_quote

That's a bit harder to actually accomplish, rather than to fake with various arrangements of steel cables.

#+begin_quote
  Fogs, mists, miasmas, and the clouding of minds. The appearance of weather control.
#+end_quote

Very good suggestions, especially for the sorts of things that make a Forbidden Zone or an Ancient Artifact. Dealing with climate/weather problems caused by malfunctioning "magic" that turns out to be geoengineering would work very well as a subplot.

#+begin_quote
  Basically, anything that traditional pantheons and heroes have been credited with. "And he stood him in the bow of the ship, and spake with a great voice, and the very walls of the city trembled and fell at his word." That sort of thing.

Voice-activated ultra-high-tech works well here.

Thanks!
