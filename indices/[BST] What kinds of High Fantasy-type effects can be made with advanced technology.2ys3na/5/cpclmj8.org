Have you looked into nanotechnology? Eric drexlers "machines of creation" or if you want a really good fictional account thats still absolutely physically possible in a high tech scenario look at neal stephensons "diamond age".

Basically, if you have mature nanotech, ... a lot goes. A book of nanostuff, contains an entire interactive wikipedia/learning programms, freefloating nanites in the air can have an area-denying effect (think fog of death), enormous energy density and low weight/high strenght materials allow for all manners of small, intelligent drones. That same level on nanotech if used on the body allows telepathy, vampire-like immunity to damage etc etc. Normal looking swords that are nano-chainsaws and go trough everything- the limit imposed by physics is sky-high. To give an analogy: right now in computer/chip-manufacturing we are in the range of double-digit (10-99) nanometre tech; and you could blow ANYONES mind with what you can do with that level computer technology. The processor in any PC or smartphone is the smallest tiny thing! Take your average smartphone. Most of the space in it is battery+frame+display. Now take it ten, twenty steps further; you have single digit nanometre tech, and not just for CPUs, but also for all the accompanying electronics, capacitors, resistors, the battery itself, the display, the frame- you have a tiny razor, light as a feather, running time in terms of weeks, hundreds of times more power than the laptop you or I am writing on right now, dozens, hundreds of sensors...
