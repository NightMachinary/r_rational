  That same level on nanotech if used on the body allows ... vampire-like immunity to damage etc etc.

It's fun to read through the D&D spell list for everything that mentions "undead", and think "how are nanites being used to accomplish this." It actually makes some thematic bits make more sense, too; the ability of undead to be universally "turned" only really makes sense if the nanites used are all a sort of lost tech that can't be upgraded, and has known backdoors for other magic-users to crack.

It also makes "lich" just another word for "transhuman." :)
