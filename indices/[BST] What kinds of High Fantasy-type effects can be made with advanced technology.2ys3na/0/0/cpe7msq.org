That reminds me: is there a setting that seems to be fantasy, with "spirits" that appear from nowhere, cause great effects, and then disappear as if they were never there... but where that all just turns out to be a precursor race who uploaded themselves millions of years ago to some computronium mesh riddled through the planet, and are now temporarily re-instantiating themselves within the "material plane" using nanodrones and projections and so forth in order to help out their successors? Like a more elegant version of the robotic excursion bodies in /Diaspora/.
