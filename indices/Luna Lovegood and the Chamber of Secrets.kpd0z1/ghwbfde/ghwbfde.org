This is a fanfiction of [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]. The pace is quick, not lingering on details or fleshing things out when there's plot to advance. This style leads to a few moments of confusion, where a new element is introduced without much or any build up, but overall it seems quite fitting when considering the protagonist.
