Grownups always forget.

I'd imagine this version of Harry, for /reasons/, would begin to think of his time with Mary Poppins as a series of half-forgotten dreams within 12 hours of her departure. I scoured the text of HPMOR, and as long as Harry either doesn't remember it or only has fuzzy memories that he never thinks about (because why would you go around thinking about a weird dream you had one time four years ago?) then there's nothing about it which precludes compatibility with HPMOR canon.
