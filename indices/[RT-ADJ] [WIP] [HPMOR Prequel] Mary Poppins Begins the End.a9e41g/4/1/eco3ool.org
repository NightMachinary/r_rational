Also, Oxford's average house prices are 11 times higher than the salaries of the people who work in the city. The location(s) I modeled "Number 11" off of were 2 bedroom homes of probably less than a thousand sq feet and they were like Â£350,000. It had to be done that way because EY modeled the Verres house as a detached house and most housing in Oxford is flats and, like, houses that are connected to each other like a townhome but not, idk what they're called. There aren't a lot of /house/ houses available, and the ones that aren't big and fancy are all in the poorer areas of the city. He said they live in a small house, and the small houses are where the small houses are, so I put them in Cowley.
