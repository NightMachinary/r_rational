Honestly its not that complicated at all, the site has a list of rules which are fairly simple in practice. A few tips for the road from someone who's won 2/3 games he's played:

1) Try to get a tech trading agreement for every technology (aside from the one you are researching). This assures you will never fall behind in any technology, and be ahead of most people.

2) Try to talk to any be friends with everyone even if you are planning on murdering them next. It minimizes the chance of you being attacked and maximizes the chances of your attack succeeding due to them being unprepared.

3) Expand. If you sit there doing nothing you will 100% lose to the person that does expand faster then you. Thus you pretty much always want to be either expanding or planning an expansion (eg. moving your ships into position just outside their radar range, waiting for them to be attacked be someone else so you can move in and kill them).

4) Don't hesitate to backstab people if needed. There can only be one winner, and if you don't exploit all the chances open to you it probably won't be you.

5) Keep your economy strong and don't put all your money into ships/research, otherwise you will fall behind over time due to being poor. I don't remember the exact ratio since its been ages, but you probably want it equal or even better to your ships.

6) Most importantly, check the game as much as possible. All else being equal if you check it every hour you will slaughter someone that checks it every 8 and it is often the difference between defending from an attack perfectly and getting slaughtered.

tl;dr: Tech trade up the wazoo, be friends with everyone, expand, ruthlessly murder your friends, invest in economy, check the game as much as possible.
