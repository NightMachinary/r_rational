[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Trilogy][The Empire Trilogy]] is my go-to recommendation for this kind of thing. It is part of the larger Riftwar Cycle, but occurs on another planet, so you don't need to read any of the other books. Set in a fantasy empire inspired by Ancient China and Japan, Mara of the Acoma has to rebuild her family's fortune. Which she does mainly through alliances and posturing rather than actual battle.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(novel][Shogun]]) (which is almost certainly an inspiration for the above), set at the end of the Japanese Sengoku Jidai period has a similar feel, but as our point-of-view character is a foreigner, we just see the edges of the conflict, so I prefer the Empire Trilogy.
