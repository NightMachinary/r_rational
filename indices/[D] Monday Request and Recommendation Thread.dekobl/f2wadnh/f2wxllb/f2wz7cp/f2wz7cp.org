My favorite thing was the breadth. The first book was okay, but as the series continued it opened up a ton more, and the feeling of progression, from when you meet the first underlord and he's so above everyone else, to when basically everyone is an underlord and they're fodder. You are shown so many different paths and fight strategies, and so many odd characters. Along with the personalities associated with the vague powersets and tropes you saw when Suriel showed Lindon the Monarchs(those insanely powerful people she said could save the valley). Also while the individual characters are good but not great, the dynamics between them are fantastic. Also, the character motivations make genuine sense, based on their pasts, and the antagonists are very rarely portrayed as genuinely evil, and the grief of those around them is shown if they die.

I could ramble on and on, all I can say is it's very solid. Wouldn't say it does a certain thing in a revolutionary way, but it does everything very well.

Did you have any particular issues with it?
