See it's hard to take your criticisms seriously when I can clearly tell you haven't read many litRPGs..

Litrpgs are generally just fantasy stories with an RPG layer on top, i.e a system, stats, and experience etc. It rarely if ever means VRMMO, or that it's a game. That's rarely the case and or a completely different genre.

I thought you'd make good suggestions, but instead what I got was just a "I don't read that because I think it's bad and generic suggestions that would fit if these stories were the way I think they are". Good thing I didn't give examples so I was able to catch you.
