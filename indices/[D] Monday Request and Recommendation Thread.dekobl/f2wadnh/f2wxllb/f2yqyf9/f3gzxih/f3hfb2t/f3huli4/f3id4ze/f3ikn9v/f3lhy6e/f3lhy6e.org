Grinding fights actually make sense in the frame of a level-up conflict-oriented RPG. Rather the problem is a mix of: the stories lacking any direction outside of dangling the carrot of one day having enough power to matter, dull or nonexistent character development arcs, tying the reader's dopamine rush to leveling up or stat boxes instead of interesting character/plot moments.

I think the mass market litRPG formula caters to a junk food mentality but litRPG itself has more potential than that. For a start, I'd prefer stories prioritizing the /RP/ part of RPG: better dialogue, better plot hooks (than the usual revenge or sob story), more immersion into the game world and what makes it real. But there's also many angles to play and worldbuilding questions to answer when you dump a human being into a game (simulation?). Why does the game exist? If the gamer lives in the real world but spends all their time in the VR, how is society built around this (assuming the game has made it big)? What's the end-game and is it meaningful?
