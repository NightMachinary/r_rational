More disappointed than anything really. And from your comment it did sound like you've not actually read many of them. There's a reason people want reviewers to have read the entire thing, or at least enough of it, before reviewing it..

Also apparently my paraphrased interpretation of your comment sounded more aggressive than I meant it to, my bad.

I was more interested in what you'd suggest instead of focusing on fighting for fighting sake or other meaningless goals. What you said was: "focus on character, dialogue and worldbuilding".

Very generic and not really what I was interested in, but it's partially my fault, I was intentionally vague.

I'd have suggested character goals like: decrease suffering, make world better, build organizations that will continue your humanitarian efforts after you're gone, and have a story with an end in sight instead of an infinite journey..
