That's fair, and the scale is amazing, but the style frustrates me. Whenever I get invested in a character, we don't see more of them, and most of the book is spent telling us how powerful and cool people are, rather than them actually doing anything to achieve that. I will admit that Ganoes has some progression, along with both of his sisters, and the younger sister's arc was one of my favorite things, besides the trail of dogs or whatever it was called.
