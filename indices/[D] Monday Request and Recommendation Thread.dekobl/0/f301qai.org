Discovered Royal Road and am having my heart repeatedly broken by starting great stories and then finding they aren't finished yet. The ones I read that are actually good are /The Salamanders/ (not rational fic but great characterization and magic system) /Mother of Learning/, and /Eight/. (The last isn't rationalist but has an unusually practical protagonist). Started an awful lot of drivel before I found those gems.

Really looking for more protagonists that are pragmatic. Too many portal fantasy feature characters that are sucked into another world and instantly shout "Wee!" and dive into a deadly Dungeon full of Monsters. Or decide to Conquer the World or Become the Strongest in the World. Cultivation novels and urban fantasy seem to make a point of having the hero mouth off to stupidly powerful people or monsters. I know I'm supposed to be impressed with how they stick to their guns but I just think "You're an idiot".

What books are out there where the protagonist is..pragmatic? Picks attainable goals, doesn't behave recklessly, sucks up to the powerful when necessary?Now, "pragmatic" doesn't necessarily mean evil...I've asked this question elsewhere and got a plethora of villain protagonist suggestions. This is related to but not identical to "rationalist" as this community seems to define it. Some rationalist fiction features heroes that introduce rationalist scientific ideas to fantasy worlds, but some of those feature megalomaniacal and reckless characters who preach the idea of rationality.

Oh...English language fiction. I've learned I have to specify that now...I find most Japanese translations I find online unreadable.
