[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/rmji][Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality]] has a cautious and pragmatic protagonist. The series is a slow build but the protagonist is very careful not to get involved in conflicts without a reason and to only start fights with overdetermined outcomes given how unpredictable xiaxia combat is unless the benefit is worth the risk. Longer review [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cdil1f/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/etu93h6/][here]].
