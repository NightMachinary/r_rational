DO NOT READ GHOUSTHOUND. Novel is dogshit, characters start as assholish caricatures, who grow out of it either off screen, not at all, over the course of 100 chapters only to revert back.

The main character is a godlike entity who only bothers to fight effectively when fighting someone who EVAPORATES FUCKING LAVA. He is able to fight off entities that span the universe with his will alone, a will that was largely given to him BY THE SAME ENTITY.

There is no struggle in the story, only the main character fucking up repeatedly then ex machina-ing a solution.

Did I mention that a running theme is that it's okay to be abused, and that you shouldn't help others with their problems? The main character is the victim of that abuse btw, so you get to read all the justifications for it over and over and over and over and over...

That's not even getting into character motivations, system mechanics, consistent power, consistent characters, believable characters, world building, or general readability.
