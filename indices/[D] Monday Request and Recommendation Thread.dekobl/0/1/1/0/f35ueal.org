While I don't think eye protection specifically ever gets addressed, generally they do take it seriously. The jokes don't really stop, but humour and seriousness are not mutually exclusive imo. I would recommend giving it another go. Overall, they definitely /do not/ treat it like a game.

I had the same problem with The Silver Mana, but the idea of a mass isekai is too appealing for to me drop it without something more egregious. Do you perhaps have any recommendations for mass isekai? Preferably not just with a bunch of teenagers, but that's still ok.
