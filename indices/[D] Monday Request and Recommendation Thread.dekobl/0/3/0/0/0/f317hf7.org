The thread for Forge of Destiny is here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/]] The sequel, Threads of Destiny, is here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threads-of-destiny-eastern-fantasy-sequel-to-forge-of-destiny.51431/]]

It's a Quest in a xianxia setting. Apparently the version on Royal Road is being rewritten somewhat, as opposed to just removing the voting parts.
