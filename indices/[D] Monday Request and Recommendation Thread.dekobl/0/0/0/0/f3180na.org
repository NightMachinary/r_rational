I personally find the relentless path of self-improvement to be interesting, in that where other genres and settings have caveats to such, xianxia doubles down on it. It's all the horrible trappings that come with it that I'm less a fan of - some make sense as being derived from a society where "Might makes Right" is more or less a physical law, but some's just pretty gnarly. As you say, IRL such attitudes are pretty damn fascist.

Some of it might just be the worldview of the culture it's from - I don't know much about Chinese cultural views, but my experience with them in professional settings is that cutthroat ruthlessness is pretty much expected over there.
