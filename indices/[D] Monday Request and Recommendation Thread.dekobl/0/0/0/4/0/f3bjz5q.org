No. Quite the opposite. That's not one of the fascist tendencies they have.

They come out as vaguely fascist to me because people influenced by fascism and lots of tin-pot dictators often talk a lot about "strength" as the be-all end all. If anything cultivation novels seem more like Hitler's brand of fascism with it's obsession with strong Aryan supermen, but I'm hesitant to make that comparison because the whole racism and genocide thing tends to overshadow everything else about Hitler.

It might be more precise to say it is vaguely Nietzschesque in it's obsession with individual strength and ruthlessness, and I tend to associate people getting over-emotional about over-simplified versions of Nietzsche's philosophies with crypto fascists.
