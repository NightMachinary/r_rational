That's unusual. Usually there is lots of kung fu fighting, martial arts tournaments, vendettas with spoiled nobles. The "Every Man For Himself" part is typical.

Generally I just don't care. A magic system where the only "magic" is improved karate chops and the prize at the end is to be the the baddest dog in the junkyard (and even that prize is a perpetually receding mirage).

I'm totally into books where the character improves himself...but just improving his physical strength isn't a kind of improvement I can get excited about.
