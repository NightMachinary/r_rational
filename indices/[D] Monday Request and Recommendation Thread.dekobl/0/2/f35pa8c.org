  Oh...English language fiction. I've learned I have to specify that now...I find most Japanese translations I find online unreadable.

I agree with you on the Japanese (and Korean, and Chinese) stories largely being lacking when it comes to translating, but it's amazing how many English series I've found that would benefit from a brief spellcheck. There are so many syntax and grammar problems in what would otherwise be an enjoyable series that it really becomes a headache to continue.

Anyways, I think you might like /Eight/, which is about a guy who is transported/reincarnates into another world. He tries to make it to a city, but the guards think he's a monster and drive him off, so he ends up living in the wilderness and has to start from scratch, making flint tools, figuring out how to start a fire and hunt. He also lives with a magic otter that's pretty cool.

/RE: Trailer Trash/ is also worth a read. It's about an old woman who gets transported back to her past teenage self. She doesn't have any magic powers or anything. Her main goal is to improve her life, given that she currently lives in a trailer park. It's harder than you'd think as the only real asset she has is future knowledge but no spare cash, rich friends, hidden treasures, just herself and what she can push herself to do.
