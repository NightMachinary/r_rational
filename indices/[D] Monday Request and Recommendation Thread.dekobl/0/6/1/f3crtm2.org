Seconding re: Trailer Trash. Its a peggy sue story, technically, but that is /not/ the advantage the main character is exploiting. -She honestly cant remember the news from when she was fifteen the first time around all that well, and the model of time travel is decidedly not on rails, butterfly effects are going to completely derail the history she does recall well far before she gets that far along.

Instead, it appears that time travel surgically removes all akrasia. Shonen Jump protagonists would be intimidated by the determination of the protag to "Do Better". This is just a delight to read.
