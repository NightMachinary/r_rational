The most brilliantly evil yet still likeable main character I've ever read was [[https://soundcloud.com/professorcrispy/wormilton-opening-number][Twig]]'s Sylvester. Raised on a regime of drugs that keep his brain malleable, trained together with a group of children, molding himself into a master social manipulator, used by the British Crown as state-sponsored terrorists. Twig is the coming-of-age story of these kids, all of whom are experiments of an amoral Academy.
