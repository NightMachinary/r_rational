It looks like these were done with deepart.io? If it's something like that, you could try style transfer from a more "logo-like" logo (smooth lines, few details), particularly on pre-processed images that just contain cat, and see if that works.

On the object level, I liked 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
