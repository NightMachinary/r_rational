No particular issue really i just have hard time getting into cultivation stories sometimes. Cant really pinpoint why that is. Weirdly the same thing goes for anime where they shout their attacks out loud even though the exact same thing in a Practical Guide to Evil feels bad ass to me. I can't really articulate why.
