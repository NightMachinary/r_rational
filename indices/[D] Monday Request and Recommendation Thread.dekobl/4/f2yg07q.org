_Hamilton_ was much, much, MUCH better than I expected. I, too, would have trouble explaining why without writing a much longer essay - there's just a lot of little and medium-sized things that it gets right, and refuses to do wrong. And I speak as somebody who couldn't even make out half the lyrics; my hearing is not that great without subtitles. It was /still/ that good.
