So this would be better suited for the Friday Open Thread, but Friday is the day I need this done by and it is a request for recommendations, of a sort, so I'm putting it here. Sorry! It has to do with Bayes and multimedia, so it kinda fits ;]

In short, I've recently been tasked with leading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/da1pda/d_friday_open_thread/f1mygbs/][a group on Bayesian stats]] and want my cat to be its mascot [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/cbffha/wellness_wednesday_thread_for_july_10_2019/etfr6ot/][for obvious reasons]].

To that end, I've run his face through one of many neural algorithms for artistic style transfer to get a feel for what sorts of stylized, abstracted possibilities best suit him.

Which of these styles do you like the most? [[https://imgur.com/a/ubaYqsM/]]

I'd probably be cutting his face out, or maybe his face and forepaws that they might luxuriously drape over the P in P(Î˜|X) or something. Maybe rustle up some versions of him in profile walking or something. I'd also do some smart upscaling and color editing, etc.

Thank you for any suggestions!
