Eh, humour is fine, it just seemed to me like they were making the same mistakes over and over. Like, how many times do you split up the party to cover more ground before you realize it's not a great idea? I don't know, maybe I'll give it another shot later, but for now it's low on my list of things to read.

Anyways, for mass isekai, do you mean a party transported to another world with one main character, or several main characters transported to another world?

There's /Epilogue/ which is like a reverse-isekai - a bunch of teenagers were transported to another wold, fought evil, then came back after a few decades. Though they came back at the point they left, so they're physically teenager despite all the years that passed.

Maybe /Legend of Randidly Ghosthound/ (yes, the name is weird, but you get used to it after a hundred chapters or so), which is more of a "system transforms earth" story but given that earth's not really earth anymore but a mashed up planet connected to a multiverse it might as well be a new dimension. It's a LitRPG but pretty well written, though it leans heavily on the "MC getting a lucky break early on that makes him stronger and edgier than everyone else" trope.

There's /Displaced/ which has several characters transported to another world and getting superpowers. It's pretty good, though the author made the mistake of having the first dozen of so chapters be only about one guy, so it skewed the series to seem like he was the only MC until we got some new POV characters. The characters are eccentric (and that's a nice way of putting it), but not in the "that's hard to believe, people don't act like that" sense, more like "well he/she became a fascist/mass murderer pretty quick."
