I forgot the most obvious recommendation - /The Wandering Inn/. If you haven't read it/heard of it, it's about a group of people (not teenagers, but young, around 20 years old I think) who are transported to a world with magic. There are two main characters, Erin, who makes her home in an abandoned inn (where the story gets its name) and Ryoka, and girl who was good at track and takes a job as a Runner (essentially a mailwoman).

It's well-written, grammatically and in terms of character development, plot and worldbuilding. The story is updated regularly - though the author is on break at the moment it started in 2017, so there's almost three years of chapters to go through - and is on its sixth book.

There's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WanderingInn/][subreddit]] if you want to check it out a bit more as well.
