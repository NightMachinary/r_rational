The Daily Grind is fantastic. It was completed a while ago and now it's started up again with a sequel. Probably the most realistic rendition of the idea of a "dungeon" I've ever seen. Really good stuff.

He Who Fights With Monsters is good. Dungeon Engineer is good. Delve is fine. The Silver Mana is good. Undermind is great. Metal and Magic is great. None of these are finished, though - but they are regularly updating.

Zombie's Journey is complete, and pretty good. Intelligent zombie protagonist, still a man eating zombie.
