Web novels have no editors, and it shows. There are also some writers I'm convinced are imitating badly translated Japanese Isekai, treating awkwardly translated idioms as intentional details to be immitated. And I don't really like it when a novel goes "HAHAHAHA".

I'm reading /Eight/ and love it. I like that the hero has some sense of the risks and is trying to minimize them. I also like he retains his memories of his old life and they are plot relevant. A lot of authors on Royal Road have the protagonist lose his memories of our world...which defeats the whole point of having him come from our world, and often makes them rather flat. It's a bonus that he's not another sad sack loner gamer. And I think the author gets the degree of starting advantage to give the hero just right.
