All the recommendations are on Royal Road. Displaced is by IrateRapScallion.

Worth the Candle gets significantly less dark as the characters progress, June doesn't stay a mopey mess either.

I should warn you that Displaced can get a bit dark as well. It's about a Medival era world, being brought forward by modern morals and it sticks to that.
