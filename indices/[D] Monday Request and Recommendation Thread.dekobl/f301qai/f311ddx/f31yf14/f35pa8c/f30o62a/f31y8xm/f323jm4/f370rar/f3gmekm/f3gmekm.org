  2) Delve is what would happen if a munchkin went to a fantasy world. The characters are alright but not really THE focus. A lot of numbers, and a book smart protagonist.

I wouldn't call Rain a munchkin. His build is the most straight forward build of all: Just auras and metamagic feats that work on Auras. Rain's just obsessed with calculating every detail of the system.

I would call it a rational build though. Rain doesn't have system knowledge or the time/money to get some. So he picks a straight forward build.

He desperately needs help in this new world, so he picks a support build.
