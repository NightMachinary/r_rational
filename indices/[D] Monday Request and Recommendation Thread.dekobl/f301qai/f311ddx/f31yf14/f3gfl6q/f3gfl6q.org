Your likes seem to align with mine so I'd better give Undermind and the Silver Mana a try. Looks like Undermind isn't a dungeon core, honestly I'm surprised with that name.

I'd say Delve is one of the best of the best on Royal Road. The Daily Grind, loved the world building of the dungeon but wasn't too keen on the charachters. I prefer the author's other fic: Draw of the Unknown.

He Who Fights With Monsters; I can see the quality in the fic. I really want to like it. But the way he just grabbed the first set of essences without even considering alternatives, a lifepath, or synergy with his racial abilities just /really/ bugged me.
