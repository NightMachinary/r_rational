I really like /He Who Fights with Monsters/. The world building is good, the characters are fun, and Jason actually is starting to grow as a character.

I started /The Silver Mana/ - it's okay, but the idea that the MC is just so stubborn he manages to break some god-like security system by smashing it because he was told he couldn't get silver and gold mana rubbed me the wrong way. The dialog feels a bit stilted too, in part because the author doesn't use conjunctions, but also because they talk way too formally when they should basically be panicking.

I actually dropped /The Daily Grind/, which is a shame because I started out really liking it, because the MC seems to refuse to take the danger seriously and treats the whole thing like a game. He has a near death experience and goes "wow, that almost took my head off. I need to prepare better and take this seriously" and then next week we're back to him joking about some new creature's name and the sweet loot they're going to get while treating the office-maze like a game.

For example, after he did a few dungeon runs and started to get better gear, including body armor, I kept waiting for him to get some proper head protection, especially for his eye. Seriously, he has the cash, get some ski goggles or safety glasses or something. If you get a stapler in your hand of even face, you can walk that off. Get one in your eye and you're screwed. He never did, and would't you know it someone shoot pencil shavings or something in his face, blinding him. he manages to survive, and still doesn't get eye protection when he goes back!
