  If you're in a life or death situation and you're offered superpowers, I don't think you're gonna go "Hmm maybe not, it doesn't match my build".

Oh I wasn't talking about the first essence but the next two after he was safe.

That said the way the first was handled could be better. The where the MC accuses the system of trying to force him to the dark side then does it anyway. It all worked out, but it didn't feel like he thoght it through and came to a conclusion; rather it felt like he thought it through, came to a conclusion, then did the opposite.

Just a bit of clunky dialogue.
