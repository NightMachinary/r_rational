Yeah, Undermind isn't a dungeon core story. It's actually really unique. Re:He Who Fights With Monsters honestly I think what happened is perfectly fine. If you're in a life or death situation and you're offered superpowers, I don't think you're gonna go "Hmm maybe not, it doesn't match my build". You're going to go "Is there a massive downside? Probably not? Okay, lay it on me.".

The Silver Mana is interesting to me because of the mass isekai premise, that isn't just a bunch of young adults. Re:Draw of the Unknown, I checked the description and it doesn't really grab me, maybe you could give a longer rec?
