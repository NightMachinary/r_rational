Devourer of Destiny was the pinnacle of cultivation novels, but it author took it down because they were getting too much shit for â€˜only' releasing once a day. Too much as in having dozens of people ordering them to write more, despite it being free. The main character was the old guy in the ring, using the people he taught to rise in power. Very much evil protagonist, but damn if it wasn't a good character. The PDF still exists somewhere, but the story is dead.

Journey of an Old Dreamer is a cultivation novel where the protagonist is actually moral. As in modern day morals, and not stupid as a brick. I lost interest in it, but I think it's still being written.

Cultivating Civilization was about a military guy who got sent to a cultivation world. No talent, no resources, no special powers. Builds his own army, and tries to strip the mysticism from cultivation. Was really great, but the author stopped writing. I think it was because of their reader's disappointment when the main character didn't suddenly become a god.

I Think cultivation novels are always going to be trash, not because they can't be done well, but because their community is going to ruin it.
