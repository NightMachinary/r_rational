  Cultivation novels and urban fantasy seem to make a point of having the hero mouth off to stupidly powerful people or monsters. I know I'm supposed to be impressed with how they stick to their guns but I just think "You're an idiot".

You know, I was just thinking the other day that it could be interesting to see a Cultivation novel that really addresses this. It almost feels like by following their daos relentlessly and allowing no doubt, they're trading physical and spiritual strength for mental weakness. For any such setting to make sense, it has to be a genuine advantage - people who don't recklessly act like idiots genuinely can't progress.

So, what if you had a protagonist who tried to deal with this? Rather than having a secret bloodline or a ghost mentor hidden in a ring, they could have some spell or ability to temporarily make themselves just as foolhardy and reckless as everyone else, that's generally unknown because everyone with "authority" in the setting who comes across it sees it as a crutch that could only hold the user back - improbable in the real world, but less so in a setting that actively rewards pigheadedness.

You'd have a character who'd act rationally and try to put themselves in the best possible position, like any smart person... who then has to flip a switch to cultivate and fight, and pray they don't do anything too stupid before they turn it off.

As for your actual request... I've found Super Minion to be pretty great, along with RE: Trailer Trash. The former's set in a world opf superpowers, and is pretty great - the latter is more of a real-life Peggy Sue.
