Ah, I see. So "individual strength and will over all else", right? If so, then the fascist ideology had some similarities -- "quality rather than quantity" and "the mightiest because the most ethical, the most coherent, the truest", to quote the same article -- but the context was different. Fascism valued "quality" and "mightiest" individuals because they were supposed to form the elite of the state and of the nation, which were seen as the pinnacle of human existence. In that they were similar to other "vanguard" movements of the 20th century, which valued individual strength only in the service of a "vanguard party", which, in turn, served a higher goal, be it race, nation or class. They had no use for a purely individualistic philosophy.
