I tried a cultivation novel a few weeks ago, and it was just so... dry. The protagonist just sat in a room meditating and reached various stages of cultivation or whatever, and the story let us know that this was supposed to be impressive, but just... ugh. I had absolutely /no/ emotional connection to this style of progression.

Anyway, your comment made me realize another problem I had with it: it was just /so/ every-person-for-themself, which just made me hate all the characters. If it's just going to be a power fantasy it should at least have wish fulfillment, right? But I got no enjoyment imagining myself in this place with those people. I wonder if this is endemic to the genre.
