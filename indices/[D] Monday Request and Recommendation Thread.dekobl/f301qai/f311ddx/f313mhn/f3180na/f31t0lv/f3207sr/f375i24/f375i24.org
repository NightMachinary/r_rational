Some of them aren't that dry, they spice it up with rape and torture. Usually it's the main character doing it as â€˜righteous retribution'. Slaughter and genocide are pretty common themes once the characters can.

As someone who spent far too much time on them, I can say that yes it being boring is endemic. It also marks those stories as the good ones.
