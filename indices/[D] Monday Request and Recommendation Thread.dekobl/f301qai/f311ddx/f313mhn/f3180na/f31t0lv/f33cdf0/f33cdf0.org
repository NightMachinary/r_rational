I'll second [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][Street Cultivation]] as a worthwhile read with a sane cultivator protagonist.

I bought the book after reading the sample chapters and wasn't disappointed. As a bonus, she's just starting to release the second book. Same as the first one, all of the chapters will be available on Royal Road first before the book is published by amazon, at which point only the sample chapters will remain.
