Well, there is probably a difference between what drove the people who:

- risked their lives during the early stages of a popular movement, in this case the low level civil war which various Italian nationalist groups, including fascists, fought against proto-communists in 1919-1920
- were in power during the heyday of the regime
- lived generations later and got to pick and choose ideas and slogans from the distant past at a local bar

In any case, thanks for the info about cultivation novels!
