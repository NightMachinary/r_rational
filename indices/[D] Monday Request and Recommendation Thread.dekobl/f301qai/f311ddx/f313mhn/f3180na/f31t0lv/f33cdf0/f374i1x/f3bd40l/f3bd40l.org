  I have many beefs with Cultivation novels. I have serious beefs with the 'Grow Strong Enough No One Can Ever Hurt Me" mantra in many of them. Always comes off vaguely fascist to me.

I haven't been able to get into cultivation novels except by proxy (/Cradle/), so I am curious: do they emphasize the importance of the state the way fascists did? To [[http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm][quote Mussolini]]:

  Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with those of the State ... The Fascist conception of the State is all embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. ... the Fascist State - a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values - interprets, develops, and potentates the whole life of a people.
