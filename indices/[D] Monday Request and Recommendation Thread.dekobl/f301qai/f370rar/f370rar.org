Ordered by my enjoyment

1) Displaced has hands down the best world building I've seen in any online story, the characters are amazing, but there are a lot of them. The POV changes to completely different story threads, and there isn't a main character. That's not a bad thing, but it can be off putting, especially the first time.

2) Delve is what would happen if a munchkin went to a fantasy world. The characters are alright but not really THE focus. A lot of numbers, and a book smart protagonist.

3) Worth the Candle is on royal road, I'm not sure if you've read it on Ao3. Probably the closest to what you've described. Great character growth, incredibly well written, amazing world building. It does go on some pretty long tangents, and can be a tad political. Overall very much worth reading.

4) He Who Fights Monsters is very enjoyable, with a smart protagonist, fits very well with your listed character traits. I would highly recommend it, but it doesn't have much to do with science or technology.

5) Super Minion has a Android for a protagonist. More of a comedy than anything serious. Decidedly not finished, and very slow updates, but I would still recommend it.

You should also read RE: Trailer Trash. It's not the genres you asked for, but it's fucking amazing.
