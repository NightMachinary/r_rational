I've been playing a lot of Neptune's Pride lately (basically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game][Risk]]) in Spaceâ„¢) and I'm a bit hooked on the diplomacy of these types of games.

Basically, I'm looking for a story where the focus is on the protagonist trying to get things done while taking into account that their 'allies' could betray them whenever it benefits them. Bonus points for diplomacy, plotting and spying.

I can't remember anything I've read that focused totally on this, but the army fighting chapters of HPMOR are my go-to example for this.
