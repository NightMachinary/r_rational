Often things like this are better on a rewatch. As an example, I really enjoyed the recent Star Wars film with the much-maligned plot point of using the rebel ship as a missile. I thought the person who did that was a true hero, and the people who came up with that plan, willing to think outside the box. In a lot of cases, perhaps unlike many on [[/r/rational]], I don't really care about internal consistency if there is a good emotional arc, and I think they nailed it with that movie.

Edit: at the time I recommended TGWDLM, I was thinking about how much optimization power it would actually take to turn the world into a musical.

As a starting point, one could consider the song Bohemian Rhapsody; and DJing.

I honestly think an ordinary human could do it, given sufficient motive.
