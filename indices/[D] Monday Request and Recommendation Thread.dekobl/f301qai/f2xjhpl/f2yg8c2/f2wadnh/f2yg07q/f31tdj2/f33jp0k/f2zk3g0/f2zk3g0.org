I am not sure if [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/][The Evil Overlord List]] is rational, but i would like to read more webfiction like it (doesn't have to be fan fiction).

The plot, the evilness, the jokes, the cursing, the inner monologuing.. Everything.. Was well done. Despite reading a ton of fan fiction, it felt fresh.

I especially like this line from Chapter 22 - "/I am an amoral sociopath who cares about nothing but his own enjoyment. Neither crippling sentiment nor uncontrolled sadism shall impede my ambition. Cold hard practicality is the only thing that controls my decisions./"

I want more.. Nay, i /need/ more... Webfiction, Dark or evil MC, intelligent and wise (or getting there), succeeding (coz bad guys winning in fiction is all too uncommon and i want to read such works).
