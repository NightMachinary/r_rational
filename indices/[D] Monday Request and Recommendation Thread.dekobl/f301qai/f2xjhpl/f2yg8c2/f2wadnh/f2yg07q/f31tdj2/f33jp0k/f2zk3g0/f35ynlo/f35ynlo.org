I have been reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-subtle-knife-worm-yj-si.342043][A Subtle Knife]]. The protagonist have a hugely exploitable powerset but by post *Mount Justice August 27, 4:25AM* he still haven't shown any initiative to build something. Does he ever start actually using the manipulation aspect of his power to build a gang/team/world-spanning organization?
