It's very well structured, and it fixes most of the world building problems other stories with this setting overlook.. The power cap is explained early on and it has not been increased and seems like it won't ever be.

​

The way that guy described power progression as Underlords being 'fodder', was really badly put. There are really very few of them, it's just that aging isn't really a thing, and they are at a world tournament where the most powerful representatives of the 6 world rulers under 35 compete. There are technically thousands of them, but this is in a world with 1 billion plus people, so it makes complete sense.

​

And it's hardly a grind, compared to the kind of story most people here are into the pacing is astronomical. It's one of those stories you can't put down after you get into it.
