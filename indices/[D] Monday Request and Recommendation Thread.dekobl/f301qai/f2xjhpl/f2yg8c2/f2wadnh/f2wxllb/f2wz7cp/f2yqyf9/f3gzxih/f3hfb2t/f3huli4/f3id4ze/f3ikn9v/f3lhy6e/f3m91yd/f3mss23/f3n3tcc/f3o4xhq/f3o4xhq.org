I can absolutely say I didn't read through all of them, but that doesn't bar me (or anyone) from leaving a review or criticism of what I did read. Of course, it may mean people shouldn't put the same weight on my opinion as someone who read the entire thing, but empirical commentary made in good faith isn't worthless.

Yeah I did take it as aggressive; thanks for clarifying and rewording. I was actually intentionally generic, because I don't want to push what I think are worthy character goals onto writers. Also there's so much, from the very meaningful large-scale humanitarian goals you mention to the smaller and personal goals. I unfairly lumped the common revenge and sob stories above as negative, but not because they're inherently bad - more that litRPGs usually deal with them in a superficial way where it's ignored until it's convenient for the plot.

For specific examples: Worth the Candle is my favorite litRPG that deals with thought-provoking themes; The Wandering Inn is my favorite litRPG that has what I think of as /human flavor/ (no cannibal jokes), i.e. character interactions; and A daring synthesis (Worm FF) has the best character growth arcs. Re: one plot bunny off the top of my head that I wanna see: a true-VR game designed by a secret AI (world isn't aware of it) because that's a convenient way an AI would have to map the human mind and take over (whether benevolent or malevolently). I guess it'd either be sorta like The Matrix where the game messes with your wiring/perceptions (unless jailbroken) or astute gamers start noticing anomalies.
