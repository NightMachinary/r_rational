That's a bad way of looking at a story. You could reduce most fantasy, scifi, stories, and even life in general in a similar manner and it'd just as easy to make them look boring or bad..

The depth of the characters is dependent on pacing, the faster the pacing the less character development you can get.

It is ultimately very similar to Litrpgs in general, if you like that it's pretty much the same thing with an asian twist. Train, get stronger, fight baddies, get loot and power ups..

But instead of 100 levels there are less than 10 and the power differences between each level are greater.

It's ok though, different people have different levels of openness. Myself for instance, will never read the my little pony fanfiction that get's recommended here frequently, ever and nothing will change my mind on it.
