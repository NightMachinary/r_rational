  I've been open to cultivation, just been disappointed.

You might enjoy Cradle then..

I get it, most cultivation stories are bad, and they are a bit of a guilty pleasure for most. I can count on one hand the number of them I actually enjoyed. Cradle is my favorite out of them..

But if you gave it a chance and couldn't get into it it's ok. People have different tastes and enjoy different things.

  I love the concept of the litRPG, but the execution is usually short-sighted or shallow.

How so? Can you elaborate ? Are you bothered when they don't do anything other fighting? What would you rather they do instead ?
