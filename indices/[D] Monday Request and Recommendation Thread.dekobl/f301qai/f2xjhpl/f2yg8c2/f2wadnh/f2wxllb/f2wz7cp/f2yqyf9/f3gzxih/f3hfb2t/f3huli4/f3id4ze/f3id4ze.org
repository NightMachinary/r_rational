I'm not saying escalation or scaling fights are bad; the typical cultivation/xianxia premise is just distasteful, i.e. punching harder will make them immortal and what do they do with that immortality? Punch immortals harder. I've heard that /Forty Millenniums of Cultivation/ is an exception, but I haven't tried it yet.

  The depth of the characters is dependent on pacing, the faster the pacing the less character development you can get.

That's a (mostly) false dichotomy. Character depth and pacing are very loosely correlated. Excess pagetime isn't necessary to make characters interesting. Cultivation characters unfortunately seem one-dimensional as a matter of course.

  It is ultimately very similar to Litrpgs in general, if you like that it's pretty much the same thing with an asian twist. Train, get stronger, fight baddies, get loot and power ups..t

Yep, which is why I dislike almost all litRPGs just as much. Cultivation is replaced by leveling, but the focus is still getting stronger. There's "character" development, but no /character/ development if you catch my drift (couldn't resist). Though I think litRPG is easier to storytell around, compared to creating a universe where cultivation and cultivator dogfights make sense as a fact of life. I love the concept of the litRPG, but the execution is usually short-sighted or shallow.

I've been open to cultivation, just been disappointed.
