It's really ironic that you're speaking from a position of knowing litRPG well and then start squabbling about what falls under the umbrella of the genre. [[https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5hxyrv/what_is_litrpg/][FYI post in case you weren't aware that the litRPG genre is generally used to encompass all game-related stories.]] If you really just want to pedantically nitpick about definitions, I can go with GameLit. I've tried about two dozen of them but maybe you can tell me whether that's enough to have an opinion.

Also let's get this straight: I gave an exact answer to your questions, i.e. why most litRPGs are short-sighted or shallow and what I think writers should focus on. If you start feeling defensive, that's on you. Reading my response again, what I see is" "I didn't like the litRPG stories I read because they're poorly written and here are some general suggestions that would make any litRPG story better because they create a more thoughtful and immersive setting."

"Generic" actually sums up the issue with the influx of litRPGs. In the space of a few years, the genre has exploded and not in a good way because any author can gloss over a bad story with game mechanics and the brief and empty gratification of seeing a /ding/. Hence the junk food metaphor.
