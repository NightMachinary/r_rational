Haha fair enough, I'm almost exactly where you are/were, and everything prior feels like set-up for the main conflict lol. I guess I interpreted it as progression because quite a few of the main characters definitely get involved in a great game with some true heavy weights.

Arguably the central character (Ganoes) starts off as a kid and is definitely being hinted at being a central mover and shaker in this conflict that probably will span entire pantheons!
