'Pragmatic' is the middle name of [[https://old.reddit.com/r/LightNovels/comments/5re405/mushoku_tensei_epub_volume_124/][Mushoku Tensei's]] protagonist. It's got an obscene dose of wish fulfillment, Japanese beta personalities and awkward anime tropes and this isn't a great intro but the actual intro tells you straight off he's a pathetic piece of shit. It's still one the better isekais from the royalroad/light novel bin because the guy's earnest in reliving his life and everyone likes a redemption story. Its flaws aside, the protagonist and his reactions to his new life are more true to his self than most self inserts where you can feel there's some sort of mask or filter. Just like the protagonist, the story's average at everything [except plot twists] but the whole is more than the sum of its parts. warning: it's still a translation but readable
