It /sounds/ like you're asking for musical recommendations. On that theme, I recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrxKX44qBJ0][The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals]], which manages to parody at least two genres simultaneously. Also it's hilarious, and the songs are catchy. Think of the implications!
