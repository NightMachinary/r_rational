It's fairly good. I can't tell if my disagreements with the behavior of certain parties, especially Dumbledore, is due to a different interpretation of canon or the influence of HPMOR. The explanation of why Dumbles would be OK with Black's treatment was both elegant and uplifting. If nothing else, I really really liked that.
