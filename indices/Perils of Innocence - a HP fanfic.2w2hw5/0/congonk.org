I actually read this a few weeks ago. I made it around 2/3 of the way through (chapter 24) before I dropped it. The rational stuff was done okay and the first two or three chapters were pretty good, but it suffers from a common fanfiction problem of not really having a plot. Like HPMOR and many other fics, it comments on the canon events, but unlike HPMOR it doesn't really go anywhere interesting with that. Also, something about the child characters and their interactions seemed a little fake to me, but since I don't really have that much experience with children and struggle with writing them too maybe I'm not the best judge of that.
