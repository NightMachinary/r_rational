Jake is clearly against death in the sense of destruction of mind, but the gods are for death in the sense of a drastic change of state upon reaching -10 HP. Suze definitely needs to experiment with her portfolio, and see how drastic a change to death she can create. If she can change the RAW of dying, there could be no limit to how many negative HP a being who wants to live could hold, and death could simply be a free action. Even a minor change, like dying at -100, would save many lives.

If the RAW are still in place, something like an epic level world-wide spell focused on recording everyone's engrams, and housing their souls on the PM plane until they decide to go elsewhere would be somewhere to start. Make a new monster type, free willed ghosts which have no vulnerabilities or attacks.

How about the alignment of all those undead worshippers? It's a pretty big deal, especially since Herrun's spilled the beans on how much the worship can change a god. her top priority should be altering her worshipper's alignments, or failing that, removing them completely.

I'd be willing to bet a good number of the liches would be willing to alter alignment if their new god commanded it. I'd absolutely love to see [[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Millennial_King][the millennial king]] being told to put on a helm of opposite alignment, and him telling Suze that he's already lawful good.
