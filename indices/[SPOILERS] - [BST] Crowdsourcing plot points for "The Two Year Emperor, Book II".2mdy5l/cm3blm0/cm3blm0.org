1: All of those plot threads sound interesting. Personally I think I'd most prefer the first because Jake is awesome.

2: It might be interesting to see Suze try and start her own religion properly, if she does not inherit Neklos'. Coming up with a doctrine, the structure etc. Could also be combined with Drifa finding a new purpose, after being rejected by Amilsandre.

3: A lot of Jake's changes seem like they'd have a great impact on Flobovian society, which could be interesting to explore. The FLEA, and magic item mass production seem utterly game changing.

I am unfamiliar with 3.5e, but if there are any spells to take control of undead then that would be insanely powerful for any warlord in Anundja. Are the lich kings going to just retreat though? I would've thought at least some would try for conquest, and they would retain control of their undead. Does Suze's portfolio give her power over undead as well?
