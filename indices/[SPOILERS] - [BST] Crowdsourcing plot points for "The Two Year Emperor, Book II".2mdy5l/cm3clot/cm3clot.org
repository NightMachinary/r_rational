The big problem is that you're near the limits of what is allowed for by D&D. The economy is essentially nonexistent, everyone is near their max attainable level, and all forms of stat boosting have (presumably) already been used. Even the average person has +11 to every single one of their stats thanks to a combination of inherent/enhancement bonuses (and another +15 to one stat by getting to level 60). They all have enough levels to be capable of doing epic level things, but there aren't epic level rules, meaning that for the most part, people are capped out.

What you really want to avoid is the characters forgetting about the tricks that they know. Your main cast has a /huge/ bag of tricks, and while it can get repetitive for the audience to see the same trick used a second time, there needs to be some justification for not using it. Writing a conflict between Albrecht and the undead would be difficult to make believable, given how outclassed the undead currently are. To a lesser extent, the same goes for Jake transforming Flobovia.

You can limit things somewhat through godly interference (especially now that the war is over - maybe they were being a bit permissive in order to win), I guess - but with Serial Escalation, that's doesn't tend to be very satisfying.

It's probably obvious from this that I think Suze has the most interesting plotline, and the most interesting external (other gods trying to screw with her) and internal (not wanting people to die) conflicts.

If you want other subplot ideas:

- Why have we not seen any druids? I get that they're not terribly powerful, but they've got /Awaken/, which is one of the most transhumanist spells out there! Sure, it costs XP, but XP isn't an issue anymore, so the only thing stopping a rogue druid from turning every tree in the forest into another druid is time - and since you can run Awakened plants/animals through your own FLEA/POPE, it goes exponential. A month in, you have an army of a billion creatures, and though they might be Good, their Good might not be the same as yours.
- Nuclear proliferation is a problem - a fight between mages probably ends with both parties dead. How do people handle the fact that pretty much everyone has a high capacity for lethality? Or do they not care much because of True Resurrection, which should be working properly now that Suze is in charge?
- Is there a moral obligation to bring people back from the dead - even those who have been dead for two hundred years? I can imagine a struggle between those who want to bring every dead person back to life and those who are content to let them rest.
