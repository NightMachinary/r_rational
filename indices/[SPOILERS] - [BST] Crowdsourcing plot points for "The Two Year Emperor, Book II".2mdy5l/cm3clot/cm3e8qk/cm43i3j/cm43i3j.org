  Is there a moral obligation to bring people back from the dead - even those who have been dead for two hundred years?

Of course there is if not from Suzy, then from Jake who would start the Sobernost if it doesn't start on it's own from the populace of Flobovia.

Perhaps a better question is what happens when all of the people who went through the flea start thinking for themselves knowing that the emperor made up a plan that turned a servant into the greatest of the undergods. This is a singularity scenario, so the interesting question is what do common people come up with when they can start using spells to give themselves good ideas.
