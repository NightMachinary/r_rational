Obvious things:

-Suze immediately seeks an alliance with Loki and Herrun because not doing so is idiotic. They welcome her because they like her and they like having powerful allies and she /will/ be powerful once she knows the ropes. Herrun's potential to Go Full Tattletale will act as a deterrent for direct action against Suze.

-Flobovia is now in the precarious position where their leaders are pretty good friends with one god (possibly three, but the other two are tricky), /but the leaders bodyguards/ worship a completely different god who may be working against Suze indirectly. I foresee Shailos revoking the Landguard's paladin status at a critical moment.

-Jake will create a utopia. Munchkins gonna munchkin.

-Jake doesn't like death. Suze now controls death. Jake and Suze are friends. Either Jake will persuade Suze to stop death from happening, essentially becoming a mortal (you know what I mean) again, /or/ Jake and Suze are going to have a pretty vicious fight at some point down the road. Or maybe Suze will create a utopian afterlife and everything will turn out great.
