I think it's a pretty common trope in pantheons like this (and at the very least, I'm pretty sure it's true of ol' Boccob himself) that the God of Magic has very few direct worshippers... but is very powerful /anyway/.

Is that the case with Arros?

Exploring something like that, and /why/ such things happen, that may be a very useful thing for Suze. Maybe it's the result of 'unintentional worship' or something (Arros claims magic as his domain, thus all acts of magic are acts of worship, whether intended as such or not) or maybe it's just the natural result of some part of the universe empowering a god in the same way /as/ worship.

Hell, maybe that's how Overgods are made. Gods take something 'squishy' that needs a lot of manual playing around with, like warfare or bards or something, while the overgods are the clever ones who take up gravity or the strong nuclear force as /their/ domain.

Maybe Suze can claim Entropy as part of her domain, and thus become immensely powerful simply from the stars doing their thing and the steady tick of time, without /needing/ a horde of undead.
