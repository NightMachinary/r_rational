Singularity story. The average Flobovian commoner has just seen what Jake was capable of, even without being able to personally cast spells or gain XP. The average Flobovian commoner is now a 20th-level archmage and a 20th-level some other stuff too, with the aforementioned +11 bonuses to all stats, making them physically and magically Jake's superior.

The average Flobovian commoner is going to realise that they're capable of the sort of world optimisation that Jake just pulled off. Why should they remain affiliated with Flobovia now that the war is over? Best-case scenario, they all cast /Genesis/ and go play in their own private universes, eternally young and needing nothing from the rest of the world. Most likely scenario, Jake has to scramble to figure out how to prevent idiots from scouring the planet with anti-osmium and black holes. He's got... what, ten million people capable of casting Polymorph Any Object by now? It only takes one person who thinks they've got a good enough reason. The surge of general goodwill that comes with winning a war might buy him some time, but it won't be long before people remember how much they hate each other.

Maybe Albrecht can offer some advice, from his time in post-singularity Anundj√•.
