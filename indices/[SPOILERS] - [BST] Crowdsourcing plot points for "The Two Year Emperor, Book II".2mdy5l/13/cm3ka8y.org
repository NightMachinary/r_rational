It looks like the plot points you have planned could actually work quite well together and could fit into a single arc or book. The story could start with Jake working with Albrecht to turn Flobovia into a transhumanist paradise partially based on the former union of Anjunda and trying to expand into the lands that been taken over by the liches and kill all the undead so they can be ressurected. The problems start when the nobility of flobovia and the churches feel threatened by the sudden changes by Jake and Albrecht, the newly empowered citizens who have gone through the POPE and the FLEA, and the consequences of allowing the rest of the citizens of Flobovia to gain such massive levels. Then there are the gods who feel threatened by the mortals ever increasing power especially after the defeat of a fellow god and now want to severely limit what they are capable of including how much magic they can have. Meanwhile Suze along with other gods and ascended mortals including Arros want to be able to do more help the mortals but must face opposition from the other gods who want to return to the status quo, gain more power by taking their positions or those that want to destroy the world so they can start over with their followers and become the most powerful god. Now our heroes both god and mortals must work together to prevent a civil war, a literal war in heaven and the destruction of most life creating a world where the remaining gods battle to the death for the top spot.

By the way I have a suggestion for a new name for Flobovia. I think renaming the nation trans meaning across or beyond would be meaningful in a story of transhumans.
