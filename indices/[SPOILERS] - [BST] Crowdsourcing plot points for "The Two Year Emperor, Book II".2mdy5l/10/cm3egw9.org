some ideas come to mind. * i'd love to see how the Suze/Jake dynamic changes now she is the embodiment of a couple things he /really/ hates (deities, people dying, powergames) and how she reacts while being in a position of power over the nobles that wronged her and over Jake. * Albrecht's struggles meshes well with Jake's and Albrecht is still flobovia's (please change that name) strategos. I see more sense in Albrecht staying in flobovia giving the troops a much needed R&R. besides a nation is made by it's people not the territory and a transhumanist paradise seems like a good staging point for an eventual campaign * jake doing the body shuffle like afi to be able to get levels and remain behind when its time to leave stpworld for earth (maybe give human!jake a rejuvenation , a bunch of platinum, and amnesia?) * afi leading a coalition of liches into a more pragmatic, less unnecessarily evil undead nation. (dark mirror to jake's flobovia?/ perhaps pressured by more merciful Suze?) * space exploration! anyway keep the great storytelling and any plot can be good.
