If Suze is successor to the deadboy does all undead worship her now? She should be the most powerful then, and Herrun second most powerful? I guess other gods won't be happy to be pushed away from power by newbies?

Can you get promoted from god to overgod? Do overgods depend on gods beliefs and worship? Are there over-overgods?

BTW: how many levels do you get for being in a party that defeated a god? Because I think Jake and friends will be a little OP if the challanges will come from mortals.

If I was any god besides Suze I would mindscrape all the mortals there to be safe from another blackhole.

Also - how many mindscrapes can one FLEA enhanced archmage cast in a day? Because assuming it's N, you can do Recursive Mindscrape Buerauocracy having mindscrappers at all levels of N-ary tree beside the lowest one (for all the others), and have utopia complete with total mind control using minimal resources (just hire the first level of the mindscrapers tree).

It even works for N=1, but the whole population would need to become mindscrapers and the tree would be degenerate.

Hell, mindscrape + flea allow for ultimate virus:

#+begin_example
  Minscrape 1 person with this algorithm:
      always do what Jake tells you to
      when someone ask you "FOO" you answer with "BAR"
      go to FLEA
      become archmage
      learn mindscrape
      ask everybody "FOO" and mindscrape the first N persons that doesn't answer "BAR" with this algorithm
#+end_example

Wait for a while - you have your utopia. When you infected the whole world you can tell them all to worship Suze.

God-holocaust and worldwide mind control in one spell. So broken...

As a bonus your land is inhabited with people that constantly

- Foo?
- Bar.

with each other.

You may want to tweak the algorithm to allow for some other activities (like maintaining the FLEA and running the country), that's left for the reader as an exercies.

Actually in a world with mindcontrol and big amount of magic-users such virus spells should already exist, even if lack of FLEA makes the infection rate slower.
