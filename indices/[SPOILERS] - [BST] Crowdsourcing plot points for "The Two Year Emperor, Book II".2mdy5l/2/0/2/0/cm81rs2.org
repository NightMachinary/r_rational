Elan: bleh, psionics. Doesn't exist. Bleh.

Divine Ranks: As far as I can tell, the only way to normally get a divine rank is by being invested with one as a divine Proxy. I can't actually find a RAW way of gaining DR0.

I'd say that no, gods can't grant DR0, although they can Proxy someone to DR1. Giving out Proxies reduces their own DR, though, so it doesn't scale.

In any case, I wouldn't allow Jake to get divine ranks. He's outside the system, he doesn't get to have the really cool toys.
