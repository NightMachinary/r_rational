Can deities in your interpretation of the divine rules grant people Divine Rank 0 and all the benefits that come with that? (Especially the immortality, though if that fails you could Polymorph people into Elan, who have no maximum age but are otherwise humanoid and slightly psychic)

I ask because Suze making Jake into Saint Jake of her religion seems like something that might happen, assuming he can have divine ranks.
