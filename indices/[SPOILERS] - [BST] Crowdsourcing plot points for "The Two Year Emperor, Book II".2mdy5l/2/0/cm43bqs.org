  Do the undead worship Suze?
#+end_quote

Probably yes and, even if not, she still gets a 'charge' off them just existing.

Making the world better by violating every mind in it? That's kinda dark.

  Can you get promoted from god to overgod? Do overgods depend on gods beliefs and worship? Are there over-overgods?
#+end_quote

No, no, and no, respectively.

#+begin_quote
  BTW: how many levels do you get for being in a party that defeated a god?
#+end_quote

A lot. Or none. I haven't decided. It's one of those things that makes the XP system go "tilt!" and I'm not sure how to handle it yet.
