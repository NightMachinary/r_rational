  Is there a moral obligation to bring people back from the dead - even those who have been dead for two hundred years?

I was actually thinking about this, and noticing that Suze, as Goddess of Death, can cast True Resurrection as a free action, and presumably has an effectively infinite caster level.

You're right about people being capped out. There are escalation potentials -- decide to take on the entire species of dragon, go attempt to clean out Hell, etc. I suspect the majority of antagonists would be other people, though -- Alice wants X and Bob wants ~X and they are both equally powerful.

Also, it could be fun watching the gods get run ragged trying to stop all the rule violations. It could even lead to a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens][Rage Against The Heavens]] scenario.
