I think you'd be better off writing about all three threads. The first reason is because I'm selfish and I want to read about everything you might write about 2YE. The second reason is that if you get writer's block, you can torture us with a cliffhanger and switch to a different character (Jake, Suze, or Albrecht) for a change of pace. The best stories I have ever read are ones with multiple story lines interleaved together.

If you absolutely have to chose, I'd suggest going with Suze dealing with other gods and only touching on Jake and Albrecht due to them being in charge of her worshipers and killing off the undead respectively.

Keep in mind that if Jake is going to be dragging Flobovia into a transhumanist utopia, there's no reason to stop at making everyone super powered adventurers. Make them all into gods who sustain each other through worship. This keeps them in check since if anyone god tries to dominate others, everyone can just stop worshiping them...mindcontrol would be heavily guarded against.
