Jake should start planning for his return trip home. Getting himself more permanent stat boosts or knowledge that will survive the return, carrying magic from one universe to another, or figuring out how to allow unrestricted transport between universes. This would probably anger the Overgods, but seems worth it.

If Herrun and Loki start behaving less altruistically, I think that would introduce some interesting complications.
