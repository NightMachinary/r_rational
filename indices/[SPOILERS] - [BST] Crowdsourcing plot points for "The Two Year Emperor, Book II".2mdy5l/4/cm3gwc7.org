Right off the bat I see l lot of the gods going after Suze to make sure that she adheres to her spot as Goddess of Death. I do not see Suze as one who would enjoy her position as the taker of life, but I am wondering if Jake could try and help her fulfill her duties as Death Goddess by setting up a resurrection cycle for those that pass into death, a la Hindu lore. She also now is as powerful in information gathering as she could learn the secrets of those that die as Neklos did.

I would also like to second the comments already mentioning the fact of Awaken and Druids. If food is just bought there should be no reason for any people to kill animals any more for food.

Jake himself knows a way now to kill gods, or at least brainwash them. He was told so by Herun. The very first thing would be to spread the knowledge of how people should think of Death so that Suze can retain her sanity and not fight against the expectations of all who worship her. That is likely the first thing we might have to truly worry about.

Edit: Crap, no creating worshipers ex nihilo will preclude using Awaken to create a worship base for mass rewriting of the gods personality through changing the majority of those who worship them. the Overgods would not take kindly to that kind of action.
