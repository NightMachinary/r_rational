For your plot points, the Flobovian one doesn't sound any good. The Landguard could just Mindscrape all the nobles into submission within a couple minutes. Less brutal solutions would require more effort and thought than that, but not that much. Albrecht's plot sounds good; other than Afi being happy to retire (with a gigantic empire of his own), there's still all the other liches and the team hasn't really figured out a way to handle them.

Suze's plot sounds the best, though I'd like to avoid direct god combat entirely and focus on proxy battles for worshipers. She and probably Arros can auto-win direct god fights now with singularities, and otherwise the power level prevents interesting writing about clever solutions (divine powers are so strong that using them in a clever way is just an informed ability). Neklos was a god of both Death and Undeath so I'm interested in how she's going to manage those two separate issues and balancing them. It might even be good to make her the main character now.

D&D-wise, I'd like to see some Druids. They have access to spells including Awaken, Timestop, and Shapechange, and their Planar Shepherd prestige class is the most broken thing in D&D when used with planes that have time dilation properties. Artificers are also classically one of the most powerful ([[http://www.brilliantgameologists.com/boards/?topic=1002.0][see old char-op tier list]]) and haven't had any screen time.

EDIT: Neklos's domains pretty clearly included Death and Undeath. Why give both to a new god instead of having separate gods of the two?
