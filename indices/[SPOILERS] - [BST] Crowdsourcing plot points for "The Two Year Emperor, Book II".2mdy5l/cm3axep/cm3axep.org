Before anything else, I'd like to say I fucking love your work and no matter what you decide to focus on I suspect I will enjoy it massively.

That said, my personal preference would be for Jake and Al to formally ally with one another and use their combined resources and intelligence to steamroll the resistance on Flobovia and rapidly make it the 'seat' of a new transhuman paradise-empire. Once they're established, they could easily become a massive source of power and influence for the gods they favor, including Suze.

I really just can't see the Flobovians representing a threat to Jake in combat or politics with his anti-deity minmaxing tech and the support of Al, plus the Landguard.

Also, Jake really needs to get around to renaming Flobovia. Like, within the first paragraph of book two.
