An interesting book to look into (albeit long) is Star Maker by Olaf. A tad dated (nuclear energy is considered the holy grail of energy production in the book) but does a fantastic job of describing different alien species and their cultures.

It has symbiotic species, hive-minds, species similar to humans but with emphasis on different senses, etc. Even some intelligent stars. For your question, it described "Plantmen", and their two differing states of sessile and motile. Sessile, when they would absorb energy, was almost a form of meditation/sleep for them (letting them get back to their roots, so to speak). Can't really recall all the details, but one thing that stuck out to me was that as the species industrialized, the importance of each form varied. Sometimes they would think that being motile all the time was most important and create technologies for that sake. Othertimes they would think being sessile was more important and set up automatic lamps to let them meditate through the night.

Can't really recall anything else from it, but I think the entire text is online, so you could find that and Ctrl-F "Plantmen".
