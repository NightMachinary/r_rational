Given our current understanding of physics, what would an expanding singularity AI in the cosmos look like? Let's assume it 's very nearly as efficient as physically possible. Let's also assume it's unable to circumvent heat death; so it is trying maximize the processing it can do before then, thus it really wants to save what negentropy it can.\\
*Basically the question is given current physics limitations and no FTL or way of preventing the universes heat death; what is the best way to maximize the amount of processing you are able to do long term within one's future light cone?*

I'm assuming it would likely expand at very close to the speed of light (i'm discounting the possibility of warp drives or other FTL exploits for this thought experiment) so you wouldn't have that much warning before it arrives (/unless/ you can you think of a way for it to somehow use lasers to remotely assemble nanomachines or something similar so that it can spread /at c/), however even if it's travelling at very close to c it is still travelling over such vast distances that on a human timescale you might see it coming quite while before it arrives. If you have any other ideas of what you might expect an expanding singularity to look like from outside I'm curious to know.

I'm guessing if you saw something like this coming it would likely look like an expanding void with some low energy emissions (I imagine things would be efficient enough they wouldn't give off any IR), however beyond that there's a lot of questions about what the most efficient way to assemble matter is if you're trying to maximize processing done before the universes heat death. One particularly interesting question is; *what is the most efficient way to do processing?* If it involves atoms it may be a better idea to use iron, just so that you can use the extra energy, though there's a question of what the conversion rate is between matter and energy when it comes to the ability to do processing. I have a strong suspicion that the most efficient processor would have to be a quantum computer, I also have a strong suspicion that it might involve subatomic components because of the sort of heuristic that faster computing always seems to use smaller components, but i'm still curious what we can think of now even if I doubt it will be what's ultimately used.

Initially upon thinking about this I figured it might turn all matter into iron since that has the highest nuclear binding energy; however I realized with small black holes harvesting Hawking radiation, you could get energy directly from matter so actually /that's/ probably the most efficient power source.

There's also the question, within one's future light cone how much can one delay heat death by stopping all the rampant wastes of negentropy? Of course you would be measuring in subjective time since you want to maximize the amount of processing you can do long term as mentioned above. I'm not sure how much more efficient the computing will be if you are trying to use say reversible computing to minimize entropy.

/Another question that comes to mind is how much of your negentropy would you want to hoard for later?/ You might be able to perform processing more efficiently somehow once the universe was much colder, though i'm not sure of the specifics. There's also a obvious tradeoff with the fact you can't store energy negentropy perfectly efficiency, however you will likely have much more efficient means of using it in the future.\\
I'm not sure there's any way we could hope to give a perfect answer to this and for that exact reason I imagine it may serve to cripple some rather defective SAI. Though it would still be expanding through it's future light cone and be shoving everything into a massive black hole so it would be pretty dangerous nonetheless.
