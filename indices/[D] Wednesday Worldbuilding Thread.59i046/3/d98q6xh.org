So, let's say that there's a superpower-based world where there's a few standard powers; when someone gets empowered, it's immediately recognizable which power they have, out of a discrete list of a few dozen distinct powers. But each power has some measure of strength which varies from user to user. Like, there may be a standard super-strength power, but for one person the upper limit is one ton and for another person the upper limit is one hundred tons and for most people it's somewhere in-between. Presumably for each power there'd be some kind of probabilistic distribution curve of strength.

There's one power where what "strength" means is purely "can you override other people with the same power". Higher values override lower values, and the values are irrational numbers that are, for fairly obvious mathematical/probabilistic reasons, never in practice going to be duplicated between two data points/users. Does this make mathematical sense? A distribution curve where the values produced actually only represent greater and lesser values and not quantities/multiples of one? It's, like, a topological distribution curve, where you can stretch the curve out horizontally and it doesn't effectively change anything because all the values are still lesser or greater than each other. I hope this isn't a bunch of nonsense.
