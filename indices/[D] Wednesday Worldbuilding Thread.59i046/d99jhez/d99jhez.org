I'm working on a setting to rationalize some of the legends about elves.

I like the idea of pocket-dimensions where time flows differently than the real world. And I like the idea that elves or faeries have ancient, semi-immortal rulers.

But "control over the flow of time," or even "centuries of compound interest" are world-breaking. And the aesthetic (dark-age nobles who live in castles) doesn't fit with the idea that everyone important was born in or before the classical era.

--------------

My plan is to say that elves live in a place that's like Sandman's Dreaming. The realm's geography is naturally chaotic and shifts based on images passing through a collective unconscious.

Entropy, inside the realm, tends to erode people's ability to store memory. So, spend too much time unprotected and you lose your sense of self. Then, you're drafted into whatever scene the realm happens to be creating.

Powerful creatures are able to carve out pockets of relative stability. These have a geography that's fixed by their rulers.

These realms only grant so much "storage space" for new information. An exceptionally big realm might gives its inhabitants the ability to hold a few years of episodic memories. And strong episodic memories are required to perform strong magic.

So, while time is accelerated, the inhabitant's gradual amnesia means that the Faerie realms fall into semi-stable loops instead of developing faster than the real world.

These loops are why faeries are so concerned with concerned with equal exchanges. Without a careful eye to equal trades, a Faerie could be generous in a way that gets repeated endlessly. This could impoverish a generous gift-giver. So the pro-social thing is to never accept a gift without giving an equal one in return.

Faeries are interested in mortals because inhabitants of the real world are born with the ability to hold decades of episodic memory. This is why Faerie nobles want to adopt mortal children.

And, adults often have strong episodic memories that they can trade, or are just able to break up the stagnation that courts will naturally fall into.

--------------

Does this seem like it fits with the key tropes around Faeries? Are there any obvious ones that I'm missing?

Also, how would people go about breaking a setting like this? Would it matter if I said that written records tend to decay if people don't invest them with magic or memory?
