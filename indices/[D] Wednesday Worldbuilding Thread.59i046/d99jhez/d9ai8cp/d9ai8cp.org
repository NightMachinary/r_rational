This seems more Faerie than Elvin as a concept. Elves are much more human, whereas Fae (in my mind) are more emotionally charged - almost like forces than highly rational minds. Think Kingkiller Chronicles or Jonathan Strange and Dr Norrell.

In the interest of simplicity, I would say the geography /and time passage/ should be creature dependant. Tie it into magic if you want - magical creatures impose their will on the world, so it's almost that your Fae realm has lots of "free magic" searching for any will to mirror and create a tangible reality from. Faster thinking creatures would generate faster time, etc. Particularly strong Fae could be at the centre of the realms of stability you mentioned - strong enough to impose upon kilometers, though a consequence of such stability might be that they think slowly, so time passes very slowly. Added with awareness of their own body could make these Fae "pseudo-immortal".

Entropy - an interesting idea, but the mechanics of forgetting should be consistent. I would suggest it as an extension of the previous magic idea I mentioned - every time you misrecall a memory free magic rewrites your memory of it to what you just recalled. Similarly misreading texts or just glancing over them briefly could accidentally wipe them clean. Storage space is now directly linked to how much you can accurately remember. Fortunately sense of our own bodies is high, and Fae could have heightened senses, so their own bodies are consistent. There could even be some Fae who've offered their bodies to carve important information into their very flesh.

A consequence: technology breaks down very quickly if it isn't rudimentary enough for you to know everything about it (e.g. a wheel would survive, a gate could be assigned a powerful Fae to maintain, but not everyone can have intricate items). I'm sure some ideas of Faeries involves technology not working when they are near.

Now, amnesia becomes a very real issue, and the rule about equal exchanges is just general good sense. They never want to be cheated (especially repeatedly) and never want to give offense (or risk forgetting an enemy). Stories of trickster Faeries could originate from the poor who would tend to come into contact with stranger, more mad Faeries on the fringes of magical society, who've lost themselves from magic and somehow stumbled into mortal realms.

As far as abducting humans goes - you'll have to be very careful with time manipulations to make sure their lifespans aren't too short, but equally you'll need sufficient reason for them not to be affected by memory loss. Having them simply being non-magical creatures would be sufficient - then the free magic has no way to recognise them. However, they are still subject to directed magic - whether by time or control or direct application by a Faerie. Their inability to resist such manipulation could stop them being too carried away with having decades more knowledge than most of the Fae, and certainly make them weak.

As far as trading memories goes, particularly powerful Faeries should be able to impose a memory into another's mind, but the system I describe gives no way to /take/ memories, though with sufficient control you could make a target very susceptible to answers.

A few final notes - there could(?) be a source of this free magic. Perhaps it's singular, or there's many. Maybe they move around. Perhaps the absolute strongest Fae control a source with their will. The benefit of a source is that it can explain gradations in magical strength, and magical creatures have limited powers away from said source. Some whose bodies rely on magic to function may even die from lack of magic.

You've made no indication of how the Fae realm borders with the human one - might be worth working that one out. There's so much potential in terms of history with borders creeping and occasionally engulfing a human village settled too close, etc.

I would set a story in this world in a more technologically advanced era. One where there's been some decades of exploration into the Fae world and the honeymoon trade period is dying and tensions are beginning to rise. Deliciously complicated.

Fae could be strangely attractive due to the influence of how they perceive themselves on their own bodies.

And finally - the idea of "loops" seems bad, because that would flat out make it impossible for Faeries to progress or develop. But I've made this up on the spot but it seems to follow the general ideas of your (very creative) world. And it all stems from this notion of free magic following will, so it should be very consistent with a bit of care. And it relies on the fallibility and imperfection of living beings to become a sharp double-edged sword that effectively limits possibilities into the not too unreasonable or world-breaking.
