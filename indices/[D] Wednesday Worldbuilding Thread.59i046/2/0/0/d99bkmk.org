My current concept is they transition from a more or less none-sentient sessile and purely photosynthetic seedling form, to a motile, omnivorous, sentient form with minimal photosynthesis relative to total energy budget.

Their ability to move is not as good as humans, lower efficiency in movement (something more like a lizard in locomotive efficiency/gait pattern). Also there are indeed herbivores, but also as they are not the only thing that is a 'plant that thinks' like in terms of species and ecosystem. I'm meandering and developing things as I go. Thanks for bringing up the way they might tame carnivores to protect from grazers. I'll mull on a lot of this.
