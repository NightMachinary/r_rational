Do they have roots? Are they stuck planted in one place for their entire lives? Or do they have the ability to uproot and move somewhere else, and if so, how much effort does this take? Transplanted plants often don't do very well for some time after. Does this apply? Or do they just walk around on feet like animals do and drink water when they find it? These sorts of things will impact their culture, since the less mobile they are the more likely they are to grow up near other family members and well-known acquaintances. The more mobile they are the more similar to humans they'll be in this regard.

Similarly, if they use photosynthesis then they'll have a stronger respect/dependency on the sun, since it directly provides food for them instead of indirectly like with farmers or hunters. This could impact religion, culture, traditions, rituals. Maybe they give thanks to the sun every morning at sunrise, or have some sort of festival every spring, or something.

Also, I expect if they don't eat meat they might have a different view of animals. But maybe they still know how to hunt for bones and skins and to protect themselves from herbivores. (Would an herbivore attack plants that can move and fight back? If there aren't any in real life you can always invent one if you want) Maybe they raise some sort of carnivore like wolves to eat the herbivores.

Also, how do they deal with seasons? Do they hibernate in the winter? Do they move all of their energy and their consciousness into their roots for the winter? Or do they hide in caves or some sort of building and stay warm with fires? Actually, do they build out of wood even though they're plants. I imagine they would view nonsentient plants the same way we view animals and so be okay with it, but maybe there are ultra-vegans among them who think that's wrong too.

There are probably other things you can think of, but I think all of them depend on the specific mechanics that you decide to make. I think the best way to work through it is to pick each feature that makes them different from humans mechanically, see how that will change what they must do to survive, and then how that affects what items or actions or creatures they like or dislike or love or fear and how that might influence their culture over thousands or millions of years.

And also keep in mind that there are many cultures different cultures even among the same species. If you have two or more competing ideas, just have some cultures that adopt each of them. Maybe they interact with each other, or maybe they're really far away and have never heard of each other, but the world is more complete if you know they exist and why.
