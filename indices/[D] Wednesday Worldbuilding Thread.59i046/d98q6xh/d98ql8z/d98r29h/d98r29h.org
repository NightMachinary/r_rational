I guess the question is "what does a number /mean/ if its only relation to other numbers is lesser/greater". In this system, is there even any practical difference between a bell curve between the minimum and maximum where numbers are centered on a most common value and a flat distribution where numbers are given an unweighted random value between the minimum and maximum?
