You will be summoned to a fantasy world to uplift in three weeks' time at a very precise time and location(your room).

You will be allowed to pack up to fifty kilogram of stuff.

What do you pick?

Harder challenge: twenty-five kilogram limit.

Even harder: ten kilogram limit.

Only one: which item do you take with you?
