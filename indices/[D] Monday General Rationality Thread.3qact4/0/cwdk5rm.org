I've lately come to the conclusion that reversing (or upending) cached thoughts can make for some really good speculative fiction. If you take something that people /know/ but don't actually think about, then turn it on its head somehow. This pretty cheaply forces the brain to recompute all the things that it had previously cached in order to fit with the new counterfactual world.

This is my hypothesis, anyway. What I'd really like is a way to test it, but I fear that it's far too qualitative to do that, because you'd have to define both "cached thought" and "compelling". I also don't have the resources (or education) necessary to run a study which actually finds out whether my hypothesis is right or not. I also think the (or a) general principle of what makes a compelling idea might be how much it disrupts the cache, but I don't know how to tell whether that's actually right.
