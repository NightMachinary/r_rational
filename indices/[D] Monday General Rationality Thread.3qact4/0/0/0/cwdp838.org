I knew that, but hadn't really made the connection to the reversal of expectations. You're completely right.

If we're talking about cognitive theories of humor, the dominant one seems to be that we get a sort of reward for bumping up against a wrong cached thought and having it corrected (and jokes are just a superstimulus). But I don't really know why this revelation causes /humor/ instead of something like /epiphany/, which is different but seems to work on similar principles.
