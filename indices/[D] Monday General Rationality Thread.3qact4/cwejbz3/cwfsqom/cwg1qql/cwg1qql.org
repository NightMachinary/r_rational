The question was rhetorical. Apparently I didn't make that fact clear enough - it's sometimes difficult to convey in text. I am in fact aware that some people don't have a problem with akrasia.

May I ask for clarification on another matter that doesn't always come across well in text? Your comment seems implicitly insulting to me, but I may be misreading that.
