I've figured out a (hopefully) intuitive way to explain the very nebulous and strange (at least to me) concept of "If you can explain all outcomes equally, you have no knowledge." I'd like to run it by you guys for feedback/improvement.

Imagine you have a co-worker who always knows everything, and you tell him that the economy went up last week. He then states several plausible-sounding reasons why of course the economy went up, it only makes sense.

Then you reveal that you lied to him, and the economy went down, and now he starts to make some very plausible-sounding arguments about why THAT made sense all along.

This triggers your bullshit detector. Clearly, he's talking crap. If he genuinely expected the economy to go up, he should have been shocked when you told him you lied. If he expected it to go down, he should have been shocked when you told him it hadn't. If you can come up with an argument for everything, you don't have a GOOD argument for anything.

And that's how, if someone can explain anything, they don't really know anything.
