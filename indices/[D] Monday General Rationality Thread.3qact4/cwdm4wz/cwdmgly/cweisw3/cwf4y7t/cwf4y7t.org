The funny thing here is that your statement is absolutely true where abstract voting systems (Schultze, FPP) are concerned, but not when people are talking about electronic voting machines like Diebold. People are literally using black boxes they don't understand to elect their highest officials.

It's exactly backwards from what would be good.
