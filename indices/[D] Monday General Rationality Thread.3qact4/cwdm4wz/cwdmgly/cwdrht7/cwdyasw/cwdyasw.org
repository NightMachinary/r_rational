Honestly, I am of the general opinion that laws that can't get broad support from more than one group are very often likely to be laws I don't actually want passed, so I am usually pretty OK with this. At least, within my present political context - Minority governments in Canada have not exactly ruined the country when they occurred, that I've noticed. And in Canada we have had first-past-the-post voting and it's resulted in both minorities and majorities in the past, so fptp is not empiricallly perfect protection against minority governments.

I also agree very much with alexanderwales points that the present voting systems are flawed. The voting system we have here in Canada is one of the very best that the 19th century created. That doesn't mean it's good at anything or for anything - it's the 21st century now. We can rebuild the system better, we have the technology. No matter what your goals are, there are systems better for it than our present voting system.
