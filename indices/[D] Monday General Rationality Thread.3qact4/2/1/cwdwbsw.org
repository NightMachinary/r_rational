I think strategic voting might be some kind of Tragedy of the Commons. Sure, if you vote strategically, it might help enforce your preferences /in this particular election/, but over the long term, it seems to distort the signal that elections provide /in the first place/, as officials come to assume that increasingly large portions of the vote are strategic, and therefore manipulable via means other than appealing to what voters want.
