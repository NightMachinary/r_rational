I have a friend who worked on the Liberal campaign, he's the president of the Young Liberal auxiliary in Alberta, and is hoping to go to Ottawa soon to work for one of the MPs.

He personally prefers STV (single transferable vote), and he thinks that's what the party will push for, though it'll probably be 2+ years before it gets implemented.
