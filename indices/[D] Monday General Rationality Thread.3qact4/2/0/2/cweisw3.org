  (Trudeau vowed to do away with first-past-the-post along with some other election reforms, but we'll see whether he can accomplish that, and if he can, what it gets replaced with.)

Meh. I'm not optimistic. The problem is that the best systems are a bit more involved than just counting the votes. As a result, nobody but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method#Users][the nerds]] understands what's going on inside [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method][Schulze method]]. People are not keen on using a black box they don't understand to elect the governing authorities.

Sure, getting rid of the first-past-the-post is possible. Getting a worthwhile system to replace it? I'm not holding my breath.
