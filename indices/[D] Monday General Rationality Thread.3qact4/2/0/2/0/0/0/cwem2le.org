I think it's possible to do incremental change, you just need long enough between changes. So for example, we had to fight to get an imperfect ranked choice option on the ballot, and assuming it passes in something like a week's time, I don't expect that the current crop of city councilors will be amenable to changing it again.

But in ten or twenty years, when there are new city council members and the less ideal system has been (hopefully) working for a decade or two, then maybe we can get another, better voting system on the ballot. Voting machines are another big issue that might become less of a big issue as time passes, especially if machines which support different voting systems become the norm, which they will if voting systems keep getting changed around the country.
