So it's impossible to incrementally improve voting systems, since each time the resistance to change will be higher. And it's impossible to go with optimal system right away, since almost everyone will think that you're trying to take advantage of them with some magical math malarkey.

I have a feeling that the only way to change it is to forcefully beat the flaws with the current system into everyone's heads. That's only the first part, though. The second is somehow motivating people to learn how alternative systems work. I have no idea how to do that, but traditional school education is clearly not working.
