We've been trying to get ranked choice voting implemented in my home town (just for local elections like school board, city council, mayor, etc.) and there's definitely a trade-off between what the average person will understand, what can be implemented, and what hits the most voting system criteria. Unfortunately, once you've changed voting systems, changing it again is harder, because people feel like they've already switched to something new and shouldn't have to switch again. There are also people who look at any change in voting laws as inherently suspicious, and sometimes those people just let that be their attitude without really thinking about whether it's correct.
