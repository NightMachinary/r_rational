Playing devil's advocate: In NZ we have the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system of voting, which gives Parties a number of seats in parliament based on the number of votes they receive. Its designed to give them voting power in parliament relative to the % of votes they received in the last general election, thereby making it useful to vote for the party you prefer. Even if they aren't likely to lead the next government it gives them a say and makes them more attractive to bigger Parties looking to form a coalition.

The is some dissatisfaction from people who view it as a system that doesn't result in strong leadership because, after a general election, the leading Party has always had to form coalitions with smaller Parties in order to create the majority needed to govern. In the words of my boss (a "project leader" from the UK, which still uses first-past-the-post): its too many voices diluting effective leadership.
