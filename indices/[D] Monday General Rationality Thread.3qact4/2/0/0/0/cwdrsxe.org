No voting system is perfect, some are just better at expressing preference than others. The problem with first-past-the-post is that it's not even at the level where you're making trade-offs; it's just /bad/ in in ways that can be shored up.

Proportional systems do have the perceived disadvantage of requiring coalitions and being "weaker", but if you thought that single-winner was the way to go, you could still do better than first-past-the-post and all of the problems that it has. (For example, doing instant-runoff within the Smith set.)
