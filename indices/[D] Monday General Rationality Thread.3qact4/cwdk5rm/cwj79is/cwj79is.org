I had a thought similar to this just the other day.

...Which, now that I think about it, is very similar to Yudkowsky's advice "being original is simple, don't do things that have been done before".

My thinking was "here's a good source of ideas: find a way to mix up a humongous mecha series". Maybe you could make a humongous mecha series and run it around a romance plot. Or a slice-of-life series about people who are /ex/-pilots of mecha. Or the mecha only exist as background features/easter eggs/scenery porn, and everything happens "in front" of them, they're never used by the main characters on-screen. Basically anything that, when people think of the series, would overshadow (or replace!) "monster of the week"/"world at war" elements, but still think of the mecha.

(...I've heard of FLCL, and now I'm wondering if it counts as having mecha elements.)
