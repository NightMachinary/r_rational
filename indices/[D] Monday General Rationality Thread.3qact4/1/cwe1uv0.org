This might sound super obvious, but having well fitted clothes and an un-slouching posture REALLY helps with one's mood and probably has a bunch of hard to pin down feedback loops in it relating to success.

I felt this was worth mentioning because I've been noticing a LOT of people in LA seem to affect a kind of curled over "reading my phone posture" even when their not reading their phones.

It might be worth a few extra bits of attention through your day to pay attention to how your standing.
