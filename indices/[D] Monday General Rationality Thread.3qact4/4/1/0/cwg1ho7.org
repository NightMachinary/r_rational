  Who doesn't? The people who stopped talking about their akrasia problems and did stuff.

You say that as though they're causally connected. :P

The whole point is that "do stuff" is next to impossible and this is existentially distressing, especially after it refuses to go away after a night's sleep. And after the seasons change. And after getting more sunlight. And after trying to work outside more often. And after trying what dietary interventions are possible, given the circumstances. And after trying (and failing) to start an exercising habit. And after seeking therapy with 5 different therapists. And after trying Ritalin and Prozac and caffeine. And after 10 years of the same crap OMG someone shoot me just try not to hit the parts of my brain where I keep my memories.
