My superpowers may or may not involve being confusing and isolated under threat of absurd amounts of collateral damage*, so it wouldn't be much of a loss, yes?

* I don't have any good reason to believe that the Earthquake/Tsunami/Fukashima Meltdown happened because I was trying to go to Japan, or that the Westside shooting happened because I was trying to hang out with someone from Westside, or that any of those people wound up in the ICU because I was trying to meet up with them, or that that person ran that stopsign soelely because the car that got totaled belonged to the person who was picking me up... I'm just saying, maybe it's better for humanity if no one associated with MIRI decides to stress test this. Completely unrelated note, do you think I could get a meeting with <hated political enemy>?
