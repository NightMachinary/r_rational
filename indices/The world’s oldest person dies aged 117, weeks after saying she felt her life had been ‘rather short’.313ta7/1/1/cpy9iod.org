  */Methuselah's Children/* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_novel][science fiction novel]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein][Robert A. Heinlein]], originally serialized in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astounding_Science_Fiction][Astounding Science Fiction]]/ in the July, August, and September 1941 issues. It was expanded into a full-length novel in 1958.

  The novel is usually considered to be part of Heinlein's "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_History_(novel)][Future History]]" series of stories. It introduces the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Families][Howard Families]], a fictional group of people who achieved long lifespans through selective breeding. The space ship in this novel, the /New Frontiers,/ is described in the Future History timeline as a second generation ship, following the /Vanguard/, the vehicle for Heinlein's paired novellas "Universe" and "Common Sense".

  According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell][John W. Campbell]], the novel was originally to be called /While the Evil Days Come Not/. This provisional title stems from a quotation from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes][Ecclesiastes]] that was used as a password on the second page of the story.
