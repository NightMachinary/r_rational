  That is truly amazing. After some quick research, there are 53 confirmed cases of people over 110, but another 300 or so how suspect that they are, but can't prove it. This is truly awe inspiring

So a probable 353 out of >7,000,000,000 or >5E-6% have only reached the point of a "rather short" life. We can do better than this as a sapient group.

Not to disparage one who we have lost, for now, but her life was amazing, only by comparison to our rather poor status-quo. Once again, we can do better.
