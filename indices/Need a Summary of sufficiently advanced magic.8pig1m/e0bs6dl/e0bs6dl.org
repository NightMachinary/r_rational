SO!

I am very bad at names.

Corin was in an unhappy house being trained mercilessly by his father for the past 5 years, after the disappearance of his brother. The training was because it was almost time for his judgement, which is where you go into the "Spire" which is a tower designed to be an RPG dungeon with tests laid out for you personally.

In the tower he frees 3 people from prison and briefly teams up with the local visage (Read: Demigod). He gets his specialized magical brand (attunement) and a book that lets him talk to a mysterious person in the tower, and a magic ice sword.

He then gtoes outside and discovered that he is an enchanter! Which is the polar opposite of the Shaper that his father has, his grandpa had, and everyone wanted. His Sister/cousin Became a summoner and his father wrote him out of the will favoring her.

HE begins his 2 years of military/magical schooling taking combat electives even though his magic isn't made for combat and slowly learning to love enchanting. He spends his time here with a few friends: Patrick, a childhood friend, whom he selects as a Retainer (Personal bodyman, bodyguard, and dueling second) He uses fire and lightning. Jin, a secretive person and of and on love interest. Marissa, Commoner woman, whom is a guardian, specilizing in personal combat (Also the biggest badass in the class in a 1v1) And Sera, who uses ice magic.

Corin goes through school alternating rapidly between extremely careful to the point where he isn't advancing (He wont use the mana in his mind for fear of losing his mind), and advancing so fast he nearly kills himself (Building a megaman style armcannon that blows up)

Eventually the spire locks down and the visage comes out and brands corin and tells him he has to recapture the people he let go, and he taks them to the spire and everyone fights and he gets a second magical attunement.
