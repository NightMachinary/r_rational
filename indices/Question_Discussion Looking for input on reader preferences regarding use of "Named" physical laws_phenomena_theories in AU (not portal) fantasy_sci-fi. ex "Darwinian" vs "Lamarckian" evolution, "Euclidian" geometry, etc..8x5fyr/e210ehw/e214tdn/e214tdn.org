I actually hadn't thought of that because I hadn't really considered what my final goal with publishing it is. Even if I publish it as a web novel at first (which I'll most likely do), I don't think I want to work myself into a situation where adapting it to a "real" novel would, by necessity, limit the amount of information readers could learn from it (as would be the case if the "author's notes" are no longer available).
