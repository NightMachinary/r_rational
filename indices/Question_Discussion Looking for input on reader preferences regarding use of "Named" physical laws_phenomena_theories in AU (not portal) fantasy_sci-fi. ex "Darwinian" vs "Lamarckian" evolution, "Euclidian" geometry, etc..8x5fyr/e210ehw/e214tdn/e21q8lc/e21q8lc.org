  I don't think I want to work myself into a situation where adapting it to a "real" novel would, by necessity, limit the amount of information readers could learn from it (as would be the case if the "author's notes" are no longer available).

Footnotes. Or an appendix to summarise such notes.

Though, personally, I think that doing the "English Earth translation" would be the superior option, it /can/ be done this way if you prefer.
