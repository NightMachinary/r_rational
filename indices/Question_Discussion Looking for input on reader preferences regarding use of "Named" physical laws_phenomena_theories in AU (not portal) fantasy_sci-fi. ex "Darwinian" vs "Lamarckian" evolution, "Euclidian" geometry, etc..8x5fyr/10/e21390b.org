Combine one and two. When you introduce the concepts, use the "full, verbose, and informative" names, but in the same sentence provide the shorthand. Like: "According to the theory of heritability of acquired traits, also known as Adaptive Evolution, we would expect to see traits A and B in populations X and Y but not Z, or like whatever and stuff or something." And then from there on out, just use the shorthand.
