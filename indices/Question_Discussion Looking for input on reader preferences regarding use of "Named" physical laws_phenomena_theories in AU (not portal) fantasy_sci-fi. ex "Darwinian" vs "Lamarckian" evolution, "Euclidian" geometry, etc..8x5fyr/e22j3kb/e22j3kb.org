I think the best solution for rational fiction is not actually to mention the names at all and instead describe the portion of the theory that is relevant in the character's own words. Partly because show don't tell, but mostly because if your world with divergent history and physics has the same theories as our Earth you're doing it wrong. (they should have at least approached it from a different direction due to having different tools and getting different results on occasion, and that's the cases where the divergence doesn't mean our conclusions would be trivially incorrect in their world).

When a name is necessary it's best to choose one that is descriptive of the theories content (natural selection, maternal impression, speciation through mana exposure, etc.) As that makes it more clear what you're talking about, and in the cases where the fictional theories do match up with real ones you should get something vaguely google-able without a ton of work.

Proper names in the sense of "Daves theory" should be reserved for when "Dave" is one of your characters and they've already explained (possibly discovered) their theory on screen.
