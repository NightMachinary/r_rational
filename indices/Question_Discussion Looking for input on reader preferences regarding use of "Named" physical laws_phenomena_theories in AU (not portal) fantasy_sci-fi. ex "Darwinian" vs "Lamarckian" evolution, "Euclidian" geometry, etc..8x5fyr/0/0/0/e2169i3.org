The moral I get from the link would be something like:

If we try to take from English every trace of history and culture embedded in the language, we will be left with nearly nothing and what remains will not be pleasant to read.

We can't write about electricity without using voltage. Volta is of course an Italian scientist, so now we are using clumsy and inept words like "Electical potential" instead. Of course, electricity itself is a word with an English history, named (so Wikipedia informs me) by Gilbert from the Latin word for amber, as a coincidence from how he was first writing about it in the context of static electricity generated on amber - so to tear out the roots of our culture's history showing in the science fiction world we should equally ban the word "electric" and all it's variations and descendants. And so forth.

English words have a meaning and history and if you try to tear out all the words that expose the fact they're from our culture, you won't be left with much. And what is left, will be painful to read.

PS: I have never, ever been glad that a science fiction author invented a new system of measurement for length, time, weight, or other units of measure. Not once have I thought to myself, "I love how I just read the character is 42 /akjangtal/ tall, so that I can look up the conversion chart somewhere to find that at a rate of 1 akjangtal to 6.4 cm to find out they stand 2.7 meters tall."
