While this is completely rational if I was reading LotR and Aragon said he was going to go to McDonalds to grab a quick bite I would be completely taken out of it.

Even if it makes it instantly understandable that Aragon is buying fast food from a chain restaurant I would prefer if the author came up with another name. Or if when Frodo saw Gollum watching the ring and said "me_irl"

That's before you get into the legal troubles of using English words that are trademarked.
