Those are some good suggestions. Thanks for that.

This type of solution is pretty appealing to me if I can find a good way of framing it for my story, but after seeing all these suggestions for various solutions, I unfortunately think I'm going to end up stuck with trial and error between 2 or 3 possibilities until I find what works for me and what I'm least dissatisfied with. Your comment was the first to really help me take this option seriously though by making it more actionable, so thanks again.
