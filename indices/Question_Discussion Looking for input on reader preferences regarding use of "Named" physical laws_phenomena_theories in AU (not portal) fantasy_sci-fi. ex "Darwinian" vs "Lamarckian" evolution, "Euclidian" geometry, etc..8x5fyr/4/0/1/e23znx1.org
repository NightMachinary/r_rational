descriptive, not-proper-named shorthand sounds like the best route.

while the words "darwinian" and "lamarckian" are useful in communicating about theories with others, they are entirely irrelevant to actually understanding the context, and i think people are insane to not think its weird for a fantasy world to have people named darwin or lamarck that debated about various theories of evolution. for me, that destroys my immersion (not irreparably but i think id roll my eyes every time it came up)

i mean the idea that youre just translating the name of some other poor schmuck who came up with a familiar theory. thats a person. you cant translate people. you cant even translate names, really - you transliterate them. it makes no sense.

on the other hand, there are some words that contain peoples' names as part of their etymology, and /that/ i think is a more flexible area. easy example is voltage - thats a word all its own, and its just named after this awesome dude. but he didnt invent the "volt" and its not exactly his name and his name coulda been Volty or Voltso or Voltaire and it still woulda worked for the unit to be called the "volt". can't think of many counter-examples for words that wouldnt work, but im sure they exist
