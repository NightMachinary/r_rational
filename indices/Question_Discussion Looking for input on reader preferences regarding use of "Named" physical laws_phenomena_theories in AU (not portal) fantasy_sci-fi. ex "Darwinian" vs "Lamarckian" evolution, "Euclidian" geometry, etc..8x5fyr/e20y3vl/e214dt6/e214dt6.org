I'm terrible at coming up with "fantasy names", so I was already planning on using normal names to a certain extent anyway. Though it's not like there's only one country/language in any given world, so I can't just name /everyone/ with english names.

Thanks for the input and the link, I'd never seen that before, though I confess I'm not really sure what to take away from it.
