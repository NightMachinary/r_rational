while im with you on words like voltage staying the same, i dont like the idea of an alien realm having a Volta, and not just because of the disjointed feeling that gives me.

Volta didn't invent the unit "volt". it was named after him almost 100 years after he invented the battery. did fantasy!Volta invent the battery, or did he discover a way to quantify electrical differences or what have you, or did he discover some other electrical quality that got voltage named after him? was his name even volta? your name doesnt have to be volta for something to be named "volt" in your honor

words have their own etymologies, and are translated based on meaning. that simply does not work well with names or people. fantasy!Volta probably did invent the battery. but they probably have little to nothing in common with Volta, so just calling them Volta is confusing and disjointed for a reader.
