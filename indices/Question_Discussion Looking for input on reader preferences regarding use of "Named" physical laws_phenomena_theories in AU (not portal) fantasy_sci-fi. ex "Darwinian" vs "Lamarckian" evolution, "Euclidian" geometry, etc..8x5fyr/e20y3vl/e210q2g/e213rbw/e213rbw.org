Thanks. I'll look into it a bit, but don't really have time to read a novel just for reference for this issue.

Did the renamed ideas in /Anathem/ have direct correlates in our world or were they not quite the same?

And can you give me your opinions on how you felt this worked? Were they easy to remember? Did it /matter/ if you remembered? Were any of these ideas discussed in enough detail that a reader could learn something about /our/ reality from it?
