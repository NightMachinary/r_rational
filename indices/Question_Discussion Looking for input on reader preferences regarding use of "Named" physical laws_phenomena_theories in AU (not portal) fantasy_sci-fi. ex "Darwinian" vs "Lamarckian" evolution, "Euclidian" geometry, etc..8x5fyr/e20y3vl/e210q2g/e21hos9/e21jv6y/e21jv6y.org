Thanks for the detailed reply. I actually started coming to the same realization after reading [[/u/ArgentStonecutter]] 's reply. At this point, its the ones that are /still capitalized/, as you mentioned, that are probably the biggest worry.

I'm always a little irritated when I see writers using "mels" and "kilomels" instead of "meters" and "kilometers", since the fact that the measurements are the same but just named differently is annoying considering it's a different world anyway. That said, if you introduce a completely new distance measurement, nobody's going to enjoy going through the trouble of calculating it out every time even if you tell them how.

That's why I was initially attracted by the fourth option I mentioned in the OP, of just claiming that the readers are reading it in English on Earth, so it's been "localized". But I don't have confidence to pull that off well outside of a few easy cases like units and measurements.

Anyway, if anything, your reply helped me firmly abandon the idea of being adamant about wiping out culture/history references, but I'm still not quite sure what to do about "named" theories/ideas/phenomena that are clearly still proper nouns and not yet "part of the language". (I'm leaning towards coming up with descriptive shorthand names---#2 above---though.) But it seems the scope of the problem has been significantly diminished. Thanks
