I think it's just not worth worrying over. If people are interested then they'll go look it up, if they aren't then they won't care.

3 is worse because it further separates the reader from the concept using a fake name; you can connect the concept to shorthand similar to (or exactly the same as) real life shorthand (for example, instead of "selective evolution" you could use, y'know, /natural selection/ LOL) and the concept will be easier to recall, but if you connect the concept to a fake name then there's nothing for the reader to associate with the concept and you're requiring them to memorize a fake name.

4 just doesn't sound like a good idea if you're doing a complete AU, there's no way around the two problems you mentioned for number 4, if you've got a character named Sheb'luth-ku and they start talking about Darwin or Einstein then that's going to break immersion regardless of whether or not you present it as an earth-english translation.

You could also combine with [[/u/melmonella][u/melmonella]]'s idea of giving the real names in the author notes section, and if you're not publishing online then you could use good old fashioned footnotes.
