I like option 2, especially if you can come up with good/evocative names. It seems worth it to do a 5 min brainstorm or crowdsource on each name, to try to get something sticky which gets at some aspect of the underlying structure of what's happening.

60 seconds of brainstorming on your example, the best I've come up with are Developmental Evolution vs. Mutational Evolution, and Seed Evolution vs. Lifelong Evolution.
