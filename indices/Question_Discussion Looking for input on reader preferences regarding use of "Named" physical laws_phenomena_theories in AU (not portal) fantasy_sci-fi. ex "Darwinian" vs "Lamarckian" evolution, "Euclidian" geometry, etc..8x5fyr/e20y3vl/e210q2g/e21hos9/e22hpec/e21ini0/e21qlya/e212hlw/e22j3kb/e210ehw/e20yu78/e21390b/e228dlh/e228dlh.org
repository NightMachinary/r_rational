For the most part, I think you should just call things by the names we'd naturally call them. However, if you choose a few very well known things to give alternate names, it can bring the fact that the location /is not/ Earth into sharp relief.

[[/u/ArgentStonecutter][u/ArgentStonecutter]] mentioned 'anbaric force'. That single change made the alternate Earth from /His Dark Materials/ feel much more foreign and caused me to reexamine everything brought up in the story, even the mundane. It is sometimes good to see things from a reset perspective and changing what something is called is sufficient to cause that.
