I guess that makes sense.

Though there is a subtle difference between talking about "natural selection" and "darwinian evolution", I'm not too worried about those cases where a shorthand /does/ exist. That was mostly just an example.

Coming up with good shorthands for things that don't have common shorthands is a little harder, but not impossible; it just might fudge the definitions a bit. "The Electricity Equations" doesn't quite map perfectly to "Maxwell's Equations" but might be good enough.

Thanks!
