Well, if you want readers to be able to learn from it you won't be able to give a description of the more complex things without some sort of explanation out of the narrative.

For example, evolution is well known and simple enough that you can just give an explanation, but something like the Fourier transform probably needs to be named for readers to learn from it.

My suggestion is to hyperlink the in-universe name to an explanation of the IRL concept, or if that's not possible put a footnote* on it. Discworld does that, and it's not too immersion breaking.

 

*It would be neat if you replaced the asterisk with a unicode pentagram (U+26E7) or something else magic related, but that may be hard to do.
