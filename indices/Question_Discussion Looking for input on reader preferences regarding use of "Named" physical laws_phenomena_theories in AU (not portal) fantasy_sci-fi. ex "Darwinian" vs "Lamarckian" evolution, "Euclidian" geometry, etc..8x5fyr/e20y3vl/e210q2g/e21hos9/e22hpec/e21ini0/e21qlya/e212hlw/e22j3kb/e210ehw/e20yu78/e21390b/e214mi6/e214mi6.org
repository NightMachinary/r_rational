Right, well, I'd be combining #1 with any of 2-4 in any case, since I intend to give full explanations and proper descriptive names. They're just unwieldy to use all the time (but not in principle impossible I guess, which is why I left it as its own option).

Do you have a reason for choosing #2 over 3/4? What about the "problem" I mentioned for #2? Not worth worrying over? Or just less bad than the others?
