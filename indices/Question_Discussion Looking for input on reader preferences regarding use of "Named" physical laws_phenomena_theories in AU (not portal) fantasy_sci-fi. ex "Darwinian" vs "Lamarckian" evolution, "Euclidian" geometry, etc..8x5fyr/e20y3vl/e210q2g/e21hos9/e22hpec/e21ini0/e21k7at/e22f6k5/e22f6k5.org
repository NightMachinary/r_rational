Calling Lamarckian evolution "Juniperian" would be even more jarring, and also would weaken the "lecture on the sly" component. You could go without naming it, if you feel like it would be too immersion-breaking otherwise.

Consider also that immersion isn't the be-all end-all of stories; as a random example, Schlock Mercenary's footnotes/author's notes are often winking at the audience, but even on an archive binge it doesn't detract.
