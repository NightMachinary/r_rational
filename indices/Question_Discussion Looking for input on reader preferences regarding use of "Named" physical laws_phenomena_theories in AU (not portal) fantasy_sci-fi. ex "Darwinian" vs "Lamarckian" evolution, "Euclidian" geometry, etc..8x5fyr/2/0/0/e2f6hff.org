  That said, if you introduce a completely new distance measurement, nobody's going to enjoy going through the trouble of calculating it out every time even if you tell them how.

Reminds me of Greg Egan's "Orthogonal" series. Great books, but he may have been a bit too thorough in giving their world its own system of units of measure... after a while you get a rough sense of what their order of magnitudes are, but you'd need to keep the conversion table and a calculator at hand at all times to follow properly through all the descriptions.
