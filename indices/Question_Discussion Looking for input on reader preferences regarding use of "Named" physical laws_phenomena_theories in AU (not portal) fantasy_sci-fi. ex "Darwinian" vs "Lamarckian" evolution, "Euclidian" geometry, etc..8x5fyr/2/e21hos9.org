  Just name the theories and native scientists responsible for these theories the same way they are here on Earth.

  Problem1: Stretches credibility, may break immersion

I think you're going to have to do this a lot, and in fact you may already be doing it without realizing it. And while you don't have to use this solution in every instance, ultimately I think using names that people are familiar with is going to be /less/ likely to break immersion.

For example, if you're writing a story that includes electricity, you'll probably be best served if you just describe the electricity in terms of "volts" and "amps," even though these units are named after Alessandro Volta and Andre-Marie Ampere, respectively. Same goes for watts, ohms, hertz, joules, and a bunch of other units.

Waving your hand and saying "coincidentally, the person to discover the proportional relationship between current and voltage in this universe was also named Ohm, just like in our world" might sound a bit too convenient, but making things convenient in this way will allow you to avoid having to re-name every single unit of scientific measurement, which would probably be /more/ likely to take people out of your setting and remind them of the fact that they're reading a secondary-world fantasy.

If you're trying to scrub every word that's dependent on a proper noun from our world, you're going to have a tough time. For example, if you ever call one of your characters a "chauvinist," you have to contend with the fact that this term is derived from the name of the (possibly apocryphal) French soldier Nicolas Chauvin. The thing is, most people are totally fine with reading a fantasy story where the characters visit a graveyard and see a mausoleum without putting down the book and saying, "Hey, how can they be visiting a /mausoleum/ when they're in a universe where the Greek ruler Mausolus was presumably never around to have this style of burial chamber named after him?" At a certain point, these "proper nouns" just become part of the language.

That being said, this doesn't really apply universally. When we get to the point where you can use the word "Darwinian" without capitalizing it, the word will probably safely evoke the idea more than the scientist, but until then, you may be better better off finding another way to talk about the concepts he's known for, using one of the many methods suggested by other commentors. But I think it is worth being aware of just how hard it is to discuss basic concepts and principles in a scientific field without using language that reveals the actual history of the people who studied it in our world.
