I have literally never minded a fantasy author giving me a physics or biology lecture on the sly. Go with the same names we have here, and give context, so that people can actually /understand/ the difference between (in your example) Lamarckian and Darwinian Evolution; and if it's not important to the story, don't bring it up in the first place.
