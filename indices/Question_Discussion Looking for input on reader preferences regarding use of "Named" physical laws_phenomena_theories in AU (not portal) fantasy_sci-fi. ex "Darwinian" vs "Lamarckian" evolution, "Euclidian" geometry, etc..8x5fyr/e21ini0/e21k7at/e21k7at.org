  I have literally never minded a fantasy author giving me a physics or biology lecture on the sly

Good to hear. I feel the same.

I'm really tempted to do this, but I don't have confidence I can pull it off without breaking immersion/WSoD. Do you think it would really detract from readers' potential learning about real science if I were to (using the same example) use "Natural selection theory of evolution" and "heritable adaptation theory of evolution" (instead of Darwinian/Lamarckian) that are then reduced to some kind of descriptive, not-proper-named shorthand (with full explanations of course)?

  and if it's not important to the story, don't bring it up in the first place

Oh, but it is :) Do you really think magic/mana that can alter reality can be considered /safe/ even when it's not being actively /used/? In my world, it's highly adaptive and mutative which can introduce a Lamarckian factor into a predominantly Darwinian evolution. And I have a full mechanistic description for how this happens, all the way down to changes in genes. That's actually how I started thinking about this in the first place.
