I strongly support 4.Ex2. In this case, if you do not use the specific word "lamarckian", then a significant portion of your audience will think that you just made up the alternative evolution mechanism, and you have deprived them of the ability to look it up.

Here's a secret, though: You don't actually need to make it understood that this is a translation. You can just call it lamarckian evolution and never imply there's anything weird about that, explicitly or implicitly. This isn't a hole that you need to put any effort into filling. As long as your story is about the /science/ and not the /etymology/, it doesn't matter that the characters are "actually" saying "bìwshēm Zhún-Pèr" unless you're planning on Juniper Lamarck actually being a character.

At the end of the day, the purpose of language is to communicate ideas. You should use whatever words best communicate the ideas you want to put into the reader's mind. All of the other options (especially 3) obfuscate the topic. That's okay if you're trying to additionally convey other ideas ("Look how weird and different my world is!"), but that doesn't seem like your goal.
