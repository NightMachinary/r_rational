I found myself dealing with this problem too when writing. Ideally, using the same terminology helps a lot follow what we're talking about; if you're not using "this is actually a manuscript from another world I found and translated" as a plot device, you can just make it clear in your preface/opening notes that terms really mean their local equivalent. Still, at least in my writing, for now I'm just trying to skirt around the problem ("classical" instead of "Newtonian" mechanics, etc.).

Of course, the ideal solution is to just have the world have its own scientific history and thus its own names, and make things clear by context. An especially memorable example of this for me was the way Philip Pullmann handled electricity in the His Dark Materials saga. In the parallel world in which Lyra lives, we soon hear people talking about "ambaric" energy. It's confusing at the beginning, but a bit of thought can make you realise that it comes from amber, Latin, while "electric" comes from elektron, meaning the same thing in Greek - because amber was the first material in which static electricity was produced and for which the phenomenon was known since ancient times. Same word origin, believable difference born out of convention.

Of course, this specific bit of world-building relies on the fact that this is a parallel world to our own, with a lot of shared history despite some significant divergences. It's also stated outright later when Lyra interacts with Will, who is from our world. But even before that, it's clever and satisfying for the reader if they can make the connection on their own.
