Okay, I've had a look over the other responses to this question; and here's my opinion:

Option 4, Ex2. Everything is the "English Earth translation", including the names of scientific theories. Now, there are a number of major framing devices I can see to pull this off:

- Have a prologue in which a historian (many years after the events depicted in the story) finds a copy of an 'original manuscript' in some out-of-the-way place, written perhaps in Latin, or German, or Atlantean or whatever is suitable to your story. Present the rest of the story as your historian's translation of the manuscript. (Readers of Tolkien will be familiar with this framing device).

- Introduce some handwavium (like Star Trek's universal translator) that allows automatic translation into any language. Suggest that such a device was used to translate the text into a common language of the world it landed up on.

- Have a 'Foreword From The Author' - in a Watsonian sense of 'author' (i.e. another character in your story, perhaps centuries after the events of the story) in which he describes why he translated the names of various scientific theories (and various animals) 'to better match those known to your world'.

- Just use the real-world names of the theories and don't explain the match-up.
