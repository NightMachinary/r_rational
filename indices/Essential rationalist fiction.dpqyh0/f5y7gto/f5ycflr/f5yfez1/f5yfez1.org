Fanfiction is kind of a better fit for the genre, to be honest. The premise of "fiction without dumb characters, where the systems are self-consistent and everything happens for a reason" is just more satisfying when contrasted with existing popular fiction. Plus, niche communities tend to be more willing to discuss "low-class" stuff like fanfiction, which can lead to them /only/ discussing them, as a method of distinguishing themselves from more mainstream communities.

That all being said... I don't think fanfiction is nearly as prevalant as you're saying. Most of the ongoing series now are original fiction, and there are just as many (if not more) essential works that are original fiction as there are fanfiction. Plus, a lot of the bigger stories that are rational-adjacent have their own forums ([[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]], [[/r/cosmere][r/cosmere]], etc.).
