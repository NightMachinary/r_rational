With Worm, you might be thinking of the Slaughterhouse Nine, who are a group of villains that "murderhobo" would describe pretty well. The protagonists definitely aren't though. It's probably the least rational story I listed in terms of the characters themselves, but one of the most rational in terms of worldbuilding---the powers are explained really well, and it's a reconstruction of superhero fiction, basically explaining ways that certain superhero tropes could actually happen realistically.

I would separately recommend Twig, by the same author as Worm (Wildbow). It's basically a more fantastical sequel to Frankenstein. It's a bit less accessible, but the character building is some of the best I've ever read.

[[https://qntm.org/ra][Here's a link to Ra.]] It's very much an anthology, which isn't to everyone's tastes, but it's recommended around here enough that it's worth a try.

Unsong is... kind of rational? The worldbuilding is purposefully crazy, and a lot of the mechanics within it more metaphorical than fully self-consistent, but it's all in a way that makes sense. It's honestly more relevant to the rational community in that a lot of its subject matter appeals to the type of people who read rational fiction. Although it might not be what you're looking for in terms of rationality, it's still really good.
