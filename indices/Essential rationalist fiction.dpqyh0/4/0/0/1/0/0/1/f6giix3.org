Also, Worth the Candle: I would agree, although a lot more at the beginning than later on, but it's made pretty explicit within the story that the intention is for it to be a coming-of-age. This is supported by the author's own statements about the main character being a self-insert, but of his teenage self rather than this current one. To me it's more of a deconstruction of rational fiction, which would make sense given the author has written some of the most foundational stories in the genre and been around for a while. He probably got bored of just writing really good rational fiction.

If you aren't a huge fan of Worth the Candle because the protagonist isn't super-rational, I would check out [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight.]] It's by the same author, and more of a straight-up representation of the genre. The protagonist still isn't the /most/ rational, but it's way less about his personal flaws than WtC. I would also check out Metropolitan Man if you haven't yet, since it's 1. also by the same author, 2. the best Superman story I've ever read, and 3. the description of it as "fanfiction" is kind of simplistic since Superman has always been open to different authors' interpretations.
