[[https://qntm.org/ra][Ra]] is pretty heavy on the magic-as-science angle, although I'm not sure how transparent /to the reader/ the rules of it are, even if the author was scrupulous about it.

But that also might just be that it all got complicated by the end; to the point where I started nodding along and taking it on trust rather than carefully parsing for full understanding.
