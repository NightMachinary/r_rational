Set in an alternate universe Industrial Revolution Europe with potions that gives you supernatural powers, involving a Chinese protagonist who found himself spiritually merged into the body of a dead university student with a hole in his head. The story is about finding out the mysteries of this strange world and constantly foiling the plans of evil Lovecraftian beings.

The protagonist is extremely meticulous about things to account for Murphy's Law (in order to survive a world where mortal lives are as bubbles on the tide) and his thought processes are written in a logical and consistent manner akin to intelligent characters' "reproducible patterns of good thought" as mentioned on Yudkowsky's blog, with consistent creative usage of his powers as well as SCP-like sealed artefacts. What I've been most impressed by is that almost all of the anachronisms is eventually explained in-universe, including why one of the gods use the crucifix as his religious symbol. I can't recall any plot holes that aren't eventually addressed.

The choice of words suffers slightly from being translated from Chinese, but it's still easily readable.
