I guess "gratuitous" has a bit of a range. The worst case is: complete tonal dissonance, sex scene sticks out like a sore thumb and feels like it was just put in because the author randomly felt like masturbating to their own prose. A milder case is, the sex scene is more organic to the plot but it still sort of feels like the plot bent itself over backwards in order to lead to sex as a plot point; which you could argue is another form of irrationality for a story, except instead of being in the service of, for example, having the main character be unreasonably successful, it's in the service of having everything resolve with people fucking for one reason or another. The totally-not-gratuitous case would be: yes, I can entirely believe in a situation where everyone is a thinking person this setup would lead to these characters having sex.
