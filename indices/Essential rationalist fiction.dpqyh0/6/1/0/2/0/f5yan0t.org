Make me think of a story I read recently, "Winter comes". A Game of Thrones fanfic that is very blatantly and openly a self-insert power fantasy in which some guy get isekai'd to Westeros in the body of the Night King. Still, 'twas pretty fun - but it /did/ have some cringey straight up porny scenes for no very good reason.
