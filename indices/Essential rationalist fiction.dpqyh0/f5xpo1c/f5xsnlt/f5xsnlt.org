For continuations of HPMOR there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][Significant Digits]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11223914/1/Draco-Malfoy-and-the-Practice-of-Rationality][Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality]]. Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] doesn't /continue/ exactly so much as /branch off from/.

For rational'd up fanfic based on other things, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]] (ongoing) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]] (on a long hiatus)

For other stuff that's currently ongoing that I'm following there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12975806/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-the-Patronus][Secret of the Patronus]] and [[http://www.moodylit.com/index.php/the-good-student-table-of-contents][The Good Student]]

For "not really rational fiction, but quite good and somewhat adjacent to the community" there's [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] and various other little bits of [[https://slatestarcodex.com/tag/fiction/][fiction by Scott Alexander]] as well as the combined output of Wildbow on [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], or the ongoing sequel to Worm, [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]]

For "not rational but it'll fuck with your brain in a good way" stories, I can also suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2372021/chapters/5238359][Floornight]] by Nostalgebraist, and also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]] (which references The Northern Caves but is its own thing, but is also delightfully brainfucky).

I can probably also dig up more (but potentially lesser) examples in any of the categories above, if one takes your interest in particular.
