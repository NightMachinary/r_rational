Current English translations is halfway through Volume 3 (664 chapters total) with an output of 2 chapters per day, meanwhile the raw is halfway through Volume 5 (~1106 chapters total), also 2 chapters a day. The writer had said he was aiming for 8 volumes in total, with about 200+ chapters per volume. Each English chapter is around 2000 words.

Neither the original writer nor the translation service have gone on extended hiatus before (unlike some other works I've followed like TAS), and the writer has multiple completed series under his belt.
