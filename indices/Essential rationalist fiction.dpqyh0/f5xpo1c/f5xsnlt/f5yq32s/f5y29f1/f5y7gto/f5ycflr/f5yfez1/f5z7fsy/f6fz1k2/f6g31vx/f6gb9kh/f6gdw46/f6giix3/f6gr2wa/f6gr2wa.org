The other reasons Worth the Candle wasn't fun for me (even though I think it is a masterpiece) is that much Existential Dread/Metanarrative undermines my suspension of disbelief, and I don't like Grimdark.

If I am going to look for fiction like X, it would probably be Mother of Learning. It's not pure rationalist, but it was refreshing to have a smart hero I didn't want to throw things at. Hero's with pragmatism and common sense are much rarer then heroes that revere the idea of rationality.\\
Looking at the Goodreads list, I also loved Jumper, A Fire Upon the Deep, and Mistborn. The Eighth Warden was recommended by someone here and while I'm not at all sure it counts it was decent.

I'd rather have an original work of sort of rationalist fiction that is well written in English than a purely rationalist work that isn't really a functional novel.
