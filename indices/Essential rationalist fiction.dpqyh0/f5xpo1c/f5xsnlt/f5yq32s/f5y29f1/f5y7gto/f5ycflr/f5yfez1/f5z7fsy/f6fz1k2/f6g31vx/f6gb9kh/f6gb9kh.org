Thanks! Very helpful!

I read and loved Mother of Learning.

Have mixed feelings about Worth the Candle...respect it but don't enjoy it. Also I'm not sure how rational the hero was...he was more rational in his philosophy then his actions.

Read a bunch of reviews of Worm. It seems to be full of a lot of characters that act like insane murder hobos?

Ra is kind of hard to google. Do you have an author or website?

Unsung looks like it has promise. Also Erogamer. I started The Good Student. I'll have to give it another try.
