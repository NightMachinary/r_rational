The unifying theme of a lot of what you've said you like seems to be creative use of consistent power systems, what with Mother of Learning and Jumper and Mistborn all focusing on that. I'd recommend Sanderson's other work in case you haven't read it, since he's basically the master of that, and his three laws of magic are a core part of rational fiction. I'd also reinforce my recommendations of Worm and Unsong, since they also focus on that. Also The Dresden Files, and The Name of the Wind (which is a masterpiece, although you might wait for the last novel to be released so you don't have to be stuck waiting forever).

Also, as a heads up, there's actually a distinction between "rational" and "rationalist" fiction (which the sidebar used to contain, but no longer does). Rational fiction has self-consistent worlds where characters make thoughtful decisions and everything happens for a reason; rationalist fiction also has those features, but with the extra caveat of explicitly focusing on good thinking, often with an emphasis on the LessWrong ideals of changing your own behaviors and recognizing cognitive biases.

As an example, Mother of Learning would be rational fiction, while HPMoR and Luminosity would be rationalist. Or, more apt to this conversation: "purely rationalist work that isn't really a functional novel" would be rationalist fiction*, while "work of sort of rationalist fiction that is well written" would be rational fiction.

*although I do think HPMoR is a pretty well-written novel in its own right
