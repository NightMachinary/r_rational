Thank you for the wide variety of recommendations. I should have mentioned that I read Pact and Worm, but it didn't occur to me. I know about significant digits, but I haven't got around to reading it. Do you have any recommendations for a hard magic system? Doesn't have to be diamonds but something a lot closer to that than say Harry Potter LotR etc
