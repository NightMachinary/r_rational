Just read through The Library Unpublished. Thought it was really good. Ending felt very unresolved, but clearly intentionally so, a lot like The Northern Caves. Perhaps we're too attached to giving stories satisfying endings, but then again, I certainly wouldn't want every work of fiction to end inconclusively. Also reminded me of SCP-2747 in a weird way.
