There is a community wiki, though I can't ever seem to find a link on the sidebar since the site layout change. Here is a direct link to it: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index]]

There's a section called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][Defining Works]] that has a lot of good options. The ones that immediately come to mind (outside what you've posted) would be:

- Pokemon: Origin of Species (ongoing - Pokemon universe)
- Worm (completed - original superhero universe setting, pretty dark and depressing (IMO) but many people love it and it's spawned tons of fanfics)
- Animorphs: The Reckoning (ongoing... I think? I stopped reading it. Animorphs universe)
- Luminosity (completed - retelling of Twilight, with a second much more original sequel)
- The Two Year Emperor (completed - DnD universe)
- Worth the Candle (ongoing - original setting that brings a lot of tabletop and RPG staples into play. One of my favorites)
- The Erogamer (ongoing - original setting with erotic-themed "Gamer" powers. "Quest" format. DEFINITELY NSFW. You need to create a free account to get to it. It's fantastic, though)

There are also weekly Monday Recommendation Threads that are full of good suggestions. Often not completely rational, but a lot of rational-adjacent stuff is good too.
