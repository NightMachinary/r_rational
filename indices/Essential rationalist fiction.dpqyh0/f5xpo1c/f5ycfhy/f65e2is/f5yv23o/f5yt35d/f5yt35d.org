It attempts rationality but fails very, very hard. Taylor is carrying an idiot ball half the time, which puts her head and shoulders above everyone else in the story, who have one all the time.

If you want a rational superhero story, try the Wild Cards series (low power level) or The Fall of Doc Future (high power level).
