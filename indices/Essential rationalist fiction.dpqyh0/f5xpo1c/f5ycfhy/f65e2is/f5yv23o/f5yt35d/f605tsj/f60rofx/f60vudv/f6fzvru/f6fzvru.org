Disagree. The worldbuilding is nonsense if you try to actually think about it. The Entities are stupidly complex and have complex motivations and yet lack /basic/ mental tools they would have to have had to devise the ridiculously OP capabilities they have; the conclusion of Worm relies on them not having those mental tools. Their plan to satisfy their motivation is multiple layers of insane troll logic. What Scion does on Earth doesn't make any sense, at any stage of his existence. Nothing about the existence and quantity of the Endbringers makes any sense. (And no, Interlude 27b does not make it make any more sense. The /least insane/ interpretation of that chapter is that it is blatant lies tailor-made to take Eidolon out of commission. I'm really not sure why fanon decided to take it as the truth, beyond 'MOAR GRIMDARK'.)

Worm tries to be a setting which works according to rules, but those rules are self-defeating and self-contradictory, and it's not even hard to find the contradictions.
