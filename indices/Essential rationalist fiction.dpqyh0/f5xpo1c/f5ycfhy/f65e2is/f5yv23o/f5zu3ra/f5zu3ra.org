A couple of problems with these munchkins. First off, her range is two blocks. While that would be enough to remove all insects from a hotel, it's useless on the scale agribusiness needs. She could pollinate small specialty farms, not cornfields.

Interestingly, she could make a killing growing pot, but that was never her interest.

Second, anything she can do a specialized tinker can do better. She's more versatile than most tinkers, but for any specific application there'll be at least one tinker whose whole power is that application. Multiple tinkers in canon came up with extermination tactics to fight her, so she isn't the only person who can provide that service. Tons of tinkers/thinkers can have her level of battlefield awareness or better.

Yes, her power would have insane mundane utility in our world, but the Wormverse has better ways to do all of those things.
