The part I'm talking about is The Slaughter House a lot Arc, for most of that conflict Taylor is the one calling the shots with the big guns only watching over her shoulder, as they don't want to be directly influenced by Jack, even after she loses Jack at Elysburgh she sits in her Dragon-craft and directs fights elsewhere. And yes, her spatial awareness is canon, it comes into play basically everytime she shoots a gun, even early in the story when she isn't aware of it. She mentions it right before shooting... You know what I'm talking about, so I don't blame you for forgetting, it was hardly the most interesting thing to happen in that chapter.
