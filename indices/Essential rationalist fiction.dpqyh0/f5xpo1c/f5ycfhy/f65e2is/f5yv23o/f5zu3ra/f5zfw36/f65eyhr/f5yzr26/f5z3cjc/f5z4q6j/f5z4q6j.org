Hmm, I think I remember that, but more rat removal than bedbugs? More broadly though I think I've always found the ‘reed richards is useless' trope to be among the more obnoxious (despite being required as a conceit of most street-level superhero settings, else they'd be a different genre). Except when facing immediate existential punchy threats, it seems like most superheroes' comparative advantage aren't in manually fighting evildoers, but in ‘earning-to-give' lol, if not by funding social programs then at least by funding private paramilitary organizations. I guess that is what Coil does (though even then, partnership with larger organizations could have magnified his effectiveness tremendously, were he less motivated by the accrual of personal power)... the skitter case just seems like if Coil took to the streets as the vigilante ‘Schrodinger', using his precognition to dodge left /or/ right when engaging muggers in fisticuffs
