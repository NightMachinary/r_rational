I had similar criticisms for her to begin with, but I feel like she does indeed munchkin her ability to a significant degree, just not in those specific directions. Due to the limitations on her powers and the instinct that Parahumans have by default, she does manage to use her incredible multitasking and diversity to great effect. By the end of the story she is the defacto battle commander for the mission that is intended to /save the planet/ and attends almost every Endbringer fight as one of the core members of the direction and strategy teams, we don't see a lot of them but it is shown that she is very respected for these roles. She even manages to use a very niche aspect of her power to get good at something completely unrelated, shooting, which she is very good at due to the spacial awareness granted by her bugs.
