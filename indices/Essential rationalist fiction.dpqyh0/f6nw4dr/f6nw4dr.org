In addition to everybody else's recommendations, [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] (complete) (and sequels (one complete, one not) is excellent.

So are Ra and Fine Structure at qntm.org, although FS is a bit rough around the edges (both complete). The Antimimetics Division stories at SCP, by the same author, are also terrific.

It's not what I'd call a core rational work, but Everybody Loves Large Chests (in progress) is also great fun if you can get over the rapey bits.
