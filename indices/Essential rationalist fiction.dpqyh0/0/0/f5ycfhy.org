  Worm (completed - original superhero universe setting, pretty dark and depressing (IMO) but many people love it and it's spawned tons of fanfics)
#+end_quote

Literal tons. I've been spending the last month and a bit digging through fanfic. I think I've gone through like, 3.5% or so?\\
Let's just say there's a lot of fucking fanfics.

Anyways, to expand on Worm and why it's "rational"...

- First off, the main character munchkins the fuck out of her ability. It's something that defines her.

- Secondly, the setting is created to be rational. The author sets up a starting goal of "People have superpowers" and an end goal of "people get them because of psychological trauma", and every step in-between can be reached from the one before. It's really enjoyable to just dig into the setting and find out more of it.

Though, as I just said, "people get them because of psychological trauma". Worm is not completely rational. Even though there are aspects of what someone would call rational fiction in it, the story itself revolves around flawed characters and how they're flawed.\\
If you enjoy that aspect of the story, you'd probably enjoy the sequel a lot more than I did.
