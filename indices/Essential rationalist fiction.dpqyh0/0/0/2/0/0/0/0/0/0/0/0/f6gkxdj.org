It's very similar to Eliezer's [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k6EPphHiBH4WWYFCj/gazp-vs-glut][Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle]]; if a system acts intelligent, with high probability either it is intelligent or some intelligence went into producing it. The more intelligent it appears, the higher the probability of intelligence involved in forming it.

The entities do /extraordinary complicated/ physics (e.g. the interplanetary transportation) and psychological modeling (e.g. somehow they automatically give everyone who triggers the specific manifestation of their attached shard whose power will screw them up the most). They're specified to be stupid, but given how intelligent they have to be to do the things we /know/ they do, this doesn't actually /make sense/.
