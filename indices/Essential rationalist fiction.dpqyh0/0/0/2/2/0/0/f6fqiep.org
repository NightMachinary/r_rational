Tactical vs strategic rationality. Who is more rational, a kid who goes into a forest and munchkins his powers as he fights goblins for a few coppers? Or the kid who stays in school, gets a safe job, saves his money, and marries the wealthy merchant's daughter his parents set him up with? They guy who uses his knowledge of probability to gamble well or the one who knows enough not to gamble?

People mean different things by "rational".
