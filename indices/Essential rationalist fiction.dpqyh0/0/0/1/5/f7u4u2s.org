Isn't one of the big reasons Earth bet is so bad because anyone with powers are compelled to create more conflict (except maybe Contessa?)? The whole setting relies on anyone with powers /not/ being rational.

That said, while I think Worm borders grimderp, as a whole I think it's fairly rational with several irrational characters. If that makes sense, don't have time to write more right now.
