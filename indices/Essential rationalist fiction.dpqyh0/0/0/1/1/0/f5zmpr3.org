Good point! I'd been trying to recall if the enhanced spatial awareness was used for markmanship (by planting bugs a laser sight?) was canon or fanon but wasn't sure. By the end of the story do you mean the fight against Scion post Golden Morning? And I'd agree that coordinating a team / recon is one of the better combat-related applications of her power, though might still struggle with range (it never goes beyond like 5 blocks, right?). Another good one involved synergies with other capes, e.g. timelocking tactically floated spiderwebs via Clockblocker's power, which iirc she did against Echidna.
