  First off, the main character munchkins the fuck out of her ability. It's something that defines her.

I feel like this is a common talking point but having read Worm I never really felt it to be the case. Within the context of a superhero reconstruction and given her near-suicidal starting outlook & shard-induced conflict-drive, she comes up with some clever fighting strategies, but imo & iirc never really uses the OP multitasking abilities or mundane utility of her powers to much effect. She eventually uses it to read lots of texts in parallel (it's like Naruto with the whole shadow clone thing -- wholly underexploited), but never, like, travels the country as a freelance exterminator commissioning herself out to big-ag as the world's most organic insecticide, or rapidly clearing bedbug infestations from fancy hotels, or w/e, making a few hundred million and commissioning some fancy, endlessly precise (insect operated) powersuits. Even putting on a costume at all seem to put a target on her back when she could just as well operate from several hundreds of feet away in her civilian identity, unbeknownst to passersby.
