  More broadly though I think I've always found the â€˜reed richards is useless' trope to be among the more obnoxious (despite being required as a conceit of most street-level superhero settings, else they'd be a different genre)

Yeah, /Worm/ was completely different from what I expected. When I heard "people use superpowers rationally", I was expecting something like [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13][this]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10503877/1/The-Amazing-Peter-Parker][this]]; a story starting from the premise that people get superpowers and having them behave like rational economic agents, maybe with a dash of effective altruism. Instead, I got the opposite; a story starting from the premise that something like the DC or Marvel universes existed, with people dressing up in spandex, taking on secret identities, and non-lethally beating each other up on the streets, and trying to come up with a way it could /possibly/ make sense. /Worm/ has several layers of justification to try to make it work (the unwritten rules, the way rogues are targeted, the nature of trigger events meaning that powers usually go to traumatized individuals, the inability of Tinkers to create technology that can be reversed-engineered or even maintained by non-Tinkers, the influence of Cauldron, the nature of shards to seek out conflict and preserve hosts' lives), but I'm not sure it does.
