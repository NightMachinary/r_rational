It gives an itneresting insight into Masego's personality (and how different it is from his parents') that them wanting to protect him didn't even occur to him as an explanation of their behaviour. I suspect they have much more mundane motivations than would be expected for a villain and a devil.

Philosophically the question of whether the apotheosised person is the same one is interesting but not super relevant, since the alternative seems to be death anyway. I'd guess emperor revenant 'came back wrong' due to only having a partial grasp of the ritual (as indicated by being dead for a year), vs the Dead King and Cat who migrated their consiousness directly.
