I think that the reveal that the Warlock and likely most Praesi do not believe that the existence after death is a continuation of the self that exists in Creation makes a lot of sense considering that they will almost certainly end up in Hell. This seems like a logical way to explain why the followers of the Evil Gods are not particularly concerned with the fact that their lifestyle would inevitably end with them suffering eternally in the Hells.
