In our world, "is a copy the same as the original" is academic and complicated

In PGtE, it's simple, because /souls exist/.

Catherine is still Catherine because Winter is grafted to the same soul she had in the beginning.

In a world where immortal souls demonstrably exist, I'm confused about how there's even a dispute about whether the same soul transplanted into a different body is the same person. The soul /is/ the person: that's what a soul /is/.

In our world, where souls (probably) don't exist, sure, there's an argument to be made that an identical copy of you isn't you. I don't buy the argument, but I recognize it has some validity. In PGtE, though, whatever entity has Cat's soul /is/ Cat, and SnowCat still qualifies.
