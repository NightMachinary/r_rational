Souls are mutable in this setting. Mages can remove and dissect them, Masego has done surgery on Cat's more than once. Winter also has an influence on her personality whenever she draws too deep.

I think it's fair to ask "Is Cat's soul really the same after all the aftermarket mods she installed?" in the same way that we ask if the Ship of Theseus is really the same ship.
