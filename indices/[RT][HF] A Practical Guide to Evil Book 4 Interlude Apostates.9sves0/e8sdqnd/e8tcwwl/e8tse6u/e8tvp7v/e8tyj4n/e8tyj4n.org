Except that that kind of personality change is inevitable. He'd be going from "person who is singularly focused upon achieving a goal" to "person who has achieved the goal he has been singularly focused on." He'd have to find something else to be obsessive over, or become less obsessive, either of which would constitute a huge change.

I don't think that hacking is an apt analogy, because an account is not a person - it's a credential. The "Nimelennar" account would be like the Royal Seal of Callow: there's a presumption that that which you're reading has come from Cat or a trusted hand, but the Seal is not the person.

A better analogy would be an injury, or other trauma, changing the person. And life is all about enduring trauma. People in my life have died: that changed me, profoundly. I've lost my religion, which was a touchstone in my youth: that changed me, also. My selection of books expanded in adulthood, and I lost a lot of my preconceptions about what a good person is.

My personality is, in many ways, /very/ different from who I was as a teenager (I was /such/ an asshole, in retrospect), but I'd say I'm the same person, with a few more miles on my body and a few more stories in my mind.

And that's not even taking into account the fact that I'm not always the same person. When I'm on the ski hill, I'm energetic and daring; when I'm sleep-deprived, I'm a hermit who stares at a phone screen for hours on end; when I'm in a state of limerance, I delve into poetry and other writing.

The things that remain constant are: this is my mind; this is my body; these are my memories; these are my values; these are my skills; these are the things that stress me, and the things that relieve stress. These are the people I love, and those I've loved in the past. And even each of those lists wax and wane as the years pass.

If I were to say that I had a soul, I'd say that all of the things I've just listed (save the body) are part of it. Everything non-physical that I identify as "me" is bound up in it. And if 17-year-old me, who had a different mind, a younger body, fewer memories, more religiously-influenced values, fewer skills, different stressors and relaxants, and, outside of family, very few of the same people in my life... If he was me --- in some ways, still /is/ me --- then he shares the same soul, despite our differences.

I see no reason why the artificial alterations on Cat's soul are any different. And certainly no reason why Second Liesse would have been the moment of transition between being Cat and being not-Cat.
