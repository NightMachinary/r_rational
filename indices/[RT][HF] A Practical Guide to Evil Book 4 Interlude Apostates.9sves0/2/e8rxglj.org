The transition between subjects is a bit confusing. Am I correctly understanding the reason his parents lied about Keter was because they didn't want Masego to find out enough about apotheosis to attempt it on himself?

Regardless, given the title of the chapter I think it's very likely that this represents a definite break between Masego and his father, leaving Cat and knowledge as his only allegiances.
