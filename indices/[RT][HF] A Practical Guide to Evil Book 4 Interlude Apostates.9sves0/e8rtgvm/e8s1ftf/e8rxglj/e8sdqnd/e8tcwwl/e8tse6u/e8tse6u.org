I think we may have different definitions of "soul" here. A soul is your personality, memories, mind, etc., everything you /are/, given nonphysical existence.

Obviously, her soul isn't the same as when she started. But that's, as you pointed out, something Masego already knows all too well. And, as souls are insubstantial representations of who you are, they're expected to change, as "who you are" changes.

Unless Winter obliterated her original soul (and I think Masego would have noticed /that/), or the word "soul" means something different in this 'verse, then I think Cat is, by definition, still Cat, because "Cat" is the person who has Cat's soul.
