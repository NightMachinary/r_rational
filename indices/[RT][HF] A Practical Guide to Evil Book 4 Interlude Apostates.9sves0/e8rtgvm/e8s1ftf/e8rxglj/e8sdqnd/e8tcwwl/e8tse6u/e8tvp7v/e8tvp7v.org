I think that, if souls can be changed by magic rather than by something we would recognize as a normal personality change, we have to say that they aren't simply "who you are." "Who Catherine is" is not just a function of what she's been through and what she thinks about it, it's also a function of how much ice magic she's currently throwing around.

The thing Warlock is worried about is Catherine and Masego's /personality/ - he believes that his son would act like a different person as a result of becoming immortal, even if the label on his soul still technically said "Masego's soul."

As an analogy, if someone hacks your Reddit account and starts posting angry screeds about Scottish independence, then your posts are still made by "Nimelennar," but they clearly have a different personality. Even if you say "Nimelennar, by definition, is the person who has this account," that doesn't answer the question of if the account has a different personality in it now.
