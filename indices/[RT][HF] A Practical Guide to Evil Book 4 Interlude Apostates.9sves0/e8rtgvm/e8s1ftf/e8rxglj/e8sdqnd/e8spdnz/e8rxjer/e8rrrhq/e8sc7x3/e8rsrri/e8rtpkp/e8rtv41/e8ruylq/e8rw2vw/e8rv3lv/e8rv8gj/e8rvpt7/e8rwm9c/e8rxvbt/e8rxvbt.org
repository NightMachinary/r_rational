Continuity of consciousness is a pernicious illusion. If we really believed we had it, we would mourn everyone who went under anesthesia as having died, as the process makes it temporarily impossible for the brain to support consciousness. If you have ever gone under, no mind which could appreciably have been called yours existed until you woke. A complete interruption.

Therefore, since the universe cannot tell the difference between two copies of me, and because we already ignore a process which completely turns us off temporarily, the fact that this situation is only strange by the number of extant mes temporarily increasing rather than decreasing is irrelevant. The outcome is the same.
