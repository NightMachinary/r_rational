It's a bit of a fuzzy line. The amount of time necessary for the two of our utility functions to vary significantly. As I am now, I would be perfectly happy to take a bullet for myself if it earned other me utility.

I would put the time in terms of decisions, after around 5 'major' (actively choosing something rather than subconsciously) decisions I feel we would diverge enough to be considered different people. At that point it would be murder.
