How so? One could argue that every time you go to sleep there is a break in consciousness, and as such the person who wakes up is fundamentally different. Following your chain of logic, going to sleep would be equivalent to killing ones-self, which in my opinion is ludicrous.

By definition, if two things are identical, they are the same. I guess a counter argument would be that the difference comes from their /position/ (referencing how electrons are all fundamentally the same, yet we know that there is more than one electron in the universe), but that ultimately feeds into the initial point I made. If you get drugged and moved 20 miles while you sleep, and wake up in a different position than you normally would be, you're still you.

There's an argument to be made if there's more than one /you/ existing at a time, but even then I'd argue that they are both you, just different instances. (Again, electrons). These "yous" can go on to do and be different things, while still fundamentally being you.
