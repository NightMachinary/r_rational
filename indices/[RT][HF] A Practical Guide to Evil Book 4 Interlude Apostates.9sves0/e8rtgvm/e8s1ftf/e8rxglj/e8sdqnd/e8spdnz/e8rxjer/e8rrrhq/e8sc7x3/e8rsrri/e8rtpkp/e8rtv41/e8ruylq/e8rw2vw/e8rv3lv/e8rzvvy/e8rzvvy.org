A mad scientist approaches you and offers a million dollars to you, if you go through a procedure for him.

He has a machine that will make a perfect copy of you, down to the atomic level. The copy will have your mind, memories, body, scars, tattoos and implants and everything else, perfectly. There will be no interruption of consciousness, you won't even faint.

Your original body will be killed in the process.

Do you take the money?
