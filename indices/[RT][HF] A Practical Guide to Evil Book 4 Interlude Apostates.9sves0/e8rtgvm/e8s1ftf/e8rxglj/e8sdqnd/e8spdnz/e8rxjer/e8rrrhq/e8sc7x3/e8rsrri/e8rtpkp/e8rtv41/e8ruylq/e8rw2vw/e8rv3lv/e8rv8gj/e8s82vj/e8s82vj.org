Thing is there is a difference. In the dead kings case and others they had to die, thus destroying the continuity of their mind. In a world where souls are an undisputed fact, that likely makes them copies rather than the original.

However Cat never did that. Her continuity has been preserved. It has also been demonstrated that she still has a soul, and at least Masego has seen it and still believes it to be her original, however mangled. As such she is no copy, but mearly an evolution of the original.
