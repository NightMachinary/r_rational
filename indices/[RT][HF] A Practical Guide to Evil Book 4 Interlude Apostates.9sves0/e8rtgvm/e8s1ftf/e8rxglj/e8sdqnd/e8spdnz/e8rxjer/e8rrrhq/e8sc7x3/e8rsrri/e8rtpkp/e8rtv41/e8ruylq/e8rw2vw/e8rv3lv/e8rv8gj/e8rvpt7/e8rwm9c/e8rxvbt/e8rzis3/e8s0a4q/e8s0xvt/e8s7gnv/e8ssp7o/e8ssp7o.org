Sleep is a little different. You might consider deep sleep an interruption, but you are still you while dreaming. Furthermore, the brain is still looking for serious, immediate threats like having been stabbed or very loud noises, and can rouse itself if those occur. Sleep is a decreased state of consciousness, to be sure, but someone sufficiently determined to believe in personal singularity could, not unreasonably, hold that sleep-them also qualifies as them for their purposes.

Anesthesia, on the other hand, induces a state where all the parts of the brain that are supposed to fire in unison instead fire in a slow, seconds-long wave moving from the front of the brain to the back. It is utterly unlike anything you find in normal operation. Furthermore, people under anesthesia often report going to sleep and then immediately waking in recovery with no percieved time gap. You still feel like time has passed while sleeping (although less of it) because the part of the brain which tracks the passage of time doesn't completely shut off during sleep. Anesthesia interrupts that as well, hence the percieved teleportation.
