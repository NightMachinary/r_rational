Depends on how much faith I have in the machine actually working as described.

Given that he's offering that kind of money for what should be extremely trivial effort on my part I am skeptical of that and would likely decline on that basis unless I have compelling reason to believe it does work, and I'm not going to then get aprocehed by a lawyer representing my original self or some otehr bullshit of the sort associated with mad science.

If I do have faith in the system to work about the only issues I have with variations of the process are the ethics of what happens to the original (my preference would be for him to survive or to be renderd uncocius at the start of the procedure and terminated without waking up, but for a mullion bucks I'm willing to not ask too many follow-up questions). Also I'd probably ask if new body has to be an exact duplicate or if i can make improvements. I wouldn't be terribly worried about losing consciousness or there being a period where we're both awake as long as the one that walks away with the money still has my memories up to the start of the procedure can insert himself into my life and considers himself to be "me".
