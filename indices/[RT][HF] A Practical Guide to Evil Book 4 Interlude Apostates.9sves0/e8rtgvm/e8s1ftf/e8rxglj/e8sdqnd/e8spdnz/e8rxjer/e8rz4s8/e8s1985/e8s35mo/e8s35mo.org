Basically.

I just struggle a little bit with that, because there's no real way of knowing what problems it can or can't solve trivially, and it's used often enough that it can be a bit of a deus ex machina.

Plus we end up with chapters like this one, where half of it is an essay about magic which ultimately doesn't have any real impact upon our understanding of the main magic users at all. Personally I'm not a huge fan of that, if you couldn't tell.
