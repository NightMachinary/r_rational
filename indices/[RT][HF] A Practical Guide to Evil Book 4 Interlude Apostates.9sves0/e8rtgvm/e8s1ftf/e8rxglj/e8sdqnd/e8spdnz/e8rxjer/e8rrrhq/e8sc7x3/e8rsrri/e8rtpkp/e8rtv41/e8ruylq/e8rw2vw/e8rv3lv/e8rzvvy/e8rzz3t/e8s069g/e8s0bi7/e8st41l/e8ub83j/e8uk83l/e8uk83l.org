The problem is that the term "original" doesn't make sense as applied to duplicated consciousnesses. We use the word to differentiate between copies and the copied, but we've never copied anything which can have its own opinions on that matter. Given that neither of them can tell the difference between themselves, it is equally valid to say that either of them is the original. They both have that right.

Consciousnesses aren't objects. You can't touch them. Discriminating between them for their origins is already frowned upon basically everywhere for precisely this reason. They are, philosophically, something /more./ Why are we trying to find something new to discriminate for?
