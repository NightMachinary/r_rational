  Right, but she's left her villainous Name behind for now....The Black Queen is not the same animal as Squire.
#+end_quote

Cat's not actually the Black Queen. Nominally she's still the Squire, although most of her power comes from being the SOMN. (See book 4 chapter 10).

As to whether Cat's left /villainy/ behind, it's worth noting that still has an Evil Name, is apparently made of Winter now (itself a force linked to villainy) and the Gods Below are still trying to give her (poisoned) gifts. But most importantly, Cat still considers herself to be a villain.

  Things changed after Second Liesse; Diabolist's ritual and Malicia's complicity have pushed her towards the Accords.

Right, but Cat was still rejecting the "justifications only matter to the just thing" since well before Liesse - Pointing to that as the cause doesn't make sense in the context of her catch phrase.

And even if it did, you have to figure that a change in Cat's attitude to her defining words, the one's that let her challenge the heavens themselves, would have been dealt with in the text.
