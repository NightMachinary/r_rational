  *Justifications matter only to the just*
#+end_quote

Speaking of, whatever happened to that?

The last time that was mentioned in the story was chapter 61 which was a /rejection/ of the phrase, both because of it's Evilness and because even Cat doesn't think she holds to it. The time before that was chapter 1, where Hakram threw it back at her, and she rejected it there as well. The last time she invoked the words and meant them was book 2, which is how many hundred thousand words ago?

Even outside of the specific phrase, Cat is constantly justifying herself and questioning the justifications of others - it's clearly very important to her. This has even been directly pointed out to her a few times.
