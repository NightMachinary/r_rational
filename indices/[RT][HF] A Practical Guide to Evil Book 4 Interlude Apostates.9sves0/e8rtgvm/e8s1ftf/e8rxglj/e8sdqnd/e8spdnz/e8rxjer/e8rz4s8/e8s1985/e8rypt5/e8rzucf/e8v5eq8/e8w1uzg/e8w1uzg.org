No, but after multiple essays about how magic works, I'd like to at least have an idea of the limits of our main magic users. It's part of a broader issue where, without really knowing the limits of magic ahead of time, it can be a bit deus ex machina-ish when it's used to resolve conflicts and solve problems.

Take, say, food shortages in Callow. This is a problem that's we've been building up to for a long while. Can Masego solve it, help in a limited way, or is he powerless here? We have no real idea where he falls on the spectrum here. Cat thought about asking him help with the devastation of southern Callow's farmlands, but we never saw that conversation or what resulted from it.

Can he help out? How much can he help out? What would the costs of that help look like (if any)? Does he have things he could do that he hasn't mentioned because he doesn't really care about people starving? How concerned should we be about this situation, if the magical demigod can potentially pull a solution out of nowhere?

There are so many questions here, and no real way of knowing what the answers are short of waiting for an answer to be given after the fact. And this is just one example.
