Interesting analysis. I agree with most of it (though I like the jargon); but the talk between Masego & his parents is interesting in multiple ways:

1) It displays a struggle between autonomy(of Masego) and (benevolent) guardianship(of his parents towards Masego)

2) It displays the expectations Masego still has towards his parents; he expects them to act in a certain way

(IF you raised me to fear nothing but ignorance, THEN you shouldn't act against this value you have instilled in me; e.g. you should never keep secrets from me that I want to learn)

3) Masego still fails to understand both the motivations of his parents and their freedom to choose and act contrary to his expectations of them -> this is why is is feeling "betrayed" and hurt

4) Tikoloshe & Wekesa, however, have underestimated Masego's desire to learn and strength of character; the Time spent with Cat & the Woe have given Masego the strength to stand up for himself even against his parents (He also has never encountered "limits" from their parenting before, which is why this matter is a BIG DEAL to him)

Finally, the chapter ends with "Arc words" from Masego - just as Black's *I do not kneel*, Catherine's *Justifications matter only to the just*, Masego has found his voice: *I do not flinch*.

And that is pretty awesome.
