  Definitely a Ship of Theseus situation.
#+end_quote

Not quite how I see it. Cat's situation would only be analogous to the Ship of Theseus if instead of being slowly replaced, the ship had been burned down in a single night and Theseus had then gone and bought a new boat that was exactly the same. The question of 'is this a different ship,' seems rather easy to answer when the ashes of the old ship are still settling into the silt of the harbor.
