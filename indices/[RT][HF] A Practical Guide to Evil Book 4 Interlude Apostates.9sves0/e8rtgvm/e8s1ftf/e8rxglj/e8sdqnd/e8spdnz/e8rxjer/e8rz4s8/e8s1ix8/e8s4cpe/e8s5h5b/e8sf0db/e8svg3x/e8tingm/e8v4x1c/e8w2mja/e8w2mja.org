  When Cat says justifications only matter to the just, she's mocking them. "Oh, you want me to justify myself? Is that right? Well, if you want my justifications, I'll have yours first!"

She really wasn't though. We saw what that phrase was supposed to mean on three separate occasions. Again, when it was set up before the climax of book 2, Cat was using the phrase to tell herself she was unconcerned with whether she was morally justified in killing a person.

There's not really evidence that the entire time there was a secret meaning unbeknown to Cat herself, and there would be issues if there were.

  But that's not what they are. The Gods Above are no more just than the Gods Below

Not according to EE:

#+begin_quote
  I don't recall ever stating that. The Gods Above and Below do roughly correspond to “lower case” good and evil, as far as entities that far removed from mortals can be understood. That neither side of the equation intervenes directly means there's a lot of room for interpretation in the respective philosophies they preach, but the bare bones are there.

  "not brainwashing everyone in a 49 mile radius just by existing for a few seconds" are. Even the Choir of Justice is arguably unjust, as it creates monsters who kill whenever a coin comes up tails and who tolerate monsters like Tariq.

The Angels promote extremism because they have an extreme perspective. Look at Hanno's extra chapter:

  They showed him, then. What it was they saw

  The endless shifting tapestry that was all the decisions that were made and could be. The impossible lay of action and consequence, of motive and result. It was too much. It was too much for him to see, to understand. The boy screamed, felt all that he was fray as he glimpsed a whole he had never been meant to glimpse. The sum of all that was and would be, the culmination of endless paths. Hanno felt feathered wings envelop him, cold arms of metal embrace him closely. He was blind, now, and had never felt more blessed.

The angels have extreme judgements, because they have no need for moderation when they can just make calls based off of a perfect understanding of everything. Is it alien and inhuman? Definitely. But they themselves are alien and inhuman - that's the point and that's why Hanno defers to them in the first place. It's an Omniscient Morality License played disturbingly straight.
