The existence of the Serenity casts doubt upon the whole "limitless torment" thing as well. Some of the Hells are certainly like that, but we don't know about all of them.

Also, way back when Cat entered the Tower for the first time it was mentioned that demons can destroy souls entirely. The likelihood that any given soul in a Hell which ever contains demons gets eaten approaches one over infinite time, so it's really asymptotically limited torment.
