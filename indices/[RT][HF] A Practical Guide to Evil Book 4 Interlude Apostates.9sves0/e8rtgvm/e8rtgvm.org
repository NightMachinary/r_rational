Warlock's theory is interesting, but Masego's argument is correct, people change all the time. Second Liesse was a traumatic event for Catherine and even now she regrets not being able to stop it, and it's obvious that such an event would change a person. Masego's doubts can be attributed to either winter influence or Cat just being more cautious after losing so much, or even part of the burden of Queenship. It will be interesting to see how she plans to transfer her mantle though.
