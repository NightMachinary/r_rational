I understand the Warlock's point, and think that generally people are underestimating two things:

1. The potential of an imperfect copy. At what level of fidelity is a copy no longer the same thing? This isn't quite the same thing as the ship of Theseus question, because it would be like if the ship got a redesign every time a new part was added.
2. That different physical forms may have different effects on thought processes. The way we store information in our brain and act on it may be quantum, and thus impossible for a normal computer replicate let alone magic or elemental fae powers.

However, we have evidence that this is not the case for Cat. When the Saint of Swords cut Winter, her body changed into a human again. This implies that Winter is a layer running on top of her thoughts and body, and something of her true self remains.
