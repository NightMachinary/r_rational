Definitely a Ship of Theseus situation.

But I disagree, a man is more than a sum of his parts, especially in a world with Roles. Even in real life, our cells are constantly replaced over years with frequent breaks in consciousness yet we remain ourselves. Catherine will only "die" between her mortal life and her new life as a winter abomination if such a death had made her utterly inconsistent with the way she was before, and as a reader I see no such sign.

Or to frame it another way, we are different from one instance to the next, changed from experience and environment. Every journey would thus never be finished, as one would return as a different person. A man going to sleep at night would be a different man when he wakes at dawn. He will thus die uncountable number of deaths between cradle to grave, especially if he seeks out life-changing experiences. The question itself is a meaningless pursuit.
