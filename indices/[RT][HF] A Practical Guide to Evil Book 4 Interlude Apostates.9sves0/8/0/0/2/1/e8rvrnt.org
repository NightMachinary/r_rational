  There's an argument to be made if there's more than one you existing at a time, but even then I'd argue that they are both you, just different instances. (Again, electrons). These "yous" can go on to do and be different things, while still fundamentally being you.

Sure, I agree that there's no fundamental difference between one and the other, except that they're still two separate people. If one of them dies, he's no less dead for there being a second one.
