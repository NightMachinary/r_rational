Except that the word original is a label which can only be placed from the outside looking in. In this scenario, there are two instances of a person which both have the right to claim that label because everything about them is identical. They are literally one person, just running concurrently. They will diverge over time, but in that moment? The copy has all the memories of being old, and the exact same right to claim them as its own. You can't say that they "didn't really happen" to the copy, or that they are any less valid, because the only way anyone knows what has happened to them is through the physical storage of memories. This physical storage is a subset of what was copied to make the additional instance of the person, so there is nothing to discriminate between.

Think about it this way. You go to get a duplicate made, for whatever reason. Both halves of the machine look identical, because the process can also be reversed to merge two instances of a person who both want to have the memories of both of them. Furthermore, the process requires soft anesthesia which prevents memory formation while you're inside the machine, and you don't get in unless they're sure it's working. Blah blah forming memories while having them scanned causes corruption in the data, or whatever. Point being, you won't remember which half of the machine you got in (this procedure is also to prevent discrimination against copies, with all the negative implications of all forms of irrational discrimination)(also, if you have ever had dental surgery, you have had this done to you, it isn't some massive ethical concern).

Once you're out, /both/ of you will be exactly identical, and you won't have any conflicting memories. Neither of you could claim, with any certainty greater than 50%, that you were the one who physically walked in the door that day and asked to be duplicated. If you planned to have "your copy" go and do something crazy then report back later, you won't be able to carry out that plan because you won't know which is which. You'll have to flip a coin instead. And, no matter what, if the one who "loses" the flip winds up dying for some reason, the only instance of you remaining will be the one who remembers winning. If you repeat that process a thousand times, the only remaining you would be the one who remembers winning a thousand times.

Your contention will be that the "copy" and the "original" should, ethically, be known, and that the process shouldn't be carried out unless this information can be known, but this contention isn't actually due to ethics on your part. You just have a firmly-rooted belief that the third-person singular pronoun should only ever refer to one consciousness running on one physically contiguous medium. With significant help, I've realized, given that our universe doesn't actually work that way, and given that we already know language is always at best a rough approximation of reality, this belief is irrational. Just because "I" and "you" have always only ever referred to the same physical instance, it doesn't mean they must always. The map is not the territory. Reality will one day disagree with the way our language is structured. It is, therefore, the language which needs to change.
