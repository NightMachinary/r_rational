The universe disagrees with you on this one. It can't distinguish between identical particles and atoms: one arrangement with the same properties is the same as all others. A copy of you made right now has the exact same right to call itself the original as the singular you which currently exists because the universe cannot tell the difference. To say otherwise is to say that the specific arrangement of atoms which currently contains you is somehow unique from all of the other possible arrangements which could do so. This would imply that you cease to exist every planck-second as particles shift and waveforms collapse.

You can't have it both ways. You cannot self-consistently say that all past versions of you are you, and also that the existence of a second you implies that one of them is not you. All past versions are exactly like copies of you, made in a different place, and reacting in different ways, to the way you would right now. They're even /less/ like you than what we propose, even. The copy would be exactly as you are now, while no past version of you can claim the same.

Ultimately, you are not your body or your brain. You are a pattern which is currently supported on those media. If you aren't, it implies that the bundle of matter which currently contains you has some unique, uncopiable you-ness about it. Saying that a copy of you is not you implies that you believe in souls. It implies that something metaphysical confers you-ness upon the universe, rather than you-ness being contained entirely within the material realm. Perhaps you are not a materialist. That would allow you to continue to believe as you do. But be warned: rejecting a hypothesis which has thus far been confirmed by every single test ever devised requires something more than logic.

It requires faith.

Do you have faith in your own singularity?
