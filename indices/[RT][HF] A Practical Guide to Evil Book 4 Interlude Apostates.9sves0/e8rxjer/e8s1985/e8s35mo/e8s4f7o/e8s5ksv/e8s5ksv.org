  The general idea is, if you put X amount of sorcery into a thing, then the other guy needs X amount of sorcery to counter it

This would be useful if the concerns about magic's capabilities centred around countering other magic. This is not the case.

It's also not particularly true? There have been plenty of times where skill and weird unexplained magical techniques are the deciding factors in sorcererous contests. Warlock vs Witch of the Woods, for one example.

  The specifics are story-dependent.

Not really? The vast majority of mages aren't Named. And stories don't seem to influence the laws of physics/magic so much as they empower Named or bend coincidence. I think this logic also shifts the problem; the /story/ itself is often ill-defined. But that's a whole other issue.
