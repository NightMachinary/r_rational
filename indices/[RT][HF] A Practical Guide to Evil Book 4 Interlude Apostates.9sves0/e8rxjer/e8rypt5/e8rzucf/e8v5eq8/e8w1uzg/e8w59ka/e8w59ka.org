The entire magical tradition of Praes going back to the creation of the Wasteland has tried to come up with solutions to their food shortage. Their only solutions have been mass human sacrifice for marginal, temporary fertility, and making war upon Callow. Heirophant is powerful, but it seems apparent that magical power does not aid in that regard. Perhaps certain heroic Named mages could do sacrifice-free fertility rituals, but the Gods Below are unlikely to give such power to those they patronize.

The setting itself doesn't make sense if Masego is a food machine. Therefore, he isn't.
