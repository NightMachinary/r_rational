At the same time, lots of the rules of sorcery introduced thus far were brought up in the context of the characters breaking those rules (often with Named shenanigans).

And discussing the relative advantages between Praesi Trismegistan, Procerean Jaquinite, Miezan Petronian, Gigantes Ligurian, Baalite/Ashuran Sabrathan, amongst others, doesn't help distinguish between what Hierophant or Warlock can or can't do when we know they're deeply familiar with all of these fields. I'm curious if you can tie their perspectives and focuses to these different theories, because I sure can't.
