Why would the Heavens flinch when told that justifications only matter to the just if they know themselves to be just? It would be tautological to them. "Why yes, justifications matter to us because we are the embodiment of Justice, thanks for stating the blindingly obvious." They would have just kept on with the forced brainwashing because being the embodiment of justice means that no spoken justifications are even required.

But that's not what they are. The Gods Above are no more just than the Gods Below, and the Choir of Contrition /know/ that. When Cat says justifications only matter to the just, she's /mocking/ them. "Oh, you want me to justify myself? Is that right? Well, if you want my justifications, I'll have yours first!" They flinched because they had no answer to that. Justice is an alien concept to them, just as love, and hope, and "not brainwashing everyone in a 49 mile radius just by existing for a few seconds" are. Even the Choir of Justice is arguably unjust, as it creates monsters who kill whenever a coin comes up tails and who tolerate monsters like Tariq.

The concept of justice appears, in the Guideverse, to be entirely manmade. Neither Above nor Below really champion it. That is the true meaning of Cat's motto, it seems. If justice only comes from humanity, then the Gods must be defied no matter the costs. Justifications only matter to the Just, and if only we are Just, then we only need to justify ourselves to ourselves.
