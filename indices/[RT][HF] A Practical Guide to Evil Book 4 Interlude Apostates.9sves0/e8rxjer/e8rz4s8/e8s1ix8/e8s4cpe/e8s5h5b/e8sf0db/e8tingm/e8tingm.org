But that doesn't work at all with how the phrase was introduced.

Cat first said it in Book One, right after fulling embracing her role as a villain and deciding she was okay with being on the side of Evil. It was meant to be an answer to Will's question ("how can you possibly justify working for these Tyrants?"), and it was an answer strong enough for her name, which had left her at the time, to come back out to play.

The next time she mentioned it was her deciding it didn't matter whether she was morally right after committing murder.

Then we get to the big one (and the last time the words aren't subverted), where the Heavens themselves demand contrition and justification for her actions, and when she tells them "justifications only matter to the just", they flinch.

Saying that this whole time the phrase meant precisely the opposite of what Cat meant kind of robs this events of their weight. And they had a huge weight, these words carried her through pivotal events.

A response to "you need to justify the terrible things you've done and will do" with "yes, justification are quite important" doesn't really work.
