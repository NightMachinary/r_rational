I think both Warlock and Tikoloshe incorrectly assume the Mantle has completely replaced Catherine when there's evidence to it simply covering up her human being. When the Saint of Swords damaged Cat's domain, she temporarily returned to her human body. The cases they bring up are the Dead King and the Revenant, whose original bodies were killed in order to achieve apotheosis. This is not the case here and if the mantle was ever usurped or destroyed, I think Cat would go back to being a human rather than being vanquished.
