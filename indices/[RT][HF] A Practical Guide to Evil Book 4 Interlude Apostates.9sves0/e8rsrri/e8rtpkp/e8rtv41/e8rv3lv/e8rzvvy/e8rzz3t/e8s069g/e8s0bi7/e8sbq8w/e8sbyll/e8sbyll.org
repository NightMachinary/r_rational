That's a really good question. Honestly, I'm not sure. I lean more towards it being binary though.

The mental imagery I have is two notes, moving out of sync with each other until suddenly they're no longer in unison. There /is/ a change as the pitches shift, but it doesn't reaaally matter until the difference is large enough to be noticeable, at which point it's very noticeable. Does that make sense?
