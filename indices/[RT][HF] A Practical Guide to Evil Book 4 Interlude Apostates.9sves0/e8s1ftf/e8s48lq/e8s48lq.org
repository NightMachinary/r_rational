My answer to both these points would be "Who cares?" It's like the teleporter problem all over again.

Even if current!Catherine has fundamentally different thought processes from past!Catherine, saying that "Catherine is dead" still feels extremely inaccurate by pragmatic metrics. Maybe she's been irreversibly altered by the mantle, but then again she's also been irreversibly altered by letting 10'000s of her countrymen die, becoming Queen, etc.

If the responsibility of Queenship can make her a radically different person (and it does, she's nothing like Book 1 Cat), but doesn't count as "being dead", then her becoming an imprint on the Winter mantle shouldn't count as "being dead" either, quantum brains or not.
