So we've got the first half of the chapter from Warlock's side, which is filled with a lot of magical jargon.

I'm not a huge fan of that, because a lot of what's said just comes off as noise and doesn't really help enumerate the limits of our characters. Although there were some interesting pieces amongst all this, like how wards cannot be placed over water, the focuses of Ashuran sorcery,some history, and a lot of detail about how Thalassina's defences function (after nearly 2000 words of that, I'm assuming that this city is going to be important moving forward).

Then there's Masego's half, which is dominated by talks about secrets and apotheosis.

I feel like Tikoloshe and Wekesa had a pretty damn good reason for keeping the secret they did (if they were telling the truth, which we have to question because Praesi), namely preventing Masego from turning himself into an undead zombie and suffering (what they consider to be) personality death. Like, Masego talks about how much he's grown since leaving his parents, but what he doesn't mention is how much room he had to grow. You couldn't reasonably say that the Apprentice when we first met him was someone who could be trusted to be responsible with some of the most dangerous knowledge around. He was a kid, and it was his parents job to protect him as best they knew how.

As to Cat and the ego death, I thought that was an interesting twist. There's been something different about Cat this book, which has been frustrating me a little, so an explanation for that is appreciated. For whether she's "gone" or not I figure people are going to have different definitions of personhood, and thus different answers to this question, but my take on it is that Cat is no longer Cat. She's something very close, sure, but if she has different values, is making different choices, and can't grow or change in the same way then she's not the same person on a static or dynamic measure.
