*Theory 1*: It's a social experiment, bro! The ultimate source of the powers will be irrelevant to the story. This will serve to further distinguish HStW from Worm, another "rational" superhero web serial. What will be important is how powers are distributed, such as based on population, land area, etc.

*Theory 2*: There is a significant level of correlation between a person's mental traits and the power they get. Most confidently, I believe that there is a link between a kid's altruism, or desire to change the world, and the strength of their power.

More tentatively, there are other traits which play a significant role. Ananya and Michael both have powers that control "elements" (plasma & electricity) on contact, which could suggest that they have other features in common. All three of the world-saving characters thus far (Simon, Noam, and Bodhisattva-kid) have powers that directly avert the loss of life.

*Theory 3*: Noam can control the mental states of his "passengers". This is about the only way I could find an elderly Orthodox Jewish man waking up in the backseat of his grandson's mind not believing it was an abomination in the eyes of God to be plausible.

*Theory 4*: Ananya is going to be the cause of the foreseen nuclear war. She's in India, affiliated with the military, and actively trying to make better weapons for her power. Pakistan is gonna get antsy.

*Theory 5*: The alphabet soup is going to tear itself apart. If history has taught us anything, it's that the CIA is an incompetent mess of competing agendas and personal aggrandizement. Once internal information hygiene fails on the super-kids, it's gonna be organizational anarchy.

Further speculation along the same lines: the main thematic conflict of the story will be the conservative old against the radical youth.

*Theory 6*: Bodhisattva-kid is responsible for the flesh trees, and Simon's gonna help him do it. Based on his power, the former is the most likely instigator of the phenomenon. Based on his actions to this point, it's probable that if he is responsible the flesh trees aren't as evil as we might think.

As for Simon, he's just wishy-washy enough to fall to the "dark side" if he thought it'd "save the world".

Also, are you posting this story to Space Battles or some other fiction sites, or waiting for the story to be more finished before you do?
