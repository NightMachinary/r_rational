The stuff about licenses for "faith healing" and "magic" is not made up. I never found a source that mentioned both, though, just one or the other, so I might be incorrect in portraying them as two different licenses rather than the same one, translated and described in two different ways. I also found nothing concrete about the requirements (or the hiring practices of psychic centers, for that matter), so a fourteen-year-old probably wouldn't qualify, but then again I don't know that he wouldn't, and if anyone could skirt the rules in either instance it would be someone with a superpower.

Nevertheless, I am probably about to learn that fully half of you are Russians whose suspension of disbelief has been irrevocably shattered... >:P

--------------

If you have any theories about what's going on, I'd be very interested in hearing them--and it'd be helpful, too, because while I'm pretty sure that the characters aren't stupid, I'm a little worried that some of them might be *too smart* and connecting the dots too quickly.

There are some things that I think should be clear to them at this point, and some theories that are laughably improbable to them and not to be considered, but I'd like to guard against the possibility that I'm not doing a good enough job of separating my knowledge from theirs.

This'll be relevant to the next couple of chapters.
