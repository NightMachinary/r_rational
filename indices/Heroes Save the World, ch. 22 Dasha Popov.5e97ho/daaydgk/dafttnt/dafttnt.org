Apologies for the delay in replying to this. Have not one, but nine [[http://i0.wp.com/kitchensanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Cookie-Experiment.jpg][experimental cookies]].

I can't comment too much, but with regard to Theory 3

#+begin_quote
  Noam can control the mental states of his "passengers". This is about the only way I could find an elderly Orthodox Jewish man waking up in the backseat of his grandson's mind not believing it was an abomination in the eyes of God to be plausible.
#+end_quote

the reason that I can't comment is different from the others: One of my beta readers wrote that part of the scene! (She's Jewish, so presumably it made sense to her, but I didn't ask for an explanation at the time).

I should also be safe in a quick reply to this:

  This will serve to further distinguish HStW from Worm, another "rational" superhero web serial.
#+end_quote

I have actually spent a lot of time worrying about distinguishing it from Worm, not least because I've been working with this idea (off and on) for six years now, give or take, long before I was really aware of Worm. I'm confident that it's going to stand on its own, but even so, I /have/ changed character abilities and other elements in order to distance the story that much more. As an example, when I first came up with Yuka's chapter, years before I had come across Worm, her best and only friend would refuse to acknowledge their relationship when they were in public because Yuka had become the school pariah. Obviously, this was way too close to Taylor and Emma (and, now that I think of it, Yuka shares Khepri's power, so the similarities would have been that much stronger...) and I had to get rid of it.

(Amusingly, though: Most of the character names are created a more or less randomly, the only constraint being that the list I was "rolling" from was made of the most common names from that country, adjusted for region or ethnicity where necessary. One of the names to come out of that process? "Sophia Taylor." Everything can be in flux until it appears on screen, especially character names (hell, I changed some names /after/ they appeared, because it turned out they didn't work!), but I'm strongly tempted to keep this one.)

  Also, are you posting this story to Space Battles or some other fiction sites, or waiting for the story to be more finished before you do?
#+end_quote

I was posting on both SB and Sufficient Velocity, and then I stopped on account of low activity. I'm waiting to get more of a backlog, and then I'm going to be updating on a daily basis for a few weeks to see if that changes anything. If you'd prefer to read this on one of those sites, though, then I'll start the daily updates now (until such a time that they go back to twice-weekly, because they've caught up with the main site).
