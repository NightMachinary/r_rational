One minor style nitpick: you change point if view characters in the middle of scenes. You show "I" thoughts which indicates a firm third person, but then jump to other character's thoughts and feelings (not the viewpoint's guess/estimation of them) on occasion.

As someone who took creative writing extensively in college, it jumps out at me.
