When it comes to internet use, I'm not smart enough to find precommitments that would work because I'm not dumb enough that I would not be able to work around them, whenever my hyperbolic discounting brain decides to scrap everything that seemed important to me a day before. Even if I were rich and I could hire a guy to stop me from wasting time in such ways, I'd probably just offer more money to that guy than I originally offered until he'd give up. I'd have to find some really virtuous religious person that wouldn't be persuaded by money or anything else I could do.
