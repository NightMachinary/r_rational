In the first two decades of the 1700s, you have:

- The calculus controversy between Newton and Leibniz
- The War of Spanish Succession involving many of the major powers in Western Europe
- A Golden Age of Piracy (one of a few - this one was somewhat attributable to the end of the previously mentioned War of Spanish Succession which left thousands of trained sailors without jobs)
- Rise of modern banking in London
- First commercial steam engine (by Thomas Newcomen)

For a couple of years I ran a D&D campaign that was set in 1713 (with magic and dragons, naturally), and every week we'd go on some new adventure in a world as historically accurate as I could make it, but with all sorts of wacky D&D stuff added in. There's a wonderful series by Neal Stephenson (of Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon fame) called "The Baroque Cycle" that will teach you everything you want to know and more about that time period. I think part of the reason that I like it so much is that it's so often ignored.

Edit: Oh, and it's also part of the Edo period of Japan and a time of colonialism in basically everywhere that's not Europe. And Peter the Great! And a bunch of other stuff!
