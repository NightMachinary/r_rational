Ohhh, leave me alone! I've not been posting, but I have been checking up on [[/r/rational]] and [[/r/hpmor]] (and [[/r/math]], as it happens) from time to time. The beginning of June has meant an increase in free time for me, and I caught myself posting on [[/u/einstein_throwaway]] more and more ... Might as well stop pretending. A little bit of honesty never hurt anyone. (Err, actually, I can think of a few examples. But never mind.)

Oh, and maybe part of setting my password to a random alphanumeric string was ... purely accidentally pasting it into an old document on my rarely-accessed desktop? /whistles innocently/
