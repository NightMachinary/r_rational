I really liked it, but wouldn't recommend it if you don't like Stephenson. It spans from about 1660 to 1715, and includes loads and loads of historical research. In addition to all of the above, it covers:

- The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_fire_of_london][Great Fire of London]] in 1666
- The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna][Battle of Vienna]]
- The various political happenings of England (including several successions)
- The life and times of Isaac Newton (a primary character, though he never has a viewpoint scene)
- A search for the origins of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel][Damascus steel]]
- Cryptography and spycraft
- Metallurgy
- The creation of phosphorus
- Slavery and emancipation

And much more. If you can handle books that sometimes have multi-page digressions on arcane subjects (which I would guess is probable given the subreddit), then I'd say to give it a go.
