Glad you enjoy it - it's definitely a bit more work, because I write something like "Lois drove" and then spend ten minutes looking up what the laws for women drivers were in the 1930s (prohibiting women from driving was talked about, but never implemented - the biggest impediment was that for a long time cars were started with a manual crank that took a lot of physical exertion, but by the 30s the switch to electric start had mostly been made). But I've always liked the interwar period - it's my second favorite time period, with the other being the early 1700s.
