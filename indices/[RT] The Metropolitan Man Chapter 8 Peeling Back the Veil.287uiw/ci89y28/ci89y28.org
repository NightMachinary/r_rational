Corrections thread:

- You missed the line-breaks between the first two scene changes (Jimmy-Lois, Lois-Luthor).

- Also "not matter the circumstances" should be "*no* matter the circumstances" I think.

- And in your author's notes "Whether this was [x] or [y] is left as an exercise to the reader" should probably be "*Working out* whether this was..." :P
