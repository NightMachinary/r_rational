I've tried my best to keep a firm third person, jumping between characters only on a horizontal line. In this chapter it's meant to be:

- Jimmy Olsen
- Lois Lane
- Lex Luthor
- Lois Lane
- Lex Luthor
- Joseph Greene
- Hershel Whitman
- Lex Luthor
- Floyd Lawton

There are two violations of viewpoint that happen in this chapter - one when Lex is figuring out whether Superman can see Smallville, and another when Joseph "not his real name" Greene and his wife are introduced. I might go back and change those, but if there are any others, let me know and I'll correct them, since the current violations I at least knew about.
