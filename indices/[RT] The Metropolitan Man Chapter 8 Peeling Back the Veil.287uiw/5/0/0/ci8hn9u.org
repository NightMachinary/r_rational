One other minor nitpick is that a lot of the scene transitions are similar. It often starts out like this "X character did this." In a way this is good since it makes it clear who the perspective is from right off the bat, but if it's done too often in one chapter it gets noticeable. Otherwise another great chapter. I especially liked Luthor's reasoning on Superman's range of vision and the conversation between Lois and Luthor. You did a good job of showing the two simultaneous layers of conversation.
