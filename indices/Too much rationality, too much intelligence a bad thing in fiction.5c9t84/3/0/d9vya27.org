  Suppose the average level of intelligence in the world was what we'd consider to be IQ 140. The writers, naturally, would tend to be a bit smarter than that. Is it impossible for them to write organically good literature? Do they need to write stories about people as dumb as the characters in our world in order to be able to write stories? Or does the intelligence everywhere in the fiction just organically go up with nobody thinking much of it?

I think fiction in the IQ140 world would have all the same tropes and general plot elements that it does now, because those things are generated from the naturally incoherent human drives that were carved into the brain by evolution.

Stories and their tropes and cliches are a map of human drives (utility functions?) in all their messy and incoherent glory.

I think IQ140 world fiction would differ from reality in the intricacy and intelligence of the justifications provided for why the story is following those age old tropes and cliches, just as Worm is "better" than standard stupid superhero stories in the increased intricacy and robustness of the explanations provided for why the characters are doing the exact same things they do in stupid superhero fiction -- still fighting each other because of shard conflict drive, Reed Richards is still useless because Simurgh, etc.

I think this pattern would continue in worlds of increasing average intelligence, right up until the intelligence was high enough that humans could alter their utility functions, at which point their fiction would become unintelligible to us. If they still felt a need to have any.

Good writing is the use of intelligence to justify stupidity, to justify the story following the same old cliches in new ways.
