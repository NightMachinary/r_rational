Suppose the average level of intelligence in the world was what we'd consider to be IQ 140. The writers, naturally, would tend to be a bit smarter than that. Is it impossible for them to write organically good literature? Do they need to write stories about people as dumb as the characters in our world in order to be able to write stories? Or does the intelligence everywhere in the fiction just organically go up with nobody thinking much of it?

You can't actually write characters smarter than yourself in a certain sense. And in fact there's a sense in which everyone in HPMOR had to be dumber than I was or they would have just walked all over my authorial world and seen right through my plots. Further, the variety in the characters is me giving them different pieces and facets of myself, with nobody getting the whole thing, because then there wouldn't be anything left for the other characters. So in that sense I did have to write characters dumber than I am. But once I'm up against that limit, why would I go any lower? If I was in a world where I was average, I'd be able to write average stories for that world; so why shouldn't I just write those stories here?
