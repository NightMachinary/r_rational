  A laser gun being, "to some degree, almost a form of intelligence" is absurd. It's technically arguably sort-of symbolically resembling true enough to allow someone to make a devil's advocate argument from while leering skeptically at them, but not much more than that. It's stretched so thin that whatever truth it has is useless.

Got it. So what you are saying is that any concept can be argued into resembling any other concept if you use enough intermediate steps and qualifications. However, the more steps you use the less predictive power the model has. In this case -- greater intelligence makes laser pistol - lesser intelligence uses laser pistol - lesser intelligence is using a product of greater intelligence meaning lesser intelligence is using an aspect of great intelligence -- is in your opinion too many steps for the resulting model to have predictive power, for it to have the quality of truth.

Obviously this kind of argument can be taken to absurd extremes. Lets have an example.

You mentioned the internet. Have you ever thought about how much the internet is like a chocolate donut? Both the internet and a chocolate donut contain information, both the internet and a chocolate donut are made out of a myriad of lesser things, molecules in case of the chocolate donut and linked computers in the case of the internet, both a chocolate donut and the internet have a dark side, both a chocolate donut and the internet have Theobromine in them (although the internet requires you to order the Theobromine while the chocolate donut requires you to eat the donut -- but then ordering and eating are /almost/ the same concepts, both involve consuming something), both a chocolate donut and the internet have pornographic elements (who hasn't looked at the hole in a chocolate donut and thought about the sexual implications?), and neither the internet nor a chocolate donut could exist on the surface of a star without vaporizing.

Presto! The internet is exactly the same as a chocolate donut. Any differences are too small to mention.
