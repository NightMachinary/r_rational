"Fiating intelligence is also interesting." Yet, you started this whole thing because you felt that it wasn't interesting. Your thoughts seem pretty muddled about it, honestly. A laser gun being, "to some degree, almost a form of intelligence" is absurd. It's technically arguably sort-of symbolically resembling true enough to allow someone to make a devil's advocate argument from while leering skeptically at them, but not much more than that. It's stretched so thin that whatever truth it has is useless.

Fiat is merely fiat, and if you have a plot that is nothing but fiat, you have an amateurish plot. It's exactly the sort of thing people have been getting sicker and sicker of since the internet made it easy to share one's insights on seeing through it.
