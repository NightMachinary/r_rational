All exercise of power is intelligence, isn't it? Just moving your arm is an exercise of intelligence. Even instinct is intelligence, just limited intelligence that is not conscious. Even if your body had all the potential power in the universe, could do absolutely anything because a vast amount of previous intelligence had gone into giving it those capabilities, without some onboard intelligence, such as a brain, it would just sit there. In fact, it wouldn't even breath.

All these concepts you are taking to extremes /are/ aspects of intelligence. Being able to move fast is a product of intelligence. If you are more intelligent, then you can figure out how to move faster. Being able to stuff yourself until you explode is a function of power over your environment, which is a function of intelligence, and actually stuffing yourself until you explode is an example of using too much power to fulfill a goal that becomes destructive if you do it too well or too much.

Even evolution is a form of extremely stupid intelligence, blindly seeking local optima over vast time scales. Your body is a product of intelligence.

Shouldn't characters have a greater chance of acting optimally as their intelligence increases? Wouldn't the, ahem, intelligent thing to do in any given situation be to act optimally?
