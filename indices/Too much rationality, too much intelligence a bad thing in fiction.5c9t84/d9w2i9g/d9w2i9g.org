You're making things absurd by insisting that they be taken to absurd extremes or not done at all.

You keep asserting that intelligence, in sufficient quantities, is essentially omniscience and omnipotence. Sufficient for what? Sufficient for omniscience and omnipotence. And?

You can say the same thing about lots of stuff. Fiction should be about slow characters instead of fast ones, because at his greatest the Flash is essentially invincible and so leads to boring stories. Fiction should be about weaklings, because well, at the extreme strong characters are literally omnipotent. Fiction should be an endless sprawling mess of exposition and minute detail and meaningless irrelevant side plots, because at the extreme if you just say what needs to be there to understand the story, you just explain the final novelty in the fewest words possible.

Fuck yeah it's boring if you do it like that.

Why stop at fiction? Medical care is a bad thing because at the far end, we'll bankrupt the entire world trying to keep a single human vegetable alive one more moment. Eating is a bad thing because eventually you'll explode like a monty python sketch.

Oh, wait. You said "Too much" intelligence is a bad thing.

That's a tautology. Too much anything is a bad thing by definition. It's right there in the "too much" part.

That doesn't mean that writing stories where the characters are as intelligent as real-world smart people is in any way worse than writing stories full of characters who are as stupid as real-world stupid people who are actively trying to re-enact their favorite stories about stupid people. Don't give me some shit about how smart people always act optimally and so their stories are repetitive and predictable. If you're having that problem, your real problem is that you have shitty characters and not enough conflict in your story.

Every character should have multiple valid and sane desires of debatable relative importance. They make decisions that are hard to predict because they actually value the results in slightly different ways that are hard to predict, and that interact in ways that are hard to predict. The rest of them cope /well/ but not /perfectly,/ because they're intelligent /people,/ and not the living avatars of the SmartForce.
