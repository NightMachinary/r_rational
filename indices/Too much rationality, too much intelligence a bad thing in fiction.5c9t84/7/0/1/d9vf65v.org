Gotcha. FWIW, the canon Animorphs books were /unsettlingly/ heavy and dark, dealing with issues like PTSD and suicide and the moral justification of murder and war crimes and so forth. That was interspersed with a lot of the joy of becoming an animal, but it was more serious, on average, than (say) Avatar: The Last Airbender.
