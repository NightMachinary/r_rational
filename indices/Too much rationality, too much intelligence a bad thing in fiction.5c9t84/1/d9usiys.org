I take the opposite perspective from yours on a number of issues here, which makes me think this might be more about preferences than objective judgement.

For me, the more unintelligent characters there are, the faster the outcomes become predictable, not the other way around. Unintelligent characters mean the story flows into the same tropes and wellworn paths that we've seen in the majority of fiction, because the majority of fiction doesn't involve intelligent characters. Maybe what you're saying is that stories with intelligent characters are too similar in outcomes to each other, but even then I'd argue that point.

Similarly, now that I'm older, throwing around flashy powers is boring when done by unintelligent characters. The less sense their actions make, the less engaged I am, because the more the veneer of suspense covering the fact that the fights are pre-scripted falls apart. I need smart application of powers to be entertained by even simple things like energy beams.

And you seem to be assuming that intelligent characters have equally ridiculous power levels, where the fight has to be over in an "instant." I don't see how that follows: the tools someone has at their disposal and the intelligence to use those powers has to be balanced by the writer to make the story entertaining: if they can't do that, it's their failure as a writer, not the result of having intelligent characters.

As for making realistic mistakes and satisfying human experiences of not being hyper intelligent all the time, that's also down to writer skill. There's a difference between handing a character an Idiot Ball to make them do stupid things just to propel your plot along and generate conflict, and giving them actual reasons to make sub-optimal choices, such as reducing their information, trickery on the part of their opponents, or justifiably compromising situations, like having your thoughts clouded by anger or pain.

Overall I think a lot of these come down to the skill of the writer. Just making characters smarter doesn't make fiction entertaining. That's a separate aspect of the process.
