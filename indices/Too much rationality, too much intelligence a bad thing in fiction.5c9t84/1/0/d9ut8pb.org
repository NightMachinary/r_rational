  And you seem to be assuming that intelligent characters have equally ridiculous power levels, where the fight has to be over in an "instant." I don't see how that follows: the tools someone has at their disposal and the intelligence to use those powers has to be balanced by the writer to make the story entertaining: if they can't do that, it's their failure as a writer, not the result of having intelligent characters.

Well, I guess you could slow down things a little by having both intelligent characters almost completely paralyzed and their only "superpower" be their ability to move their eyes. :)

In the hands of a superintelligence even the littlest thing can be a super powerful super power. That's the whole argument that produces the AI in a box that can mind control its keeper with a text link. Prolonging it means the author is holding the characters back by the scruff of the neck.

  For me, the more unintelligent characters there are, the faster the outcomes become predictable, not the the way around. Unintelligent characters mean the story flows into the same tropes and wellworn paths that we've seen in the majority of fiction, because the majority of fiction doesn't involve intelligent characters.

  Similarly, now that I'm older, throwing around flashy powers is boring when done by unintelligent characters. The less sense their actions make, the less engaged I am, because the more the veneer of suspense covering the fact that the fights are pre-scripted falls apart. I need smart application of powers to be entertained by even simple things like energy beams.

Oh, I agree completely with this. As I grow older I require more intelligence in my fiction for it to engage me.

Where I may disagree is on why this is. Is it because I'm a greater person now that I'm older, putting away childish things, or is it because I require novelty for engagement, and intelligence is rarer than stupidity? If you could wipe your memory of all the flashy powers you've read about in books and seen in movies, forget the wellworn cliches of the genre and of storytelling in general, would you then be engaged by those stupid things just like before, and experience the same entertainment, the same fulfillment of your basic human needs in the medium of imagination?

Have you never experienced stumbling upon a new genre, rational superheroes for instance, and having the first thing you read in that genre be amazing, fulfilling all your "stupid needs"(basic human drives for dominance, pleasure, etc), and then found that you require more and more intelligence in all later things you read in the same genre to allow it to make it through your defenses against lack of novelty and into your mind so you could enjoy it?

Are stupid stories actually the perfect vehicles for satisfying your basic drives in imagination, but once you've read a few stupid stories you require increased intelligence (which as I've said is obviously rarer, requiring greater intelligence to write) for it to penetrate your "been there seen that" defenses against lack of novelty?

The base of this idea is that many human drives are stupid. I'm not saying they're bad, but they're stupid. They were not designed by something with intelligence in the first place, but by evolution, and they /require/ some stupidity to allow for situations where they can be satisfied. In a story where everyone is past a certain point of enhanced intelligence there is no room left for the satisfaction of stupid drives. What you are referring to as "good writing" is skill at coming up with extremely unlikely situations wherein even someone who is highly intelligent will have room to indulge stupid drives.

You require /really/ good reasons for intelligent people to act stupidly in the stories you read for it to be enjoyable. But they still have to act stupidly for it to be enjoyable.
