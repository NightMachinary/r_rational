  If you could wipe your memory of all the flashy powers you've read about in books and seen in movies, forget the wellworn cliches of the genre and of storytelling in general, would you then be engaged by those stupid things just like before, and experience the same entertainment, the same fulfillment of your basic human needs in the medium of imagination?

I think it's a mix of what's novel and what's intelligent. New things that are dumb are still dumb, and less enjoyable. They're still enjoyable, but less than they otherwise would be. Old things that are intelligent are enjoyable too, even if maybe not as enjoyable as something new and intelligently written.

  You require really good reasons for intelligent people to act stupidly in the stories you read for it to be enjoyable. But they still have to act stupidly for it to be enjoyable.

You're treating "act stupidly" as equivalent to "make mistakes." There's a difference, and it has to do with information available to them, context, character flaws, and so on.
