I guess it depends on how you define "too much intelligence". Twig, for instance, is about bio-engineered several-standard-deviations-above geniuses, and mostly feature characters making very smart choices against very powerful opponents, and yet because their resources are limited they end up having engaging action scenes and creative application of their resources.

Even when we get something close to a super AI (the primordial), the story deals with it in an interesting way.
