  Is it better to make the villains with greater resources less intelligent rather than needing probability manipulating entities and suddenly appearing robots to justify the heroes not just losing instantly? I'm not sure. And I get that the robots were probably a required artifact of the non-rational Animorphs, so I'm not really complaining that much about them.

Personally I think I would be enjoying it less if the villains weren't as intelligent and the Chee weren't included. I think it's all being handled very well, so it's balancing the various extremely powerful forces and the competing intelligences of the heroes and bad guys wonderfully, but if it were handled any worse it would likely fail on a number of levels, yes. Hence the point that writing intelligent characters in a story well requires intelligence and hard work.

  Also, I haven't ever read the non-rational Animorphs, and I was reconstructing in my mind what those books must have been about, which I was imagining was probably the joy of being able to become any animal and have all their skills and abilities with a human mind, and I was thinking about how much you had to squeeze and scrape to fit even a bit of that into a rational setting where the heroes and villains had enhanced intelligence without it endangering the heroes' goals, with people being stupid by having fun being their house cat or whatever and accidentally getting everyone killed.

Ha, that's... very little of what canonical Animorphs were about. I can totally see how you might think that though, and it would have made for a much less depressing book series :)
