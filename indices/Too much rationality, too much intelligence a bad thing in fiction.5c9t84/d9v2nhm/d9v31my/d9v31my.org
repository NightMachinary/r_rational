  You started this thought with r!Animorphs. I'm curious if the rest of the thought applies directly to r!Animorphs (i.e. whether you think it's bad/boring/less entertaining/more predictable fiction as a result), or whether your thoughts meandered further and it isn't a direct commentary. If you don't mind sharing, that is.

Not really a direct commentary. Animorphs was starting to give me that cold fearful feeling that there was no room for human stupidity/humanity in it (I've only made it to chapter 14). The thing that started my thought going in that direction was the fact that without the intervention of a previously unknown robot thing, by this point the heroes would all be dead. Or without the intervention of the God/fate/probability manipulating entities you keep hinting at. It felt like the hand of the author preventing a foregone conclusion from coming to pass (those with the most resources /will/ beat those with less resources if they both have equal intelligence, baring the whims of pure chance, and the author's hand forcing the plot to go as it should rather than as makes sense is generally disguised as the whim of chance. Or, you know, probability manipulating entities).

Also, I haven't ever read the non-rational Animorphs, and I was reconstructing in my mind what those books must have been about, which I was imagining was probably the joy of being able to become any animal and have all their skills and abilities with a human mind, and I was thinking about how much you had to squeeze and scrape to fit even a bit of that into a rational setting where the heroes and villains had enhanced intelligence without it endangering the heroes' goals, with people being stupid by having fun being their house cat or whatever and accidentally getting everyone killed.

Is it better to make the villains with greater resources less intelligent rather than needing probability manipulating entities and suddenly appearing robots to justify the heroes not just losing instantly? I'm not sure. And I get that the robots were probably a required artifact of the non-rational Animorphs, so I'm not really complaining that much about them.
