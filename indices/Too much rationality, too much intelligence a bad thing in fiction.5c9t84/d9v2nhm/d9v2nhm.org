You started this thought with r!Animorphs. I'm curious if the rest of the thought applies directly to r!Animorphs (i.e. whether you think it's bad/boring/less entertaining/more predictable fiction as a result), or whether your thoughts meandered further and it isn't a direct commentary. If you don't mind sharing, that is.
