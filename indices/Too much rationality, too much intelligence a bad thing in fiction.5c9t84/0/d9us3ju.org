While intelligence might limit some characters, I think it opens up so much more space realistically (I personally hate it when the "hero" of the story just happens to find "ultimate loot 1, 2 and 3" and "specific counter to not yet seen opponent 5" just by chance; but if the character is intelligent enough to send someone else to do a risky fetch quest and thus they don't get ambushed and then blackmails the "ambusher", that I can enjoy), though the morals may need to be a bit towards Blue and Orange Morality.

But I do think it is harder to write stories that are rational, I had DMed A DND5E game where I tried to have a few rational NPCs, it made it a lot harder...
