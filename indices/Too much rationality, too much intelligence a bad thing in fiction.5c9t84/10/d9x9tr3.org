Imagine that we live in a world that revolved around tic-tac-toe. We play the game with real suspense and curiosity about who is going to win. We write stories about these games! One day, some extraordinally intelligent writer comes along and ruins it all by writing a character that always drew or won, and worse explained it in a way that everybody else could understand, so now /everybody/ always drew in their games. That would be too much intelligence in character (from the perspectives of the people in that world).

Our world doesn't revolve around such simple games as tic-tac-toe, or even a much more complicated unsolved game like go. It's a much much vaster game. There is no one goal of the game, each player has their own variation which (on the object level at least) changes over time. Worse yet, we are embedded in this game, and so as players become more intelligent it becomes more interesting for those players. It's going to be a /very/ long time before humans can write intelligent enough characters to make this game as boring as tic-tac-toe.
