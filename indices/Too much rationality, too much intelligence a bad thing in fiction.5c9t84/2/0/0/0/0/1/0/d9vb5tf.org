Too many words in a story also eventually becomes anathema to storytelling, because the story eventually becomes longer than any human can hope to read in their lifetime.

That doesn't mean that stories that are longer are inherently worse, just because they're closer to that "law of narrative" that no story will ever realistically reach.

By the same logic, stories with intelligent characters are fine, even if "nigh omniscient" levels of intelligence make for a bad story.
