Off-topic, but I'd go so far as to say that increasing the length of a story is an inherent improvement, and that when someone says that a story should have been shorter, if their criticism has any merit, it's that there's something wrong with the contents that make up that length.

If a country is run by a small, corrupt circle of billionaire princes, and 99% of the population have nothing, the problem with the country isn't that it has too much wealth, but that the wealth is in the wrong place. The length of a story is like the wealth of a nation - an inherent good that may be mismanaged. I'm aware that this is an uncommon belief, but it's always been something I've held firmly.
