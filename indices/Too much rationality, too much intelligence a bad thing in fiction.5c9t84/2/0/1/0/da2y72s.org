That's true, but my thinking went that coming up with valid logical reasons for monologuing and duels to the death is an example of the author/world coming up with intelligently constructed valid logical reasons for the characters to act stupidly. That's claiming that monologuing and duels to the death have some kind of inherent intelligence rating to them, but I'm thinking of them as an example of wasteful, inefficient, and maladaptive behaviors that appeal to human drives and are hence fun for the reader, which the story needs to justify happening /even though/ the characters are intelligent.
