  You can totally have two superheroes monologuing at each other in rational fiction, but they do it because they're both trying to win the fight and trying to improve their public image at the same time. Or they're actually trying to convince each other and spare themselves the fight.

  And you can have neato fights, but those are largely dependent on how you do your worldbuilding. If you give someone the power to explode heads from a distance, then no, you're not going to get a grand epic battle out of it. But if it's not possible for two opponents to kill each other in an instant, and if terrain matters, and if there are other considerations to the fight beyond just life and death, and if etc. then yes, you can get good battles where two intelligent opponents are acting rationally.

You are basically saying that if you have intelligent characters then you need to have a more intelligent writer in order to allow /that writer to come up with better and more intelligent excuses for the supposedly intelligent characters to act in a stupid manner/ (but it's okay, because the world building/their public image totally justifies it, so you can then enjoy it because it's justified).
