That's essentially just complaining that Ron didn't get an intelligence upgrade along with everyone else. I don't think he was actually any stupider than in cannon. Didn't cannon Ron spend part of a book being horrible to Harry because he idiotically thought he was the Heir of Slythern or something?

Perhaps I should have said, /There was no place in that world for any human of average intelligence to be a person./
