I found your argument compelling until I read this thread and realized that you have a badly misinformed idea of what intelligence is and by extension what rational fiction is.

The Sherlock Holmes archetype (or, less controversially, the Encyclopedia Brown archetype) isn't a well-written intelligent protagonist; it's bullshit. Intelligence isn't a black box that magically outputs correct information.
