If I was intelligent enough I could build a distributed no sparrow shall fall nano camera system and and observe and comprehend everything in the world, and then I could watch you rolling those dice no matter what countermeasures you took and know exactly what you rolled.

Information acquisition is a function of intelligence. The only way for you to keep a true transcendent intelligence in the dark is to perform the dice roll outside its light cone. And even then it may be able to make some good guesses based on simulated realities and models of you and those dice.

Intelligence is power, power is intelligence, and I am defining power as the capability to shape the world according to your will (your goals).
