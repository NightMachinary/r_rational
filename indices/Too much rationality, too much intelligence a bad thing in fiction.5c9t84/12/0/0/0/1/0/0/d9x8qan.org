I rolled a die and got a number between 1 and 6, I divided that number by 3 and got a remainder of 1. What number did I roll?

Intelligence is bounded by /information/, no amount of intelligence will enable you to tell what number I got from that information. Likewise Sherlock Holms doesn't have enough evidence for the pronouncements in the book.
