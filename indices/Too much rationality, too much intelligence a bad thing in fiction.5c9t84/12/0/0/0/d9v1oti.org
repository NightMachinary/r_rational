  Intelligence is not omniscience.

It is. Sufficient intelligence allows you to deduce any knowable fact about reality. If an AI is intelligent enough it can run a simulation in its mind of all the thoughts a person will and can have, deduce all their memories from the evidence of reality (needing less information to deduce them as it gets more intelligent), and know everything they have done and everything they will do in response to any possible stimuli.
