Right. And the more intelligent you make the hero or villain, the more intelligent must needs be the justification why that intelligence didn't allow them to know the critical piece of information that would allow them to win instantly. And when the intelligence gets high enough there is no room anymore for uncertainty of any kind, nor for any story that would be interesting to humans. Because humans find uncertainty and stupidity (or things that can only exist under those circumstances) interesting and pleasurable.

That was kind of my point.
