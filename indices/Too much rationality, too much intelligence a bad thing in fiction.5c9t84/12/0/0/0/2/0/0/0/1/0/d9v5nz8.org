Sorry. Maybe it wasn't the best example. I have a tendency to think of all rational stories as superhero stories to some extent, because the characters generally get the superpower of enhanced intelligence right off the bat, which allows them to do more with less, and then it generally kinda turns towards wish fulfillment.
