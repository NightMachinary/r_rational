-The enemy is ofc also smart.

-As the hero is now not omniscient, it's possible that enemy has something he doesn't know.

-As the hero can't now simulate worlds in a nanosecond, as a hyperbole, he can have limited time to prepare.

It's not about if superintelligent superheroes can do more than I allow them to. It's about if author allows them to know everything, there is no story there and they could probably save everything by building a time machine and moving a pebble somewhere in the past.

If the hero knows everything his nemesis has and is going to do and has already prepared for everything, he has won already.
