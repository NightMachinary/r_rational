Right. All physical laws, and then knowledge of how the universe should organize based on those laws.

Of course, the AI doing this might need a planet's worth (or more) of resources to build itself sufficiently wonderful eyes to be able to see every detail of the molecular interaction inside the fairy cake to be able to deduce all this. . . And it probably couldn't deduce all things outside its light cone (the light of the events hadn't reached it yet). And there may be some Heisenberg uncertainty principle problems cropping up after a while. But, in principle, yes.

/Look, and I will show you the universe in a handful of dust./
