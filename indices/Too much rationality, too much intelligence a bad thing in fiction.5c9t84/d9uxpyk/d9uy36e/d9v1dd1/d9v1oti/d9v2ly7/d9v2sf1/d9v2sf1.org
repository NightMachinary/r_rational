Matter of degree. The all knowing AI gods was to prove it was possible. Super intelligent superheroes can do less than that of course, but my point was that they still might be able to do more than you were allowing. The difference between the smartest and the dumbest human is so tiny, after all, and the difference in what they can do is so great.
