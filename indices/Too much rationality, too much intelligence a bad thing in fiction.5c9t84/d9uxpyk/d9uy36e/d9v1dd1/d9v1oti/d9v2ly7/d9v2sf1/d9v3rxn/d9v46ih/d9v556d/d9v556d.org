Well my point kinda is that if you make an example of superheroes fighting, it doesn't make sense to try to imply they are extremely superintelligent if best they can do is a typical supervillain fight which ends because other kills the other one before they can escape. I think it was just a bad example if you were trying to talk about fucking intelligent instead of just somewhat intelligent.
