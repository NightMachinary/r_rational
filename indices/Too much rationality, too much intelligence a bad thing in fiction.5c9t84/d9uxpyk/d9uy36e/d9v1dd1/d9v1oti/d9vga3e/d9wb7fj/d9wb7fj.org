  Intelligence isn't a black box that magically outputs correct information.

You are actually saying that intelligence is not a black box that you feed wants, information, and effort into and that then spits back out solutions or possible solutions? Really? What the heck would you say intelligence /is/ then?

Are you saying that intelligence is not magical because it doesn't have to output correct information? But man's intelligence has put out quite a bit of correct information. As far as I know we are not now naked apes struggling to survive in the savanna. So, are you denying that if the box was better the information coming out would be better?

Sherlock Holmes is unrealistic, yes. But are you saying that if you made the black box better it is impossible that it could do the things Sherlock Holmes does? I'd bet if you made it better enough to do that, then it would be able to do a lot of other things Doyle never dreamed of, but are you arguing it is impossible to perform feats of deduction? And to perform them better if the black box worked better?

I don't get it.
