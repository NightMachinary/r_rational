I'm kind of confused by what you mean. Are you specifically talking about human characters? IMHO, if someone's intelligence is able to surpass instinctual human conditioning, they're either an enlightened being or an alien entity. Writing about characters with the level of intelligence you're implying isn't very realistic and would handicap the work, unless the whole point of the story is seeing their unique perspective. I honestly think it's all up to the writer and how they handle it.

You talk about there not being excitement in a fight between two intelligent opponents, but I completely disagree. I hesitate to use this as an example, but a show like Death Note wasn't exciting because of its flashy battles. It literally had none. It built up hype because of the escalating tension. It showed its character's line of thinking and created suspense with every decision they took. If a battle between incredibly smart individuals isn't exciting, it's not because intelligence diminishes fights, it's because of shitty storytelling. A good writer can make five seconds the most exciting/satisfying part of a story, just by its execution. A great one would make the build up to it just as exciting as the conclusion.
