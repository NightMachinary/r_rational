I'm going to wade in here because I think everybody is missing the point I would want to make.

Rational fiction featuring intelligent characters is only ever boring if there is only one, or perhaps two, clearly stated intelligent characters, using their brains to manipulate what are essentially underlings as they fight each other.

In good rational fiction, this is not the case. In good rational fiction, everybody is smart, and that means that there are so many players, and so many factions, that it becomes increasingly difficult to predict it all. That's part of why HPMOR was so interesting. We read is mostly from the perspective of intelligent, rational children, who simply did not know enough about their environment to fully understand all the gambits happening around them. They could be surprised. They could be ambushed, because with every move they made they were attracting the attention of new players with new motives they didn't know about.

To use your example from RTS games and perfect play; In good rational fiction, the hero goes in to fight the villain knowing he is good at RTS games and thinking he can beat them on that front. Only then halfway through the game it becomes apparent that the villain knew of their skill, and somehow skewed the game in their favour. Or the game is a distraction; somewhere else the villain's main plot is happening. In good rational fiction, players don't walk into perfect games where it is all about pure skill, not when the stakes are real. This is not the point of plotting (one of the hallmarks of rational fiction). In good rat fics, everybody and anybody is essentially cheating, and winning requires cheating better.

And in good rational fiction, if the main character did not think of this and take it into account (which they most likely haven't, unless it's the kind of boring story featuring super intelligent gods curb stomping the enemy), then they will only find out when the readers does and boom; suddenly you can have flashy action scenes, improvised battle plans, and all the other hall marks of fiction as they try to escape the 'ambush'.
