DayStarEld makes great points on intelligence. To add to that, rationality is merely acting optimally in order to satisfy your value-informed goals. Values are, I think, most often formed during one's upbringing. For example, a character raised on a cricket and ruminant farm that couldn't keep up its profits and was replaced with a factory farm, might value giving purpose to and having respect for all life. Their goals would relate to encouraging the latter and making the former a reality. No matter how intelligent you are, accomplishing those goals would prove a tremendous challenge.

Rationality means the alignment of your values, goals, and actions. It's up to the writer to decide how unique and interesting to make each of the three.
