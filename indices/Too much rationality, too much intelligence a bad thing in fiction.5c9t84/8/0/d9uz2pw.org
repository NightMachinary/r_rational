  Writing about characters with the level of intelligence you're implying isn't very realistic and would handicap the work, unless the whole point of the story is seeing their unique perspective. I honestly think it's all up to the writer and how they handle it.

Well, I want to learn how to do it, and do it well. Vernor Vinge manages it a little in /Marooned in Realtime/.

I never got into Death Note. I get that the base idea is "If you could knock anyone dead in the world you wanted, how would you use that to make the world a better place," but this crosscircuited with the idea "Lets kill people in prison who everyone /knows/ are totally guilty because our laws aren't strict enough already and we need to have more capital punishment and this show is a conservative commentary on how we need stricter laws and more punishment of criminals," and then I threw up a little in my mental mouth and resolved never to have anything to do with Death Note.
