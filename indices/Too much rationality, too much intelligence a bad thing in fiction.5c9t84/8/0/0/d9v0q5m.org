Yeah, that's why I tried to be careful when I mentioned Death Note. I wouldn't call it a /smart/ show, but it does have highly intelligent characters. I don't think it's about what you mentioned, though. Thematically speaking, it shows that Light is just a childish person with a god complex. I just enjoyed it as a good psychological thriller. It doesn't really explore any of the philosophical questions it raises, so I did end up disappointed with it in that regard.

On the subject of pulling off what you're talking about, I'd recommend focusing on the character, rather than the plot surrounding him. I think it's comparable to One Punch Man in the sense that you already know he's going to win, so it's more focused on exploring who he is. Obviously, it's bound to be more cerebral since it's about intelligence over raw strength, but the same techniques used to entertain the reader could be applied. Seeing how the character interacts with people, his detachment from the world, etc.

An extremely intelligent character is bound to be less concerned with threatening problems. To him, they could be trivial since he already knows how to solve them. This could cause conflict with those around him, since from their perspective, it's like he doesn't care. I dunno, I'm just an amateur here, so I'm probably missing something important here.
