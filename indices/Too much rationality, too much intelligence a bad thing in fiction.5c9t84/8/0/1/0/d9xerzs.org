  I think you have a somewhat faulty understanding of Death Note.

I'm sorry about not being clear above. I don't have /any/ understanding of Death Note. I once briefly skimmed the wiki to see what it was about, made the aforementioned mental connection, and then resolved to have nothing to do with Death Note unless something came along which made it seem much more appealing.

Other things which bothered me about it from the wiki description were that it seems to have a supernatural otherworld, but that this serves no purpose in the universe except to vaguely explain the Death Note, and that the Death Note is as close to an inherently evil power as I can imagine, being able to create nothing, build nothing, not even implying a greater power somewhere else because apparently the supernatural that produced it has no other real power, able to do nothing but subtract from reality.

It is interesting that I consider the Death Note to be inherently evil and uninteresting for these reasons but do not consider awesome military hardware in the same way way, even though it exists for the same purpose. I think it is because awesome military hardware implies enormous potential behind it that could be used for other purposes, while the Wiki was very clear that the supernatural that produced the Death Note somehow had no other potential or power.
