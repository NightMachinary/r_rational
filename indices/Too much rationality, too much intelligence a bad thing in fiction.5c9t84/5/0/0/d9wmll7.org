  Shouldn't characters have a greater chance of acting optimally as their intelligence increases? Wouldn't the, ahem, intelligent thing to do in any given situation be to act optimally?

Ok, sure, why not. But what you have to understand is, the second you can't explain to someone of your own intelligence exactly how the "intelligent" character arrived at their conclusions, and have that explantion be sufficient to get them to understand the entire line of thought, your character is not actually intelligent, you're just fiating them as such for the purposes of the plot.

They are "intelligent" only in the same way world-class attractive actors playing "ugly" characters are ugly. You will find this happens way, way below "omniscience," and pretending otherwise doesn't mean the character is smart as much as that all the people who believe they are are stupid.
