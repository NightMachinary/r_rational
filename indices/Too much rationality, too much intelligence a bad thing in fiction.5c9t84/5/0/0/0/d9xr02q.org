Very true. And yet fiating intelligence is also interesting. That is in essence what superpowers are. A power which would require a greater intelligence to create/build/possibly even operate, being used as a resource by someone without that intelligence.

Like a regular person found a laser gun. They can't build a laser gun, they can't even understand fully how it works, but it will vaporize things for them, and it must be the product of a greater intelligence that knew how to build it. It is, to some degree, almost a form of intelligence. Giving someone superpowers generally just means you tied that laser gun to their arm so you can't get it off without killing them (so the story can be about them using the gun, rather than all the people trying to get it for themselves).
