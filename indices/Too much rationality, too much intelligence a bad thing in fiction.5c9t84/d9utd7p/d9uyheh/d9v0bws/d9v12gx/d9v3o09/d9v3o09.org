The area between 'recursively-self-improved AGI' and 'average human intelligence' is massive. There's plenty of room for characters that fall between those two things, and it's very rare for protagonists to fall closer to the former than the latter. The baseline to consider a character intelligent is very similar to the baseline for considering a person in real life intelligent, and given that real life contains no omnipotents to my knowledge, I have no objection to intelligent fictional characters also lacking omnipotence.
