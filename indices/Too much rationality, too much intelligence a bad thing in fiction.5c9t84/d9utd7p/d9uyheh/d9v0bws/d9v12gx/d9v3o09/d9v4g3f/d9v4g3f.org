Okay. I was pointing out that intelligence as a absolute eventually squeezes out anything that can be interesting to a human from a story, because humans have many "stupid" goals naturally evolved and not designed, which cannot work on a framework where there is too much intelligence.

/Too much intelligence eventually becomes anathema to storytelling/ as a law of narrative is my idea.
