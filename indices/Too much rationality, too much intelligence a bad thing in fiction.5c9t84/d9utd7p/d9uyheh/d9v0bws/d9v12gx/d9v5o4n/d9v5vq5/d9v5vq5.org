Well, rational fiction generally seems to strive towards having more intelligent characters. I know, the official rules just say no things that happen just because the plot demands it, but generally writers take that to also mean more intelligent. And is it not interesting to take that to extremes, and then examine what those extremes do to stories? Perhaps some basic rules of human nature can be gleaned. Or tips for writing. Or interesting effects that happen before the extremes, like the cold feeling I get inside from a story where everyone is too intelligent for anyone with much human stupidity (devotion to instinctual human goals) the live for long or be a person.

I personally feel most writers worship intelligence in characters to some extent, so is it not interesting to discover that intelligence in its pure form destroys human values and interest in stories?
