Intelligence â‰  superintelligence. Intelligence isn't a switch the Author flicks, immediately bestowing godly AI-level thought processes on all characters. In fact, no AI-level character has ever been written, what with [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent][Vince's law]] and all.

Intelligence, in the quantities that are humanly possible to write, has none of the harmful effects you describe. The author isn't forcefully tugging events along, since proper decision-making makes the chain of cause and effect seem more natural than it otherwise would. Battles aren't foregone conclusions, the more intelligent the combatants are, the more intriguing and unexpected the twists and reversals can be. A smart hero may not spare the villain, but why would they need to? The villain villain is perfectly capable of escaping themselves without any heroic mercy, with any of a dozen back-up plans.

A stupid story happens because the plot says so. A smart story happens for conceivable, relatable reasons. This isn't "cold and frightening", it's making the story alive.

In all, your idea of "intelligent" fiction seems to base itself in superintelligent stories that haven't been written yet. The problems you describe are, I suppose, conceivable with some sort of post-singularity fiction, but I don't see how any of it could apply today.
