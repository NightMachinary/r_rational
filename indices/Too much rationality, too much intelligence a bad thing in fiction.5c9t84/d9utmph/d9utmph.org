I've had similar thoughts myself, before.

I've thought about "what would I do if I could x" and for powerful enough x, invariably the answer is "/sigh/, I suppose I need to maximize its use to save as many lives / reduce as much suffering as possible, otherwise I would feel guilty."

This extends even to personal fantasizing, so to satisfy myself, I have to add a disclaimer like "this happens in a virtual world without other sentient beings" or "a magical being comes and eliminates all suffering, what do you do now" or whatever.

Anyways, besides that tangent, I feel the following way:

Your solution of "slowing down" time and ideas seems fine, except that I think it might be difficult to pull off realistically. You might have to do it in terms of metaphors of some sort and probably a great deal of suspension of disbelief. Still, if done properly, I think it could be very entertaining.

In this line, rational fiction is interesting in its own right because it is so rare, but in a different way from normal fiction. If you can show some of the planning that the characters do during the planning phase, and then show how those plans are circumvented and then the characters manage to use some secret fallbacks (that were nevertheless hinted at) or whatever to recover when it looks like they were sure to be eliminated, but still at some cost to the protagonist. I feel like (Significant Digits)[[[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html]]] (hpmor fanfic) does this well, but I won't reveal how, for spoiler purposes.

Like running an epic level Dungeons and Dragons campaign, it's basically more about matching power than about absolute power. You could show the protagonist absolutely dominating some people and then have them face their match.

Also, bear in mind, rational fic doesn't necessarily mean "Overpowered" fic. It more means characters not doing obviously stupid things. You can have rational characters with low absolute power facing less rational characters with very high power, and still have them struggle and provide an interesting fight for the viewer.

Another option is to have a semi-rational but in some way "insane" villain (or at least one whose goals are sufficiently different from normal human goals), like Tarquin from Order of the Stick (warning: Order of the Stick spoilers ahead). He is shown to be very "genre savvy" in the sense that he [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0766.html][writes a list to prevent his (non-rational) soldiers fall for the classic movie tricks]], nevertheless, his eventual goal is to [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0763.html][die in a dramatic manner]] due to his love of story. A sufficiently powerful and rational character that values narrative could force the protagonist to act narratively (or at least pretend to act narratively, whilst actually executing a secret plan) in order to defeat them. However, this falls more towards the comedy genre.

On a similar note, you could have an otherwise rational character with some major personality flaw which can be used to defeat them. You could also have a rational but evil character who just doesn't care about others, and after setting up what they feel to be sufficient precautions, then proceed to explore their power.

Let me know what you think!
