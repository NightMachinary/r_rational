I'm starting to think it all comes down to the idea that humans derive enjoyment from stupidity. From watching someone be outsmarted by someone else more intelligent, to experiencing joy in thinking of a situation that allows or gives an excuse to an intelligent character to act stupidly in an awesome manner. If someone it too intelligent that means they can see the path to succeeding at their stated goal, such as eliminating suffering in the world, and in many cases this path is incomparable with the stupid sub goals that evolution has given humans, such as dominate others, have sex with others, enjoy watching pretty explosions, crush and destroy your enemies while being wonderful (did I already cover that under "dominate others"?), be looked up to and adored by others, etc.

I wonder if humor is related to this dichotomy?

Thanks for linking to that strip where Tarquin explains his goals. That was really cool and hilarious.
