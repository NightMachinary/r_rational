  Don't really agree that that is his motivation at all. Just that he's happy to enjoy the life even if it means that ending

The audience wouldn't enjoy it very much if Superman acted intelligently and devoted all his time (or the maximum possible amount) to saving people. In order to try to relieve this various writers have tried to provide the justification that he needs time to "be human and connect to humans to care about people," but anyone who really thinks about it will get slightly uncomfortable and guilty feeling upon imaging all the people with whole lives ahead of them and valuable experiences and skills that are dying, being preventably snuffed out, while Sups takes the time to pretend to be a reporter or to go on a date with Lois.

But if he wasn't stupid in that manner there would be no "human" connection for people to identify with him. He would have no "life," he would just be a force that spends all its time saving people. He wouldn't be relatably human.

/Superman has to act stupidly for fiction about him to be enjoyable/ (stupid defined as not fully following the rational path to making the world a better place, which is his supposed goal).
