In Dominions it IS treatable, provided that you have a healer unit. A wide variety of human factions get them, and there's two different kinds of independent unit who can do it. Furthermore, anyone with the correct research can cast Cure Disease, craft a Miraculous Cure All Elixir or otherwise get access to suitable medical care. So it's not really untreatable so much as as a serious disease that you won't recover from without treatment.

That said, I absolutely expect to see it used as a terrorist weapon. (Looking at you, Bane Venom Charm!)
