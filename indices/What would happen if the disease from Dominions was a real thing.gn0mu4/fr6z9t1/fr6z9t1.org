It's not /very/ long term. The average human in Dominions has 10 HP. Hardier warriors might have 12, and exceptional heroes might go as high as 16. Disease completely stops natural healing, and causes the loss of 1 HP per month, so basically everyone who contracts Disease dies in a year.

Diseases that are effectively 100% fatal exist in real life; [[https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/48ujhq/whats_the_scariest_real_thing_on_our_earth/d0mz5uq/?context=3][rabies is a good example]]. In such cases, our actual response is just to be really proactive about preventing it.

That said, the 'non-infectious' bit is /weird/. Not being spread between people, but instead randomly caused by injury and hunger, it seems more like a curse upon the world than an actual disease... and indeed, Dominions has all kinds of nasty magics that cause disease, including on a potentially-global scale. It also has a number of magics that cure disease, from divine powers to herbal remedies to magical sites. Since most such effects cure any afflictions, including stuff like /missing limbs/, it's pretty clear that any setting that contains this particular Disease also contains curative effects of similar potency. So the best answer is the same as with any other disease; first we find a way to treat it, then we find a way to cure it, then we find a way to eradicate it. Given that Dominions includes effects like Gift of Health, which cures all afflictions on a potentially-global scale, the same principle can clearly be applied even to "untreatable" supernatural Disease.
