Wow, a fellow Dominions player! Thanks for the post! And basically agree with everything you said.

I'm wondering if in addition, there would be significant social fallout from having to deal with those people who get the disease (e.g. similar to nursing homes), if they would be discriminated against and even persecuted, if it would result in witch hunts, if it could be used as a torture / threat method, if it would cause fewer people to sign up for the armed services, if it would change how society views the famished, etc.
