The symptom list is highly suggestive of the consequences of untreated diabetes. Which includes impaired healing of wounds, increased susceptibility to wound infections leading to amputation, impaired vision and blindness from retina damage, heart and kidney damage leading to low oxygen levels and general weakness, etc.

So it's not really all that weird. All you need is a common bacteria that can infect wounds but doesn't spread easily from person to person (which describes lots of actual bacteria) that also produces a toxin that, if it gets into the bloodstream, generally messes people up but not badly enough to kill them right away. "Disease" not being contagious might just be an approximation to "You probably would get it if their blood gets into your blood, but that rarely happens in a world without blood transfusions and injected drugs."
