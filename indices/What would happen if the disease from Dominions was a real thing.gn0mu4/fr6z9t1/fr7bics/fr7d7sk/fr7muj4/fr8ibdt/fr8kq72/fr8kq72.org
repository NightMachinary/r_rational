I recommend Scott Alexander's [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]] as one of my favourite pieces of nonfiction.

In terms of leprosy, I honestly don't know all that much about the disease IRL; I would mostly be looking stuff up on wikipedia and regurgitating it at you with my own errors and misconceptions thrown into the mix, which is on balance probably not a good use of either of our times.
