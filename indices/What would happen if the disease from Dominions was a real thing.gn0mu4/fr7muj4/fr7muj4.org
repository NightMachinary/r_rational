Dominions' medical system is sort of constrained by the fact that the entire setting experienced by the game is basically during the equivalent of a World War: everything is going into producing and training soldiers and weapons, and only the bare minimum is left for the home front. If you took the world and magic of Dominions and had no enemies to fight, you could make a pretty great paradise with e.g. Gift of Health, Well of Misery, Gift of Nature's Bounty, Disease Grinders and so on and so forth. However, in the game setting pretty much all of the benefits of magic are horribly constrained by the fact that you have to use every magic resource to go kill the other bastards before they take over the world and kill /you/. It's a very Molochian trap, sometimes lead by actual Molochs, where everyone's in a pretty permanent state of competition, sacrificing everything for a competitive edge.

One of the more interesting gamey interactions with disease is to have a regen bless and give the diseased unit a shroud of the battle saint. They have a terminal disease that is slowly killing them permanently but it doesn't actually make any progress because they're permanently regenerating...

One of my favourite nations is MA C'tis, lizard kings of disease. Their swamps being the source of disease to all warmblooded creatures points towards disease also being a stand-in for e.g. malaria and other insect-borne disease. On the other hand, things like Foul Air and battle injuries in general suggest a more widespread infection form of disease. There are units that disease those around them, having basically contagious disease - the mummy and e.g. T'ien Ch'i's Master With The Iron Crutch Li T'ieh-Kuai for example; interestingly both explicitly identify the disease as leprosy in their flavour text (which was often thought, in the time periods Dominions draws on for it's lore, to be much more contagious than we now believe). There are Disease Demon assassins that spread plague, too, though. Also, you get a chance to get diseased in winter if you're old (especially in death scales). Basically, the weirdness of Dominions Disease from a Doylist perspective is because they're drawing from like a ton of different folklores and superstitions and belief systems that were in turn based on a number of different actual diseases with varying etiologies and prognoses and treatments, and simplifying it to a binary 'diseased y/n' state for gameplay and sanity reasons.
