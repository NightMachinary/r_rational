I usually use, and prefer, "they" universally. I have seen he/she alternating done well but it seems harder to do well than just using "they". As far as neologisms goes, I don't really like them, and only use them in reference to those who desire them explicitly (rather than using them for everyone). My least favoured alternative is the "He or she", an awkward construction that I particularly dislike for it's inelegance.
