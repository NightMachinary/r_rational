Depends on why I'm being gender neutral.

If it's a /hypothetical/ person I'm using in an example, I flip a coin to decide whether I'm using he or she, or otherwise just avoid using anything gendered. For example "when a Jedi draws [flip coin, tails] her lightsaber". If it's a persistent hypothetical person, I'll keep gender the same for as long as I'm talking about [flip coin, heads] him.

If it's a /real/ person whose gender I don't know, I'll generally go with "they", though sometimes to avoid this I'll make a token effort to determine gender (on reddit it's easy to check user pages).

"It" is usually considered offensive; I haven't ever met someone who liked being called an it. Pronouns like "ze" and "xe" I find jarring, though I understand why people use it.
