  This applies to dictators as well; you don't get dictators because there's this one giant asshole making everything miserable, you get them because of systemic problems that you can't just wipe away by killing enough people. It doesn't take a terribly deep reading of history to see that this is the case. What you need is to create new, stable institutions, which you can't really do with the Death Note.

Kevin Spacey's Character from COD: Advanced Warefare sums this up well in his 'democracy' speech:

"Democracy isn't what these people need hell, it's not even what they want. America's been running around the globe trying to install a democracy in nation after nation for a century and it hasn't worked one time. Now, why do you think that is? Because these countries don't have the most necessary building blocks to support a democracy, little things like, we gotta be tolerant of those who disagree with us or we gotta be tolerant of those who worship a different god from us or, that a journalist gotta be able to disagree with a fucking president. And you think you walk into this country based on fundamentalist and religious principles, drop a couple bombs, topple a dictator and start a democracy? Give me a break.ï»¿"

You can't just kill Sadam Hussain and have Iraq magically transform into a bastion of liberty and freedom, there's inertial reasons that places end up with dictators, and killing the dictator isn't actually going to change the inertia of the country.

So yeah, using a Death Note to make the world better by offing dictators won't really work too well. It at the very least will lead to increased violence and instability as the result of a power vacuum.
