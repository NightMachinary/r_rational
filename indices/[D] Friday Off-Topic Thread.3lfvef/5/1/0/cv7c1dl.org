Now I know who to suspect if the world's financiers and landowners start dying disproportionately. :P

I've had these thoughts as well. I believe a systematic campaign against the wealthiest people and their soon-to-be-wealthiest beneficiaries may indeed discourage the idea of inheritance altogether. But what happens when anonymity becomes popular among them? What happens when the wealth is, instead of concentrated in personal assets, moved into corporations and shell companies? Invested assets will probably be moved into more liquid and less regulated forms. Couldn't this result in a collapse of fractional-reserve banking? Not that FRB is by any means sensible, but I doubt this sort of approach would result in anything less than massive destabilization and catastrophe.
