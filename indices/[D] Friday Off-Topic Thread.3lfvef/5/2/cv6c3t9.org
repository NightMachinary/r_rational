As I think they realized in the show, the ability to manipulate circumstances surrounding a death is more powerful than actual death itself. But let's ignore that.

I'd become a supervillain.

Send an ultimatum to the government, probably in the middle of an obviously-contrived death (a criminal escapes jail, finds me, takes my note, drives to the whitehouse, and counts down to his death by cerebral hemorrhage alongside others travelling from completely different locations across the world - for example.) If they do not comply, I'll just kill them. The same goes for large corporations and individuals with enough personal wealth or political power to make a difference, such as dictators.

/That/ is how you become God of a new world - by forcing it's existing rulers to remake it for you as a paradise. Not by killing people the justice system has already caught one by one.

EDIT: Oh, this should be kept fairly secret, too. Otherwise you just get a whole planet coming up with ways to defeat you, which is ... bad. Keep to quiet-but-dramatic blackmail and threats.
