My first targets are the known leaders of ISIS, because I think it is entirely possible to make it look like they died by the hand of Allah, and thus to collapse the entire group.

After that, I don't know. Killing Kim Jong Un won't actually solve any problems, and there aren't any other sufficiently evil people whose deaths I conclude could be easily manipulated into positive outcomes.
