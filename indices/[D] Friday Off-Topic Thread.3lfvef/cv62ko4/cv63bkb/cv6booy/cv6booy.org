  First, criminals don't really respond to incentives like that - increasing punishment changes the incentives for the crime, but that's worthless if there's no response to incentives. Look at the drug war in America. Increasing the penalties for possession to the point of absurdity hasn't done a lot to curb actual use. There have been a number of studies on this.

However, there are also studies that point that swift, sure punishment does reduce recidivism. (I'm drawing a blank on the guys name and blog....).

It is reasonable to assume that criminals are rational actors, but you must assume a discount rate (A 1% chance at life is basicaly the same as 1% chance at 20-30 years?)

If Light can get the %age up to a reasonable #, people take notice.

However, you can also punish supposedly rational actors with a rule that. "The head of a corporation that causes a massive environmental disaster dies." (etc).

You could also target the leader (and families) of despotic regimes. I think that's the best bang for the buck. "People disappear in your regime, you die."
