I think there are relatively few problems that can be solved by killing. One of the big mistakes that Light makes is in thinking that killing all the criminals will eliminate criminality. This is wrong for two reasons (beyond the moral ones).

First, criminals don't really respond to incentives like that - increasing punishment changes the incentives for the crime, but that's worthless if there's no response to incentives. Look at the drug war in America. Increasing the penalties for possession to the point of absurdity hasn't done a lot to curb actual use. There have been a number of studies on this.

Second, criminality is systemic. It's a result of how your society is set up. Just killing the criminals is treating a symptom, not the actual cause. If you're using such an extreme method, you want to be sure that you're hitting the root of the problem.

There's also the issue that the Death Note can only kill people who are /caught/ for their crimes, leaving behind everyone who is smart enough to get away with murder, rape, jaywalking, etc. Once people know the rules, they'll know enough to hid their face and name. You'd probably see shootouts with the police more often, because every crime is a death sentence. It just doesn't work.

This applies to dictators as well; you don't get dictators because there's this one giant asshole making everything miserable, you get them because of systemic problems that you can't just wipe away by killing enough people. It doesn't take a terribly deep reading of history to see that this is the case. What you need is to create new, stable institutions, which you can't really do with the Death Note.

So what's it good for? You can try using it to break the world somehow, either by its (nearly?) pre-cognitive powers or some other method. You could get some money, either through blackmail or by dictating actions prior to death. You could use the pre-death mind control aspects in order to build power or make some more subtle shifts in the way of world.

Personally, I would probably use it for euthanasia.
