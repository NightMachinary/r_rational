I think if it worked, the costs associated with it would be way too high. I mean ... could you hold the world hostage and get specific policies implemented? Well ... even that I'm not sure about. You're depending on people responding to the pressure of death in the way that you want them to, which I don't think is safe. /Instead/ I think that you would probably end up killing a lot of politicians, then have a second generation of politicians who work from anonymity with their faces masked and identities unknown to the public. Then you'd have to start killing everyone who agreed with that policy of avoiding death, until the bodies had stacked up high enough that people agreed that politicians wouldn't be anonymous. And even that probably wouldn't work, because they would find other ways around your tyrannical rule. That's all regardless of what your specific policy proposals are.

The history of the 20th century is one of people killing their political enemies in order to enact policy changes. The track record on this has been absolutely abysmal. To argue that you could do better with the Death Note is to argue that the real problem was in not using /enough/ force, or not using it precisely enough, which I think is a bad misreading of why the violence-based approach to changing society hasn't worked.

I think if you actually wanted to use the Death Note to change some public policy, you'd want to make sure that people don't even know that any one is being killed with it. You'd make every death look like an accident and arrange so that mortality rates didn't look /too much/ different from the real world. You wouldn't take out the people in positions of power, but the people who /create/ those positions of power. Otherwise the position of power is just going to be filled again in a few days.

And /even then/ I'm skeptical that it would be effective, because as stated, people have tried the violence-based approach many, many times before all through the 20th century and morality aside, it doesn't seem to get results.
