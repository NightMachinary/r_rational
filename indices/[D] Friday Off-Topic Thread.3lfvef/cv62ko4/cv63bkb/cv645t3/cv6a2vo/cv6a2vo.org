You would gain a great deal of power - but it would depend fully on completely maintaining anonymity in the face of virtually every powerful stakeholder in the world trying to discern your identity. While people here probably have read [[http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][gwern]] about this... I would not count on the authorities of the world, confronted by an actual Death Note, to not use google really hard and /also/ read gwern about this. L is pretty exceptionally smart, but in real life there would be a much larger amount of manpower and in attacking hard problems quantity has a quality all it's own. I am confident that I am very smart, probably 'smarter' than the average of the people who would be told to kill me as soon as they were pretty sure of my identity... but there would be thousands of them, and only one of me, and I would have to be smarter than all of them in a large, large number of fields, all the time, or my identity would slowly leak.

Another difficulty: you might be able to persuade governments, etc, by threatening world leaders... but the ones who wouldn't comply are likely to be the true patriots who want to serve what they perceive as a higher cause (e.g. their nation, the common good, etc) over their own personal self-interest, and are therefore likely to be the ones who you should want to kill the least! Also, the legitimacy of democracy is such a powerful force for good that attempting to destroy it by personal military coup through perfect assassination is probably going to cause more net problems than the improvement from your specific policies over democratically determined policies solves, and from a pure utilitarian perspective would increase future suffering and decrease future happiness.

Honestly, the whole 'you now have proof that magic really exists, that fates are in some respect foreordained, and etc.' would really confuse the hell out of me, and I am not sure how that would factor into my planning. The 'magic is real but until now the entire world appeared consistent with the no-magic hypothesis' really would tend to indicate I was in a simulation or something.
