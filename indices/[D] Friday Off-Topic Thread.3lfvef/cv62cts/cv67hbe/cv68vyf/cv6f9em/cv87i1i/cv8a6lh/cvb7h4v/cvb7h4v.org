While technically possible, it would be incredibly inefficient and wasteful. The cost of resources to move those supplies up to a fraction of light speed and back could be used to colonise entire other solar systems, or keep however many million people alive for x number of years (instead of spending the same amount of resources on a few thousand people for x years). We only have so many resources in our sun's gravity well and by extension in our universe, so it behooves us to use them efficiently.
