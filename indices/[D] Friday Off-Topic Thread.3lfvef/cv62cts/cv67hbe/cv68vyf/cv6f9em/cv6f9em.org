Call me a humanocentric specieist ass but the only ecosystem I'd try to emplace on a colony planet is one that benefits our colonists. And the only reason to make that complex and self-sustaining is to have a bare bones support structure in case both technology and the interstellar supply system somehow go to shit for a while.

I guess another reason would be for science. You could do all kinds of ecological and biological experiments. No one will complain about people messing with the equilibrium of nature if the whole thing was emplaced on a terraformed dirtball by human hands in the first place.
