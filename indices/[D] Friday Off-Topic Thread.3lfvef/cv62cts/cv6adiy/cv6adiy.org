I think ecosystems have some value of their own, as an interesting thing that could be permanent lost. But it's unreasonable to value them /more/ than their constituent parts, considering the suffering involved.

I don't know of any way to systematically reduce wild animal suffering; I'd suggest some sort of large-scale zoo or adoption system, possibly prioritizing prey animals and highly intelligent species somewhat. But while this might reduce suffering on the margin, it could never scale to eliminate even a noticable amount of animal suffering.

On the other hand, I'm /extremely/ dubious about the idea that animal lives /aren't worth living/. You don't even have the evidence of suicidality with animals; they demonstrably aren't suicidal. So I'm not really comfortable with attempting to euthanize or sterilize large portions of the biosphere, a task which would merely require a one-world government to accomplish.

In short, I think animal suffering is bad and should be prevented; but I don't think it's possible to bring animals as a group up to our living standard, at current levels of technology. Technology will advance, though, and we can still help individual animals to an extent.

The issue of suffering in /domesticated/ animals, however, is both far larger per individual animal and much easier to address.
