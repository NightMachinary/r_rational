Animal lives could be worth living*, but we still wouldn't want to create any more of them (depending on your thoughts concerning stuff like Parfit's mere addition paradox and Benatar's Asymmetry, etc. Humans with tremendously unfortunate diseases might still have lives worth living but would still want to prevent creating more humans with those diseases, especially when alternatives exist). Currently existing animals wouldn't necessarily die (except, perhaps, by old age), but I don't feel as strong an impetus to let them breed. And if, for example, we can't feasibly round up the predators and let them live well without harming others, we'd have to weigh their preference for life against the preferences of all the animals they'd otherwise kill (averaged across our uncertainty in predicting the effects of any sort of ecological intervention).

I also don't know that the suffering of agricultural animals is necessarily worse than that of wild animals. Perhaps for some types of animals (esp. in factory farms), suffering induced by being kept in a tiny box your whole life compares unfavorably to an hour of bleeding out as a hyena chews your leg off ([[http://foundational-research.org/publications/importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/#How_Wild_Animals_Suffer][as one example]]), but I think definitive statements to that effect are hard to make. And certainly some domesticated animals (e.g. many pet dogs) live far more pleasant lives than exist for the majority of animals in nature.

As for addressing the issue, I agree that ecosystem reformation is far harder a question than just closing down farms or improving slaughter practices. And it's certainly far less palatable to the average person, so there'd be considerable social pushback, at least in the present social climate. But there are still practical questions to consider today, like reintroducing predators to areas where they'd previously been depopulated (e.g. the Yellowstone wolves), or replanting the rainforest, or mitigating the less desirable effects of global warming, or whatever.

edit: though the suicidality observation doesn't necessarily demonstrate this, as non-human animals might just be really bad at forecasting the future. I'm sure a gazelle would "prefer" to die painlessly just before being disemboweled by a hungry lioness, perhaps even some considerable amount of time in advance. But since gazelles can't predict well what the future holds, they might "choose" to live on in the present, even if, with perfect foreknowledge, they'd have chosen to die.
