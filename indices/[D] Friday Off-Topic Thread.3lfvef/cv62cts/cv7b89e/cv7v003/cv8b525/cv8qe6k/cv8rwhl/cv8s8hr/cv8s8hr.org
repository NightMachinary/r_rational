  If you treat the issue, "the LW way", then your meta-ethical view ought to give you a specification of what kind of inference or optimization problem your normative-ethical view is actually solving, thus allowing you to evaluate how well different codes of ethics perform at solving that problem (when treated as algorithms that use limited data and computing power to solve a specified inference or optimization problem). Declaring yourself a "subjectivist" is thus specifying very few bits of information about the inference problem you intend to solve: if it, whatever it is, is about your brain-states, then which brain-states is it about, and how do those brain-states pick out an inference problem?

I don't understand this paragraph. By "code of ethics," you mean an agent's action selection process? What do you mean by "what kind of inference or optimization problem your normative-ethical view is actually solving?"
