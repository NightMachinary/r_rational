My cumulative concern for individual animals vastly outweighs my concern for "species" or "ecosystems" or "nature" or whatever, so I regard ecosystem re-engineering or anti-conservationist destruction (probably through gradual capture, sterilization, and relocation) fairly positively. Which isn't to say that I don't value the knowledge-of-how-the-world-works represented by extant species (they're sorta important for my work in evolutionary biology and ecology, for one), nor that I don't have some purely "aesthetic" appreciation for nature shit (I've spent many thousands of hours hiking, backpacking, climbing, paddling, etc. You probably won't find an outdoorsier person than me outside a pub table of wilderness guides), nor that there aren't "practical" benefits to be found in preserving nature (e.g. medicinal herbs, though I think targeted approaches far more effective), etc. but rather that I value closing the hellish pit that is the brutal death and torture of trillions of animals per year (roughly) above the potential and current benefits that that suffering brings.

Or at least reducing it somewhat. Maybe instead of trillions of animals, keep it in the billions, or at least don't terraform future worlds to bring the numbers into the quadrillions and up. Maybe don't gently let /everything/ die, but keep some animals in pleasant, controlled, zoo-like environments in perpetuity (i.e. create a "technojainist" welfare state). And don't do this immediately, necessarily -- perhaps once the "diminishing returns of studying nature" have set in, or we have good surrogates for outdoorsy stuff, and especially once we 1) are fairly secure in our own survival as humans, and 2) have a good idea of the short and long term ecological effects (e.g. the population dynamics of mesopredator release). All keeping in mind that for every moment of hesitation and delay untold numbers of beings wail in agony, and all.

I reckon most people oppose stuff like this because they either don't value animal welfare very strongly, are very confident that non-human animals are incapable of suffering, very strongly value the preservation of nature intrinsically (at least when it can't affect them, though I'm sure plenty of people lamented the eradication of smallpox on the basis of not tinkering with That Which Man Was Not Meant To Tinker With), or have a Disney-fied view of how the natural world works.

As a moral anti-realist/subjectivist, I don't think there's a "right" answer to the value-laden bits of the above, so when you ask

#+begin_quote
  which is more important, the suffering of individual animals, or the health of the ecosystem or species as a whole
#+end_quote

I see it as ultimately a "personal" question, with the necessary qualification of /important to whom/ or /important for what/. Within my own set of values, the bit that cares about stuff like this vaguely resembles preference utilitarianism, and I'm pretty sure your average, say, field mouse cares a lot more for not starving or being torn limb from limb by a barn owl than it does about complex abstractions like the "good of the species" (with all the evolutionary misconceptions that term entails). Of course, it probably cares a fair bit about raising young and fucking (perhaps less than avoiding a painful death, though), but "ecosystem health" and "species preservation" are not on the agenda.

Of the people I know, Brian Tomasik has probably written the most about these issues (followed maybe by David Pearce). I'd start [[http://reducing-suffering.org/#Animals][here]] under "Wild-animal suffering", if you're interested in reading some essays and discussions.
