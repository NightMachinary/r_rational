What option(s) for neuter-gender English pronouns do you prefer?

*1.* =He= universally

*2.* =She= universally

*3.* =He= and =she= alternating (by example, paragraph, chapter, etc.)

*4.* =They= universally

*5.* A new word (=ze=, =xe=, etc.) universally

*6.* =It= universally

*7.* The writer's preferred pronoun

Generally, I lean toward options 3, 5, and 6.

Feel free to suggest further options.
