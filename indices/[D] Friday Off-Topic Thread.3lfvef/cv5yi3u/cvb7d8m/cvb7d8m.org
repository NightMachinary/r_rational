  So, why is VII generating so much hype? Aren't they just trying to milk the franchise as much as possible at this point? Why do people still love SW so much?

Well, personally I think I'm hyped for two reasons. One, Star Wars got to me before I had seen enough films to start picking things apart. Fleeing through an asteroid field for example was a new and exciting way to get rid of chasers, rather than that thing any fighter pilot in a film does. Second reason is fond memories of KOTOR and KOTOR II. That's all there is too it. I see a star wars VII trailer and my mind just links it to all those hours spent happily cutting people up with lightsabers.
