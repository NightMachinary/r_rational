This is exactly where I'm at- the books just add so much depth to the universe and characters. The EU novels' vary a lot in quality (there are some really horrible or just bland books out there) but it's a very rich, vibrant universe with epic story lines. Overall I agree it's mostly entertainment sci-fi except there are some amazing books in there. I think everyone knows the Thrawn Trilogy is a staple recommendation, but for example /Traitor/ is pretty unique (and probably the closest example to a relationship like Quirrel/Harry's in HPMoR, now that I think of it).

Whereas the movies? Great special effects, some memorable scenes/actors, and that's probably all good I can say about them.
