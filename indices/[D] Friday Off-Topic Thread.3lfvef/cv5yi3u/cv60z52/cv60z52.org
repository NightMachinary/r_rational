Most of my love of /Star Wars/ is for the Expanded Universe novels (Thrawn Trilogy, New Jedi Order, Legacy of the Force, and many stand-alone books), rather than for the movies or the cartoons. The books expand (duh) the background a lot, even if they can be inconsistent at times. I like the original trilogy, but certainly don't care enough about it to rewatch it, as I do with the books; I probably skipped half of every prequel movie when I watched it on DVD (romance? who cares?), but I loved the ship designs and visual effects.

(I may count only as "a kid who's just discovered sci-fi", though, since I read only for entertainment, rather than for any depth.)
