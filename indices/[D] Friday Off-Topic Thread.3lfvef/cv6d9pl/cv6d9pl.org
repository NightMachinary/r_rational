It seems like there's occasionally going around, these "What is the most rational thing to do in X situation" threads.

They're like those "Scenario" threads from spacebattles, where someone proposes a scenario and people well go back and forth deciding what the best thing to do in it is, and the original poster will act as 'nature' and describe the responses to their actions.

I sort of like the concept as a game, but I feel like things could be done to make it more rational and interesting, otherwise the original poster is basically God/game master, and can just distort things however they want. Many any attempted munchkin will know the wrath of a vengeful GM.

At what point does it lose its value as a learning tool, and starting being a very loose form of online roleplaying? Is it even really the sort of thing we should have here? I'm not sure whether or not I'm in favour of it, because it seems pretty ill defined right now.
