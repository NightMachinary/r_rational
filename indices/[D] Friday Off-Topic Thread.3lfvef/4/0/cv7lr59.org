Neither actually....

1. [Note that these strategies are for when arguing with people who refuse to pay attention to my side of the argument] I usually do my absolute best to avoid arguments with people on how to do some task which I don't consider to be important. My reasoning is that it's easier to just go along with what they need done, since the amount of time it takes for me to change their mind is often more than just letting the results prove them wrong. If the argument is important enough (such as money is at stake, this is my domain of expertise, or we are about to start on a time-consuming project), then I often can demonstrate why I'm more likely to be right such as being educated in this field, prior experience with this task, or some way to prove why I'm one of the right people for the job. Don't appeal to *logic*, appeal to *authority* of being in a higher-level position, or appeal to the *emotion* of don't-you-trust-me?, or appealing to their *laziness* (I know better and you can just let me take responsibility for any potential shit-hitting-the-fan problems). It's dipping into Dark Rationality, but these kind of people aren't going to listen to logic, you need something else. If it's to do with facts, then if they aren't going to listen to the reasons for my answer in the first place, I usually just prove a link to some respectable source from online (this is a bit hit-and-miss at times). If that still doesn't work, I walk away. They aren't going to ever listen to me, so why spend more time with them? I am the /master/ of walking away and not letting it bother me ever again.

2. I'm surrounded by smart people and I make mistakes in a ridiculous variety of situations. I /know/ I am not smart. I have been called a genius by several people, and one person (after watching me mess up in a social situation) asked me if I was an idiot savant. However, I just feel awkward when that happens. My reasoning is that I'm lucky to like learning for its sake and I'm very well-educated. So I just chalk these comments to people seeing a well-educated person for a genuinely /smart/ person.
