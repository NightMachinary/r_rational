For 2 due to the nature of being even just a reddit user you are likely demographically in the smarter than average.

First, assume that education is broadstroke correlated with intelligence. As presumably a western educated younger person you get have a higher quality education than most of the world. Most old people, most children, most poor people can all be assumed to be below average intelligence.

If you did even reasonably well at school that would be another indicator of above average intelligence. At the end of the day it's not that hard to be above average.
