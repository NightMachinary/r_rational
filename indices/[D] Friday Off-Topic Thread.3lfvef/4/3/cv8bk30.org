  Do you ever find yourself arguing with non-rationalists, and trying to use rational arguments to convince them of something, and they refuse to accept your point?
#+end_quote

Mostly, /no/. I try to avoid arguing when I expect it to be neither useful nor fun. There can be many circumstances in which it's fun but I'll never convince them, but of course, in those, why even try to convince rather than to troll?

  Do you ever find yourself feeling unjustifiably superior, on the intelligence scale?
#+end_quote

Yes, when I was a teenage edgelord and into early graduate school. The lesson I eventually learned is: if you find yourself feeling unjustifiably superior on the intellectual scale, you need to turn your eyes towards new role-models who are sufficiently above your level that you can still /learn/ something from admiring them.

Feelings of superiority are a distraction from real goals for foolish mortals. In fact, they're practically the /definition/ of "foolish mortal" in at least one important sense: millenia's worth of people have thought themselves ever-so-clever for finding ways to raise themselves above other people in social-status hierarchies, as a result of which they accomplished /nothing else/ with their entire lives.
