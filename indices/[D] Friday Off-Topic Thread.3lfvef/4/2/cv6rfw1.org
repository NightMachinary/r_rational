1. All the time. Recent example: My mother trying to convince me of christian end time prophecies. She asked me to do research on them, so I did, and they strike me as the same brand of bollocks as horoscopes and suchlike. However, I know that if I brought that up to her she'd get really defensive or -- well, she seems almost psychotic when she talks about them. Really not comfortable for me.

2. I do my level best not to. Just because someone is not a rationalist doesn't mean they don't have valid (or true) opinions, even if they are sourced in (un)intuitive, unexplainable judgement calls. That's not to say it doesn't happen sometimes anyway, especially with people I know to lack sound reasoning for a lot of their stated opinions -- but people have their fields of expertise and experience regardless, in which they are vastly superior to myself.
