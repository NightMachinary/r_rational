To address 2.), I wasn't really trying to propose that rationalist > all. I moreso just was trying to illustrate that, due to the inherent complexity of rational thinking, you can expect rationalists to, on average, have a higher than average threshold of intelligence. Obviously, as a rationalist, you should be able to acknowledge a verified expert in a field, and accept that their knowledge in said field exceeds yours. I was moreso leaning towards the common man. As in, you're in a room full of coworkers (let's assume you don't work at a place that would surround you with intelligent equals, such as a university. Let's assume you work at a walmart, or a call center, or somewhere else that's stocked with average people as employees), or family members. And you're entering discussions, and you find yourself feeling so superior, just because these people, plain and simple, *aren't as smart as you are*. Inherently, there SHOULD be nothing wrong with that, but I will admit that I, personally (for a variety of complex reasons), am inclined to look down on others that I find particularly unintelligent. Not to the point of extremity, but enough to feel superior to the point that I find myself uncomfortable with how dismissive of them I am.
