I'm generally against them. To me it's like having dessert without dinner. If you don't have a story to wrap the exploits, it's just ... meaningless? I think that they have a place here, but I'd like to see less of them, ideally in favor of workshopping stories. (I also feel like people talking about their stories before writing them makes them less likely to write them because they get some of the same hedons with none of the production.) But I know this is down to personal preference and don't really think I'm in the majority.
