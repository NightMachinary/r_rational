  And you're entering discussions, and you find yourself feeling so superior, just because these people, plain and simple, aren't as smart as you are. Inherently, there SHOULD be nothing wrong with that, but I will admit that I, personally (for a variety of complex reasons), am inclined to look down on others that I find particularly unintelligent.

Nah, it's way more alienating than that. When there's /really/ a significant gap of intellectual capability, I can't look down on other people, because I can only weakly guess at their point-of-view, and they can't even guess at mine at all.

Too large a gap just makes me feel very alone.
