  But I generally feel that I'm justified in feeling at least slightly more intelligent than other people simply because I've read more than them. People find it fascinating that I know random facts like Lavoisier discovered Oxygen, or that the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock is 190,000$. Come on people, read more.
