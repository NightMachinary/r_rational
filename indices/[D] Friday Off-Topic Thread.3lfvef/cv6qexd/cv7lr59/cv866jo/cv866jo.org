1. YES. I usually try to tell myself this, especially when I'm familiar with the people I'm arguing with ("Come on Kishoto. These people have never read HPMOR. They don't know what lesswrong is, they probably only know the word fallacy from an English class from way back in school. It's irrational of YOU to try and use a rationally based argument to convince them, as they don't have the tools for it. Or are already biased in some manner due to upbringing, personality, etc. and refuse to let their viewpoints change) but I can never stick to doing it. When I get into the argument, I forget this and just default to verbal sword fighting, and a rationality-based sword shatters against ignorant defenses. I really need to take your paragraph and like save it on my phone, so I can try and enforce it on how I think. Especially since I suck at walking away from shit (despite the fact that it's easy to see when someone's hunkering down and refusing to change their viewpoint) because I love arguing, and hate willful ignorance.

2. I, unfortunately, am not surrounded by smart people. I, myself, am fairly intelligent, but I don't really hang around any one that is. Most of my friends are in other countries, so we communicate via Skype and such, and THEY are fairly intelligent. But the people I interact with at my job (a call center, where I'm in management) or in my daily life aren't. Even if schooling isn't really a factor (although I can bring that in too, depending), they can't seem to make the intuitive leaps that i'm able to (holy hell, reading that sentence sounds so arrogant. Argh.) For example, when the Malaysian plane went missing last year, and weeks passed without anything substantial being found, I heard so many people at work talking and this is how this conversaiton started:

"We have all this fancy technology. We can google people and find what street they're on, how can you not find an entire plane?"

"Well. Those people you "google" are in civilization, firstly, assuming you can find them at all, it's because there's some data being transmitted, via their phone, their workplace, etc. You don't have any of that in the ocean. Plus the ocean is much larger than people give it credit for."

"That makes no sense. I can contact someone in China and we can't find this one plane between all these countries? What about radar and shit?"

"Well, firstly. Even if we look at all of the detection methods we have, a lot of them need some form of thing to bounce back off. Something transmitting. That's how you track things. If the tracker's disabled, you're stuck trying to identify it physically. And there are huge range limitations on things like SONAR and stuff, and that's not accounting for noise."

"Well, how do we know it even crashed? Maybe it was stolen and landed on some island?"

"While technically, that may be true. Realistically, having some secret airport on a deserted island large enough to land that size of a plane is very unlikely. Plus, why would you bother? The amount of money it would take to set up said airport and sustain it would be ridiculous. And air space is heavily monitored, so it's not like you'd even be able to make much use of it. And this flight didn't have anything that important on it, human lives not withstanding."

"Well, what if they just flew it to another country, huh? Where they had all that stuff set up illegally already."

"Again. Airspace is heavily monitored, pretty much world wide. Especially with planes that size. Not to mention, fuel limitations. It couldn't just keep flying indefinitely. At best, it could've made it to like India or something. Maybe."

"Well, how would you know? You're not a pilot or smuggler or anything."

"I don't have to be to know the things I just said."

The conversation then went on for a while longer (too long, I'm ashamed to admit) and I walked away feeling as if 80 percent of what I said went over their heads, as they all went right back to puzzling out how the plane was probably stolen and landed on some super secret island.
