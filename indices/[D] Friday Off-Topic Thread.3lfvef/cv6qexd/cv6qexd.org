Two questions.

1. Do you ever find yourself arguing with non-rationalists, and trying to use rational arguments to convince them of something, and they refuse to accept your point? For example, I got into an argument with an older lady (I'm 22, she is about 40) about colds. She said I shouldn't go in the rain, because I would catch a cold, due to both the general cold of the water and the cold inflicted on me by the wet clothes drying on me. I said that I wouldn't, as the cold isn't caused by low temperatures, it's caused by a type of virus. She proceeded to tell me about how her mother, who was very wise, told her that growing up, and she noticed that it was indeed true. I told her that it's more likely she was either incorrectly remembering, or selectively remembering things. That it was likely she mentally disregarded the times she caught a cold without being wet, subconsciously. She proceeded to accuse me of always trusting science over the wisdom of elders. I proceeded to say "I'm not saying old people don't have knowledge from sheer time spent on the Earth. But I definitely trust facts verified by thousands of intelligent minds, over advice from a single old person, if the two directly conflict." This argument spiraled, and the rest isn't important, as it quickly became more about how I was always a "know-it-all that trusted Google more than those who know more because they are older". Anyway. So that's the question. Have you ever tried to appeal to the rational side of a non-rationalist, only to get rebuffed? And does said rebuff ever make you almost irrationally angry?

2. Do you ever find yourself feeling unjustifiably superior, on the intelligence scale? Like, obviously, you know you aren't Einstein or Hawking. But you know that you probably know more than the average Joe on a lot of topics, as a student of rationalism, or even just someone who likes to read or learn new things. It also seems to take someone smarter than the average bear (/he he he/) to really grasp some of the basic concepts of rationalism, meaning you can almost assume a budding rationalist is smarter than average (please regard the *almost*. I'm not making a concrete statement, I haven't done any formal research on this, it just seems like a sensible conclusion, based on what I've seen of many core rational elements, and the knowledge it takes to begin grasping them) So, as a result of said intelligence, do you find that, often, you're disregarding the opinions of those around you as almost lesser than your own? This isn't a good thing, as you are obviously only one person. You will be biased and/or wrong a lot, naturally. But this still seems like an easy trap to fall into, especially when you aren't in an academic setting, so you find yourself just naturally more intelligent than those around you (And yes, I know, intelligence is an abstract concept, but come on. Please infer what I mean, here.)
