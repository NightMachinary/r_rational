The /original/ Star Wars trilogy harkened back to the pulp magazine era that George Lucas had grown up in (same for /Indiana Jones/). There wasn't much original about Star Wars even when it was first released in theaters. So I think if you want to ask why Star Wars was popular then, you have to ask why pulps were able to sell a million copies a week for a long period of time.

I think there are three big factors at play.

1. The pulps existed to fire the imagination. In the same way that the /Twilight/ series is often criticized for having Bella be this blank character for the audience to project themselves into, the pulps often had a world that an adventure-hungry person could project their imagination into. This is where the paper-thin characters and loose rules of the Star Wars saga work in its favor; it's not really about the story, it's about imagining your own stuff. I never hear people rave about the story of Star Wars and very, very rarely hear people saying the characters were well-constructed. Instead, they're imagining lightsaber battles or cool ships flying around exotic worlds.
2. Anything that runs for a long time is going to generate fans, even if it's crap. I haven't really figured out why this is the case, but part of it is that people gravitate to the familiar, and some other part must be that people get invested despite themselves. If you want fans, just keep churning out the same thing, week after week, or year after year, and eventually people will just ... have settled into it. Star Wars did that. At the place it's at now, it's an institution. /People like institutions./ (This was one of the basic models of the pulps.) People get done with a well-crafted story and think "I wish there were more of this" without really considering that maybe the story the author wanted to tell was done (alternately, without caring). George Lucas knew all this, which is why the series was calibrated towards repetition and familiarity.
3. It's got spectacle. When the pulps weren't firing the imagination, they were showing things that were neat and shiny, new ideas that maybe didn't have much more than surface to them but by the time you started thinking about it, they were on to the next thing. Part of this feeds back into 1, because you want to leave things to the imagination and hint at a larger world, but also because spectacle is easier if you're not giving the full details of how, say, a plasma blaster actually works. Star Wars has spectacle in spades.

Star Wars happened to come along at a time when the pulps had been dead for a while. It reintroduced that aesthetic to a new audience and hooked into those familiar patterns in the old audience who was familiar with the pulps. From there it gained institutional inertia and dug its hooks in with the expanded universe and loads of merchandise.
