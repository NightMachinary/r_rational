  Why do people still love SW so much?
#+end_quote

I suspect a combination of two causes: that at the time it first came out, it was, in fact, one of the best available pieces of SF on visual media; and that a lot of people watched it at an age where they imprinted on such things.

I'm still rather fond of the "Mystara" setting for Dungeons and Dragons, which I was exposed to at roughly the same time, in spite of it being based on D&D physics and having all sorts of inconsistencies and silliness that should turn the worldbuilding on its head.

  Aren't they just trying to milk the franchise as much as possible at this point?
