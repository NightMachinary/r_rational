With trepidation, I dredge up another probably controversial opinion of mine. Downvotes are welcome as long as it generates interesting conversation.

Star Wars sucks. I don't get it, I just don't. It's a stupid predictable plot in a world with inconsistent sci-fi and paper thin characters. How did something this bad get so big? Having forced myself to watch all 6 and finding that I enjoyed maybe half of the first one (of the original three), it's beyond me how these movies got past pre-production.

It doesn't help that the universe doesn't have any depth and seems to be targeted at kids who've just discovered sci-fi. Hell, even most of the fanbase seems to hate the prequels. The world is written to be as malleable as possible, allowing for 100 comic books, 30 graphic novels, and 20 more movies.

So, why is VII generating so much hype? Aren't they just trying to milk the franchise as much as possible at this point? Why do people still love SW so much?
