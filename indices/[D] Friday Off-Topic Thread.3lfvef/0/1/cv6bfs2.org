I say this as someone who didn't like SW when I rewatched it as an adult, and who gave Phantom Menace a terrible review, publicly declaring that I would never give Lucas money again, because I felt at the time I was supporting a racist. I never saw the last two, although I've caught part of them on TV. So this is the original trilogy for me.

(I have softened in the last 15 years. Now I think Lucas is just tone deaf, and his donations of most of the proceeds from selling Star Wars make me think that I was far too rash in judging).

1. The Best Special Effects award the year before Star Wars went to Logan's Run. From the looks of the two movies you'd expect a few decades between them. Star Wars looked amazing at the time, and it holds up well.
2. My father took the (very young me) see it in theaters a second time. What interested him was that the movie constantly had music and themes. The music is legitimately one of the great orchestral pieces of the last century. Would it be as popular if it wasn't a movie? Of course not.
3. The world's depth is implied. The cantina scene, for example, implies dozens of other worlds, and not just "Human with a ridged forehead."
4. Having read Joseph Campbell, I'm not sure that it mattered that it tapped into the Hero's Journey architype, but there's certainly an argument to be made.

1. It's a sci-fi movie based on Swashbucklers and Samurai Movies. It's a glorious hodgepodge.

That being said, it's overlong, poorly edited (sometimes deliberately so, like the pulps), and the trilogy is repetitive.
