Since Alicorn's [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/dogs.shtml][Dogs]] story was posted here a while ago, I'm interested in knowing what you think about the following issue.

You probably know about the reducing animal suffering section in the EA movement? Anyway, [[http://qz.com/497675/to-truly-end-animal-suffering-the-most-ethical-choice-is-to-kill-all-predators-especially-cecil-the-lion/][the co-founder of Giving What We Can argued that we should start killing predators]] because they cause suffering by eating prey animals alive. Of course that was a really dumb suggestion because it's really hard to predict what the actual effects are of that kind of intervention.

As you could guess, [[http://thehsi.org/2015/09/10/animal-rights-gone-wrong/][the response to this was a bit hostile.]] [[https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153646854454700&id=99206759699][In Facebook discussion about this]] many people suggested killing the authors. [[https://www.facebook.com/VeganDotCom/posts/10153217867161872?hc_location=ufi][People argued that nature is sacred, that we should leave it alone, that morality doesn't apply to animals]]:

  One of the most problematic elements of this piece is that it presumes to impose human moral values on complex ecosystems, full of animals with neither the inclination, nor the capacity, to abide by them.

I don't think we should start killing animals to reduce suffering. Setting aside that, the question is, which is more important, the suffering of individual animals, or the health of the ecosystem or species as a whole?
