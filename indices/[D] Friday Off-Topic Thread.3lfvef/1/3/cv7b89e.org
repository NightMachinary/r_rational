I find it very dubious that extant animals suffer to the same extent as humans, and that I should care about animals to the same extent as humans. So forgive me if I simply don't care about this. If anyone starts to interfere with ecosystems (already approaching destabilization) that support humans for the sake of prey animals, I will oppose them in the only way I can, by posting loudly about it on the internet. And voting, if it ever comes up.
