Obviously animal suffering isn't as important as human suffering. But there's so much /more/ of it.

To justify your argument, you'd have to value animal suffering trillions of times less than human suffering (which seems rather suspicious), or simply not subscribe to utilitarianism at all - or consider animal happiness worthless.
