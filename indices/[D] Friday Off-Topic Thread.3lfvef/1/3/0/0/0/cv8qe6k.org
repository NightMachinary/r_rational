I'm not certain that utilitarianism has anything to do with it. Utilitarian moral objectivism seems to be the main argument here, while I'm more like a moral subjectivist. I may just be thinking of utilitarianism in the "shut up and calculate" sense, rather than by the philosophical tradition.

Speaking of, my ethics teacher seems to be bewildered by the fact that rational justification is not required for an individual's terminal values, while at the same time saying that terminal values (the Good) are the thing that all moral judgements are relative to. My classmates all hate me for talking too much. I think I'm just going to shut up for the rest of the semester.
