Really? I actually think Erratic has shown him to be very rational. He understands extremely well the rules that bind Names and uses them to ensure his continued success. Mind you his idea of success is everything burning and him dancing in the ashes, but he does have a method to go about it. The Bard even comments on it in this chapter:

“First step always works, so always have a first step going,” Aoede said. “Now, a lesser soul would say all that will accomplish is destroy more and and more of Creation until it all collapses on your head because you missed a beat.”

“The part that matters is the dance,” Kairos smiled. “Not the bow at the end.”
