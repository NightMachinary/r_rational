I suppose you could say it's not so much that he's irrational as that his goals are more aligned with Cat's. Akua wants to control creation. Cat does not want Akua to control creation. They will fight head-on and one will lose. They will each do everything in their power to win that battle. Kairos wants to destroy a lot of stuff. Cat wants him to destroy less stuff. If they have some big climactic showdown and Cat defeats Kairos, they're both happy with that. So they're not going to work to prevent that. Kairos is going to spend his time destroying stuff instead of preparing for that big climactic battle, so Cat will have a much easier time winning.
