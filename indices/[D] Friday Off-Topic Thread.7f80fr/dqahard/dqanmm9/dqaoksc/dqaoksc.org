Yeah, I have to second this. I tried the oculus rift DK2 a while back and it was "cool" but definitely still at the "toy" stage of things, rather than anything seriously worth using. The resolution is the biggest drawback right now-- these displays are a fair sight worse than 1080p per eye, even though they have great refresh rates. I'm thinking it'll take at least another generation before the screen resolution is up to par (at least 2000x2000 per eye, and probably a fair bit more), and probably a generation after that to get the form factor and control surfaces down pat. So looking at the relatively slow pace of development so far, VR isn't going to be very useful for consumers until the mid to late 2020's.
