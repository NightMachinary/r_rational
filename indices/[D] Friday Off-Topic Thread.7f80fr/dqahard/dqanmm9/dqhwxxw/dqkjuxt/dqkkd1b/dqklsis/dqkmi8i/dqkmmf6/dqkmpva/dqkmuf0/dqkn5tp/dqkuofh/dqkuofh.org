Your loss, broheim.

And I came up with a better analogy.

It's like not having any sort of phone at all, and refusing to buy the iPhone 5 because you know the iPhone 5s is coming out soon. When the iPhone 5s comes out, you'll refuse to get it because you know the iPhone 6 is coming out. At some point you have to just pick a point in the product cycle to jump in and accept the fact that something better is going to come out soon. Better headsets will come out in 2018 and I'll be stuck with my inferior headset, but then another batch of even better headsets will come out in 2019 and those people who bought in 2018 will be stuck with an inferior headset, then more headsets will come out in 2020 and I'll replace my current headset. That's just how it works.

I really feel sorry for you. You have no idea what you're missing out on.
