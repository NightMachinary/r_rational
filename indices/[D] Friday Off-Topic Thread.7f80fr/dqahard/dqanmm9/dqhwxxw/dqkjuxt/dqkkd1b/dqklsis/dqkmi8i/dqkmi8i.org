  Yes, and I've used headsets and seen the reduction in the screen door effect.

You've seen the screen door reduced, not removed. While the screen door effect exists, I'm not interested.

  That resolution is per eye, the effective resolution is 2800x1400.
#+end_quote

No, the effective resolution is the per-eye resolution, because you're seeing (effectively) the same thing with eac heye.

  Once again, it doesn't matter that you know the tech specs, you don't have any actual experience with these devices so you legitimately aren't qualified to judge them.
#+end_quote

Now you're just being ridiculous. Tech specs /do/ matter. I'd never used a 1440p monitor before I bought this one, but from my experience with lower resolution monitors, and, you know, basic math, I could tell it would be a significant improvement. And hey-- it was! Similarly, I can extrapolate my experiences with the DK2 to apply them to higher resolution monitor. Sure, I'm not /as/ qualified as someone who used VR headsets regularly, but your implication that my opinion doesn't matter just because I haven't used the exact headsets as you is baseless.

Even with your example, having been on a drop tower ride doesn't replicate skydiving exactly, but it doesn't need to-- having that experience of "falling" from a height still gives applicable experience.

  Read this article. I mean seriously, don't reply until you've read it thoroughly because I'll know if you don't.
#+end_quote

Huh, so it looks like my initial impression was more right that I thought-- not only is VR not worth using now, it'll be even longer than expected to get to the point where it's worth using. Though really, the article was mostly a rehash of stuff I'd already seen-- the only new information was about the lenses not being properly optimized and about the pixel fill.

Regardless, It's my cash, and I'm pretty confident in the judgement that it's not worth spending until VR has, minimum, 2K displays for each eye (and preferably, 4K displays). And that's before taking into account the fact that the VR content pool is so incredibly shallow right now, and that GPUs still need some improvement before they're even capable of running VR at the resolutions and refresh rates it would take before I found VR truly immersive.
