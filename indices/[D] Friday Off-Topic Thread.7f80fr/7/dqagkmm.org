I've posted here before about how I'm better at dealing with internal sources of stress than external, but the worst has finally come and I need some advice to survive this weekend. I currently have *15 dogs* visiting my house for my Mom's pet sitting business, none of which will listen to anyone when we tell them to stop barking and tripping us.

I can barely walk around or sit on a chair because of how much space they take up, every time someone opens a door or there's a noise down the street they sound the alarm, I spend half my day manning the door to the yard because they can't decide whether they need to pee, and I can leave them alone for 5 minutes without something happening.

After 4 days of this, I can barely think straight at this point and have gone emotionally hollow. I've repeatedly screamed myself horse in frustration and am on the verge of a anxiety attack unless I find some way to relieve this stress. I'm afraid to read or watch something relaxing because being interrupted might set me off and it's hard not to focus on how /temporary/ the reprieve would be anyway.
