That's rough to hear, I'm sorry you and your mom have got to go through that for the holidays.

My suggestion may be to do something like splitting half of them or more outside (don't know how big your yard is) and rotating with your mom, maybe sit outside in a chair and just read a light hearted book or comic, something that doesn't require too much concentration. The constant attention they need while indoors seems like it's the main problem, whereas if they're allowed to just run around outside and do their business if needed would make it not as stressful, maybe?
