  Hmm well, Brownian motion in itself is a stochastic process, so that's putting the cart before the horse a bit imo

I mean I was addressing the question of assuming quantum randomness how rapidly does that propagate up to noticeable macroscopic differences. As for quantum phenomenon behaving randomly in this context that seems basically settled, unless you want to stray out of well established models. In Copenhagen it's random, and in Many World's it's random from the perspective of any given Everett branch.

As for weather I was just referring to specific details not large term stuff/trends (though some pretty large stuff like specific hurricanes seems likely to be highly sensitive to initial conditions).

  Eh just because it's easy to implement a model with a certain property doesn't mean the property holds with respect to any real world process.

I probably should have explained that with more detail: The models like that weren't deliberately designed to be random. The one mentioned in the video was designed to model weather they discovered that changing whether you rounded at the 5th decimal or 6th (or something like that) would totally change things. Yes it's a simplified model, of real world phenomenon, however I wouldn't expect a vastly more complicated one to be /less/ sensitive to initial conditions since that's not generally the trend in chaos theory.

When it comes to human behavior yeah you're right people are for the most part fairly predictable, which is why I was careful to caveat that this applied much more to some behavior than others. However it's not like you can deny that some aspects of human behavior can't be predicted with near certainty beforehand since everything is running on slightly noisy hardware.\\
For instance I frequently make decisions where I have no strong opinion one way or the other, and so I suspect my final decision is down to neuronal noise. Though I also frequently use [[https://qrng.anu.edu.au/RawBin.php#][a quantum random number generator]] to make those decisions.

As for which people are born, that is also one of my go to's for a really obvious example of the butterfly effect since it seems like any change in initial conditions will probably change which if any sperm meets the egg and it's something which is much easier to point to than a combination of many tiny changes adding up.
