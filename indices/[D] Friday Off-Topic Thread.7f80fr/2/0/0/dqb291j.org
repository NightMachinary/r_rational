Thank you for responding!

  Because there's quite a few things like brownian motion that ought to be directly affected by quantum randomness due to being highly sensitive systems
#+end_quote

Hmm well, Brownian motion in itself is a stochastic process, so that's putting the cart before the horse a bit imo, and it also has the Markov property and expectation (0,0...) so I don't think any non-Brownian perturbations would really affect it any. Unless you mean to say that the quantum foam itself behaves in a manner that's roughly Brownian?

  the weather ought to be noticeably different since weather being highly sensitive is pretty well accepted
#+end_quote

Is this well established? Some of weather's current unpredictability might just be due to model misspecification and insufficiently granular observational scales -- I wonder if we could do a better job of predicting the weather if we had e.g. some ultrasophisticated mechanistic model and microdrones measuring conditions of every single cubic meter of the earth, or something. Climate certainly seems fairly predictable, but averaging chunks obviously removes variance. Maybe within some climatic range variation is chaotic? (e.g. you're very confident the weather in superstabledesertland is going to be sunny and between 110-111F exactly ten years from now, but can't say where in (110,111) it is -- likewise, you can be quite confident the earth won't freeze to absolute zero a century from now, etc.). Lorenz said something similar in his '72 talk but presumably the field has progressed quite a bit in the half-century since. IDK.

  This is just because even relatively simple computer simulation of sensitive systems can rapidly diverge simply because of a difference in initial conditions of one part in a million

Eh just because it's easy to implement a model with a certain property doesn't mean the property holds with respect to any real world process. I took a pop eco class a few years ago and we coded up a bunch of these positive Lyapunov exponent models but the instructor made plenty sure to distinguish between math-world and real-world dynamics (e.g. models of community structure fail to account for all the negative feedback loops in actual animal behavior afaict). Has it been super well established that these systems behave as they do IRL? edit: actually a double pendulum isn't a bad example here -- in math-world super chaotic, swinging to-and-from all willy-nilly, but in real-world I can very accurately predict where it'll be at some distant future point (at rest, due to negative feedback loops in the form of air and kinetic friction).

I'd say human behavior is pretty stable and balancing, actually! Most of my every-day behavior feels rather railroaded -- e.g. I check both ways when I cross the street, eat when I am hungry, strive to maintain other equilibria/homeostasis, etc. IDK much about action at the molecular level but it seems brains have a fair bit of redundancy, too.

My go-to examples of small-to-large amplification have always been: germline mutation generating novel phenotypic variation, and the filtering of hundreds of millions of sperm to just one during fertilization (which seem to get all swirled up during ejaculation, and if nothing else usually a couple hundred sperm are solid contenders during the actual egg breaching iirc. There might be some vaguely Brownian effects on their travel, too!). Though these might not have direct repurcussions until a few weeks into the pregnancy (where alternative embryos might impose different nutritional demands on the mother).
