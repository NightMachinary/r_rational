When it comes to the fact the computer simulations used for chaotic systems are generally deterministic that doesn't really matter much for our purposes since the important thing is that it's highly susceptible to initial conditions. As for these sorts of systems getting more chaotic with more complexity that will depend on whether the relevant influencers are convergent or divergent. But with something like a double pendulum adding more pendulums will only exacerbate the chaos in a lot of circumstances the more chaotic connected systems there are the less predictable things are.

  Well, in plenty of cases the noise is self-correcting -- e.g. a leaf falls on me and slows me down, but then I speed up slightly to compensate.

Sure but that only works for systems where the relevant variables are converging on a particular target. Whereas in circumstances where they aren't, internal feedback loops may well amplify noise.

  Aha! So you'd be a quick avenue for divergence in my original question if we live in that sort of stochastic universe! Though it does say "The hardware is constantly generating random bits at a rate of 5.7Gbits/s. Currently, the rate at which the live bits are streamed is being limited by the bandwidth of the internet connection." so draws from that site are still pretty deterministic at especially small time-scales.

I mean whether that counts as deterministic would depend on what you're using that word to mean. By the standard you seem to be using anything that's not /directly/ connected to a source of quantum noise would count as deterministic, since one could hypothetically look at the quantum noise before it affected the system in question and thus predict the outcome in advance.\\
In another sense however it's obvious not deterministic, since you couldn't predict things in advance of the generation of the quantum noise.
