When it comes to how quickly quantum scale randomness would make its way to the macroscopic level I'm of the belief it would happen quite rapidly. Because there's quite a few things like brownian motion that ought to be directly affected by quantum randomness due to being highly sensitive systems (like double pendulums but far worse). Which means I suspect in perhaps a few weeks the weather ought to be noticeably different since weather being highly sensitive is pretty well accepted.

However I think things may well diverge in other macroscopic ways more rapidly than that. More generally I expect /any/ system that's highly sensitive to initial conditions (ie the sorts of systems that are hard enough to predict they seem random) to probably diverge rapidly. This is just because even relatively simple computer simulation of sensitive systems can rapidly diverge simply because of a difference in initial conditions of one part in a million or less as is mentioned in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8wGQW-Y48][this video]].

So I suspect the number of systems that will be close enough to quantum scale effects to be affected is pretty large. Importantly however there will be many more higher scale systems that are within enough orders of magnitude of /those/ systems to also be affected and of course further systems affected by /those/ systems and so on up until you reach macroscopic levels.

Anyway I suspect that in addition to weather (though that takes weeks so it's not /very/ rapid) and things like lotteries that deliberately try to be as pseudo random as possible there would be many systems that would diverge within a day such as:

- Human behavior: I suspect some of our behavior is going to be affected by the brownian motion of individual neurotransmitters. So if the brownian motion is different then some neurons that would otherwise have reached the threshold for firing wouldn't or vice versa. How noisy particular people's behavior is however is hard to guess at.

- Things highly susceptible to /any/ difference in human behavior: If the noisiness of neurons is different I expect things like dice rolling which are fairly pseudorandom to not go the same as in another timeline.

- The specific behavior of pretty much any life: The point about neuronal noise applies to other vertebrates however even single celled organisms are going to be a little bit noisy because of brownian chemical motion.
