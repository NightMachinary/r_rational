(potential) ~*/WORM SPOILERS/*~

I had [[https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/7ese00/batman_vs_contessa_with_30_seconds_of_prep/dq7hw9h/][an interesting discussion]] recently on how Contessa (or, more generally, PtV) would fare in various contests, e.g. fighting Batman or playing darts or picking large numbers. It reminded me of another question I'd had about Worm when I'd first read it years ago (but never got a satisfactory answer to): is the Worm multiverse stochastic (as implied by Dinah's power, some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison_of_interpretations][interpretations of QM]], etc.) or deterministic (as implied by a strong interpretation of PtV or Coil's power, ignoring "blind spots" which imo should very rapidly cloud the future even in a deterministic universe without overwhelming preponderance of negative feedback due to sensitivity-to-initial-conditions reasons, trapping their users in some local minimum of future-space or some entirely foreign possible timeline, respectively)? Does precognition in Worm generally allow for total knowledge of the behavior of every particle in Worm (I guess the consequences would be similar if probability is a property of the system sensu stochasticity or a property of the precognitor's mind)?

This also relates to another question I've had regarding initial-conditions sensitivity and the nature of feedback loops that structure interactions and processes IRL. Note: IANAP, so apologies if this question is ill-conceived or poorly specified. If the universe at small scales is stochastic -- how long would it take for two identical earths, duplicated at this exact moment in time, to diverge such that one could [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_the_difference][spot-the-difference]] visually at the macro scale (or if that's too vague -- until you have the case where a person is dead in one universe, but alive in the other universe "10 minutes later" in their reference frame)? Since in recent centuries we've constructed tools that allows super minute effects to be amplified enormously, how would the distribution of times-to-noticeable-difference change if stuff like geiger counters didn't exist, e.g. the duplication happened not now but 1,000 years ago?

/Alternatively/, if our universe is deterministic -- say you have the same duplication and spot-the-difference condition, but now there's a slight difference in the two universe. Where the first looks as it should, the second is missing a single hydrogen atom from the center of the planet Jupiter, and is in all other respects identical. How long before the two universes visibly diverge? Obviously it would need to be at least .5-1h for gravity from Jupiter to propagate as far as earth, but can we say anything the order of magnitude of time it would take for macro-differences to arise (a year? a million years? my intuitions fail me)?
