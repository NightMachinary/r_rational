I really enjoyed My Hero Academia. The music is great, the action is great, most of the characters are interesting. But that can be said for a lot of shows: objectively My Hero Academia is fairly standard "great" anime, if that makes sense. I just know it connected with me on some deeper-than-usual level because I was tearing up by the end of the second episode: the last thing that made me cry that quick was Ender's Game.

I think the premise is what really sets it apart. Not the premise of "high school for superheroes," that's fine but nothing too special. I mean the premise of "what does it mean to be a hero in a world where 80% of the population has super powers?"

In most fiction with superheroes and villains in it, the people with powers are heroes because who else will be? "With great power comes great responsibility" and all that. Those stories occasionally explore what it means to be a hero on a deeper level, but the focus is still on the superpowers, because outside of people like Batman and Iron Man, Step 1 is always "Have powers." In their case it's "Have lots of money," which is just another way to say "Have power."

But in a world like My Hero Academia, almost EVERYONE has powers, having powers doesn't make you special. Sure some Quirks are pretty terrible for crime fighting and some are awesome for it, but even if yours is something as non-combat focused as making objects lighter, or talking to animals, the drive to be a hero as opposed to just working in construction or at the zoo or similar civilian tasks is what sets a hero apart. This is what it means when the protagonist gets chosen, despite being Quirkless.

I think the real focus of the show is that, in a world where everyone's special (and so nobody is), learning to be a hero means more than just learning how to use your powers. It means everything else: the desire, sometimes the /need/ to act when no one else will, or the spirit of sacrifice that goes beyond that which others expect of us, or even what we expect of ourselves.
