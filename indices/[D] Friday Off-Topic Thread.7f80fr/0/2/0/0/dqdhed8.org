Okay, that's not as bad as I feared: it sounds like they're at least ostensibly aware they have a problem, instead of denying it, getting angry, or insisting it's their money to spend as they please.

Have they tried therapy? It sounds debilitating enough that they might need professional help to recognize why they can't control their spending or stick to budgets.
