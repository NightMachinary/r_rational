You could try to chat with your sister and listen to and respond to her concerns maybe? Might be good for her to have a trustworthy and sympathetic ear (also, I hadn't read your 3rd to last sentence when I wrote this -- so I guess what prevents that trustworthy adult from being you? You could skype or call them or something without much difficulty). And it'd be good to teach your younger siblings good financial/budgeting/spending/saving habits so they don't learn from your parents, though I guess it sounds like you're doing ok? So maybe that's not as necessary (especially if they're coming up with money-saving lists on their own).

Assuming your parents are having basic needs met (and aren't buying digital goods while starving or something) and the concern for retirement is they eventually won't have $ to meet those basic needs, you could consider starting a secret retirement fund for them instead of sending money to them directly, maybe?
