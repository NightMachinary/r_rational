*PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:*

If you don't already own a virtual reality headset, now's a great time to get one because they're all on sale right now.

I'd personally recommend the [[https://www.digitaltrends.com/vr-headset-reviews/samsung-odyssey-review/][Samsung HMD Odyssey]], but the other Windows headsets and the Rift and the Vive and the PSVR should all provide a compelling experience. I owned a GearVR for a while, and even /that/ was relatively decentish; if you've got a recent Samsung phone and you just want to dip your toes in the water and see what all the VR fuss is about, it's not a bad option at under a hundred bucks.

Seriously though, VR is ridiculous and incredible and you should look into it and seriously consider getting a headset.

Thank you for your attention. This concludes our public service announcement.
