Lemme say the opposite. I have tried the HTC Vive and I was impressed, but even at a heavy discount I think technology (and content) is just not there yet. I'd recommend waiting for the next generation of devices, unless you want the equivalent of atari game design (there isn't even a good solution to movement yet) combined with the still unavoidable screendoor effect.
