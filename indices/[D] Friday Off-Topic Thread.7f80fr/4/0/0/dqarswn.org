Good content is... sparse. That doesn't mean there isn't a decent amount of captivating stuff out there. Google Earth VR is mind blowing.

I disagree about the movement issue. There's (in my opinion too few) games that allow you to walk around with the joystick like you would in a FPS, but you have to get your sea legs to do that or else you'll get sim sick (I had a DK1 Rift back in 2013 and most of the stuff available back then used standard FPS locomotion, so all these new headsets with positional tracking are like nothing, doesn't bother me a bit). But teleporting and snap rotation (rotating in 15 to 30 degree increments) works as a replacement for people with sensitive stomachs, and that's pretty much how it's going to have to be until the generation /after/ the next generation of headsets. I know that, since before the first consumer VR headsets were released, they've been working on devices that shoot electricity into your inner ear and trigger the little hairs that control your sense of balance and acceleration, but I highly doubt that that tech is gonna be ready for general release within the next 5 years.

As far as the screen door effect is concerned, the Samsung Odyssey has a resolution of 1400 by 1600 per eye, compared to the Rift and the Vive at 1080 by 1200. While this doesn't entirely mitigate the screen door effect, it /is/ a /significant/ bump in resolution and it's enough of a bump to make the SDE practically imperceptible in most use cases. It's a crisp display. PPI isn't a perfectly reliable metric here because blah, it's more about pixels per degree and there's pixel fill and and subpixel arrangement and just blah blah /blah/, but it's good for a rough estimate of SDE. The Rift and the Vive have a density of 441 and 447 pixels per inch respectively and the Odyssey has a density of 615 ppi. That might not be true because another source put the Rift at 460 ppi, but the takeaway here is that it's ~450 against >600.

Basically what I'm saying is that the resolution is good enough to use the headset for watching 2D content on a virtual screen, which /vastly/ increases the quantity of quality content. Also, HMDs using the PSVR-style "halo" are significantly more comfortable than HMDs like the Rift and Vive and GearVR that pull the headset onto your forehead and cheekbones like heavy ski goggles, so spending multiple hours wearing the headset watching video content is actually a realistic proposition. Having your own personal movie theater where you can watch Netflix and YouTube and play video games is pretty effing cool.

Relevant excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  A new display from Samsung targeting use in VR headsets packs a whopping 2,024 x 2,200 pixels into a 3.5″ form-factor, delivering an impressive 858 PPI, nearly twice the 460 PPI of the Rift and the Vive.

EDIT: The DK2 you tried had a resolution of 960×1080. The lenses were also cheap and generic; most current headsets use Fresnel lenses. You should find the nearest Microsoft store and do a demo of a /real/ VR headset (if no Microsoft stores nearby, some Best Buy locations still do demos of the Rift, you can find a demo location here:
