How do you know the resolution isn't high enough /right now/ if all you've ever tried is a DK2 Rift? How do you know the Pimax headset is any clearer than any other headset if you've never tried any other headset? You know the big draw of that headset isn't its resolution, it's the field of view, right? The DK2 you tried had a field of view of 95ish degrees, the Rift and the Vive and the Odyssey have a FOV of 110 degrees, and the Pimax headset is at 200 degrees. They've got more pixels, but they're spread over a larger surface area.

Seriously, go on Google and find the nearest Microsoft store and demo a more modern headset. All of the Windows headsets have a resolution of 1400x1400 per eye (except the Samsung Odyssey with 1400x1600 per eye). How can you know that the resolution needs to be "at least 2000x2000 per eye" if the only headset you've tried had a resolution of 960x1080 per eye?

I, personally, have in the past owned a DK1 Rift and a CV1 GearVR, and I currently own the Samsung HMD Odyssey. I've done close to a dozen demos of the PSVR (I was trying /really/ hard to convince myself to buy one, but the PS Move controllers are just... I mean, if the tracking on them wasn't terrible then I'd've forced myself to build a bridge and get over how anti-ergonomic they are, but the tracking on them is terrible; Sony should've designed new controllers instead of recycling old PS3 tech, but I digress), and I've demoed the Oculus Rift and HP's WMR headset. I didn't immediately run out and buy the Rift because I was waiting for the PSVR, and by the time I decided the PSVR wasn't up to snuff I'd been waiting most of a year and I'd been following the development of things like Intel's Project Alloy and Google's Project Tango and announcements were being made about the Windows Holographic platform and I figured I ought to wait another year, and I'm satisfied with that decision because I ended up getting a bitchingly awesome headset. [*Edit from more than a year later:* It wasn't as "bitchingly awesome" as I initially thought, and I sold it.]

The point of all that is, if /I/ were to make the "I'm thinking it'll take at least another generation before the screen resolution is up to par" argument, I wouldn't support that argument by saying "I owned the DK1 Rift a while back," y'know? If I'm mistaken about your experience with VR headsets then I apologize, but "I tried the oculus rift DK2 a while back" is pretty hard to interpret as anything other than "the only headset I've ever tried is a DK2 Rift." To be perfectly blunt, you really aren't qualified to judge the quality of the second generation of products when your only experience is with a prototype from before the first generation of products was released.
