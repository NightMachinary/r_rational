  How do you know the resolution isn't high enough right now if all you've ever tried is a DK2 Rift?

Because I've read articles and reviews that unambiguously state that the screen door effect still exists. It's probably not as bad, but so long as it's there, I simply can't justify spending several hundred on what basically amounts to a toy. I currently have a 1080p monitor and a 1440p monitor; going to what's effectively a single 1400x1400 monitor would be a huge step down in quality. The tech specs are pretty unambigious-- whether for gaming or serious productive work, the current VR headsets on the market simply aren't worth buying, at least for my use case.

Again, I can definitely see the appeal of VR in general (which is why I'm so excited about this double-4k headset), but I don't feel like wasting my money for the sake of being an early adopter.
