  Because I've read articles and reviews that unambiguously state that the screen door effect still exists.

Yes, and I've /used headsets/ and /seen/ the reduction in the screen door effect. The fact that you can still see pixels if you stop moving and really look for them is irrelevant when you're moving around and doing stuff. Your eyes focus off into the distance and it disappears.

That resolution is /per eye/, the effective resolution is 2800x1400.

  The tech specs are pretty unambigious-- whether for gaming or serious productive work, the current VR headsets on the market simply aren't worth buying, at least for my use case.

Once again, it doesn't matter that you know the tech specs, you don't have any actual experience with these devices so you legitimately aren't qualified to judge them. I'm not talking down to you here, I'm stating a fact. I'd never walk up to a professional skydiver and say "I've never jumped out of a plane, but I've rode [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_tower][drop tower rides]] at amusement parks and I've looked at the math regarding terminal velocity and such and therefore my baseless opinion on what it /probably/ feels like to jump out of a plane deserves to be taken just as seriously as your /actual/ experience."
