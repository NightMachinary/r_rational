  You're basically arguing that it's not worth upgrading from a 30 inch 720p TV to a 40 inch 1080p TV because it isn't 4k yet.

Actually, I would say that. Or rather, I would say that the bump from 720p to 1080p isn't high enough to justify upgrading, and that instead it would be a better idea to wait until a 1440p tv fits in the budget. I could have upgraded my 1400x900 monitor to 1080p more than a year ago, but I decided to wait until 1440p monitors started dropping under $200 instead. Incremental improvements are just wastes of money-- it's best to use something until it's obsolete, then buy something that's future proofed.
