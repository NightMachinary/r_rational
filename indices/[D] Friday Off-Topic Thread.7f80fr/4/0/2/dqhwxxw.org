So I was saying that I was going to need to wait a few years until display resolution was what I wanted...

[[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimax8kvr/pimax-the-worlds-first-8k-vr-headset][I WAS WRONG]]. It's 2 4K displays rather than a true 8K display, but this is still ridiculously amazing. I'm a little hesitant because it's being made by a small chinese startup on kickstarter, but then again, oculus got big the same way. The display is also a bit clunky in the sense that the regular version only supports upscaling regular 5k output converted into 8K output, and the 2x 4K version will be significantly more expensive, but it's still an incredible leap forwards.
