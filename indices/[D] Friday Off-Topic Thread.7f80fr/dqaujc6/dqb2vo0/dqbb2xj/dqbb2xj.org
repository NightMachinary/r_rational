  My partner and I watched the first episode (or two) and it didn't really grab us, so we moved on to other animes. Do you feel you were intrigued from the very beginning, or did your enjoyment build over time?

I think it builds over time, but I was particularly grabbed by the end of the second episode because the protagonist's emotional moment just felt so genuine and earned by the show, despite only being 2 episodes in.

  aww, but I think if you can talk to animals you can be a much better hero campaigning for super-well-informed welfare reform, or setting up comparative-advantage trades with different nonhuman populations, or even working as a zoo veterinarian, than trying to fight crime through direct combat

It's not explored a lot, but I don't think it makes the animals sapient, I think it just works like a sort of mind control.

  it IS just like the real world, then!

Yeah, I think that's the underlying point, more or less :)
