My partner and I watched the first episode (or two) and it didn't really grab us, so we moved on to other animes. Do you feel you were intrigued from the very beginning, or did your enjoyment build over time?

  I mean the premise of "what does it mean to be a hero in a world where 80% of the population has super powers?"

[[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html][Ah, so just like the real world, then!]] Though I guess the baseline IRL superpower package tends to be pretty uniform -- the booooring "walking squishy brick" -- supervision, superhearing, superstrength, superspeed, supermobility, superanalyticalreasoning, etc. and further specialization is more often the result of practice than anything else (except when you filter your reference class by "practice a helluva lot" -- then most of the variation obviously goes back to being attributable to "inborn superability", though even there the variation has often shrunk to barely anything relative to the whole population). Some supertechnology has given people even more superpowers, and inequality in its allocation seems to exacerbate matters somewhat, but still...

  but even if yours is something as non-combat focused as making objects lighter, or talking to animals, the drive to be a hero as opposed to just working in construction or at the zoo or similar civilian tasks is what sets a hero apart

aww, but I think if you can talk to animals you can be a much better hero campaigning for super-well-informed welfare reform, or setting up comparative-advantage trades with different nonhuman populations, or even working as a zoo veterinarian, than trying to fight crime through direct combat

  learning to be a hero means more than just learning how to use your powers. It means everything else: the desire, sometimes the need to act when no one else will, or the spirit of sacrifice that goes beyond that which others expect of us, or even what we expect of ourselves.

it IS just like the real world, then!
