Looking for a specific rational story. Please help!

Story consisted of the meeting between humanity and an alien species, but the aliens were concerned only with trade and economics. The story introduced many economic principles and all of the characters had agency and were driven by a goal. It might have been Stargate SG - 1 FanFiction but I'm not positive. If anyone can find this or remembers it I would love to read it again.
