I had the same thought about talking to the sister about the issue.

If you ([[/u/Kylinger][u/Kylinger]]) decide to pursue that course of action, I would recommend not initiating it up with something like "so I found your list in the trash" and instead go for something more along the lines of "so are mom and dad still being really bad at handling money and overspending" as if it's a known variable, letting her know that it's not just her and that other people also see your parents spending patterns as abnormal and that it's normal to notice it.
