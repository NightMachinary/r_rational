I participated in a 48-hour gamejam last week, and my team won best novice game for [[http://gamewithus.ca/games/?gameID=110][our entry]].

It was a fun time, full of collaboration, learning new skills, and learning when new skills would take too long to develop and hacking something together (I don't think there's a single =else= in our code.).
