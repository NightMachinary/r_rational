i know what you mean, I have abandoned a lot of videogames after exams or whatever forced me to stop working for them for a week or more, sometimes just because I didn't want to work on them for a week and couldtnt return to the project afterwards. .which each new project I've become increasingly obsessive which taking notes,and for the relatively simple game I'm working on , combined whith making the code as easy to understand for my future self and made of small pieces as possible I was able to return after a month and remember what most of it did.I haven't done anything in two weeks though.

For you I ( although it's not like I have a solution to that problem , otherwise I would have finished games, but extra credits has an episode on this which you probably should watch and says basically the same plus other advice) recommend trying to read the code at least for a moment every week, even if you don't have time to do anything else, just to avoid forgetting the parts that lived in your head and how it works(of course if you are depressed you won't necessarily be able to do that).
