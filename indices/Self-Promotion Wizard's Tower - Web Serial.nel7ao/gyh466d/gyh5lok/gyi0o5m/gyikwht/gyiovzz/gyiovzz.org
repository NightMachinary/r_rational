I could have phrased that a bit better.

I wouldn't take it that far, I'm just suggesting that /if/ someone were active and known here, they would be well received. Basically a free pass... skip all the other qualifiers... kind of. I'd still expect people to be pretty critical.

Most of the people who would qualify for that well-known list, at least in my mind, are already well-written authors who just happen to reach out on this sub. Not just people who post here occasionally.

Alexander Wales, Nobody103, Yudkowsky. Whatever they pump out next is going to get a good run here, even if it's not strictly rational.

I don't think anyone should care about 'proving credentials' outside of proving a capability of writing intelligently. I might be wrong, but to ask otherwise just seems a bit circle-jerkish to me. And if a newly minted author were active here, their writing would be a known quantity, to some extent. You haven't, I haven't, a lot of people haven't, so it isn't known. You're improving that reputation of competent writing just by responding to these comments.

You do you, write well and coherently, and even if this sub bitches about your work like they do Delve, well, that guy's making like $5k/mo. We don't matter all that much, the redditors here are just a small group of very critical and hard-to-please people looking for very specific niche fiction that is not well catered to.
