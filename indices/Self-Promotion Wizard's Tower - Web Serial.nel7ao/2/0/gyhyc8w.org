Thanks! I appreciate your candor and frankness. I'll look into rewriting the blurb to offer a better expectation of the story.

You're the first (and only) to bring that up and let me know, despite having the blurb up for more than a month on Royal Road. I feel a bit like I have been talking with a piece salad in my teeth and you're the only one who pointed it out.
