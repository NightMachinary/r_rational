I'm 44 chapters in, and it is my current favorite on RoyalRoad. It has a slice of life feel to its pacing, but it looks like existential threats to this world are on the horizon and the protagonist will have to be involved. The MC is pretty rational, personal quirks and some other circumstances aside, and the other characters actions are consistent with their characterizations, even if sometimes that is made more clear to the reader over time. The worldbuilding is not only thoughtful but does not just follow common tropes. I'm really impressed by how often the author will fix typos within a few minutes of a comment reporting them, as well as by the reasoned responses to criticism.
