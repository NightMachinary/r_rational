I'm not going to read your story, and I think you deserve an explanation why. Because your blurb has turned me completely off of reading it, and if that's losing you other readers, you should probably fix it.

I can break your blurb down into two parts: a backstory for the main character, and an idea of what the story is going to be about, and what the character wants. That's fine: it's a good way to construct a blurb, and you've baked some good world-building into it, too. The problem is that neither part is compelling.

The backstory part talks a lot about deeds that the character has done, of titles he has earned, but they're rhymed off like items on a grocery list. They don't have any weight. I don't think this is the problem, though: I think it's exactly what you're going for. Your wizard is weary, has lost interest in those deeds and titles, has lost all reason to want to interact with the world. In a word, he's depressed. And that could totally work: he's not a character who's a lot of fun, but it's often compelling to watch characters like that deal with what life throws their way.

Where you lose me is the second half of the blurb, By this point, we understand the character, so we want to know about the story. We know what the character wants; we don't know what is preventing him from getting that. And the second half of your blurb does next to nothing to establish a conflict; the most it does is to hint that this won't be the case by saying "We'll see if that happens."

As a comparison, if you look at a copy of /The Hobbit/, you'll probably find the following:

#+begin_quote
  Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.
#+end_quote

Your blurb establishes that this is a person who would rather not being out going on adventures, much the same as Bilbo. But /The Hobbit/'s blurb only dwells on that for one sentence, before telling us that there are forces which prevent him from living out his days in contentment in his hobbit-hole. That's what's missing from yours.

The heart of any story is conflict. And while a character struggling against depression is a decent conflict, your blurb makes it sound less like the story is less about him struggling against depression than surrendering to it, and the latter is not a story I'd care to read. And if that's *not* the story you've written, then your blurb should be revised so that it sells the story you /have/ written.
