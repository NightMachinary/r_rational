Im no mod, but I feel like excessive self promotion might be frowned upon here; instead of a post like this, you'd be better served by doing something like "Wizards Tower End of Arc 1" or "Chapter 44", since there's no issue with just posting links to your work. I guess people also don't want constant chapter spam, but you could just do discussion threads in batches of 5+ once per week or something

Related to that, you asked at the end of the chapter if people would mind if you switched to less frequent posting. I would suggest you do go to fewer chapters per week, perhaps 2-3 longer chapters. I think meeting a post per day requirement can have a negative effect on quality.
