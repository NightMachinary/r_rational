  If I recognized you from discussion threads here for other authors. This sub is a kind of tip-of-the-iceberg place, rational fiction goes a lot deeper than this and there are some very intelligent writers who are not well promoted outside of this environment. Basically, convince me you're intelligent and competent.

I understand that having a reputation on this sub and being recognizable goes a long way toward establishing that you actually understand the culture here. I find it unfortunate because I am mostly a lurker that is here to read interesting rational fiction. I've been here for years, but I have hardly any proof because I didn't even bother to make a reddit account for a long while.

Us lurkers are just screwed I guess. If I ever wanted to self-promote a rational fic here, I'd have to reference a lot of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] stuff just to "prove my credentials" so to speak.
