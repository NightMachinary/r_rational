  what would convince you to consider reading the story?
#+end_quote

- A spoiler revealing a self-contained, worthwhile and well written piece of your story.

- The size of your discussion thread on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and the general bitching : discussion ratio. (I mean I still read Delve, but god the comment sections here lol)

- If I recognized you from discussion threads here for other authors. This sub is a kind of tip-of-the-iceberg place, rational fiction goes a lot deeper than this and there are some very intelligent writers who are not well promoted outside of this environment. Basically, convince me you're intelligent and competent.

- If there's a signal I see, either in an early chapter / discussion thread / whatever, that you actually kill off characters then that's a +1 for me. An author willing to kill an invested character in their story is a strength, unless they do it poorly.

Other people will have different criteria and I'm sure my criteria aren't universal to this sub, these are just a few things I look for in RR fics specifically. There are too many poorly plotted powertrip fantasies to sift through and they have learned to make themselves difficult to identify, like Defiance of the Fall turning into a wuxia meme around 30(?) chapters deep.

That said, I'm going to give a go at reading your story without any further prompting, mostly because I saw you earlier on RR's Trending or Popular list and you had over a 4.5 average review.

Your synopsis definitely *isn't* a turn on though, it reads too much like the generic power fantasies that infest RR. There's nothing to catch a reader looking for anything beyond that /in the synopsis/.
