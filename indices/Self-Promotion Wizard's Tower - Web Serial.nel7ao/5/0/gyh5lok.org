Thanks for asking!

I answered that question 12 days ago the first time I self-promoted here, but have no problem answering again.

It meets, in my opinion, all five of the requirements listed in the about section of this subreddit.

It's been recommended here before (which is actually what led me to find this group).

I could go on BUT, before I do (if you want me to), I'd like to ask: what would convince you to consider reading the story?
