Space after periods ought to be set using the same sort of formatting metadata as line height, font size, margins, or justification. Set within a CSS class or text style so that, unless overridden, it's defined in a single location for the entire story; maybe even presented to the user as an advanced display option.

Repeating the physical space character makes sense for physical typewriters, and monospace fonts, but not for web pages and word processor documents that already separate layout and styling.
