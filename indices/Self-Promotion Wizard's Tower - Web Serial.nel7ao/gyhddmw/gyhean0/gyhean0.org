Thanks! I wasn't planning on doing any further self-promoting here for at least a month or more after this post (whenever the next arc is completed) so hopefully it won't feel like spam at all by then.

With regards to the fewer / longer chapters, thanks for that advice as well. The daily chapters is more intensive than I had originally estimated, so I could imagine the story taking a quality hit at some point in the future if I tried to force it.
