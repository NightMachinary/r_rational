I would definitely suggest watching /Frozen/ before reading /A Bluer Shade of White/. It's not strictly necessary, but I think will enhance your enjoyment of the fic. Besides that, it's also one of my favorite Disney movies, and does its own deconstructions/subversions of the standard Disney tropes in a way that's pretty pleasing.
