I admit I was skeptical about reading something Christmas-ish initially, but then Eliezer Yudkowsky recommended it - it's worth a look. And then I was like.. wow, just wow. To take deconstruction of a concept to such a ridiculously badass level. My thought pattern regressed as the story continued, to something like holy shit, Holy Shit! Suddenly days have waltz by and I found myself despairing, frantically searching around for the next of his work.

I am ashamed to admit though, I haven't read a Bluer Shade of White yet. Took a great feat of willpower not to. As much as I hate leaving it like this, it's just that I never seem to be getting around to watching Frozen first. It's amazing to see how a writer can take a world, and make something extraordinary out of it. I don't want to miss out on that.

I wish Metropolitan Man didn't have to end :/
