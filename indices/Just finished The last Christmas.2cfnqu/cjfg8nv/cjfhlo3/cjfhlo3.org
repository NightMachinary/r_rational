Oh hey, that's me!

I'm glad that people like /The Last Christmas/, but I keep looking at it as a very flawed piece - complete in the sense that the story is over, but not complete in the sense that there are a lot of things that I want to eventually change about it. I wrote the whole thing fairly quickly after getting done with National Novel Writing Month 2013*, and had set Christmas as my deadline.

I haven't gone back to edit it since then, though I just did a quick reread and there are half a hundred things that need polish. The ending also needs to be about twice as long, but it's sort of a tricky thing because the opening sections are almost all talk and exposition of these impossible things, and it needs to transition into this war planning session type of thing if that's still something that I want to go with (which I probably do). Also, more foreshadowing. I'm planning to do all of the corrections in November and have the fixes in place by next Christmas season (when I figure people are more likely to read Christmas-themed stories).

* /The Timewise Tales/ is a story about people hopping backward and forward through time in pursuit of their goals. It's sort of about fate, destiny, and what to do when you know you can't change the future. I did a reread of it with some edits a few days ago to figure out which parts need to be shuffled around, which need to be rewritten, and which need to be scrapped. Depending on which of my current projects I decide to pick up and finish, it might be the next thing you see from me.
