The data/code-transparent machines are usually said to "have von Neumann architecture" or to be "von Neumann computers", when anyone talks about it. The self-replicators are 'von Neumann constructors' if you want to be unambiguous.

Also, who actually talks about von Neumann architecture as a separate thing? All modern computers have it, and with the possible exception of quantum machines, will have it for some time.
