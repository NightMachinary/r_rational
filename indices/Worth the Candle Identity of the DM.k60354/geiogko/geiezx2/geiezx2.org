Two more weak points in favor of this theory:

- Arthur's brother has been mentioned less than we'd expect for someone interested in/involved in/knowledgeable about RPGs. Sure, Arthur doesn't talk about his family, and sure, Arthur's brother is away at college, but Arthur's brother must have been very engaged with RPGs to have this large collection of source books. Surely Arthur would talk to his brother about RPGs at some point - it's apparently a strong shared interest. Heck, Arthur's brother might even visit home at some point - participating in a session would be plausible. Aerb!Juniper apparently even collaborated to some extent (perhaps without actual interaction) with Arthur's brother on the ruleset of the game running Aerb, and Aerb!Juniper's life is supposed to be pretty close to Earth!Juniper's. Yet we have had very little mention of Arthur's brother, none of these light, simple interactions that one might expect with the minor character who started Juniper and all his Earth friends on the path of RPGs.

- This would be an unexpected resolution of the "Who created/runs Aerb?" question. "It's just Juniper from the future" is the obvious resolution, and frankly, a pretty boring answer in itself, both of which are points against it. Arthur's brother would be a more interesting subversion. (Of course, the obvious answer is also sometimes just the answer...)
