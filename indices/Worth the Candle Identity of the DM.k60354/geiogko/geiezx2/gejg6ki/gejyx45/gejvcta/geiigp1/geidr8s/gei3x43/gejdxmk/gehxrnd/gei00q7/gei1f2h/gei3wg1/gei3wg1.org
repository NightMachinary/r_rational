Oh, I totally agree that that's the most likely interpretation.

On the other hand, Joon thinks the DM isn't Joon, and you'd think he'd be the expert.

Back on the first hand, Joon would know how to fool Joon into thinking he's not Joon...

And so on.

It all depends on how many layers you think AW is playing on. Going strictly by the text above, it's not Joon. One layer down, you'll notice that the DM doesn't outright /deny/ being Joon. A layer below that, and you'll notice that Joon, an experienced DM, doesn't notice this and call it out as an obvious attempt to misdirect without lying. But then we know that the DM can snap his fingers and reset the conversation to an earlier point until it goes the way he likes, and we have no assurances that we're seeing the first iteration of the conversation...

You could go around and around in circles forever arguing whether that chapter implies that Joon is the DM, or implies that he isn't.

My own opinion is that it's being left deliberately ambiguous, so I'm open to the idea of the DM being other characters than Joon. But then, I believed that the identity of the antagonist in HPMOR was being left deliberately ambiguous, and the author has said that wasn't the case, so take that for what it's worth.
