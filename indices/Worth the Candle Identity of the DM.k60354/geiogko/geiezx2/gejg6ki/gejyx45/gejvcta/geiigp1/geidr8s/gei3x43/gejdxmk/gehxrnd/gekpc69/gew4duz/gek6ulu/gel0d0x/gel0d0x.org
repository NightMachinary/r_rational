I dont think Joon is a real person. Stupid name, stupid town name of Bumblefuck, unrealistic rpg adventures, way to advanced rpg adventures, way to inteligent teenagers, way to articulate teenagers and finally only person with modicum of real behavior is DM.

So DM is a player/programer, playing custom rpg game and every person inside is fake, and Joon is just a cover for a player like Shepard in mass effect. Just like Shepard, Joon is also being accosted by hot horny alien babes and plot convienicences.

That being said, its possible we are analyzing this way to much, and its just another isekai litrpg.
