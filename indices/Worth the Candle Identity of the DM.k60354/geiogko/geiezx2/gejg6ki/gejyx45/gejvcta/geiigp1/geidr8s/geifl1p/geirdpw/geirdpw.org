I'm okay with it. The Crimson King did it, it worked. It would be a reference to that trope and the whole story is trope soup in the first place. Alexander Wales can do that too, if he wants. He is an author of comparable skill, if not comparable success (yet).

Alexander, get that agent and get pitching for Netflix series! They want fantasy and superheroes, Limelight is ideal for that! (And I want to see Alan Tudyk play Galen.)
