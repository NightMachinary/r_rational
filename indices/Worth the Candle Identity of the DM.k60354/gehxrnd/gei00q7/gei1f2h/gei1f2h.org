See, I read that and took it as DMJoon altering his features a bit to keep from giving up the game, but that could be totally off base. I just have a hard time seeing the DM as anybody /except/ older Joon, given how tied the world is to the worlds he created in his head. Especially aspects like Fel Seed that weren't cribbed from another pre-existing campaign.

Edit: either DMJoon altering his features, or Joon just not wanting to see it. He can be pretty blinded to stuff relating to himself sometimes.
