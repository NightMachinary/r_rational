I'd find it a little disappointing myself, nor does it fit perfectly with all the evidence that we have (for instance, setting up the Lena Cordrew/Karen Dowler anagram wouldn't have been that much of a pain for him). Alexander Wales has the ability to be the DM and might easily have the inclination, though. For it to be Joon, Arthur's brother, or some as yet unknown character leaves us with the question of how and why they'd choose to be the DM, and it's hard to imagine a satisfying answer.
