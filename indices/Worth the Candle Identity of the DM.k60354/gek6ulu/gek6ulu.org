My craziest brainstory is that the GM is an AI made by future Joon. Basically, future Joon made an AI to entertain and heal his comatose friend. Shit went wrong, something like Arthur being fundamentally unhealthy or giving him what he is supposed to want keeps making him miserable. So Aerb turned into the grimdark version it is now.

Joon goes in to fix it and the AI has now combined his deep-seated self-hatred with Arthur's arrogance, helplessness, and misogyny to create the mess that is current Aerb. The game was originally set up for Arthur 2.0, but starts adapting when Joon lets the first version of Amaryllis die.

It's so tenuously supported that I don't even consider it a theory, but it's fun.
