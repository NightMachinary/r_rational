I'm confused why "the DM is the author" isn't on your list. It works even better with the "kindred spirits" line, explains why he has the power that he has and fits the metafictional nature of the story. Ever since Juniper started speculating about how he might be emulated in precisely the same way that the people of Aerb could be emulated (and he's right of course, they're all characters in the same story), that was my best guess.
