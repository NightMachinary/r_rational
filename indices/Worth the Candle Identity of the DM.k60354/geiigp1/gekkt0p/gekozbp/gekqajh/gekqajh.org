So that gives him an upper bound of 50 years to work on developing simulations, but that puts him in the 2060's. There's no way sims of that complexity are possible in the next 4 decades. Though I suppose you can always hand wave this away by saying their technology advanced faster, or June went into cryostasis and came out when tech was better, but that just feels contrived.

But more important than all that is; does this feel like a good explanation? Is it satisfying to say this really was all just a elaborate fantasy fulfillment on the part of an old man?
