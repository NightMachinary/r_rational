  There's no way sims of that complexity are possible in the next 4 decades

I wouldn't be so sure about that. Think about processing power 40-50 years ago.

And its possible future medical advances will give him at least a few more decades. Assuming future Joon came into big money to make this simulation, we can expect him to access top medical stuff.
