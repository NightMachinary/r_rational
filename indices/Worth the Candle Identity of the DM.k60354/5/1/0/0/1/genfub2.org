  There's no way sims of that complexity are possible in the next 4 decades.

I guess I have to sit down and explain the futurist concept of longevity escape velocity to ya. (Transhumanism is a theme of the story, and not dying is kind of the whole point of religious things like the technological singularity.)

Simply put, "curing" aging outright and immediately isn't necessarily necessary to avoid dying to it. Maybe the first treatments only get you +30 years. But that's 30 more years for new breakthroughs to develop to increase the average lifespan, and so on, until aging isn't a cause of death.

Whether that works out in real life or we end up poking each other with sticks when civilization collapses in 30ish years, well, doesn't matter. This is a story. About a simulated virtual world with at least one human-level agent; curing aging is way less amazing than that.

(As an aside following this kind of stuff is kind of depressing some days. One of the current hot topics is ISRIB, a *miracle brain rejuvenation drug*... for mice. Not you or me.)
