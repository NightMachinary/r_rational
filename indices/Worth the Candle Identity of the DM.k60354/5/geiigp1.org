I'm a fan of the theory that the DM is Joon, but not the same as the character in the story.

The idea being that the the DM is the real Joon, older irl, and that he had created this simulation. He initially put Arthur in due to never getting over his death. Putting Joon MK2 in is another attempt to deal with something he never got over. His teenage trauma and attempted suicide. Joon in the story is his attempt at creating an alternative past for himself, including changes to the character itself, to be more the person he wished he had been.
