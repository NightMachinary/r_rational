Okay, this is testing the ground because these stories have the same problems as Ender's Shadow - The author giving Sherlock the answers directly. But the data that Holmes uses to make deductions are occasionally available in the text to the reader - the reader's challenge is to make Holmes's inference in advance. The Sherlock Holmes stories are intended to be exercises in attention to detail, which is surely a useful skill for a rationalist.

It's not puritan rationalist fiction, I can admit that.
