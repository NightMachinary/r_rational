I like this introduction of Jiraiya. It's easy to forget that in addition to being a legendary ninja capable of summons and jutsu beyond that of any jounin, Jiraiya is also a spymaster. This is exactly the kind of test he'd run, and also the way he'd choose to apprehend Naruto. Jiraiya is good with people!
