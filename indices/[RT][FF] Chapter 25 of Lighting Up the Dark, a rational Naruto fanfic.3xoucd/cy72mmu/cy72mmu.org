In canon the [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Bell_Test][Bell Test]] was not invented by Kakashi. It was already used on the Sannin and Kakashis team. I believe Kakashi continues to give this test in canon even after it has failed on Orochimaru because of nostalgia/trauma. A test you can pass by not caring about passing (like the first Chuunin Test in canon) is not very good.
