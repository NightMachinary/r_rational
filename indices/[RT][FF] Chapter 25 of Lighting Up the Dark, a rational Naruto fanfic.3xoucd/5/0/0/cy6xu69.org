Seems like he means edit. Mostly reading over your work and rewording things in ways that make the story flow better, removing extraneous word or sentences, maybe even adding in descriptions where you think necessary. It's not a point against you, it's that most people become better at things after having practiced them and you've become so much better now that the difference is noticeable between this chapter and the first few.
