Sure thing, here's my biased view on it. Person with rather limited knowledge of Naruto and engineering knowledge ends up in the Naruto world in the brain of baby. Orphaned, and feeling like a prime target for Root 'recruitment', the SI attempts to grow strong enough to avert the coming possible end of the world whilst not being noticed as strong enough to be kidnapped and also giving targeted information to improve the odds of the world not ending, and also ideally improving his own standing. I take the butterfly effect rather seriously to the point that no-one conceived after the SI's introduction has the same genetics and has no guarantee to be the same gender, or even to exist in the first place, because sperm are highly random.

The focus of the story is on worldbuilding the world of Naruto to make some sort of sense, munchkining the hell out of limited resources, some comedic elements, friendships and high speed combat.
