Hey eaglejarl, you were the one writing the "Naruto is on Team Anko instead of Team Kakashi" fic, right? (if not, please ignore the rest of this comment)

If so, I was one of your early readers and I think I gave you some feedback on the first few chapters, but unfortunately I got so busy around that time I had to drop most of the web serials I was reading, yours included. I was thinking about trying to find it again recently, but was at a complete loss as to how to go about doing so until I recognized your username. What ever happened to the fic? Still updating?
