Hmm, maybe I'm accidentally equating Genghis Khan increasing the frequency of his specific genes with an addition of people with his genes when it should thought of as a replacement.

You are probably right that I'm misunderstanding how Genghis Khan affected the human population, but I still feel confident that there must have been /some/ people who directly caused more humans to be born.

Oh! Maybe something like a doctor who came up with better techniques for giving birth or raising children (so many women would hate me for this)? Either way, this is an interesting thought exercise in how to reduce the human population by using the Name, but it's a very crude tool for this contrived purpose so I wouldn't use it for this purpose. A bio-engineered plague is more cost-effective than time-travel after all.
