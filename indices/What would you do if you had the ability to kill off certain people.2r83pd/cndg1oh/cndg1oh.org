And, for me, I wouldn't use this power. The unforeseen sideffects could be huge (although limited, as our phonetic romanized language is only so old, so it's not like I'll be taking out anything too important, biologically speaking) and completely shift development. But, as I do live comfortably in our current state, I am obviously biased towards keeping it this way. For all I know, this is the darkest timeline, and only seems good relatively. Maybe if I took out all "Johns", we'd have had world peace by 1122?

Too unpredictable for my personal tastes. I don't think I would cause the end of the world, or anything similar, but I do think I could easily shift the current human condition. And that's not something I want to do randomly.

EDIT: minor change to what I mean by language.
