I'd research it more, given the opportunity. With no opportunity for research, probably Hitler. The other people that pop to mind - like Stalin and Mao - seem like products of their time who could have had equally catastrophic replacements. Killing Hitler might not stop World War 2, but it would probably stop the Holocaust.

Since that's rather standard though, my edgy answer: Aristotle.
