For generations after The Reaping, no parent dared to name their child with the Name.

To use the Name meant to become "unborn". If parents ever named their child with the Name, the child would die without warning to a different cause every time.

It became wild-spread policy to give ones child a name in secret at birth and to give them a different name for public use. Some would live their entire lives without ever knowing their birth name. To know someone's birth name meant to become part of their family. To call others by the Name, whether or not they already had a name, meant they were cast out of the world, out of society; they were less than a ghost, less than memory, undeserving of even a thought, kind or cruel.

The Word is synonymous with loss and the void of forgetfulness. Over time, the Word would pass out of memory, only to reappear in different eras, cultures, civilizations, as a nonsense pattern of syllables with the power to kill a person.

The Word is ____.
