Choose a Turing complete regular expression. You want one which works as a Universal Turing Machine with any TM representable as a name, and the expression matching iff the TM halts. As it is undecidable whether any given name is matched by the regular expression, by naming people specific names and checking whether they die, we've got a halting oracle or hypercomputation (same thing). That can trivially be used to take over the world.

To keep it more moral, we do it on soon-to-be-aborted fetuses and pay the parents.

But your idea also seems good; we /can/ kill everyone just by matching some form of *, and can exclude ourselves if we want to. That might work as a kind of threat against humanity: "make me dictator or I'll kill all of you".

(Wonder if this is the weirdest halting oracle proposed yet. Probably not.)
