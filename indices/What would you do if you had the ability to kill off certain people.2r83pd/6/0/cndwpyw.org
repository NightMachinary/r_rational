Note that after selecting a name, you change the course of history so that everyone who would have been given that name in your timeline effectively disappears (somehow), and no one will ever remember that they ever existed (except you, unless you had an ancestor with the Name, which eliminates you a la grandfather paradox). So going by my interpretation of the post, you will never have to worry about getting caught, but no one's going to remember ever making a contract with you.

P.S. To answer your CEO question, assassinations are hideously expensive (according to every crime novel ever) and most CEOs aren't worth the assassination price. For the remaining few, they probably have high level security guards to protect them and the resources to find the person who is going around and killing off their fellow rich CEOs. So one CEO's death = $$ + the law + every other rich amoral CEOs = not worth it!
