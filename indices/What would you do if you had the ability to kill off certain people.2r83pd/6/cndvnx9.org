So any name that would have been used over a few hundred years ago is basically like moving to an alternate universe; I expect even a few changes to quickly turn into macro level changes that you wouldn't recognize, and the person making this choice would likely not be born in the new universe.

So this is only good for newish names.

As I'm a selfish soulless being: I would see which person with a newish name has the highest price on their head, then sell myself out as an assassin. Based on some movies and books I'm familiar with, I'd probably get at least $10 million. If I can manage to do it without getting caught or revealing the method, I would actually open an open market for the name to choose, which may yield more.

Or perhaps I could make a lot by betting against a company's stock and then killing the CEO? There are ways to get options with steep payouts, the question is how much leverage I could get for that. Come to think of it, why don't people do this already? Is it that hard to kill CEOs of large companies that potential profits are less than cost+risk? Or are other people just a lot more moral than I give them credit for?

(I'm so totally going on some secret government list now, aren't I.)
