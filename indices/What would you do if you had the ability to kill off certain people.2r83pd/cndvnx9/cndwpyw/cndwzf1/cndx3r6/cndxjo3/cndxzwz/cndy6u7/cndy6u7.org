(I happen to be an Ashkenazi Jew).

Are we assuming that I'd retain all of my knowledge? Then I could just choose any big discovery in the last 200 years and rediscover that myself, ensuring me big bucks. Which recent important discoveries are mostly a result of a single person (or group of people with the same name) and likely wouldn't have been discovered without them?
