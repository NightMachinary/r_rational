I argued that any mass elimination of people past a certain amount of time ago would change who you are.

If I knew that the CEO of any Fortune 500 company would die in the next week, I could make somewhere in 100s of millions by buying out-of-the-money puts on the stock. Can private security really stop someone who's willing to pay $50 million?
