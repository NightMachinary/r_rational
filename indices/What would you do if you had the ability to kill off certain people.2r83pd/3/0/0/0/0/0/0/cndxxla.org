That's true. I was thinking in terms of total number of humans alive and not how fast humans breed. Dang it! That's the purpose of all the calculus classes I've been taking! To notice when rate of growth (acceleration) is more important than the speed of reproduction (generation to generation growth).

I'm might be babbling a little here, but basically you're right and I'm a little frustrated to not be paying attention to the mathematics behind this sort of thing.
