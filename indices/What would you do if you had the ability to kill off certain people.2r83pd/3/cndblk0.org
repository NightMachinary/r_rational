Ideas off the top of my head:

Using the power to eliminate mass-murderers from history such as Hitler, Kim, Nero, etc... Although, my [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2r7r5f/when_people_are_given_awesome_power_they_dont/][previous post]] seems to imply that killing Hitler is a bad idea. Also can you save more people than the ones they kill?

Change history by saving an important person such as the JFK assassination (horrible president by today's standards by the way) or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria which sparked off WWII.

As a form of population control by eliminating people who are the ancestor of a large number of the world's current population. such as [[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0214_030214_genghis.html][Genghis Khan]] who has about 16 million descendents today. And those are just the male descendents that we can check; Genghis definitely had more descendents who are female.

An alternate form of population control is to pick extremely common modern-day names such as John (Caucasian), Muhammad (Muslim), Kim (Korean), Lee (Chinese), and so on.

EDIT: Oops, some of the names aren't just modern-day names. I doubt the Muslims would be happy with me killing off their Prophet. I'll still leave it in though, since Muhammad is /the/ most common name in the world.

Both population control suggestions are a bad way to go about reducing the human population since there is no name universally common among all cultures, therefore some ethnic groups will have more people killed off than others.

Final idea is to simply not use the power.

Further EDIT: I wonder how many cases of stillborn children and parents being unable to conceive are due to the child (in some alternate timeline) being unfortunately named?
