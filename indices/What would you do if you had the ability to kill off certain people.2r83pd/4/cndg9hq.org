In addition, names are a convention in and of themselves. They don't phsyically exist. They're placeholders. So the method by which this occurred would be heavily rationalized out by all of us, I presume, if this were a possibility.

For example, if I choose John, does history fate each child named John (specifically John. I choose to believe that derivatives won't be affected) with being stillborn? If so, this will easily be noticed a few thousand years ago, and we will just all know to not call our children John. Aside from any butterfly effects (although we can't discount these, either), I presume things would proceed in much the same manner, albeit with a varying devotion to studying why this specific act occurs, especially by scientists. I am also certain various religions will form based around this occurrence.

I could go on, but I'm feeling lazy.
