It's a Chinese xianxia trope which is inspired by Buddhism and Taoism and a bunch of other stuff, +kinda like how mana comes from the Bible+. Supposedly there are xianxia novels from the warring states period, 2200 years ago.

I always found it strange that the Buddhist idea of meditating to eliminate the illusion of self and to relinquish all earthly attachments in order ascend to the next level of existence is twisted into xianxia's avericious, nihilistic, amoral race for ultimate power. Fodder for a humanities thesis.
