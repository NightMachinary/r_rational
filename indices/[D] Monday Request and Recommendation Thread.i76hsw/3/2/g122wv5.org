I personally don't believe there's a single story that can be pointed to and given the credit for cultivation novels being a thing in English speaking countries. I do not believe Savage Divinity is the first popular cultivation novel as it'd have to compete with a slew of translated works some of which have good translations.

I started off by reading Tale of Demons and Gods' manhua on Batoto, got impatient for new chapters, and ended up finding the novel on Wuxia World which was further ahead. Qidian, Gravity Tales, Wuxia World, and Novel Updates helped make xianxia more available to the public.

If you're looking for some pretty alright novels Er Gen's stuff is pretty good along with Cultivation Chat Group, Street Cultivation, and Forty Millenniums of Cultivation.
