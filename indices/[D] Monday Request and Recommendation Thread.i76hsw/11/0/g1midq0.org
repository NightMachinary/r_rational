These might help : [[https://www.alexirpan.com/webcomicrecs/]]. For more rationalism, try one-shots [[https://xkcd.com][XKCD]] and SMBC ([[https://www.smbc-comics.com/]])

My personal favourites: (descriptions from tvtropes or webcomic sites, with edits by me)

[[https://www.paranatural.net/comic/chapter-1][Paranatural]] - is a comedy/action comic about a group of superpowered middle schoolers fighting evil spirits and investigating paranormal activity in their hometown. The art becomes full colour and VERY AWESOME in a few pages, please give it until that long. I love this one very much

[[https://www.daughterofthelilies.com/dotl/part-1-a-girl-with-no-face][Daughter of the Lilies]] - is a fantasy/ adventure comic. Thistle is a hooded combat mage on the run from her past. She's hired on by an Orc mercenary named Orrig to work with him and his rather fractious employees. The comic follows her adventures

[[https://blindsprings.com/comic/blindsprings-cover-book-one][Blindsprings]] - is a storytale/fantasy/adventure/mystery comic. Princess Tamaura survived a revolution by making a seemingly Faustian deal with mysterious, masked spirits. Pledged to them for 300 years, Tammy is about to fulfill her pact when a young man finds her and decides that she is meant to be saved, whether she likes it or not. His "rescue" pulls Tamaura out of her timeless verdant sanctuary and into a world that has advanced without her ... where war is brewing over the same magic that flows through her veins. How will her return change this new world?

[[https://www.farnorthcomic.com/comic/don39t-tell][Far to the north]] -   is a Fantasy comic. Far to the North follows Kelu as she runs to the monsters of her remote mountain home when her family is captured by outsiders.

The same writer also has [[https://www.tigressqueen.com/comic/page-0001][Tigress Queen]], which is fantasy/adventure. The tribal nation of Zizumbir has been fending off settlers from the Jaezian Empire to their north for generations. Kizarasunga, the current warlord of the South, has been invited to meet directly with the Jaezian Emperor to finally put an end to the bloodshed. The catch to the Emperor's plan for peace is that it requires a marriage alliance that no one is exactly keen on.

[[https://www.clockwork-comic.com/comic/page-1][Clockwork]] - is fantasy/ mystery. Cog Kleinschmidt works happily as an artisan within the stronghold of the world's leading empire, Mercia Fortress. He finds his life taking a screeching turn upon the arrival of a diplomat from the enemy Kingdom of Arcadia, who needs something from Cog - whether he agrees or not! Cog soon finds himself trapped in the faraway Kingdom of Arcadia - an aristocratic haven with rich history and even richer tastes. However, Arcadia heaves with creepy undertones and conspiracies, but the citizens seem willfully ignorant of the bizarre events going on under their noses. Cog finds himself getting pulled further into Arcadia's paranormal side, and decides the only way out is to solve the kingdom's mysteries himself - with any help he can get from Arcadia's stepford-like residents!
