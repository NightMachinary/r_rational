I'd recommend the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron][Masters and Mages]] trilogy if you want something similar. The setting is not modern, but magic plays a large part in the development of the setting. This trilogy is probably my favourite published work from the past 2 years, and it's complete!
