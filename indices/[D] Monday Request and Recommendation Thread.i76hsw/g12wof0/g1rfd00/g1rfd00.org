Ex Synthetica is an optimistic Worm fanfic, with a Taylor that is a shaker able to control really small mechanisms (think nanites).

Aces and Jokers has an SI with card powers, kinda. It's like a combination of Dauntless and Uber. The SI goes on to fool around in Brockton Bay instead of being too fix-it-y. Usually keeps a pretty comedic tone throughout, although it gets kinda wild later on with what happens with the power. You might still like it.

Communication is a worm quest where each decision is the combined opinion of all the SB users' replies. Pretty funny to read at first, and at times wholesome.
