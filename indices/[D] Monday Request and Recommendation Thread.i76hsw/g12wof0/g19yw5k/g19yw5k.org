There's been a bit of a renaissance in mindless, cheerful Worm fanfics.

None of these are particularly rational, but they're all fun in different ways:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/oogways-little-owl-worm-kung-fu-panda.857691/][Oogway's Little Owl]]: Worm / Kung Fu Panda crossover. Really nails the heartwarming and funny bits of Kung Fu Panda.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/refusing-the-call-worm.869941/#post-69059755][Refusing the Call]]: Worm / DC (but not really) crossover. Someone, somewhere, is trying to get Taylor to be a cape. She's far too sensible for that.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/taylor-has-a-strange-hobby-yandere-taylor.860167/][Taylor has a Strange Hobby]]: Yandere!Taylor knows how to get bullied. Sophia starts bullying her. It's (one-sided) love at first shove, but evolves quickly from there.
