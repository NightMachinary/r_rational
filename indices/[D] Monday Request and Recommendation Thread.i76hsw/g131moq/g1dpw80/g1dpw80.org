Regarding Tales of MU I want to warn you that the links to the first chapters are all broken. You can still get there, but it requires some manual fiddling.

Beyond that, I remember enjoying it as a teen, but the author definitely has (or at least had back then) a problem with dropping story lines and never picking them up again. In the beginning 3+ chapters were needed to cover a single day (which I personally still enjoy but many regard as far too slow pacing) until she herself noticed it went nowhere and skipped a year ahead in time as a soft restart.

I think it's still ongoing, but I haven't read it in over half a decade and don't even remember why I stopped.
