Yes, children swallow whatever propaganda is fed to them and I would no less blame an american child from admiring the CIA than I would a german child in the 30's from wanting to join the hitler jugend. But the author is presumably an adult, in which case lionizing the CIA betrays either ignorance or endorsement of evil.

I say this as a citizen of a country that suffered for decades under a military dictatorship whose coup on a democratically elected government wasn't just aided by the CIA, it was instigated by it, and whose new regime's torturers and political suppressors were trained and indoctrinated [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation][on US soil by it]]. The US president at the time even committed to an outright military aid(i.e. an invasion) if there was any pushback in order to reassure the conspirators, which luckily there wasn't. Regardless, the result was thousands killed and tortured, neutered and stillborn democratic institutions, and considerable economic and cultural development set backs.

The funny part is that because the CIA sowed so much chaos and caused so death, disorder and misery on false intelligence and harebrained analysis throughout the entire world that the above paragraph *does not narrow down which country I'm speaking of at all*. It could be indonesia, where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366][millions were abducted and secretly killed]], and their families didn't know for sure for decades. It could be Chile where the tens of thousands of political prisoners were tortured or killed, or a dozen other countries in central and south america, in africa or asia. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, there's no knowing how much shit they got up to that we'll never even find out.

In closing, if there's any justice one day admiring the CIA is going to be regarded by the wider public as only slightly better than admiring the NKVD or the SS. For many people that's already the case.
