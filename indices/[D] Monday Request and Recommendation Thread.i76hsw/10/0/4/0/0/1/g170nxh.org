  But the author is presumably an adult, in which case lionizing the CIA betrays either ignorance or endorsement of evil.

And therein lies your flaw: "lionizing the CIA" never actually happens. It's just a character detail, which you would know if you had actually read anything instead of instantly dismissing it. A detail which fits the character's personality and motivations. It is, after all, an isekai lit-rpg, and not a spy story or some other type of CIA based fiction.
