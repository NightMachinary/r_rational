The largest problem with the plot is that most of the book is a version of a locked room mystery that gives the impression of there being clues, but isn't actually solvable purely from what the text says. On the other hand, on a meta level, the culprit is obvious from very early on.

On a mechanical level there is quite a bit of improbable encounters that both favor and hinder the protagonist. To your last point, there's very little exploration of what the culture of this society is actually like, though based on the summary it appears the next book will expand the scope a little more.
