This is on my list, it sounds very interesting but I heard the plot is not particularly thought out. Quite a few holes here and there, and things being quite convenient at times. The premise is fun though, and the setting could be very interesting in the hands of a competent world builder.

Make a world where rulers are necromancers, extrapolate how society and customs would work given that, give the magic system some depth and utility, add some likable characters with a somewhat alien culture that has different views on death and you'd have a very good story in your hands. From what I hear this is that book but made by an average writer.
