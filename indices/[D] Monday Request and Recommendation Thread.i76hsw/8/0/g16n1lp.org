You asked and you shall receive. Now I don't know if I'd call any of these stories particularly rational, but I enjoyed them.

Probably the most famous RWBY fic. Jaune awakens one day with the powers of a gamer. Great fic with lots of cool plot developments and worldbuilding. Diverges heavily from canon almost immediately as when it was written not much of RWBY had actually yet been made.

  When Jaune woke up back in his house with his sisters and family, all he could do was sigh. Every time he died he was forced to start over again, and this was what... the one thousandth time? More? If it doesn't matter how hard he tries, doesn't matter how much he fights. Then maybe it's time to just kick back and enjoy himself. Fate can find someone else to be its whipping boy.

One of many stories from Coeur Al'Aran and in my opinion his best. If you really want RWBY fanfics he has written several, and they are all competently written. I do think his quality goes down with later stories though.

An excellent White Rose (RubyxWeiss) romance story that is absolutely filled with angst in the best way possible. I highly recommend this if you at all like romance stories. Mikotyzni has written several other great stories that are worth checking. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157764/1/Rush][Rush]] is another great White Rose romance story by the same author but is significantly less heavy than What Defines Us. Might actually be a better starting point even though I personally like What Defines Us more.

Not a finished fic, but great and worth reading despite that. When I first saw it I assumed it was going to be yet another trashy Ruby becomes evil fic, but it surprised me with its amazing quality. It just finished its first phase at 301,541 words so its a good time to pick it up despite it being unfinished.
