I'm not paying for these translations and it turns out that I like decent stories more than I care about grammar or other translation quality type things. It's not for everyone though which is why I put the disclaimer.

Honestly, I have no idea if Reverend Insanity is a high quality or low quality translation. Im just so used to translations that I just dont evaluate stories along that axis any more.
