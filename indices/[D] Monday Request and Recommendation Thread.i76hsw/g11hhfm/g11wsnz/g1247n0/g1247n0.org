Twig is a great example. Sy is very weak physically, so he has to get creative with how he solves situations, which sometimes end up screwing him over (like all Wildbow protagonists).

The Lies of Locke Lamora is about a pair of con men who pull off heists on rich people. It's not /that/ rational but very entertaining, with some colorful language!

I haven't personally read it, but the Baru Cormorant series is about an accountant pulling off revolution through social manipulation.
