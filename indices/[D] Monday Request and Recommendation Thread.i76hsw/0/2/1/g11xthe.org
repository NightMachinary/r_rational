Hah. I haven't gone back to Erogamer in a while, mostly because I became more aware of Cindy's horrifying lack of caution, especially when that one boyfriend talks about how his extremely conservative grandfather would use it, how he would test and test and test and never do anything that hasn't been verified to not go horribly wrong. Contrast to Cindy, who explains why fat people's consent doesn't matter when it comes to forcibly making them beautiful. It just started making me anxious, which admittedly isn't terribly difficult and probably isn't indicitive of most people, but Cindy is far from the ideal person to hold the reigns for the universe.
