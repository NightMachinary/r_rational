[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies][Dark Skies]] Very innocent likeable MC has lots of bad things happen to them and has to figure everything out starting off not knowing anything. Slow burn. Prolific update rate. Semi-rationalist leanings as the MC figures out the world, although it's not competence porn - lots of mistakes.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429/cinnamon-bun][Cinnamon Bun]] Isekai where the main character is very enthusiastic and naive. Has been described here as 'reasonableness porn'. MC tries to solve things with hugs where possible, but accepts that this isn't quite /always/ possible.

The author, [[https://www.royalroad.com/profile/147338/fictions][RavensDagger]] has a number of works on RR and his own following. They're fun, and I enjoy them, but also not what I'd call rational in general.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32617/solomons-crucible][Solomon's Crucible]]. System apocalypse. System tech trees include modern weapons, which the MC picks up. Popcorn fic. Enjoyable.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] - (NSFW, Explicit) Cooperative dungeon core story. MC gains power by doing magical experimentation, by gaining and supporting a +harem+ group of companions. Think dungeon core makes lasers and expands political influence + explicit scenes.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/][Previous /r/rational Discussion]] - (NSFW, Explicit) Last updated Jan 2020, but I think worth mentioning since it's been so long since it came up in the sub - Also, I'm still binging. It's Rational Porn.

To borrow from [[/u/XxChronOblivionxX]] in the older thread:

  The thing that really stood out to me when I first started reading it was the depth of the MC's thoughts about the true implications of a power like this. The EroGamer power, as it's manual describes, has this casual and fundamental control over literally everything. History is rewritten, personalities shift and change, all to serve Cindy's little Erogame experience, and this is not lost on Cindy. It's surprisingly hard to describe this in detail, but people not shy about erotic fiction should absolutely give this a look just for that part.
