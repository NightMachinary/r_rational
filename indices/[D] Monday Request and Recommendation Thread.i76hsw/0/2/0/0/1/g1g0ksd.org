[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/tinker-of-fiction-worm-sort-of-crossover.54982/threadmarks][Tinker of Fiction]] is a /Worm/ quest. The MC is a self-insert into an original character, a 12-year-old boy who is sent to live with the Heberts. He is a Tinker who can access technologies from different fictional universes.

It's been fairly popular (for a quest) and spawned at least 3 other fics which used similar rules. Personally, I thought that the idea was cute, but the execution left me lukewarm at best.
