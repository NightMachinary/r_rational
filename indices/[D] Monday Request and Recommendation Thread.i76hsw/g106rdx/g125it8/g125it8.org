I'll second the recommendation. It's not /that/ rational, the protagonist becomes really powerful pretty quickly and receives some questionable powerups from dubious magicking. But overall it's a solid story all around. The worldbuilding is really well done, with an interesting and vibrant world with rich history. The system is really interesting too, but on a more mystical level than the math behind it. The characters are good, with most people being well rounded in flaws and qualities.

As for the quick powerups, it turns out later on that while the protagonist is technically powerful and an accomplished mage, he's pretty weak compared to his peers. He works to round out his flaws of course, and later on his power base is significantly more connection based than just raw power, as in his status allows him to make friends with powerful people.

The one part that irks me a bit is that Erick's success at magic overshadows his daughter's practical experience and min-max mindset. It's sorta explained in one chapter by "the mana loves Erick," but we're still waiting for a better answer to that. Besides, Erick is a terrible combatant, which I feel balances out his powerful magics.
