I'd give this a counter-recommendation. I read the first few chapters, and while the premise sounded interesting the story itself isn't great.

My biggest problem is the characters. They're just kinda bland, especially the dad. It feels like the author tried to make funny and eccentric but it falls flat and comes across as him not being aware that they're a step away from death.
