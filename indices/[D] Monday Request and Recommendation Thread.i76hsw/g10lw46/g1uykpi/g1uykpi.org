I've spent this past week binging a large portion of /A Rabbit among Wolves/' writer's (Coeur Al'Aran) works, and I have to say that a lot of them are good and even reasonably rational.

In particular, /Forged Destiny/ is the same type of rational-esque LitRPG as Delve, with a great premise and outstanding execution. It managed to run 1.1M words (being actually a complete series of 9 books) without running out of steam or becoming repetitive, staying gripping throughout. It's good enough and divorced enough from the RWBY setting to stand alone without any knowledge of the original show (which I myself haven't watched, but have picked up the general gist of from other RWBY fic).

Honorable mention is /Relic of the Future/, which is a Peggy Sue and therefore arguably rationalist by default by letting the protagonist preempt practically all idiot balls by foreknowledge, though it puts a twist on things by throwing Jaune so far back in time that the majority of the fic is pre-canon.

Lots of the others were also good, but not particularly rational. Many are guilty-pleasure types, self-indulgent, leaning heavily into tropes like the grimdark antihero/sympathetic villain (Null), angsty backstories (A Hunter or Something), identity porn (White Sheep, Forged Destiny), overpowered protagonists (/White Sheep/, /Null/, /Relic of the Future/, /Not this time, Fate/)... but always keeping it just grounded enough with reasonable stakes and challenges so as to not let it become actively cringey. The author is good at writing those viscerally satisfying moments---foreshadowed twists, important reveals, vicious beatdowns, things that /should/ feel like fanservice and powerwank but are well-written enough to /not/.

More importantly, it's all technically proficient with the exception of their earlier works, and even those improve quickly. (/Not this time, Fate/ starts with mediocre prose and an inability to properly punctuate dialogue, but ends its 600K-word run with basically novel-quality writing.) All in all, it was a pleasant way to spend a week's worth of commute, and /I'm not even done/, because holy shit, this person has been churning out fiction on a regular schedule since 2015 and they're /not stopping/.
