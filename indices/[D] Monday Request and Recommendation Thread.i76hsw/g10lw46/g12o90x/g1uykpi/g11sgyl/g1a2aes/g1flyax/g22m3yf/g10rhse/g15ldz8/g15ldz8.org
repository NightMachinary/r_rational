I just read it and it's okay but at best vaguely rational. The MC is portrayed as smart but the character motivations, behavior, the plot, and the world building aren't consistent or sensible a lot of the time.

Way too overly complicated, unrealistic and frankly stupid plots are common. The MC who is portrayed as very smart and safe and afraid of death takes unneeded big risks constantly. Characters that the author has decided are important luck out page after page despite being repeatedly set up for likely death. Level 50 is extremely high yet even at the highest levels you get 3 levels per feat/fight. It's fun but no, I would not say it is all that rational.
