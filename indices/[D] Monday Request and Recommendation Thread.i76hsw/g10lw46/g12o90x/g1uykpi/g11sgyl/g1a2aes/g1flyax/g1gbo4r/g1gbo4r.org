There's a couple reasons.

- One of the obvious ones is that Jaune is a blank slate for authors. His portrayal on the show is is very meh while at the same time his backstory is fairly interesting. It offers a fanfiction author a lot to play with.

- Another is that many, if not most RWBY fics, like most fanfiction in general, are shipping fics. They tend to focus on the relationships more than the plot, For whatever reason, Jaune fics might have ships, but they're usually not the focus.

- Another is because of just how big an influence the author Coeur Al'Aran has had on the fanfiction scene in general. His works are extremely popular and he tends to use Juane as his go to MC which has inspired many others to write fanfiction like him. Like for example, I only got into RWBY b/c of his fanfiction and I'm pretty sure this is the same situation for many people.

- My last point one is more speculation than anything, but imo I think [[/r/rational][r/rational]] tends to prefer stories written by male authors and male authors tend to write male MC's more often. I haven't checked, but from what I've seen, even the sotries with female MC's that get recommended on here are more often than not, written by male authors.
