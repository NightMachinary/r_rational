To a large extent, Ave Xie Rem Y is one of a kind. Very few xanxia stories are as well put together.

The best I can recommend that are similar in a broad strokes way are Paragon of Destruction (I recommend reading the first few chapters and then jumping directly to the end of arc 1. The quality is very mediocre in the first arc and picks up significantly at the start of the second. There's a summary chapter at the end of arc 1.)

My other recommendation would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]]. It's not the same genre, but has a similar, "feel," that I feel makes it a worth checking out.
