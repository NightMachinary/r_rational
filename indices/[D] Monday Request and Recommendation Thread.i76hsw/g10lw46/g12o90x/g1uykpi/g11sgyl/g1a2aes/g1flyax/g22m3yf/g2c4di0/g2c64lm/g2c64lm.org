Thanks man, will give both a try. Not xanxia exactly but a cultivation story still. I would recommend way of choice. The MC is a doctor and he's a precious pure soul. The world also have some cruel logic to it. A bit slow a the beginning and not much fighting goes on. It takes a while for the MC to start to cultivate then it's much faster from there. The side characters are fully fleshed and the world-building impressive.
