Perhaps someone who is up to date can comment, as I'm still only 30% through the story.

I haven't been turned off by the existential horror yet, but hey, maybe the Erogame just pre-emptively found just the right people in just the right situations such that it only had to nudge them and nothing has been rewritten and continuity has not been revised and [minor]the houses just happened to have been arranged for high heeled jumping before Cindy tried that run! The bushes too!

Otherwise I'll come back here and retroactively edit once I'm deeper into the fic.
