[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst][Ar'Kendrythist]] is a fantastic litrpg, with a social worker dad and his daughter getting isekai'd into a world with a system. Like Delve, it takes a deeper look at how a system would affect the world (logistics, warfare, politics, etc.). The system is very different from Delve though, it's more mystical and less "crunchy," but there is nonetheless a good exploration of how and why the system came to be. The worldbuilding and characters are really good. Highly recommend. Updates about 10k-15k words per week.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends][Infinite Realms: Monsters and Legends]] is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid. Like its name, the story happens on an infinite plane (think minecraft world), following two main characters and some side characters (and the occasional interlude). Very competently done. The characters are good and 3 dimensional, even the side characters. The power system is interesting, and the main characters are very interesting. At the start one of the characters is much more interesting than the other, but starting from volume 2 the other character is getting development. Updates 3 times a week with around 4k-5k word chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574944/1/Brockton-s-Celestial-Forge][Brockton's Celestial Forge]] is a worm tinker OC story with an SI being the passenger. The main point of view is the OC, who gets vague directions from his passenger which sometimes ends up screwing him over. The tinker power is basically Inspired Inventor lite, so it quickly gets very powerful (the consequences of which we're only starting to see). The characters are pretty well done and face actual consequences from their actions (even the protagonist). The tech jargon gets a bit much sometimes but the latest few chapters have been good. Updates once a week, ~10k words.
