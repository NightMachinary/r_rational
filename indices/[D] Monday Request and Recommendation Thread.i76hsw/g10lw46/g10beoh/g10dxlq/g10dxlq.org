Besides the fact that it's not set in a city but a magical school, I wouldn't call this urban fantasy, which is usually low fantasy, hidden magic practitioners, oblivious populations, and so on, like dresden files. This story is high fantasy in a modern setting, and all tech is made of and runs on magic.
