That's a shame, as much as his stories frustrated me, he's better than 90% of the writers making thousands on patreon with shitty generic litrpg knockoffs.

I think a big part of it is that he's terrible giving the reader payoff from his cool interpersonal and power conflicts, at giving an actual feeling of catharsis or following up on a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CrowningMomentOfAwesome/CrowningMomentOfAwesome][crowning moment of awesome]].

The Good Student is a perfect example, a story that started really strong with a great hook and a bunch of interpersonal relationships with deep wells to draw for conflict and resolution, like the MC's pining for an unattainable girl. But the reader is never given *any* satisfying, clear-ended emotional payoffs with their relationship. He makes a character unlikeable, but characters keep liking them? And their motivations don't change? It's maddening.
