I read it to about chapter 70ish, and the min-maxing daughter chapters are excellent but the father chapters I can hardly stand. I really don't the father's trait of immediately following the lead of any being of power who is half-way persuasive, regardless of their affiliation. He's a spineless wimp who justifies this with espoused pacifism, and at the same time he agonizes about not being a wimp but he caves anyway every damn time and I find that is not a fun read.
