I just finished reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth][Gideon the Ninth]] and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not rational but I'd compare it to the Dresden Files as being somewhat trashy fantasy fun.

The blurb on the cover describes the plot as "lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space" and honestly the only thing that description is missing is some truly atrocious puns along the way. It has a dark souls-esque aesthetic in which everything seems to be the decaying remains of a greater world. It also has some apotheotic themes which I suspect people in this community would enjoy.

My only complaint is that either the author or I am wildly incorrect in our understanding of how colons should be used.

The sequel came out just a few days ago and while I haven't yet read it, I am looking forward to picking it up.
