I never understood judging translations on a lower standard. Maybe it's because I'm German, but I grew up on translated books where the prose was no worse than German original books. If the Chinese to English market doesn't pay well enough to stand up to the level of quality where I am able to actually forget that it's a translation then I'd rather read something else.
