  It's just a character detail, which you would know if you had actually read anything instead of instantly dismissing it.

I thought that the whole "I'm going into the CIA, and that's that" business at the beginning of Chapter 1 was pretty good. It provided a plausible reason for a 22-year-old college graduate to be "bodyguard certified and boot camp trained" and to be familiar with a couple of languages. It also introduced her insecurities:

  She added, half whispered, “If they'll have me.”

(I am not qualified to judge whether this type of conversation between a new CIA intern and her father would have been considered a security breach in 2019. My guess is that it wouldn't have been a problem if she had been an analyst, but she apparently wanted to be a field agent, which is more problematic.)

Unfortunately, the rest of Chapter 1 -- the writing, the characters, the dialog -- didn't work for me, so I set it aside before the LitRPG part could really kick in. Perhaps I'll give it another try at a later point.
