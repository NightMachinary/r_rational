Ayy rwby fics are my jam. Here's a few more, although they probably don't reach the same quality as the previous ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13067349/1/An-Exercise-in-Stupidity][An Exercise in Stupidity]] is a Gamer SI fic, with the usual powerwank, but the protagonist is actually pretty fun to read. He goes full juggernaut, with high health and strength. His attitude is like that too, just butting head-on into danger and out of danger. His luck and intelligence stats are also 1, which should tell you a lot. He's not actually dumb, but let's just say he's a very impulsive guy. Pretty AU, but with some interesting developments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] is also by Coeur Al'aran. Probably my favorite work of his. It's pretty much original, with characters from rwby. Takes place in a gamelit world where people are born into classes, which are divided into castes. From the point of view of Jaune, who was born a Blacksmith, but one day found an item that changed his class appearance into Knight. Of course, he goes into Beacon, the academy for training Hero caste (combat classes mainly) people to do quests. It's pretty good, although I found the last part a bit slow and formulaic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12909945/1/Professor-Arc-Student-of-Vacuo][Professor Arc: Student of Vacuo]] is a fanfiction of a fanfiction. Takes the premise of Professor Arc, one of Coeur's works, and makes Jaune's backstory real. He actually becomes a student of Vacuo, and then becomes a legit professor in Beacon. I remember it being pretty enjoyable, at least more so than Professor Arc.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097232/1/Nevermore-Sweetling][Nevermore, Sweetling]] is a Lovecraft crossover, kinda. Follows Qrow Branwen, who takes care of cultists and dark rituals. I haven't read all of it, but it was pretty enjoyable. Funny too. Kinda like Dresden Files: RWBY edition.
