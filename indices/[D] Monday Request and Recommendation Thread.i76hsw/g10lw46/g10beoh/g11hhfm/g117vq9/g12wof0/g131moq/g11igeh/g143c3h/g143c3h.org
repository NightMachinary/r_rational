Any recommendations on Kafkaesque rational fiction? I'm really interested in reading a story where a rational main character has to come to terms with a completely irrational and surreal world (i.e. waking up as a bug in The Metamorphosis).

However, the premise certainly doesn't have to be about a MC transforming into something else---just something that explores similar themes of alienation and anxiety in a world that no longer makes sense.
