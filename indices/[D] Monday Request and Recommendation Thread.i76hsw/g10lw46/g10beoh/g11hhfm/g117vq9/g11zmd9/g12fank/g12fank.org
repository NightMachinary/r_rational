At the beginning, it was all Chinese novels, web or otherwise. I don't have much knowledge about the popularity of xianxia in China.

Translation of Chinese novels to English began with wuxia (cultivation+martial arts) but it was a niche community, much like how anime was niche. I only got into it when the community branched more into xianxia (seeking immortality) and xianhuan (cultivation+fantasy), and around then it got a lot more popular. I was introduced with Coiling Dragon on [[https://wuxiaworld.com][wuxiaworld.com]] around 2015, and from what I've heard a lot of others were the same.

I agree with [[/u/CreationBlues][u/CreationBlues]] that English-written xianxia has since melded with Gamelit to an extent. I disagree that Savage divinity is that popular - check out [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series-ranking/?rank=sixmonths][novelupdates]] for a better reflection of what is popular.
