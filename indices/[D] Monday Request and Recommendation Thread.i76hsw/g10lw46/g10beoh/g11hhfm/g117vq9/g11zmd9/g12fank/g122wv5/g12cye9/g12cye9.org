Same for me TDG on mangalife, many years ago. Got impatient, went to the novel. Caught up with the novel, the author went on a hiatus. Started reading other things on the genre. Most of it bad until eventually found good works.

TDG has interesting combat and would be really good if the author hadn't gone into the go to the next dimension where people are stronger trope. If he just had slowed the pacing and made the MCs story be about saving his country and repopulating the world it'd have been one of the best cultivation stories out there.
