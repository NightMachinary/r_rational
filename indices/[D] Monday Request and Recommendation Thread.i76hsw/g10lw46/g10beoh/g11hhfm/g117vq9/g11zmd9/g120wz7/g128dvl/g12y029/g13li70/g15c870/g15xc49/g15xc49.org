Just to point it out, 'mana' has a really complicated meaning that is quite significantly different to the fantasy usage, at least in modern Maori usage. [[https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/3424]] If I heard someone in New Zealand use the word 'mana,' I would expect them to be using it in the sense of a leader's charisma/ respect/ authority.
