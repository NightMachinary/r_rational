What works are you folks following every update? Here's a list of ones that are active and I automatically click read when a new chapter is out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13420487/1/A-Rabbit-among-Wolves][A Rabbit among Wolves]] is a RWBY fanfiction that asks the question what would happen if Juane Arc became the head of the White Fang instead of attending Beacon. It's a popcorn fic that offers some solid laughs.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][Street Cultivator's Book 3 is being posted on Royal Road]]. Sarah Lin puts out two chapters of this urban cultivation novel weekly. It's a fantastic story of cultivation that avoids the standard cliche's that often come with cultivation based stories. Books 1 and 2 are available on Kindle Unlimited.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard][Confessions of a Magpie Wizard]] is a decent fantasy story of a demon who infiltrates a human academy and learns empathy. Pretty fun read.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice][Never Die Twice]] is a fantastic story about a necromancer who's goal is to kill death and give everyone the ability to live forever. His goals might be admirable, but his methods are fairly evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362076/1/Less-Than-Zero][Less Than Zero]] is a DC fanfiction where the author has inserted an OC character. The story follows Null as he discovers his powers and tries to use them to move on up from poverty. He tries to figure out where his ethics lie and works with villains and heroes alike. One of my favorite stories out there.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] is the story of a man named Carl and his ex girlfriend's cat as they fight their way through a murderous dungeon that exists as a form of entertainment for the rest of the galaxy.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside][Castle Kingside]] started off as the story of a surgeon in a fantasy world, but now it's transformed into one of the best uplift fictions there is.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/paragon-of-destruction_12311119706248305][Paragon of Destruction]] is easily one the best cultivation novels out there. The story really starts getting good after the first arc ends (I got frustrated around chapter 30 and jumped to like 68?) and I haven't been able to put it down since. It follows a very standard shonen wish fulfillment power fantasy, but it does it well. The story has a cool magic/cultivation system, well put together world building and is quite well written.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur the Dragon]] is hilarious story of a thief helping a dragon navigate a world with litrpg mechanics in a goal to make the most gold possible. Fun in small bit sized bits. Can get repetitive if you binge through it in one sitting.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/#post-41524293][Ave Xie Rem Y]] is a fantastic story that follows a boy who wants to be a doctor in a world of cultivation. The standard xanxia tropes exist, but they're shown in contrast to the mc who's a breath of fresh air in this genre.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.10534/][Going Native]] is a DBZ/DC fanfiction where the mc is a reincarnated individual born as the younger brother of Vegeta. They're drafted into the Saiyan army and commit atrocities in Frieza's name. It's an interesting story that does a good job of melding DBZ and DC. It's gotten a bit boring as of now and I'm mostly waiting to see how the story will look once the mc goes to earth.
