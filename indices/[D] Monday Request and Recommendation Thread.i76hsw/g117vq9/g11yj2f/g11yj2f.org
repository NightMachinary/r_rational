I'm not sure. I think it's kinda a slow boil thing. Basically, xianxia starts as shitty translated webnovels, which started a while ago. They're aggressively bad, so they don't get a lot of mainstream interest. However, the ideas influence people, and more and more works are translated at (minorly) better english. Gamelit starts breeding with xianxia, which are written just as bad as the translation novels are but from actual english writers. Keep in mind, the entire time most works aren't disappearing, if they're good they stick around and people keep reading them.

Savage Divinity might be the first popular xianxia webnovel? It's written competently enough, and it has clear influence on it's system from xianxia. Asian aesthetic, tiers of practitioners, single unifying energy currency, body reinforcement, meditation, spirit weapons, etc. etc. etc. It's a lot lower power than traditional xianxia, but it's basically the same stories and systems.
