Seems like kind of an interesting premise for a setting. If actually achieving enlightenment causes you to fuck off to a spiritual plane, you'd expect all the people left on the material plane to be selfish unenlightened assholes. Helps to explain the sheer level of selfishness and nihilism in some of these stories.
