Everything I've seen on the internet about the etymology of 'mana' in the fantasy context suggests it comes from the word of Polynesian origin whose meaning seems roughly the same as the common modern usage ('supernatural power that permeates everything'). Dunno where [[/u/GlueBoy]] got the connection to Biblical 'manna' (which is more of a nectar/ambrosia thing anyway).
