I mean...individual mind control upon touching that's broken by hitting your head kinda isn't that good for an Infinity Stone.

Compared to the Power Stone being capable of roasting a world or the Aether being able to take out the universe...

Even compared to mind control like say...Hive's they don't look that impressive, in terms of robustness.

The Infinity Stones are supposed to be the next-level thing, as they're set up. And the Mind Stone seems like it was the weakest, in how it was harnessed at least.
