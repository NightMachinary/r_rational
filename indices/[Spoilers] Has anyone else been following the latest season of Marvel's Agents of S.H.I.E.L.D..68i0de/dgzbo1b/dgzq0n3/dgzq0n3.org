What about the infinity Stone's mind control wasn't as effective? Loki's staff gave the wielder complete control over people without reducing any of their abilities, and they were only freed when they hit their head after being punched by an Avenger or Scarlet Witch counteracted it with her own telepathic powers. It seems like the Stones are just as powerful as the stuff SHIELD deals with, they just don't have any special abilities to protect themselves.
