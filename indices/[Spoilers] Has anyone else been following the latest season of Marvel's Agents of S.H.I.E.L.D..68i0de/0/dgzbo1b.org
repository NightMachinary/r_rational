I'm watching it too. The Darkhold is surely a means of enhancing intelligence and definitely seems to be kinda-sorta sentient or aware.

It struck me a while ago just how absurdly powerful it has to be, based on how they can scan the brains of someone within minutes and send them out. No one comments on it but it really is ludicrous. It's a shame that they're likely going to find some way to wipe out most or all of Radcliffe's work since it breaks the status quo so much; with the Darkhold he essentially achieved all he set out to do, he was just dumb about AIDA.

  Daisy and Simmons weren't able to get their "true selves" to come out because they weren't just brainwashed; they'd developed into different people due to different memories and influences

AoS in general seems to be very bad about following the "fighting the mind control from the inside" trope, which I kinda like. Brainwashing or control really seems to stick. See the Hive arc, which provided a brutal example trying to appeal to that going wrong. Once you change someone's history or their brain chemistry they change, and it's hard to get them back.

Which makes it odd that the main ways of mind control in the movie universe, despite being based on the canonically most powerful things like Infinity Stones...suck.
