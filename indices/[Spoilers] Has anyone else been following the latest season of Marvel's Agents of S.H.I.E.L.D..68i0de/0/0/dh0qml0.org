The characters themselves can be infuriatingly irrational, though. The scene where Fitzsimmons walks under the LMD detector and it goes off, prompting the two to argue over who's the robot, lost all of its intended emotional impact for me because I couldn't get over the fact that the two supposedly brilliant scientists supposedly couldn't think of something as simple as /walking back through the detector one at a time/.
