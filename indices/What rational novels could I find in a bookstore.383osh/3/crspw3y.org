/The Steerswoman's Road/ is pretty good. The target demographic is probably young adults (sort of like Jumper, maybe a little more adult-friendly), although the 2nd/3rd book in the series, /The Lost Steersman/, "has people who like good hard-SF adventures" as the target demographic.

Terry Pratchett (most relevant to your interests might be Moist von Lipwig's books, starting with /Going Postal/, which can indeed be read without prior exposure to Discworld).

Have you read Iain Banks' /The Algebraist/ yet? You should! Though it does get a bit long in places, so if you haven't read any Iain Banks, you should start with the very tightly-paced /Player of Games/ or /Look to Windward/.
