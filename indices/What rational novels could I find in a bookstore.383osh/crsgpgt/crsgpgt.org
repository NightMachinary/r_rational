Most things by Charles Stross - in particular, I recommend Glasshouse. It's in the same universe as Accelerando, but personally I found it much easier to read (it has a much more conventional narrative structure, a less confusing cast of characters, etc.). Despite being an off-shoot of sorts, it's very self-contained and still makes perfect sense without reading Accelerando, though obviously the context will bring something to the table.
