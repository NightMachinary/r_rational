Some ideas are:

[[http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720][Ted Chiang's Short Stories]]

The [[http://www.amazon.com/Jumper-Steven-Gould-ebook/dp/B003Y5HCXG/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433192941&sr=1-3&keywords=jumper+series][Jumper Series]] for a good treatment of teleportation.

[[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003K15EKM/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=CEAXUAH4BUHV&coliid=IF945GHFXN2P8][Blindsight]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/076532802X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=CEAXUAH4BUHV&coliid=I23BYBUF8SBA29][Echopraxia]] by Peter Watts, although Blindsight is [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][free]] as a pdf on his website.

[[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EMXBDMA/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=CEAXUAH4BUHV&coliid=I2ZSRRMKIOZZK3][The Martian]] for how to survive on Mars.

Finally, there's the first 17 chapters of HPMOR provided as a [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mM-jgiy9teaINEED0WvXCCEZD12FP1m7Qn6vnYLZ4kM/viewform][free physical book]]. But they prefer that you order multiple copies to spread knowledge about HPMOR rather than just one for yourself. So ordering a bunch to give to your reading group is perfect.
