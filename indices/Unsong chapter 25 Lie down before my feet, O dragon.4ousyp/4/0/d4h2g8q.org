If they are, we can predict when it will end.

EDIT: If we just go linear, the series should end after about 84 or 85 chapters, not including interludes. Taking a look at the [[http://i.imgur.com/Q7lQy0q.png][moving average]] is really interesting to me, though. Basically you see two humps. Note that Book I ends after the sixteenth chapter.

In this story, we are all of us on whale watch. Alexander is in California, famous for its whales, and the Monterey Bay Whale Watch is located at, you guessed it, */84/* Fishermans Wharf. Monterey is named for Saint Louis IX of France, whose tomb the sage Jules Verne wrote of in his commentary, /To the Sun/Off on a Comet!/, in which a comet grazes the earth and carries away said tomb with it, along with a few individuals. Clearly, the Comet King is Saint Louis, who shall return---as comets do---to carry his chosen to heaven---Shamayim---Shamuyim.

HOWEVER, the kabbalistic significance of a length of 85 should not be understated. It is the length in feet of the whale which sunk the /Essex/, a source of inspiration for /Moby Dick/.

None of this is a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.
