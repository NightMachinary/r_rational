It's not a sci-fi novel without some inexplicable BDSM.

Edit: I think narration is seriously harming the "rational-ness" of the story here. Our hero's decision to take the bottle has only thinnest justification separating it from an idiot ball, which is supposed to be the worst sort of trope. I know wisdom is his lowest stat, but this is really, really pushing it.
