I think this is the first time we've seen her fully embrace her title as Duchess of Moonless Nights. Previously she has just been using standard winter powers of ice and cold, but she now seems to be controlling her Domain in the same way as an aspect.

(I'm capitalising Domain because I assume it works similarly to an Aspect or Name. But iirc we haven't had much information about what it means in practice. Seems she has been pretty reluctant to delve deeper into it.)
