Well, if Black dies and gets resurrected as an undead zombie he would be the Ur example of a Death Knight, freeing up the Name of Black Knight for Hakram.

Remember Black knows the likely outcome for him and his prized student assaulting the fortress of the Enemy.

True enough, Ubua claims she caught Black and Squire must race to save him. She comes in at the last second to see Diabolist killing her mentor before her eyes. A heated battle ensues which ends with Squire being defeated and near death. In her last throes she gains a bullshit power up and defeats the sinister Diabolist. As she kneels over the soon to be corpse of her mentor, words of gratitude/encouragement is spoken before Black dies, finishing the student surpassing mentor theme.

Cat screams at the heavens, saying she won't accept that and promptly uses her power to bring him back to life. Because fuck the narrative that's why.

Black is probably counting on this. Because I simply cannot see how Ubua could outsmart and overpower the Black Knight to capture him. Killing him is one thing but subduing him? Priors for that are too low. He definitely planned to get captured. Or Ubua killed him, but the story wouldn't allow for Black to just get killed off screen. There's just not enough dramatic effect.
