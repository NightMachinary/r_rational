I think you've got it backwards. The levelling up trope was always based on fantasy tropes. Think Rand from Wheel of Time, Kaladin from Stormlight Archive, etc. As you journey and adventure, you train, you quest, you learn techniques, you unlock inner reserves, etc. Fantasy RPGs codified that, but it's a trope as old as storytelling.
