Pretty high, I'd say. I'm betting on Cat's first Aspect after transitioning into Black Queen to be Command, that can be used similar to Rule (though I don't think we know what Rule does, outside of Malicia being able to use it to Speak silently), but also what she does with Winter Zombies. That, or she gets Rule and keeps her mantle as Duchess.

As for Robber, I hope he doesn't get a Name. It feels like it'd detract from the character, though I can't quite articulate why.
