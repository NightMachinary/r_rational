  As for Robber, I hope he doesn't get a Name. It feels like it'd detract from the character, though I can't quite articulate why.

Because names have significant narrative weight, and as Cat said to be named is to want the world to be a certain way. That doesn't really apply to Robber as he's just there to have a blast.
