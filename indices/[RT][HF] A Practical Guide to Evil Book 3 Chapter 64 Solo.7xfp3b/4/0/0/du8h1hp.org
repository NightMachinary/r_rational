We've seen the Dead King do something very similar with his undead named in the Ranger interlude. Yes, it's OP, but not world breaking. Though the casualness with which she does it may be something.

I agree with [[/u/haiku_fornification]] the stage is set for Black to be resurrected as a Winter Zombie. We know Named Undead can exist, We know Cat has Undead powers that bring back the dead with personalities and knowledge. Liesse is the place where the first "resurrection" story happened.

It fulfills the story of Cat killing her master, allowing her to transition, presumably to Black Queen, by taking ownership of Black. It also set her in direct conflict with Malicia, suddenly owning her Black Knight and a good chunk of the remaining Legions. It also sets her in direct conflict with the rest of the Calamities for having power over Black.

There are three important cards left to be played that I think are relevant here, though maybe not all in this conflict.

1.) Adjutant's transition, I thought it would be to Black Knight, but if Black is sticking around, probably not.\\
2.) Ubua's got to have an inkling of SOME of this, and still has yet to use Cat's Fae nature against her for a real attack, especially since Daddy Dearest is waiting in the wings.\\
3.) Malicia's attempt to take control of the Greater Breach Array, (Maybe Cat can *Take* this, or Winter Zombie Ubua, although the latter strikes me as extremely dangerous, even more than *Take* which would likely backfire immediately.)

Edit: I wonder if Ubua's captured Fae will make an appearance here. This is based on the speculation that there must be a Summer counterpart to Cat's Duchess, and that this particular Summer Fae was outside of Creation and Arcadia at the time the Queen and the rest of the Fae transitioned. It would also be thematically fitting for Ubua to have a Fae, being the representative of the Old Guard as she is.
