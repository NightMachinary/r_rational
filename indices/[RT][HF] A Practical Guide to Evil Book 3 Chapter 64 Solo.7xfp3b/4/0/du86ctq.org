At the rick of borrowing too much gaming lingo her new ice zombies seem ridiculously OP. Being able to kill someone and resurrect them with all their knowledge intact and accessible breaks basically any conspiracy or attempt at secrecy. Imagine how useful it would be to capture an enemy scout and get all their knowledge about the army instantly.

I wasn't very clear from how it was phrased whether her zombies did magic to set eachother on fire or what. But if so then seriously broken pz nerf. Imagine her doing that on a battlefield slaughtering a whole mage line then having it turn against their own side :O

Based on how this story normally goes and the general rules of the world there is probably going to be some sort of cost or limitations to it though. Possibly using it forces her more and more into Fae mode. Or she can only raise the zombies in that manner because the pocket dimension links to her Domain of starless night, and she wouldn't be able to do it in normal circumstances.
