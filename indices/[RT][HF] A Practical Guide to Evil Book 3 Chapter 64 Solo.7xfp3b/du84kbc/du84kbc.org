In this chapter, Catherine Foundling casually and effortlessly:

- destroys an army by looking at it funny

- makes sentient and intelligent undead that can use magic

- walks through a fortified castle, litterally at some point

- tanks a couple blows from magical lasers that can blow up stone

- does so while having a weak transitional Name

- notices nothing unusual with any of the above

No wonder people find her absolutely terrifying. She rants about her past but she's come a long way from the girl that slept hungry because bread got too pricy.
