Sounds like more than a two year effort and a lot for 10,000 people, but it's definitely a step, in terms of problem solving. The real problem with this is that you're dealing with a competent AI at the other end of the game - you're dealing with the encryption of a potential superintellignece, which is bound to be harder than normal encryption.

The AI in SAO are implied to be the first, and if the newest arc in the light novels is to be believed, the government hasn't reached the same amount of progress even two years after the start of SAO.
