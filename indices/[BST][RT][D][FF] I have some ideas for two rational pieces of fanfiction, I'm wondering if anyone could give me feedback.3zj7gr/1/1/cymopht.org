Oh, and I just remembered. The whole "anyone can communicate with the outside world" thing seems like a system that's too exploitable, or at least, it seems like it's too easy to do somehow, even if it won't change the situation. The way I see it, there shouldn't be any reason the SAO simulation looks outwardly different from sleep. IIRC it completely cuts off voluntary motor function. And how are they going to get a subject in an MRI scanner without the NerveGear going /Scanners/ on them? (thanks for the image, SAO abridged)

Either way, it's not really that important. I really only wanted him to exit the simulation at some point because it sets up for some poignant moments with his family and friend that wouldn't otherwise exist. Basically, I just wanted for the angst. It doesn't seem to consistent with the environment, but I can conceive a dynamic where it does not influence the potential of the conflict.
