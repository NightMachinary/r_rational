The point is that the Keima is creeped out by it as well - I'm not too sure if you're familiar with the show, but the premise is that the main character is almost repulsed by the idea of romance with real people. He is forced, under penalty of death, to try and win their hearts, and the character development is him realising that he is a) not as emotionless as he thought and b) that what he's doing might be pretty wrong.

I think it exists more as a thought experiment than wish-fulfilment.
