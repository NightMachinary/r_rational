First, /thanks/ for responding. This is the exact kind of thing I was talking about.

#+begin_example
  Also, remember Eliezer's first rule of fanfiction. You can't just make things easier for Kirito. How will you make it harder?
#+end_example

I know, the sequence on rational fiction was one of the first things I read. the problem is, there wasn't really a plot in Sword Art Online to begin with. It's vague about what exactly Kayaba accomplishes by going through the motions of Sword Art Online, but the series wants you to see him as a sympathetic villain for some reason.

To answer: I'm not exactly trying to make it easier, I'm trying to give him a /reason/ to have ridiculously good information on completing the game aside from "he was in the (even more selective beta test". Kazuto goes to school - /Japanese/ school. It's hard to see how a fifteen year old boy could become one of a thousand to enter the select beta test.

  Artificial intelligence will be a problem. The AI present in the original is enough for a post-scarcity society, and that's without self-improvement.
#+end_example

I think I want to end game to be somewhere along the lines of: Kayaba is trying to set the first genuinely friendly AGI free into the world. It explains the whole "seed" thing in the original novels behind just being a cool video game engine.

As someone interested in the gaming industry, I can immediately see the draw of an AGI for a video game administrator. Developers generally strive for three things in a game: balance, progression, and agency. They combine to create a feeling of productivity (even if that productivity doesn't actually exist). I imagine that an artificial intelligence that prioritizes these things would be at least interesting.

(I know things like balance, progression and agency are /vast/ terms that fail to really specify anything. I've read enough of Yudkowsky's essays to know that even if I do somehow manage to get an AI that optimizes around these terms it would be vastly different from anything I would want to see in society. But the funny thing is, when I try to predict what something would do under these conditions, the whole "trapping players in a virtual reality" thing becomes self consistent.)

Keep in mind, the Extra Credits series on youtube is excellent to see more about how video games are designed to be good, and talks a lot about other things you would assume something like the CARDINAL AI would be equipped with. Skinner box techniques among them.

  I think your going to have to add Dark Arts to that list.
#+end_example

Even when I knew how people in this community named things, I was still amused and surprised by the notion of legitimate philosophy classified as "Dark Arts". That being said, Keima's form of manipulation is less "taking over the world" kind of manipulation and more "taking advantage of lovesick teenage girls" manipulation. I'm sure this all falls under the greater category, but generally there are some differences. (although, I am not sure, and I'm certainly intrigued enough to read the essays in school when I have the time)

It's about time for me to set off on my journey to the building-of-compulsory-education, which means I'm going to be unavailable until robotics class when I have access to a computer. Nonetheless, I'll try to reply to whatever else you might ask. This more of a brainstorming/trying to foolproof my ideas kind of thing, which I find hard to do alone.
