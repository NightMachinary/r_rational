I feel like I'm less critiquing your ideas and more adding my own, but here's my response.

#+begin_quote
  The World God Only Knows

  Themes:

  Instrumental Rationality, Entropy, the logic of Emotion, Utility, Ethics,
#+end_quote

Based on that synopsis, I think your going to have to add [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Dark_arts][Dark Arts]] to that list. If your character knows how to manipulate people's emotions, and it's a rationalist fic, that means the reader has to learn how to manipulate people's emotions.

#+begin_quote
  Sword Art Online

  Themes:

  Epistemic rationality, Artificial Intelligence, Social and group dynamics, Utility, Risk-versus-reward
#+end_quote

Artificial intelligence will be a problem. The AI present in the original is enough for a post-scarcity society, and that's without self-improvement.

It might be good to add something about [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_utility_function_is_not_up_for_grabs][the utility function is not up for grabs]]. Explore Kayaba's way of looking at things to show why he thinks Sword Art Online is a world worth dying for, and yet how utterly horrifying it is to someone else.

  I think the fanfiction hook should be that he alone has the ability to log out and communicate with the outside world
#+end_quote

But anyone can communicate with the outside world. They just need to have someone wake them up at the appropriate times to send messages. And the outside world could respond by drugging them to fall asleep. It's not much, but I feel like they should have done it.

Also, remember Eliezer's first rule of fanfiction. You can't just make things easier for Kirito. How will you make it harder?
