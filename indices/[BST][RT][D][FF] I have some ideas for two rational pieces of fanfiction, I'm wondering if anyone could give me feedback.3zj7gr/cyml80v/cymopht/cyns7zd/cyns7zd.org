Don't use an MRI or other external scanner. It's redundant. The Nervegear is already of sufficient resolution.

What you could have happen instead is the government, realizing the problem, applies its considerable computational resources to crack the session keys of the connection used by deceased users. Cracking the keys of living users would be a waste of resources, because with Perfect Forward Secrecy they would only be able to read the past, not the present. So they passively snoop all the traffic of all the Nervegears they can, and try to crack the encryption on the users who die, and offer that user's exploits to the family as a sort of "here's photos of your kid/sibling/parent kicking ass" memorium. And from the dead users, they identify some flaws in the game's servers' RNGs, and get better at breaking the keys, so now they can semi-regularly get into living player data, and that's how they single across the beta testers and the guy running the game and his notes, and that's how they start passing messages to users through glitched item names in the player inventory. You have 999 DROP THIS ITEM IF YOU CAN READ THIS.
