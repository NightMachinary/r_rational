You don't need an MRI. You can do it with an EEG, which is noninvasive. Although I suppose the NerveGear would probably mess with that. The NerveGear isn't supposed to mess with /involuntary/ motor functions like heart rate, is it? I'd expect the brain to use more energy while you're awake, which would lead to some clear differences.

You could also do things using hormones in the brain that Kayaba wouldn't be able to mess with without ruining SAO.
