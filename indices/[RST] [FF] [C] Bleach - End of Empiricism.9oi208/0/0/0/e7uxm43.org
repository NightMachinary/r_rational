Aizen is a perfect example of what happens when you let yourself get away a bit too much with handing down powers to your characters... though by the end of the Soul Society arc, I think he was still salvageable. My way of writing a 'rational' Aizen that's dangerous but realistically defeatable would have been:

- not actually very strong physically, though skilled in kidou
- his Kyouka Suigetsu only projects illusions that /he/ pictures in his own mind, therefore can not show anything that he does not know, and require an effort of concentration that's greater when the illusion is more complex. This also puts a limit on how many people he can deceive at the same time
- never achieved bankai, as suggested by Urahara in this story.

Within these boundaries, Aizen could be an interesting 'trickster' villain, and Urahara his natural foil. Rational!Bleach would end up looking like a battle of two masterminds in which everyone else is mostly a pawn.

Another option would be for Ichigo to learn to fight him with his eyes closed. He never saw Kyouka Suigetsu and could keep that up, which would remove Aizen's main advantage over everyone else. In fact I always assumed while reading Bleach that /that/ would be the reason why the Gotei 13 would ask Ichigo's help in fighting him. Turns out Kubo didn't think that far at all.
