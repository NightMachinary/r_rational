  A demon like Descartes imagines could be intelligent enough to do that, but Aizen is still only human.

The question is, what really /creates/ the illusion? Aizen, Kyouka Suigetsu itself (following more or less liberally its owner's instructions, like some sort of super artificial intelligence), or the victim? As I said above, if I wanted to write a /balanced/ Bleach, I would make it Aizen, and then all the vulnerabilities you bring up and more would indeed exist. However Kyouka Suigetsu /could/ be able to work out all the details, which would make this much harder. In canon, no such vulnerabilities are suggested, so I'm more inclined to go the "it's just magic, it always works" road (which is what I went with in this story).

  Which is why you have to apply statistics rather than just compare the difference. Sure among 7 billion humans there are going to be lucky ones, and then among those lucky ones there's going to be even luckier ones, and so on, but that hits a limit pretty quickly. If the difference in the two rates is small and your sample size is small, then sure, you could be just lucky. But if it is huge or stays statistically significant no matter how many samples you gather, that's a pretty big clue that either you're the most lucky person out of all 7 billion people on earth (which is incredibly unlikely), or you are in an illusion.

But it comes at no expense for the system to just raise the general rate of luck. If you're not supposed to die of cancer, the illusion could just say "invented cure for cancer!". Boom, no cancer for anyone any more. Now the thing is, of course, a /pool/ of people with reliable information and no bias on average could still find a crack in this facade. But a /single/ person, with limited knowledge, specific biases, some of which they'll be unaware of, and no reliable pre-illusion knowledge (it's all just in their memory), /plus/ no certain knowledge of when the illusion even began? There's far too much uncertainty to draw any conclusions. I could easily rationalise the idea that /my/ world right now is an illusion, but most likely that would just me being psychotic.

  So the longer you never notice anything off (other than the fact that you still haven't noticed anything off), the more likely it is that you are in an illusion created by your expectations.
#+end_quote

What if your expectations include sometimes noticing weird shit? I think you can go more and more meta in this reasoning and never reach the bottom.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not saying that. This is just a tool for figuring out whether you are in an illusion. Whether you should detach yourself from an illusory world is your own choice.
#+end_quote

Well, in Ichigo's case, he'd get paranoid about having been trapped and defeated by a dangerous enemy. So that would inevitably translate into basically sapping the joy out of the rest of his life. It's hard to detach the two things. If you worry about being in an illusion, it means you consider reality intrinsically superior (like Gin does). If you don't, you may be actually willing to step into one by yourself (like Tousen) and then wouldn't worry about it as long as you're satisfied.

  like creating countless cameras, placing them everywhere, and having them all feed visual data to you all the time, forcing the illusion to constantly compute the data of every location you are filming. That way, if the illusion is being maintained by either you or the illusioner, it could break down from the fact that neither of you humans is capable of computing that much data at once. It's not guaranteed to work, but it's a start.

I think the weak point in that is that ultimately all comes down to a bottleneck: you. Suppose I studied particle physics and sat down at the LHC, reading its outputs. The LHC produces several TB of data per second, much of which is automatically pruned out by algorithms, the rest is copied and stored in multiple servers. Now, when a scientist looks at this data, they /still/ can only take in as much as their senses can work with. So no illusion would need to /actually/ process all the quantum weirdness stuff and then produce TB of data and then refine that into the plots that he looks at on screen. It would just need to produce the plots. And by definition, those plots would fit the knowledge of the subject, so they would be good enough to fool them.

Sure, you could photograph or save them, and then go study nuclear physics /better/, and see if they still match your expectations. But you'd be looking at illusions, again. Why should the copies stay the same? And in this scenario, Infinite Mirror can even manipulate your memory. So your own memory of them would be unreliable. Any attempts to uncover the illusion will only lead to further, subtler manipulations.
