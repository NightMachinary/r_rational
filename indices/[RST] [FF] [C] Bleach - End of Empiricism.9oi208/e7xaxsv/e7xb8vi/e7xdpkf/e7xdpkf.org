  A more sadistic enemy could give them worse ones on purpose

That would also result in a statistically significant difference, letting you know that the world is an illusion catered to (hurting) you.

  others could simply try to go for realism
#+end_quote

The problem then is: how? People are inherently terrible at being realistic. We consistently expect things of the world that end up being absurdly optimistic compared to reality, even when we're trying to be realistic. A demon like Descartes imagines could be intelligent enough to do that, but Aizen is still only human.

#+begin_quote
  So you still have a layer of uncertainty - maybe you're just a lucky person?
#+end_quote

Which is why you have to apply statistics rather than just compare the difference. Sure among 7 billion humans there are going to be lucky ones, and then among those lucky ones there's going to be even luckier ones, and so on, but that hits a limit pretty quickly. If the difference in the two rates is small and your sample size is small, then sure, you could be just lucky. But if it is huge or stays statistically significant no matter how many samples you gather, that's a pretty big clue that either you're the most lucky person out of all 7 billion people on earth (which is incredibly unlikely), or you are in an illusion.

  Second, what if the world is simply produced by /their own/ expectations, and thus mirrors exactly their expectation of unfairness too? I think that makes more sense in this model because it lightens Aizen's otherwise rather excessive load by having everyone imagine their own world. But in that model, /by definition/, you can't ever notice anything off - because if you think it would be off, it won't happen in the first place.
#+end_quote

That would be even easier to determine is an illusion. After all, like you said: by definition, you can't ever notice anything off. In reality, people rarely notice things are off, but it /does/ happen from time to time. So the longer you never notice anything off (other than the fact that you still haven't noticed anything off), the more likely it is that you are in an illusion created by your expectations.

#+begin_quote
  And on a human level, you're basically saying that you should prompt yourself to automatically detach yourself from the world if it's making you happy. People do that plenty IRL ("I don't deserve this", "it's too good for me", etc.), and usually it's not healthy.
#+end_quote

I'm not saying that. This is just a tool for figuring out whether you are in an illusion. Whether you should detach yourself from an illusory world is your own choice. Personally, I don't see the point in detaching since you are still stuck in the illusion anyway. A better method would be trying things to overload the illusion: like creating countless cameras, placing them everywhere, and having them all feed visual data to you all the time, forcing the illusion to constantly compute the data of every location you are filming. That way, if the illusion is being maintained by either you or the illusioner, it could break down from the fact that neither of you humans is capable of computing that much data at once. It's not guaranteed to work, but it's a start.

After that you could try even more desperate things like launching some of those cameras off into space to force the illusion to have to compute a larger fraction of the universe, or abusing special relativity by accelerating yourself to near light speeds, and so slow down your own time such that 1 second to you is X years for the rest of the world: X years that have to be computed by your illusion in the 1 second you experience.
