  As for why I personally don't bother to find out whether reality is an illusion: it's because I don't have courage. I don't think it is impossible for me to find out whether I live in an illusion. Nor is it impossible to break out. The problem is what comes after:

I think my viewpoint comes across pretty clearly from the story, in the sense that with regards to the more abstract concept of "am I in an illusion?" - as in, is there an objective reality, am I a Boltzmann brain, etc. - all of those paths simply lead to fruitless and unfalsifiable conclusions that don't enhance my condition by one iota. If I had significant reason to believe I may have been put under an extremely accurate but imperfect illusion I could consider trying to find out / break out of it, if I have reason to believe it is worth it (since as you point out, anyone who put me into it would surely be vastly more powerful and knowledgeable than me, and has done so either for good but unfathomable reasons or out of hostility, and in either case breaking out isn't necessarily that great of an idea). But as it is, it's just one insignificant possibility among far more pressing and likely concerns, so to pursue it wouldn't be different from a weird form of religious belief, something I'm not keen on.

Of course Ichigo has a bit more to go on there - Aizen had the ability and the motive - but he's still speculating when imagining Kyouka Suigetsu's bankai. When you consider what he /knows/, he can be sure he's not the victim of an illusion: he didn't see Kyouka's shikai, ever. Even if Aizen did have a bankai, there's no guarantee it'd be a more powerful version of the same ability. Not all bankai are. Soi Fon's shikai is a stealthy two-hit kill stinging weapon - and her bankai is a /motherfucking bazooka/. So he has some more reason than me to suspect that possibility, but no real way to check his own reasoning and confirm it's grounded in reality and not sheer paranoia without going to frankly unreasonable extents.

Then again, the follow up of this story might as well be a paranoid Ichigo that lives in constant fear of Aizen watching him while everyone around him considers him crazy.
