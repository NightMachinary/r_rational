Fair enough. I did enjoy the story, it just annoys me when people give up on finding the truth because they think it is impossible to determine. Even if Kyouka Suigetsu is truly omnipotent, there is no way for Ichigo to know that, so it is too hasty to give up.

As for why I personally don't bother to find out whether reality is an illusion: it's because I don't have courage. I don't think it is impossible for me to find out whether I live in an illusion. Nor is it impossible to break out. The problem is what comes after:

Considering my personality, I wouldn't have voluntarily placed myself under an illusion that wipes out all my memories of my pre-illusion self, so if reality is an illusion, then I have clearly been placed under it against my will by someone who doesn't particularly care about my wishes. So if I somehow break the illusion, I would still face the problem of having to defeat whoever placed me under the illusion, whether that's Aizen or a horde of machines guarding the matrix.

But seeing as my pre-illusion self's memories are gone, I don't remember anything about how I was defeated the first time and so cannot improve my chances of victory, whereas the illusioners probably remember that and have probably monopolized any resources I might have had. I don't even know if the laws of physics in actual reality are the same as in the illusionary reality I'm under, and so cannot make any plans whatsoever. It wouldn't be absolutely impossible to win, but the illusioners would have an obscenely massive advantage over me in any fight. And this time, they may not be so lenient as to place me in "reality". They could be angered by the mess I caused from breaking the illusion, and decide to put me under some illusionary hell instead, which is absolutely terrifying.

Ichigo may have the courage to fight Aizen again, but I do not.
