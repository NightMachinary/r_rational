I see a few problems with that. First, they don't know that for sure - Aizen states he's willing to give them "better" worlds but that's far from obvious. A more sadistic enemy could give them worse ones on purpose; others could simply try to go for realism. So you still have a layer of uncertainty - maybe you're just a lucky person? They surely do exist, not everyone happens to have a perfectly average amount of positive and negative outcomes. And on a human level, you're basically saying that you should prompt yourself to automatically detach yourself from the world if it's making you happy. People do that plenty IRL ("I don't deserve this", "it's too good for me", etc.), and usually it's not healthy.

Second, what if the world is simply produced by /their own/ expectations, and thus mirrors exactly their expectation of unfairness too? I think that makes more sense in this model because it lightens Aizen's otherwise rather excessive load by having everyone imagine their own world. But in that model, /by definition/, you can't ever notice anything off - because if you think it would be off, it won't happen in the first place.
