So there is a way to tell if you are in the illusion then: check whether the world is fair to you.

Because the real world is fair in its unfairness to everyone. Random accidents happen all the time for no reason other than the butterfly effects of random whims far in the past. Measure the rate of such accidents happening to strangers, then measure the rate of such accidents happening to the people you care about. If there is a statistically significant difference between the two, you're in an illusion that is catered to you.
