First of all: /sorry/ for delaying a bit more the new Optimised Wish Project chapter! I'm working on it, but now and then I need to do something new to get my inspiration running again. So here's a short Bleach story to compensate. Writing Bleach rational fanfiction is something I've been thinking about for a while - it's temping but also hard, since the story has plot holes large enough to drive a train through. This isn't that, really, but rather a short rationalist parable about the Problem of Induction as applied to the very real issue (for Bleach characters, at least) of fighting an absolutely perfect illusionist. Enjoy!
