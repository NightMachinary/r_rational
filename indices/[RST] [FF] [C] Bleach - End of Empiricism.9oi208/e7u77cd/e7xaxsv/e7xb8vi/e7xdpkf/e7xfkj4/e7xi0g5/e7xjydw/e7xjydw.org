  But when you think about it, that makes no sense either: we have seen plenty of sentient Zanpakutou throughout the series and all of them seem to only have human-level intelligence.
#+end_quote

Most of those were in anime-only filler though. The only canon Zanpakutou spirits we see are Zangetsu and Zabimaru, and both tend to just be enigmatic and give hints to their owners. Maybe Kyouka Suigetsu is special - but either way, you're pointing at inconsistencies in side stuff written for a source material that was /already/ some of the most inconsistent, plot-hole ridden stuff out there. It's kind of a losing battle.

  It can't just do so like this though, otherwise the illusionee would notice that suddenly an incredible amount of things have cures, which would be a massive clue that the world isn't real.

Well, it would as long as it felt feasible. Most illnesses are rare enough that you can be reasonably expected not to catch them. Living healthy up to 80 or so is a possibility. Plus Ichigo is a Death God anyway, he /knows/ he's special and immortal, so his own mortal body can die and the illusion can simply go on.

#+begin_quote
  Eh, Ichigo is a standard shonen MC that never gives up no matter how bad things get. If being trapped in an illusion is enough to make him give up and be unhappy for the rest of his life, he should have given up long long ago near the start of the story.
#+end_quote

More like, he'd try to break out all the time and fail, which would be frustrating. Unless you consider an eternal struggle the ideal condition for him as a shounen MC which... fair enough. That gets interestingly meta.

Also, if he was /wrong/, he'd be rightfully seen by everyone else as a schizophrenic, paranoid, tinfoil-hat wearing madman.

#+begin_quote
  True. That's why I said it wasn't guaranteed to work. And so you would keep trying different things until you find one that does. The possibilities are endless, and there's no way to be sure that there is absolutely no way to break the illusion, so you can choose to keep on fighting forever.
#+end_quote

Sure, so why don't you do it right now? It's not like /you/ have any evidence that you're not trapped in an illusion either. Knowing that Aizen exists doesn't change the balance much in practice - even if you did not know of his existence, he /still/ may exist. You're as likely to stumble upon an inconsistency while simply living your life as you are doing anything else, since you have no idea what it could possibly end up being anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Which strongly suggests that if the copies (or your memories) don't stay the same, someone other than yourself, either the Kyouka Suigetsu or Aizen himself, has to actively review your memory and manipulate it every time you gain some memories that suggest you are in an illusion. Which presents a weakness in the illusion: as Aizen increases the number of illusionees, more and more of them would keep on gaining memories he or his Zanpakutou has to actively review and manipulate, and it could reach a point where they can't keep up if the illusionees don't give up on checking whether they are in an illusion.

Again, this hits on that "computational limit" thing. First: does the illusion power all come from the same source, or does it subsidise part of the victim's own brain power to parallelize its job? In the latter case, scaling is irrelevant, but perhaps differences in intelligence among victims could make a difference (though the ones providing less computational power could also be the ones less apt to notice anything wrong). Second: is that source limited at all, or is it just infinite magic that works?

These are all actually pretty interesting questions - as I said, if I had to write a full Rational!Bleach story /this/ is definitely the way I'd go to treat Aizen's power and give it reasonable limits and his opponents a fair shot at victory. However since this story was more about the Problem of Induction in general, the "Kyouka Suigetsu is basically absolutely omnipotent" approach worked better for me in this case.
