  However Kyouka Suigetsu /could/ be able to work out all the details, which would make this much harder. In canon, no such vulnerabilities are suggested, so I'm more inclined to go the "it's just magic, it always works" road (which is what I went with in this story).
#+end_quote

Fair enough, the author of Bleach probably also figured the Zanpakutou could just handle the illusion itself. But when you think about it, that makes no sense either: we have seen plenty of sentient Zanpakutou throughout the series and all of them seem to only have human-level intelligence. Thus Kyouka Suigetsu can't be like a superintelligent AI and work out all the details.

  But it comes at no expense for the system to just raise the general rate of luck.
#+end_quote

I suppose if the illusion somehow makes it so everyone has the same amount of luck, even if it doesn't match reality's amount of luck you wouldn't be able to tell unless you measured reality's rate beforehand.

  If you're not supposed to die of cancer, the illusion could just say "invented cure for cancer!". Boom, no cancer for anyone any more.
#+end_quote

It can't just do so like this though, otherwise the illusionee would notice that suddenly an incredible amount of things have cures, which would be a massive clue that the world isn't real.

  What if your expectations include sometimes noticing weird shit? I think you can go more and more meta in this reasoning and never reach the bottom.
#+end_quote

Then that raises a very interesting paradox for the illusion. For example, if I had a very unfair coin that is far more likely to land on heads than on tails (this is easy to make, just glue a heavy coin to a light one), I would still expect it to eventually land on tails if I keep flipping it over and over. But I would never expect the next particular flip to land on tails, since each flip still has a far higher probability of landing on heads than on tails. So what would the illusion do? If it obeys my expectation of the current flip, the current flip should land on heads. But if it obeys my expectation of all the flips, one should eventually land on tails. But it can't just wait until I expect that the next coin flip has to be tails, because I would always expect that the next coin flip should be heads since the flips are independent of my past flips.

And the same would be true for my everyday life in the illusion. I would expect that if I was in reality, really bad things would happen every once in a while. But I would never expect a really bad thing to happen on precisely the day I'm currently experiencing. So the illusion would have to somehow handle these two contradictory expectations.

  Well, in Ichigo's case, he'd get paranoid about having been trapped and defeated by a dangerous enemy. So that would inevitably translate into basically sapping the joy out of the rest of his life.
#+end_quote

Eh, Ichigo is a standard shonen MC that never gives up no matter how bad things get. If being trapped in an illusion is enough to make him give up and be unhappy for the rest of his life, he should have given up long long ago near the start of the story.

  I think the weak point in that is that ultimately all comes down to a bottleneck: you. Suppose I studied particle physics and sat down at the LHC, reading its outputs. The LHC produces several TB of data per second, much of which is automatically pruned out by algorithms, the rest is copied and stored in multiple servers. Now, when a scientist looks at this data, they /still/ can only take in as much as their senses can work with. So no illusion would need to /actually/ process all the quantum weirdness stuff and then produce TB of data and then refine that into the plots that he looks at on screen. It would just need to produce the plots. And by definition, those plots would fit the knowledge of the subject, so they would be good enough to fool them.
#+end_quote

True. That's why I said it wasn't guaranteed to work. And so you would keep trying different things until you find one that does. The possibilities are endless, and there's no way to be sure that there is absolutely no way to break the illusion, so you can choose to keep on fighting forever.

#+begin_quote
  Sure, you could photograph or save them, and then go study nuclear physics /better/, and see if they still match your expectations. But you'd be looking at illusions, again. Why should the copies stay the same? And in this scenario, Infinite Mirror can even manipulate your memory. So your own memory of them would be unreliable.
#+end_quote

*/Ah but that becomes very interesting now doesn't it?/*

Who is controlling your memory wipes? Your memory isn't automatically manipulated every time you suspect you are in an illusion, otherwise Ichigo wouldn't have been able to ask the question of whether he is in an illusion. And you certainly don't expect your own memory to be wiped, since you wouldn't remember any previous instance of your memory being wiped and so wouldn't recall any data to suggest your memory would be wiped. You also wouldn't expect a copy you wrote a value X on to read a different value Y later.

Which strongly suggests that if the copies (or your memories) don't stay the same, someone other than yourself, either the Kyouka Suigetsu or Aizen himself, has to actively review your memory and manipulate it every time you gain some memories that suggest you are in an illusion. Which presents a weakness in the illusion: as Aizen increases the number of illusionees, more and more of them would keep on gaining memories he or his Zanpakutou has to actively review and manipulate, and it could reach a point where they can't keep up if the illusionees don't give up on checking whether they are in an illusion.
