Thus far you've been introducing characters and following canon fairly closely. These next couple chapters I feel are going to really make or break the story. We've seen the changes you've made to everyone, and now it's time to see how that changes what happens.

I should mention that it's kinda strange to have an interlude the chapter before the end of an arc, but considering the events that ended the arc I can see why you wouldn't really want an interruption.
