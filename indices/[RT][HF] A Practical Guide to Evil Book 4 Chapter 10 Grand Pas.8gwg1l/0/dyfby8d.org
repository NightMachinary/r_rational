One subtle way they are inverting the normal Good and Evil dynamic I just noticed is that normally it would be the heroes using the small army and clever tactics vs. a numerically superior enemy force. The rules of the Narrative seem to work more at the level of individual named then at the scale of armies, but if I was on Procer's side I'd be rather worried that we were letting the other side be the plucky underdogs in this.
