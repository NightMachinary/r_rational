  She'll consolidate her host and march straight to Harrow, where Callow will have to meet her on the field or yield a key objective.

Did you mean Hedges? Sitting in Harrow does shorten the supply train and safeguards heroes from fighting the Woe until the demon is gone, but backtracking doesn't do anything to avoid attrition in the longer term.

Watch “don't need to be trusted, just need to be there.” They are more likely a distraction than not. My guess is that she's trying to bait out the heroes separately from the army that can't catch up with them. Then again, Cat has only two combat-capable Named in her host right now: herself and Masego. Still not sure why she's keeping Hakram away.

Maybe Archer could catch up too, but then why send the raider cohort separately from the main force? Until she described the aftermath of Nauk's deployment, I thought they would be the ones with the task of harassing the supply line. Evidently they have another target, but I have no idea which one.
