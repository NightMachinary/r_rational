I did mean Hedges, thanks.

It's hard to see how this tactic on its own could result in victory. Attrition warfare is all well and good but Cat would need a lot more time to whittle down the enemy army to something manageable.

That's why I think she has several other plans that she'll pull out when appropriate - Archer is probably one such plan, as you say. I'm confused about Hakram too. You would think now would be the time to pull him back into the army.
