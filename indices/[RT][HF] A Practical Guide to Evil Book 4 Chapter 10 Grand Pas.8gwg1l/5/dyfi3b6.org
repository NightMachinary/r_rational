A war of attrition, huh? How very Winter-like of Catherine, making her enemies feel the bite of hunger.

This seems like a first part of a plan. Princess Malanza is not an idiot, as soon as she realizes what's happening she'll consolidate her host and march straight to Harrow, where Callow will have to meet her on the field or yield a key objective.

I'm guessing Cat has a couple more cards up her sleeve. Maybe she'll move Harrow into Arcadia? Or immobilize the host by killing the commanding officers using the Watch? I'm not sure either would work with Heroes around.
