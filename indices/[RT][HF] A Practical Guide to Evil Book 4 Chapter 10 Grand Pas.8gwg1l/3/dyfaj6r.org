  We believed she'd gambled on her having enough supplies to reach Hedges even if we did, which meant she'd be picking up the pace soon to force a battle there.

So, it looks like they're forcing the princess' hand while also demonstrating that she can make any two armies disappear at will. I'd say Cat's trying to bait Malanza into splitting her own host to guarantee catching up with at least one army of the three, but the crusaders' marching pace means that Cat will have time to regroup, so with the last paragraph my bet is on princess of Aequitan either having to split the /heroes/ if they can't guess where the next gate will open, so they'll hold the chokepoint, or singling out the army that has no gate-maker.

The phrase about Watch just needing to be there probably means that Catherine wants Malanza to leave a reserve of maybe five thousand to fight them off if necessary, but with their numbers that cannot be the only anngle at play. The fact that she sent Archer with Robber means that she'll either need them to attack some crucial part of the crusaders' host, or that she expects heroes to eventually be deployed to protect the supply line.

The involvement of heroes in the resulting strategy is where I'm drawing a blank. Will /they/ move quickly enough if Catherine keeps this up? Can they maybe enter Arcadia themselves? Will they able to make the gate a chokepoint? Catherine only has three battle-capable members of Woe with her (two if Archer is too far).
