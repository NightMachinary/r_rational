Oh, and I forgot an important distinction: Catherine has /three/ gate-makers.

One is Larat, who's currently in the western group of six thousand soldiers led by Nauk. One is Catherine, who's with Juniper's group of over nine thousand in the center. But, for those who remember the Battle of Four Armies and One, Masego can use fairies (maybe dissected, probably not, given that the Count of Olden Oak was successfully freed by the Queen of Summer) to open gates of his own. If the Wild Hunt splits, he'll be able to move around the group he's with just fine.

Maybe the avoidance of a pitched battle will culminate in heroes sallying out with the army to tie down what they believe to be Catherine's main means of transportation (herself and Larat), only for Masego to open a new path of retreat. Probably wouldn't be used as a straight up means of ferrying the third group around, since the procerans would get an advance warning on that. I still hope for transplanting a shard of Arcadia as an opening move, though.
