I am not assuming that any particular computation is equivalent to human consciousness. I am suggesting that the argument that you can have a computation that produces behavior indistinguishable from human consciousness (with a strong standard of distinguishability) - but isn't actually conscious - is itself a claim that requires better proof than "it's executing on a different substrate".
