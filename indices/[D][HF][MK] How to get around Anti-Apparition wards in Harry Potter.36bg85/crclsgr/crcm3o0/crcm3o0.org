Interesting! I'd love to read a story that expands on these ideas. It wouldn't be quite canon, though, since Merope Gaunt was able to affect Tom Riddle with love potions. (Possible fix: some love potions can also affect neurotransmitters in p-zombies, causing them to behave as if they were in love.) There are probably canon instances of Imperiusing Muggles too.

It also raises questions about magical creatures. Is a flobberworm morally worth more than a Muggle, since it has some tiny amount of subjective experience?

We also know that souls can be bound to simple objects like Horcruxes, so you don't need an object like a human body which is complex enough to show apparently conscious behavior even without a soul. So while Muggles have to solve hard engineering problems to cyborg-ize themselves, could a wizard just make a golem with a clay head and transfer their soul to it? Given your setting, they could probably benefit from extra explosion resistance.
