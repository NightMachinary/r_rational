But, if you think about it, the existence or dualistic individuals doesn't prevent the existence of monistic ones. We know from canon that wizards are dualistic (voldemort being a disembodied wraith) , now saying that muggles could only be dualistic or p-zombies is a false dicothomy, they could still be monistic, we have weak evidentemence for that : we know the physical laws that rule the muggle universe are the same than ours, we can assume muggles are identical to real world people . The only unanswered question is what did magic do on human evolution? We know that if evolution finds something that's exploitable it does but we have no canon information on that, it couldmake an awesome plot point.
