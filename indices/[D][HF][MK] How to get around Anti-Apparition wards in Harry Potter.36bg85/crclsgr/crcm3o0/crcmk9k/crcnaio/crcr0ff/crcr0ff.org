  In the real world I actually agree with Dennett, but if dualism is assumed to be true in this fantasy world, it wouldn't make sense for certain arrangements of neurons/transistors to also, by sheer coincidence, create a conscious entity. So whatever similarities Muggle behavior has with wizard behavior, must arise from a complex unconscious simulation.

I dunno. P-zombies?

You could still argue through the same line of thinking Eliezer uses, which is that if our talking about consciousness is caused by our being conscious, and Muggles have indistinguishable descriptions of consciousness, either they're probably conscious too or our consciousness is secretly epiphenomenal.

Mind you, there's still the question of /why/ Muggle and wizard brains work so differently, but that's no odder than the rest of magic. Maybe an ancient wizard decided to back up his brainstate, who knows?
