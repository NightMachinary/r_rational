Some issues with canon, yeah - but almost anything coherent would have that problem! The general impossibility of controlling or obligating Muggles is a feature, not a bug. In this universe, Merope used a potion with physiological rather than mental effect, and went slightly crazy when repeated date-rape didn't lead to a stable relationship (Voldemort doesn't have a pleasant backstory).

These questions are indeed interesting. You appear to hold with the traditionalists too, in the claim that conscious experience cannot exist in purely physical substrates. Daniel of house Dennet would disagree...

Soul magic is far more dangerous to a wizard than any explosion, but in principle this would be possible - if about as wise as dancing through the Forbidden Forest on midsummers day in iron boots, shouting that all fairies are bastards...
