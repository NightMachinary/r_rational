I've been playing around with similar ideas, where dualism is actually a thing. Muggles have no mental self - they're p-zombies. Squibs have a mental self, but it's disconnected from the body (the old families know it's kinder to destroy the body; squib-dom is /much worse/ than lifelong paralysis). Wizards are entites which exist on both mental and physical levels.

What makes this particularly interesting - aside from 'what is the moral status of entities that empirically don't have conscious experience like us (but might through some physical basis)' - is the hazards that wizards alone are exposed to.

Eg: Love potions, having a magical effect, only work on Wizards. Likewise all other mind-affecting magic, Dementors... etc. On the other hand, having a non-physical existence helps you survive lethal injury, dis-corporation, old age, etc.

Most magic only affects physical things, via non-physical mechanisms. Those who study the nature of the mental world too deeply tend to attract great power to themselves, followed closely by Powers no sane person knows of, before they vanish in some catastrophic experiment.

The society is divided not by political philosophy, but rather metaphysical: is a muggle a person? What makes something morally right? Squibs? (of course, saying any of this to a muggleborn witch or wizard is a colossal /faux pas/)

TL;DR - Harry Potter and Philosophy of Dualism 101, with explosions.

(edit: yes, I have read /Philosopher's Zombie/. It's good, but quite different.)
