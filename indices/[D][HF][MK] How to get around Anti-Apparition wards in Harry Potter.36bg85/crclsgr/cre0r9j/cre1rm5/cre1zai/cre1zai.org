Damn.

Hmm... would Young Wizards + [[/r/rational]]'s generic pool of ideas wind up as a story, as supplementary canon to Duane's work, or as biography of our userbase? The one thing I never liked was that wizardry is described as inherently conservative, which makes more sense in Duane's original setting of the series as taking place in her stable, boring childhood version of Long Island rather than in today's real world.
