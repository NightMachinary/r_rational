Summoned and Banished objects still have to move through the intermediate space, though. Vanishing is still mysterious enough that it could be what House-Elves are doing: all we know about "where do Vanished objects go?" is that they go "into nothing, which is to say, everything", and it's unclear whether they reappear and when. Plus the Vanishing Cabinet got through Hogwarts' wards.
