If ward boundaries are considered tangible enough for the basilisk blood to interact with them, that's a clever solution. I wonder if a live basilisk could let venom drip into its mouth and thereby pass through almost any ward? (Presumably the blood and venom still inside its body is not considered to be "touching" the ward; that would be /too/ exploitative.)
