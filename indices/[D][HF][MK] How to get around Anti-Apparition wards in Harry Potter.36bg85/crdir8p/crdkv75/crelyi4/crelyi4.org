/too/ exploitative? hah! I had once entertained the idea of writing a fanfic featuring an ultra-intelligent Harry. At one point he would seek out to destroy the wealth of the purebloods (ie. Malfoy) by wiping out all the goblin gold in Gringotts, by putting basilisk blood in a glass vial (uncorked), then gemino-ing the vial and dropping it into Gringotts. The resulting lake of basilisk blood would burn through all the wards as well as all the goblin gold and anything else of interest (such as the horcrux) until all that's left is a mess of basilisk blood, glass, melted stone and melted gold.
