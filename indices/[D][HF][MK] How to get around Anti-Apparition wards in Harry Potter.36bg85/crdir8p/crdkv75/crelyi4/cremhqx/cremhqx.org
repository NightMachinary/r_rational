I /want/ to say that wouldn't work, but in canon three underage kids managed to not only steal from the high-security vault of a pureblood family, but also kidnap one of the bank's security dragons. This is why the rest of the setting has to be upgraded to match the protagonist: if not, winning becomes trivial.

That said, is Gemino really likely to work that way? Food cannot be conjured out of thin air; presumably magical objects also cannot be conjured (otherwise you could just make a Philosopher's Stone from nothing), and I would expect something as powerful as basilisk blood to also be un-duplicable.

According to [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gemino_Curse][the wiki]]: "Over time, the copy tended to rot or tarnish more quickly than the original... It is also unknown as to whether or not the Gemino Curse can duplicate living or sentient beings, or if it is able to replicate an object's magical properties." So it might actually be as easy as you say.
