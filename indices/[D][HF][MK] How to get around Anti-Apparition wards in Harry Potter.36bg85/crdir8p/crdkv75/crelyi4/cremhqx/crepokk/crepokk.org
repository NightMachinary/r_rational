  That said, is Gemino really likely to work that way? Food cannot be conjured out of thin air; presumably magical objects also cannot be conjured (otherwise you could just make a Philosopher's Stone from nothing), and I would expect something as powerful as basilisk blood to also be un-duplicable.

I read on the HP wiki that Gemino creates temporary duplicates and can only be dispelled by the caster. Which literally means that once this happens, Gringotts is fucked. The basilisk blood doesn't have to exist permanently; anything it ruins before it dissipates will also be irrevocably damaged. Food, philosopher's stones are only valuable because they last. And while the copy rots or tarnishes more quickly, I don't see how basilisk blood can get /more/ ruined.
