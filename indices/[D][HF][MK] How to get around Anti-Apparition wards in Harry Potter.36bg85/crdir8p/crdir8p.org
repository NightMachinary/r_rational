It is known from the fact that basilisk blood is able to destroy horcruxes, the /most warded objects in the entire story/, on just a slight touch. As such that means wards - which ostensibly would prevent physical contact - are instantly destroyed upon contact with basilisk blood.

Keep a bullet/pellet smeared in basilisk blood with you at all times. Harry can do this anytime after killing the basilisk in Book 2.

Use Wingardium Leviosa to send the blood pellet flying off into the distance. Anti-apparition wards have to have a ward surface, ie. its outermost range, even if it's half a mile away in each direction. Send the pellet far enough in any direction and it will exit the ward surface, and voila, the ward collapses.
