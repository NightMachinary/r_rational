This depends entirely too much on why magic works. If it's some sort of automated system that detects an appropriate coded phrase or thought and invokes a specific effect then this wouldn't work, since it would be creating an entirely new command-effect pair. A new spell would have to be similar to an already existing one to work, and the anti-Apparition spells might possibly block a larger set of potential spells by requesting the system to ignore all matter transport out of/into the target area.
