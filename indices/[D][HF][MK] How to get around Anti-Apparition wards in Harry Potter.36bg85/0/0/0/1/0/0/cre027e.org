As long as we acknowledge that spells having identical effects on the "consciousness" of wizards and mages alike is evidence against the magic=soul theory, and we're clearly ignoring/handwaving it. I mean really, that argument could be made about anything. It /is/ being made for anything. The killing curse coincidentally wrecks the nervous system of muggles, in a way that "leaves no noticeable mark on the person" except that they're dead.

Come to think of it, that's both a plot hole in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie, /and/ decent evidence that either both have a soul, or neither do.
