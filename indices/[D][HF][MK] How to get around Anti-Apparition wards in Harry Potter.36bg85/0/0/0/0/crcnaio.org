In the real world I actually agree with Dennett, but if dualism is assumed to be true in this fantasy world, it wouldn't make sense for certain arrangements of neurons/transistors to /also/, by sheer coincidence, create a conscious entity. So whatever similarities Muggle behavior has with wizard behavior, must arise from a complex unconscious simulation.

Horcruxes, ghosts, and Dementors are the only examples of soul magic I can think of in canon, and none of them are really beneficial. Ghosts are denied the afterlife (or whatever is beyond the Veil), horcruxes split your soul (which has unspecified terrible consequences; I would say it drove Voldemort crazy, except that Tom Riddle was pretty crazy to begin with), and Dementors are the worst possible thing (similar to [[http://hdm.wikia.com/wiki/Spectre][Spectres]]). There are plenty of mind-affecting spells---Cheering Charms, Confundus, the Diadem of Ravenclaw---but at least this area of magic isn't entirely too-dangerous-to-risk.

I see you've read some Discworld.
