Eh, I was thinking more that from the perspective of most magic, muggles just don't exist at all. Obviously a fire spell would still burn the organic matter, but a love potion would just kill them due to toxic ingredients uncountered by magic, and obliviation has no effect at all.

Luckily muggles also lack the senses to perceive or means to interact with magical effects, so the 'entrance' to various districts is more of a portal to folded space (ala Kings Cross), rather than "hidden" (like canon Hogwarts).
