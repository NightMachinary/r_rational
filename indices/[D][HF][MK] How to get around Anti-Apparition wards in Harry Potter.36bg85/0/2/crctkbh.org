The problem with this is that p-zombies depend on the assumption that consciousness is some kind of substance. That's really a kind of weird assumption. Whether the computations that create the appearance of consciousness happen in a digital computer or a chunk of fat or a metaphysical force field, they have the same results and there's no reason to treat one as privileged.
