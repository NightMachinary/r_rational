My favourite so far - ie the only one I'm likely to write - is a kind of meta-crossover, in snippets. There are no YW-universe elements whatsoever - instead,someone has published a /suspiciously/ familiar book series.

Harry finds The Book one day while hiding from bullies in a library, and it becomes very important to him. Hermione has been searching all her life for enough knowledge to make the world stop hurting, and discovering magic is a wonderful dream that's slowly turning into a nightmare. They meet on the Express, and since both are hiding from everything form a sibling-type friendship. Ron is mostly irrelevant, like in canon, but may turn up sometimes. (noticing familiar backstories? There are no co-incidences...)

Then an indefinite series of snippets, mixing all kinds of themes. The Avedictory, Provocodictory (Dementors, yeah?), the Oath - and meaning it when wizardy doesn't come, monsters and magic and learning and whatever of life I want to write... Less of a focussed story than a wandering exploration of worlds.

In some ways it's crossover fanfic, with maybe a touch of meta and a subtle kind of write-who-you-know.
