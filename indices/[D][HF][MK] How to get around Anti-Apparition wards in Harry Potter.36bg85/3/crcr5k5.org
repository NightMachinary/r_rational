Honestly, I always got the impression that anti-Apparition spells "worked" by detecting the Apparition spell and stopping it. Kinda like a counter-curse.

House-Elves get through because they technically use a different spell that happens to have identical effects.

Conscious intent is clearly "real" in the Potterverse, for a certain measure of "real" - they interact with spells just as effectively as, say, temperature or momentum does. Better, even. On this basis, it should be easy enough to check if Muggles count; just have one interact with a piece of magic that requires an emotion, like Harry's sacrificial love shield thing or a Boggart. (I bet they do, for the record, and there's probably canon evidence.)

But then, so are /words/; Transfiguration is easier when the target and subject sound the same, as with guinea pigs and guinea hens (completely unrelated creatures otherwise.) Supposedly, so are "magically powerful numbers", although we haven't the foggiest idea what that /means/.
