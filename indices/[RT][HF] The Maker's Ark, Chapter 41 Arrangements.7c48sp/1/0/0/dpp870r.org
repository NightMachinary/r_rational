Doc is /way/ more talented at building bombs than is useful, safe or he is comfortable with. That's why he hates them so much--remember he came up with his block after he unintentionally built a bomb that could wipe out life on Earth when he was trying to destress after breaking up with his first girlfriend when he was fifteen.

Utility and delivery are trickier.
