  Worm 2 (Technically it's Parahumans 2) is rolling out soon. In the meantime, I'll be dropping some very super minor tidbits on the Worm website. These interim pieces will serve as kind of unofficial/prelude/tone-setting bits and will go up on my usual schedule, just as things for people to see if they're keeping to their usual routine of checking in. They will not be full-length chapters and may not even be 500 words long.

  This will go on for a couple weeks (5-10 segments on the usual Tues/Possible Thurs/Sat schedule) and the final installment in the set will link to the site for the Worm sequel. Links will also appear on all of my sites. This will give me time to hopefully get some final preliminary work done, wrangle the mailing list, and (ideal world) fix my currently scattered sleep schedule.

But yeah, go read Twig if you haven't. I don't think I can oversell how great it is.
