I've been looking through quotes and I'm still not clear if Wildbow would approve or disapprove of making your own ebooks for personal use, I think the best counterargument for myself is this quote:

#+begin_quote
  There's unethical sorts who are taking others' work and claiming it as their own (often with a title/name change) and I'd rather not make it easier for them. I know there's a few fanmade ebook versions circulating, I accept that it'll happen, but I don't want to help the process along.

So I won't share this link anymore, but it's virtually impossible to prevent somebody from googling the words 'worm scraper' so it's kinda a moot point anyways.
