Grimdark has come to mean gratuitous brutality and darkness. It's very often used, for example, to describe the new wave of "gritty" fantasy, ASOIAF being the perfect example.

Wildbow's writing style can be summed up as "... and then it got worse". But the ending of worm was pretty optimistic. I'm worried none of that will come through in the sequel and we'll be back to square one.
