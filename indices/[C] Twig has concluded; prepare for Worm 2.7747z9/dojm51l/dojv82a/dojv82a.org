I think Wildbow has learned a lot from his other stories. Grim and unrelenting pace was the problem Pact had, and he's recognized it; Twig had quite a few parts that were more fluffy than dark. I think he's not not going to make the same mistake he did with Pact by starting it at the same tension level he finished the previous book off at.
