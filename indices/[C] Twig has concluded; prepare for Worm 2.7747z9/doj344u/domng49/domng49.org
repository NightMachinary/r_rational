In a way, I'm glad that Taylor is getting sidelined a bit, because that means people may start to see appeal in anything else than Taylor fics.

Seeing the hyper popular fics follow the stations of canon but never leave Brockton Bay gets old really fast.

Tabloid pops up as something that I think should be more represented in Worm fanfics
