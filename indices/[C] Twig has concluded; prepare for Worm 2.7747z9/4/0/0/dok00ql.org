I agree. Twig is really good (haven't finished reading it yet btw) but a lot of the arcs feel kind of self contained and episodic. So it didn't really give me that "I have to immediately continue reading this!" feel that Worm did.

Rather I was more inclined to read an arc, go read something else, then come back and read another arc. But the actual arcs themselves, especially the character dynamics, were great.

I rate it above Pact at least.
