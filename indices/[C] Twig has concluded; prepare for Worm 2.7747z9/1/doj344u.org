Far from being excited about Worm 2, I'm actually quite anxious. While world building is amazing, for me Worm is mostly about Taylor, who is extremely unlikely to appear in Worm 2 in any capacity beyond a passing mention or a as historical/religious figure, let alone a protagonist.

I am also enjoying a steady supply of some great Taylor-centric Worm fanfics, and so I'm worried Worm 2 is going to pull away a significant chunk of the fandom, causing current authors to switch to stories about new characters that I don't care about.

As for Twig, I started reading it the last time a notification about it ending was posted here, and I've just finished Arc 4. While it is certainly better than early Worm, in almost any 'objective' metric I can come up with, it has also failed to hook me in the same way Worm did, and is, at points, a bit of slog to get through. But yes, if you have not given it a try yet, you absolutely should.
