For me, Worm is like jumping into a cold ocean. There is excitement, ups and downs. Pact is like getting excited to go to the beach, but you get there and it wasn't what you hoped for. Twig is like sitting in slow acting quicksand, and only realizing after trying to get up.

Edit: No autocorrect, 'ot' is not a word, I really did mean 'it'
