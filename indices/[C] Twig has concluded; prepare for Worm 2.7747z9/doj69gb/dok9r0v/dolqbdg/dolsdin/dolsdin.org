Good question. I am going to say this represents my personal enjoyment. For example, in Worm, there is a huge slog fighting the clones of the (forgot their team name). However, the back and forth in trying to figure out what Tattletale knew was very drama filled and exciting.

With Pact, I loved the rules of the world, but wasn't a fan of where the main characters took it. I ended up losing interest in what was going on, and was more excited about interlude chapters with excerpts from the textbooks!

Twig (no spoilers) left me feeling like it was too slow, the world wasn't as interesting as Pact, the excitement wasn't as great as Worm's highs. But... I found myself constantly thinking about it, and found myself intwined with the main character's personality, and much more invested than the previous stories.
