Spoilers ahead, my interpretation of Angier's motivation..

The first time Angier duplicated himself, "he" shot his "clone", as the clone yelled: "I am the origin-"

What if, the clone actually /is/ the original? Whatever truly happened during the moment of the duplication, only the two Angiers would know... Most would assume, a perfect, atom-to-atom duplication would produce two instances of the same person - with no way to tell them apart and the question to define the "original" is not meaningful.

However, one possibility is something happens during the duplication process, the two copies are /not/ identical. Both would know somehow, the original gets teleported away and a clone is produced at the original location. This, of course, is the not the most obvious mechanism one would expect.

This is why Angier shot his original in his first ever experiment - he knew he was the clone, therefore had a "lesser" right to exist, thus quick to resolve to desperate and drastic measures. This is also why he would go on perform the trick, knowing the one drowning in the tank would be the "clone", and he would live on as the original.

Of course, there is no evidence to actually support this hypothesis at all. However, even back to the model where the machine produces identical copies of the same person - the surviving Angier could not know for sure; he heard his-self yelling "I am the original" - an eternal seed of doubt forever remained in his mind. He had no way to answer the question definitively who's the "original" (to him this is not a mere philosophical question, but a life and death paradox).

In this sense I think he truly believed the brief words his first murdered clone spoke - that the clone is the original. After all, he /felt/ like the original when enjoying the awe and applause of the audience every night. Therefore, in his mind, what he was doing was a merciful murder of his clone every day, not a knowing suicide. I think this is likely the justification he gave himself. Given it has already been established that he did not like at all the double taking the glory and prestige earlier in the movie, I think the only plausible explanation for him to kill himself every day only to let a clone take all the glory is that he believed that the survivor was and would always be the original.
