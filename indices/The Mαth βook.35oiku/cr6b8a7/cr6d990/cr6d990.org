I think it's quite alright; although not strictly within the realms of rational fiction as this subreddit's purpose is, plenty of people here would be interested in something like this, I think. I will, at least, check my public library for a copy of this book, so you've helped at least one person out.

I've always been interested in math, but never really been sure where to start. If this book is half as good as you portray it to be, it seems a nice place to do so.
