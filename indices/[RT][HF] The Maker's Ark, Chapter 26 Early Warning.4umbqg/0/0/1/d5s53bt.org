Dunno what BEC is, but I don't think she's talking about a black hole. "Ice, more than any frost giant has ever dreamed of". Black holes are cold (at least, when there's nothing else around), but lacking in solid water.

A black dwarf is the closest match I can find. They're high-gravity (100,000 gees or so), and covered in various frozen gasses. On the downside, they're hypothetical objects that our universe is too young to contain, and also there's apparently no way to travel interstellar distances and land in the same universe you left.

An alternate universe is more likely. Have any been introduced that would work?
