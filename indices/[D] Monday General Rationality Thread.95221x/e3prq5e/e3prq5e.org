Which sites or resources do you use to learn more about self-improvement?

Subreddits like [[/r/getdisciplined]] and [[/r/selfimprovement]] mainly contain people who, understandably enough, have far to go regarding self-improvement. Thus every such community I've found sucks. Lesswrong was decent, but it has limited high-quality material, and the actually clever people seem to have left the site now.
