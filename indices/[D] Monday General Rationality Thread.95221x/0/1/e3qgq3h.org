lesswrong has improved a lot, honestly.

I use complice, and find it useful. There's a "chat room" there where people are productive together and post their goals. You get out what you put in: i.e. you need to sort of volunteer what you're doing and ask people for help, but then you get a lot of help (someone once debugged an issue I was having with LaTeX/BibTeX!). The chat room runs under the pomodoro technique: 32 / 8 minute cycles.

If you want to sign up I can rustle up a referral link that gives you an extra week of free trial, but the chat room itself is free/open.
