MOOCs on logic, [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking][math,]] statistics and probability, neuroscience (brain 101,[[https://www.mcb80x.org/][^{[1]}]][[https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurobiology][^{[2]}]] [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain][its vulnerabilities to addiction,]] etc), metalearning, etc. If you want to give them a try, and if your priority is self-improvement and disclipline, start with the [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn][metalearning one.]] Which will also help with the process of gradual introduction of MOOC-based learning into your daily (monthly, yearly) schedule.

Also Duolingo for languages; Khan Academy, artofproblemsolving.com (too expensive, unfortunately), and brilliant.org for math (still looking for additional good math learning platforms that would have non-paywalled interaction with human tutors). And [[/r/booksuggestions/]] when I've already determined what specifically am I looking for.

There should also be a good CBT-related self-help resource listed here, but I haven't found any yet.
