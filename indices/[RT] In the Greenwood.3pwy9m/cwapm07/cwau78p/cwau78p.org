Not sure what you mean. It's a retelling of the classic tale while following all the marks of a rational story:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

It's certainly not rational/ist/, but it's quite a nice rational short story.
