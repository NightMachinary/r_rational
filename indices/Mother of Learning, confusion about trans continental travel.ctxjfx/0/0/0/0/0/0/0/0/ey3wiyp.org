hmm i don't remember him perfecting it, he analysed it yes.... this is how that went

“Yeah, now that you mention it, I don't really like the idea,” Zach agreed. “How is your analysis of their contact ritual going?”

Zorian's face twisted into a grimace.

“That bad, huh?” Zach asked with a grin.

“I'll say this: there is a reason why they're still using that stupid method instead of switching to something better. I don't think I'll figure out something better any time soon,” Zorian explained unhappily.

“You might want to work with them instead of away from them in the future,” Zach noted. “They're annoying jerks, but I'm sure they're as interested in making the contact ritual better as we are, and they have way more experience with it than you do.”

that was chapter 65 when they first saw the "ritual" afterwards, chapter 79 is the next one they mention progress on the actual ritual despite working on it for ages, where it's a offhand comment of "having improved the bakora gate rituals speed and reliability greatly" no more details provided. if greatly is cutting the time in half we're still talking roughly 15-60 min, and it still require fuel as long as they are using the doorway adepts gate rather then they Cyorian one, and still require a shitload of spider casting.
