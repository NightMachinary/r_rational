working on my final reread and i think i can at least a new reference relating to your question.

the first mention of the modified gate spell is when he talks to silverlake (in chapter 74)

  Zorian smiled. That was only natural. After all, Zorian's gate creation skills were a fusion of more orthodox gate creation skills that Xvim had taught him, as well as the insights Zorian had made from studying the Ibasan permanent gates and seeing the Bakora Gates in action. He doubted many people had had the opportunity to study so many different gate creation methods.

  ...

  “Throw in that modified Gate spell of yours and we have a deal,” Silverlake said.

the 'modified' aspect would imply its not just the basic spell he's been using with simulacra and the reason he can do it is all the other gates and dimensionalism he's studied. I wish it was more clearly stated but there it is.

Edit: ugh

Now in chapter 79 Zach makes the gate because he left a simulacrum in eldemar....I take back what I said above
