several reasons, one the Tarmantula give him access to spells that he can't really get his hands on in Cyoria so it's another orchard of low hanging fruit when it comes to useful spells, it can also build stuff there without fearing intervention from anyone that "matters" aka knew him before he got so good at spell formula.

Damien was usually there with his fiance and while he traveled around Cyoria i'm pretty sure he needed to go back, requiring Zorian to keep a simulacrum there.

Bakora gates are far from THAT convenient, they take a lot of mana to activate and a lot of chanting spiders to hope they get the request right, and it could take anywhere from 30 min to hours, they also require Zorian to teleport to their web, bribe them & supply them with crystals enough for the portal to have enough mana since their bakora gate is in a pretty low ambient mana area.

Having a simularcum in Koth give him a perfect escape route from anywhere since he know nobody will be able to teleport to follow him, meaning it's a perfect retreat spell.

I'm sure there are more good reasons those are just the ones at the top of my head.
