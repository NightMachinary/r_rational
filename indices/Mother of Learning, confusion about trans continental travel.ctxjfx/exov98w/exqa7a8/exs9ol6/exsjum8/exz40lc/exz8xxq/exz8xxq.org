nope that's where you're wrong, the ritual is always needed, without the password you can't travel to that gate period that's why they were not able to go to especially many places at all before he collected the passwords, that's also why they were so eager for passwords for areas they can't normally acess, if they could travel there with the gate anyway it would never have been a issue.

in real the ritual is crap, it's a makeshift solution since the real one is lost to time, and Zorian have so far not mentioned any way of skipping the "ritual".
