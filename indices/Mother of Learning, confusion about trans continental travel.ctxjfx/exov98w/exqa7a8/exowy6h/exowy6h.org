During the period where Zorian was watching the Silent Doorway Adepts, I remember him trying to puzzle out and find the underlying mechanics, and using those mechanics to power the bi-directional simulacrum gate.

Is he able to do them mismatched, where there's a simulacrum on one side, and a bokoran gate w/ password on the other?

Either that or Zorian's just running so many simulacra that he's everywhere.
