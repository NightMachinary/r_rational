  Ch 99 mentions Zorian's ability to open a gate to Koth "at will" a couple of times, in such a way that it sounds like a simulacrum doesn't have to be on the other side. However, I don't remember him ever acquiring that ability.

I think that once they have the bakora gate password, they send a simulacrum through to the other side, and the simulacrum stays there for the rest of the restart.
