Thank you so much for this.

  hey were shown as being present at the old gate the first time they gave a password to the Silent Doorway Adepts, because neither side trusted the other.

I didn't notice that it was more of a trust issue rather than the underlying magical limitation.

  I think you're right that you need someone on each side. However, if you can send a simulacrum through a Bakora Gate, that cuts down the vast majority of the travel time required to get the much-more-convenient Gate spell working.

That would cut down the time yes, but many times Zorian is shown to just open the dimensional gates without mentioning the simulacrum at the adjoining gate. Now it is entirely possible that the simulacrums /are/ present just not mentioned because it's not that important. But take chapter 83 for example when they have that fight with QI, only Z&Z attack him and none of simulacrums are even mentioned. I find this instance pretty glaring, so I guess Zorian can just straight up open gates like you mentioned about chapter 99, but again I dont recall him having that ability.

I do however remember that he was modifying/optimising gate spells after studying QI's gate, bakora gates and mixing coaching instructions from Xhim and Silverlake. So I guess he might just have that ability to straight up open intercontinental gates.
