  Bakora gates used by arinae - To use these one must have the ritual and the password for that specific gate. Z&Z travel around and gather passwords for these gates when they are physically present to inspect a new gate. Now can they just give the new passwords to the arinae web in another restart and the gates would work? Don't they have to be physically present at the new gate to activate it?

As far as I can tell, it's just a matter of knowing the password. They have to visit any new gate once, to /get/ the password, but that's it. Any gate they've already been to in the loop, they don't have to visit again.

They were shown as being present at the /old/ gate the first time they gave a password to the Silent Doorway Adepts, because neither side trusted the other. But now that they know what they're doing, it's just a matter of giving the Adepts the password, and they're able to go to that gate.

I think you're right that you need someone on each side. However, if you can send a simulacrum through a Bakora Gate, that cuts down the vast majority of the travel time required to get the much-more-convenient Gate spell working.

That said, I could be wrong about that; [[https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/99/][Ch 99]] mentions Zorian's ability to open a gate to Koth "at will" a couple of times, in such a way that it sounds like a simulacrum doesn't have to be on the other side. However, I don't remember him ever acquiring that ability.
