Greenseers seems to be the most powerful magic users that we've met so far. Pretty much super-charged wargs who have the ability to take over animals and plants. By looking through plants (only weirtrees so far) the greenseer has the ability to see all that the tree has seen. This could for instance be used to scout ahead, plan ambushes, find hidden treasure etc.

We haven't seen much about the true power of shadowbinder yet, only Melisandres shadow that assassinated Renly. The Shadowbinders are, according to World of Ice and Fire, to be the most sinister inhabitants of Asshai, a city where no magic is prohibited. The possibilites of blood-/shadowmagic is pretty much limitless. Resurrection, assassination, glamours/illusions and the like combined with the possibility of more direct destructive firemagic makes shadowbinders kinda op. The only drawback seems to be that most powerful spells requires kings blood but with some resources an ambitious (and scruple-less) shadowbinder could find some bastards (Robert has more than a few still running around), breed them with others or each other and then just sacrifice them for more power. Rinse and repeat.
