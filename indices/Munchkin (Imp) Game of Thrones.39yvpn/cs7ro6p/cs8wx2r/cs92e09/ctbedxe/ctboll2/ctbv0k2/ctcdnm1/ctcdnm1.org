Technically yes, but not by enough. Besides, your archers will not stand and fight when charged by a flying flamethrower. I know I wouldn't.

There's in-universe evidence of this. The Targaryens landed on Westeros with three dragons and not much else, crushed every opposing army, and united the seven kingdoms in two years - all without losing a single dragon.

Most ASoIaF dragons died of old age or in a fight with another dragon. I think one of them was killed by a scorpion (the siege weapon).
