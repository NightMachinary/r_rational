The rules are too poorly defined to really figure out what's going on in /A Song of Ice and Fire/. I've seen the scholars at [[/r/asoiaf]] try, but it's all mostly guesswork. If I had to do a power ranking (*spoilers follow*):

- Dragons. Long-range artillery in a world where that's basically unknown, fast travel times, morale breaking, etc. Not much way to munchkin these except to spend lots of time with them, give them lots of food, and don't chain them up in a dungeon (/cough cough/).
- Others. Virtually invulnerable to anything except for dragonglass, Valyrian steel, and maybe plain fire. Doesn't really matter, because if you're an Other you never really need to go into combat; just raise an army of undead and stand back on the hills while they fight it out. The extent to which summer time effects them is unknown, but I would work on finding an immunity to that.
- Priests of R'hllor. Resurrection is great, though their form of it kind of sucks; it's better for morale boosting than it is for any other purpose. If you're doing things right, no one is strategically irreplaceable. The costs, limits, and conditions are unknown. The priests also get access to some form of divination, and possibly shadow magic, but the divination isn't all that good, and the shadow magic presumably has some limits on it, unless the characters are stupid (or there's some contextual reason for them no to use it that's opaque to the reader). It's not clear to what extent R'hllor actually exists, if at all. It's not clear to what extent shadow magic and blood magic are R'hllor based. Glamours are really, really good, for subterfuge; impersonate enemy commanders with it to sow dissent and confusion.
- Faceless Men. Have access to better form-changing magic than the priests, but not much else. They use this for impersonation, but apparently not to take over entire kingdoms by pretending to be the king. It's not clear whether this is because they would need to have too much information, because of their culture, or because of unknown limitations on the magic.
- Skinchanging. Good for scouting. Good for leading animals on the offensive, if you can get a pack of wolves to follow the one you're warged into. Good for long-distance communication, if you can control it precisely enough to beat the ravens. Could you make a monkey write? A parrot talk? Unknown; we haven't seen it used enough. You /can/ skinchange into a person, but it's not clear what the limits or conditions on this are.
- Greenseeing. Somehow distinct from skinchanging, or in addition to it, but all by itself it seems to offer some not-very-good divination. It's poor for information gathering, but could be made better by planting more weirwoods. Nothing else that it's done has been too impressive.
