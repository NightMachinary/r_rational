You've forgotten the Braavosi Faceless Men -- they possess the ability to change their identity so thoroughly that they can infiltrate and assassinate whom ever is worthy of the Many-Faced God's attention.

Blah blah blah, spoilers, etc.

That said, Bran and Arya are tied for munchkin powers, since they possess warg/greenseer and warg/morghulis abilities. They seem to be on the flip-side of the same coin since Bran can't fight at all and knows so much, while Arya can sneak and kill (as Nymeria too, don't forget) but knows so little. Perhaps Jon Snow will top both of them, but that depends on whether or not he is Azor Ahai.

If I had pre-existing knowledge of all magics in the ASOIAF universe, I would first collect all of the prophecies from Maggie the Mage, Mirri Maz Durr, Quaithe, Daenerys, Melisandre, etc. as a warg/greenseer like the Bloodraven. Secrets are hard to come by, so I'd make sure that I have plenty of coin on hand to pay the Faceless Men to assassinate key advisors in places like the Small Council and replace them with my own "little birds."

Then, I would send Ravens to individuals who I can manipulate with whispers of power to show up at key moments and ensure their successes or failures based on my foresight and triple-checked/quadruple checked prophetic knowledge.

Chances are I'd probably spend centuries figuring out how the prophecies are all related and all of my manipulations would just result in getting a boy shoved out a window and making a crow say "Corn! Corn!" Because really, this is AGoT. You never want to become the main character.
