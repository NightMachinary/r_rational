  I personally found a bunch of things and situations felt like cop-outs or deus-ex-machina when they occured, and it never felt like Butcher's characters had very closely defined limits and capabilities.

Pretty much this. I've only read the first four books and every. single. fight. goes the same way: Dresden and the enemy keep casting spells or exchanging physical attacks for pages, they're all dodged, and then Dresden gets some non-life-threatening injury and pulls some solution out of nowhere to win when all seems lost.

I pretty much had to force myself to read them instead of just skipping to the next line of dialogue (which is arguably the best part of Dresden Files), because I got no entertainment or enjoyment from them whatsoever.
