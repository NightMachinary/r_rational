Yeah, it might not be the hardest rational fiction, but the big difference between it and most other fantasy, is that it's obvious the author is trying to be rational and consistent in worldbuilding and storytelling.

As a counterexample, J.K. Rowling never even tried. Potter never tried to steer the plot in a way that benefited himself, with maybe one or two exceptions in the entire series. Forming the underground fight club is the closest thing that comes to mind.
