I think I'll add personal summary of the article.

Chernobyl is about the danger of suppressing criticism, lies, and arrogance. The show creator intended to keep it front and center, but the show itself shows sensationalism from the first episode and never did it hold back. Sensationalism included: scare-mongering on radiation effects, blowing historical turns of event out of proportion (e.g: staffs being ordered to open a valve remotely changed into personally go down draining radioactive water, effectively sacrificing themselves), connecting events that has no relation to each other, creating fictitious incidents, melodrama.

No mention whether the show has of masterful acting, directing, or solid writing. Article's core is about exaggeration that crossed the line. Given that this subreddit fuss a lot about worldbuilding, especially when it has historical events woven into it, I don't think Chernobyl is a good match. It might be a good match if the show's populated by sane characters, despite over-the-top worldbuilding. But sadly, the article mentioned none about it.
