I suppose this is the episode it's referring to: [[https://www.thetrumpet.com/14007-three-men-who-saved-millions]]

It has indeed been corrected, saying the three guys didn't actually die. Guess perhaps the version where they died became a bit of a urban legend? But the show is apparently so accurate it seems weird to assume they simply made a mistake rather than purposefully romanticise the episode.
