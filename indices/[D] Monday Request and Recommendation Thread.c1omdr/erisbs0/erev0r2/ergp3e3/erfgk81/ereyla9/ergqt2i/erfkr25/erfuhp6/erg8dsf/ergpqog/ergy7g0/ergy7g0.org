What I know about self-sacrifice is when the elderly volunteering on cleaning up the area around Fukushima Japan, after earthquake-tsunami some years ago. I know very little about Chernobyl, I don't know any self-sacrifice happened around Chernobyl incident. Try ctrl+F valve on the page, that's what they stated.
