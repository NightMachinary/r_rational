I'm one third through [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/s-i-original-si.1134/reader][S.I.]] and I'm amazed that I haven't seen it recommended here until recently - this story is this sub personified.

The protagonist wakes up in a post-apocalyptic, post-Singularity future where a large portion of mankind has vanished, city-sized A.I.s dominate the landscape, and the world is mostly unmapped by the remaining human city-states. He is a self professed rationalist and his actions are consistent with his goal of not dying ever again if he can help it, find out what happened and prevent further apocalypses from occuring.

It helps that it is excellently written and that I haven't noticed a single typo so far.
