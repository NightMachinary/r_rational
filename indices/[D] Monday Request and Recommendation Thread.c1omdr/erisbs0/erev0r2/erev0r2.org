I recently finished reading the three Books of Babel series by [[https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&rlz=1C1GCEV_enUS852US852&q=Josiah+Bancroft&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEwzzciuLLcsUIJwM4yMM7LSDJK05LOTrfST8vOz9XMyS1KLEosq44tTizJTi60SS0sy8osWsfJ75RdnJmYoOCXmJRflp5UAAJeXbnpTAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjA5eaWiPHiAhXom-AKHRCdCO8QmxMoATANegQIDBAE][Josiah Bancroft]]. Senlin Ascends, Arm of the Sphinx, The Hod King.

What a fantastic series, and not anything what I expected going in. It's a rational story at heart, but the story is logically written without large plot holes in my opinion.

I'm always very cautious when giving a synopsis of books to others, because even that can be a spoiler in itself.

I encourage you to just read these books without anything going into it, and enjoy the ride.
