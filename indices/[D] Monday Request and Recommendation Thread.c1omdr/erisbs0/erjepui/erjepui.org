Are you familiar with the Dresden Files? Based solely on your liking for Natural 20, I'll recommend this - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8902388/1/A-Wizard-Named-Harry]] . It's unfinished, but it's good chaotic fun anyway.

I have no idea whether or not it will make any sense without knowledge of Dresden.
