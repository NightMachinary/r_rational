Requesting: anything with a dragon main character.

Recommending:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][El-Ahrairah]] again. Worm fanfic with a protagonist that reminds me strongly of the Harry in HPMoR and a very rational plot.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/agent-of-cauldron-worm.345669/][Agent of Cauldron]]. Another rational Worm take that deals with the worldwide goals of Cauldron and the events that are going on, following the growth of these characters and how they became who they are and /why/ they're such ruthless bastards.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]]. It's Worm but the protagonist is smarter and it's much more tightly plotted. I might even recommend this fanfic /over/ the original Worm.
