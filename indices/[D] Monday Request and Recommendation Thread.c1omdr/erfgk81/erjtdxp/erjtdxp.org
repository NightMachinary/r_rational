The main problem with Agent of Cauldron is the main character is an idiot (Like really dumb) and the PoV jumps around quite a lot, offen to chacters you don't give a shit about, detracting from the main story. It's one of those storys I liked at the start but when I got nearer to the end I regretted wasting time on it.
