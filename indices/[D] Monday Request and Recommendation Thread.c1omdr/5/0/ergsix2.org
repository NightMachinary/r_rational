I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8415898/1/God-of-the-Machine][God of the Machine]]. Like most of /The Carnivorous Muffin/'s non-crack stories, it explores some existential horror/nihilistic themes which occasionally border on the surreal. Definitely recommend it for the Mind Games and nice pacing.

*Edit:* I encourage reading despite the premise and the warning at the end of chapter 1. Use both to give you an idea of the direction of the story but otherwise the story stays true to the goal of telling a story about characters trying to out-play each other.
