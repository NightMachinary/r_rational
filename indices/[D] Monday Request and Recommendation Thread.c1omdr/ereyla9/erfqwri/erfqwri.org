I read a couple of chapters but was intending on not continuing it because it just seemed weird for the sake of being weird. The body-changing premise also really bothered me because:

- the MC seems to give no thought about where the new body came from. I would think a normal person would be worried that it would take over at some point!

- why aren't the people who transplanted him concerned about the intelligence in the body? If it came from one of the AI xities shouldn't they worried it worried it's a trap of some sort? Why would they even expend resources to transfer him? Or, if they're lying and they're the ones who made the body, why?
