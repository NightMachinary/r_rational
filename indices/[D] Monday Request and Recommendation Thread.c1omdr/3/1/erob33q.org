Cenotaph was fun, sadly the third part is incomplete and abandoned/on hiatus.

The characters are pretty in line with cannon and events that didn't happen played like you would expect, and even the parts that could turn into a who would win scenarios are handled well.

Great fanfic, that being said, it's in no way better than the original.
