I usually hate squeamish good guys as well and get really annoyed when they capture the bad guys and don't double tap. But in this case it isn't a safe the world/evil is winning etc. scenario and if she uses lethal force on any good guy she's not even doing it for the greater good, but just to safe herself. And the good guys have very good reasons to attack any keeper on sight and to not trust them.
