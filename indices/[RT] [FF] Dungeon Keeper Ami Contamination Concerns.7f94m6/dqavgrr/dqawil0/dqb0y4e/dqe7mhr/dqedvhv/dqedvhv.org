I stopped shortly after the fairies; when she risked serious harm/dying to take them down without harming them, then decides to let them go; then they go and cause her more trouble and it seemed like her only reasoning for it was they believed they were doing the right thing when they tried to kill her. Also I'm not sure the Baron or the fairies qualify as "good" iirc the baron kills soldiers under his command because he refuses to listen to reason in the spider dungeon. The fairys were willing to murder a stranger just because they sensed darkness?/taint? don't recall what exactly its been around a year since i tried to read it.
