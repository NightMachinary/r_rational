I'm not really sure what this objection is about. The only times I can think of when Ami doesn't use lethal force on her opponents are when her opponents are the good guys (e.g., the Avatar, the Dwarves, Baron Leopold, the faries, etc). She quite willingly kills rival Keepers (e.g., Zarekos, Clairmonte, Nero, Malleus, etc), and tries at every available opportunity to kill those that are still alive (e.g., Arachne).
