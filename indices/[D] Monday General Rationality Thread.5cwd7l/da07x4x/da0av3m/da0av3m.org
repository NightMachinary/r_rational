Have you heard of the game Alien Frontiers? Not to advocate plagarism, but some of its mechanics seem suited for this game.

How do you plan to publish?

As far as ending scenarios go, it would be pretty cool to have something like the scenario booklet in Betrayal at House on the Hill, where you look up the conditions at end of game in a table, and are directed to a page explaining what happened. i.e. (Military tried for a win and failed) && Obliteration && (some other random ephemera) -> "Your attempts at developing a 'smart' targeting system for a space-based missile targeting system end in failure, when your AI's objective function is stealthily rewritten by a mole in the research group with ties to a terrorist organization. The resulting satellite cannot distinguish between friendly and enemy air travel, but is smart enough to prevent itself from being remotely shut down. Travel by airplane becomes impossible for at least the next ten years. "
