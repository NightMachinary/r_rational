I think it would help with some things like integration-- pulling together components from various researchers in language understanding, vision, planning, memory, cognitive architectures, etc... that are researched separately but would need to be brought together for a working system that has all the capabilities of a human. Massive training datasets could be assembled using mechanical Turk. Researchers would have access to powerful government supercomputers. You could get a good fraction of all the AI researchers in the U.S. working on parts of the same project. But none of that would be enough to develop human-like AI unless the time is right. So I'm guessing you could speed it up by 10 years, if you picked a moment to start 20 years before it would have happened without the project.
