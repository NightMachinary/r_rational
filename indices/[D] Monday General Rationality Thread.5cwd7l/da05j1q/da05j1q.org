After the US Presidential election I resolved to escape the bubble I was in and try to see the viewpoint of the other side without bias, only to find several popular opinions expressed among them horrifying either for their blatant prejudice or willful ignorance. The only thing more horrifying was the responses to such statements from their peers ranged from support to apathy with very little dissent. So now I'm tempted to retreat back into my bubble even though I know that would be irrational and unproductive.
