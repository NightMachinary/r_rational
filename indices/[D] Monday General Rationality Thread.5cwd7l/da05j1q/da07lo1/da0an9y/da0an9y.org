Good advice in theory, but difficult to implement in practice. The only people I personally know who voted differently than me are family members I didn't like even before I found out their political beliefs. When I checked out subreddits that cater specifically to the other side, many top voted comments were espousing worldviews based on the rejection of information I consider factual.

Even those I spoke to who disagreed with the statements only expressed apathy towards them rather than righteous indignation. When I asked for insight into their logic behind their motives, they made it clear that they have the exact same view of my side as I do of their's and hold their own side in the same regard as I do of mine. Neither of us were able to convince the other of anything.
