What about all the institutional violence perpetrated by the current establishment? Record incarceration rates, dropping 20k+ bombs per year on 7 countries, arms deals with dictatorships, etc. Because those things are harder for me to tolerate than saying mean things.

Don't get me wrong, I think Trump is a disaster, and it's going to be a deviation from the status quo. But I don't pretend like the status quo is good either, it has very ugly spots that need to change if our society is going to live up to its professed values.
