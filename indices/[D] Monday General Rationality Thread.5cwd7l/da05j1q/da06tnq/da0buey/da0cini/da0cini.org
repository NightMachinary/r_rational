Maybe you should lower you standards a bit. It's okay if you don't actually start agreeing with people with different opinions.

Different opinions exist, and are held by rational-ish people with internally consistent beliefs, who are still wrong; being aware of that (actually aware, in a way that impacts your decisions) is already way above the sanity waterline.
