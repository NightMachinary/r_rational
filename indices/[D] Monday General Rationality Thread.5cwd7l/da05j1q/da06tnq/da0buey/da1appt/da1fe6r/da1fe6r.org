One guy described it as "only being allowed to practice my religion in church on Sunday". He says that he tolerates the existence of LGBT people and is fine with them getting married, but to force him to treat them equally is forbidding him to practice his religion in public and this belief didn't make him bigoted.

Even after I explained how religious practice tends to be different in urban communities from rural and how the baseline liberal morality is secular humanism as a result, he still didn't budge. He then pointed out that has known very few LGBT people or hate against them, as if it would help persuade me.
