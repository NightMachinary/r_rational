I want our community to avoid mind-killing politics, but I can't talk about this without revealing that I am a liberal who's been [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5c5utp/im_a_liberal_who_wants_to_try_and_bridge_the_gap/][talking to conservatives]]. Whatever you hear me say, please do not use it as an excuse to dehumanize your political opponents like I am tempted to.

A big one is that they have a much narrower definition of racism than I do that precludes the existence of institutional prejudice, even while believing in implicit bias. They not only dismiss accusations of bigotry against a person or group that has not committed hate crimes, but they are convinced that being accused of such is itself a form of prejudice against them.

I have spoken to people who politely explain to me their reasons, which they think are perfectly rational, for believing that white privilege does not exist in the US and reject my opposing viewpoint as either propaganda by demagogues or discrimination against them. I told them that I had been unfairly prejudiced against them and expressed interest in overcoming my biases, but they did not respond in kind.

That's just one of them. Others reject laws I see as protecting LGBT people or a woman's reproductive rights as infringing upon their freedom to practice their own religion. I spoke to people who knew I am bisexual that some businesses should be allowed to refuse service to me because of what I am, and thought that didn't count as discrimination. They said my demanding to be treated equally was discriminatory against them.

These are attitudes and beliefs that are considered acceptable in communities with opposing political views from mine, which in my communities are considered to be obviously immoral. I know that I should empathize with people who disagree with me and that will lead to the best possible outcome, but that's not what I feel like doing.
