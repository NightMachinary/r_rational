One specific comment I read, which I'm paraphrasing only slightly, was "I don't care what policies Trump implements so long as it causes liberals anguish. He could put forth a law that demanded the execution of every animal in every zoo, and I would back it 100% because of how pissed off it would make the liberals".

Now, I don't give a fuck about animals, but that was one of the most legitimately evil comments I had ever read, simply because it proposes that /hurting people who disagree/ is more important than anything else. That hurting other people is, in fact, a terminal value which sits above all others.

I'm hesitant to repeat things like that, because I think pointing out the most horrible things just furthers the toxoplasma of rage, but it's one of the reasons that I decided that venturing out of my bubble wasn't worth it. I would rather just stay in my bubble and do work as resident skeptic and/or devil's advocate, so long as I don't have to see things like that.
