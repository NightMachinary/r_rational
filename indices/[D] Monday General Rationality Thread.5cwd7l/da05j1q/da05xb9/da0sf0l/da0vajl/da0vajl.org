Honestly, when it comes to the famous "Red Tribe" and "Blue Tribe", I come from a definitively blue /location/, but I feel very, very alienated from both /tribes/. The Red Tribe come across to me as chauvinistic maniacs who want me thrown out of the country for my regional and ethnic origins. The Blue Tribe come across as hipsters who can't shut the fuck up about Twitter for long enough to raise my friends' wages to an acceptable level, and who keep coming out to city meetings to explain how they won't build affordable housing because they want us kids to fuck off and die in Montana somewhere.
