  I feel very, very alienated from both tribes.

This in my opinion is a good way to start looking beyond the bubbles

  The Red Tribe come across to me as chauvinistic maniacs who want me thrown out of the country for my regional and ethnic origins.
#+end_quote

As someone who was inculcated in the red tribe I find this view deeply disturbing, they have their many flaws and stupidities, but it makes me want to cry that this view has permeated this far and is an honest view from you, my peer, /here./ On the other hand the idea also gives me the impulse to cackle in counter-productive mocking laughter, not at you,but that this seems to be a common belief help by a lot of today's population.

To put it more constructively how could we live in the country we see if even 1/5 of the country thought that way, or even though it was okay to think that way?

Edit clarity, I hope
