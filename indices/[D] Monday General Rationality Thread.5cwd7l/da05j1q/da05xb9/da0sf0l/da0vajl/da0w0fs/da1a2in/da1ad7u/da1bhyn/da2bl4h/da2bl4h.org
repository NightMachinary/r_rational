I'm going to ask some of the same forbearance I don't know if I'm going to address your concern to your satisfaction or just seem to offer an old man's cynical bromides, but this a reply in good faith but there have been a lot of interruptions in my household tonight, so apologies if I ramble. In kind I will say the red tribe is too much in business and too little in shrinking government's action I won't say they are the all defector, but it seems that way sometimes. To put my principles clearly I'm excited to see Mars will likely be a private expedition, though I wonder if we will end up with Heinlein's Golden Rule or a Free Luna, and I'm cynical enough that I though Fiorina should have been the candidate so we could have a Woman to Woman, or Capitalist to Socialist race and either get some of the identity politics out of the way, or maybe had a referendum on a real issue.

I'm not sure of your state or ethnicity. Myself I am Jewish decent, Lutheran upbringing, service academy, followed by a decade in, went back to school after, and now successfully converted to programmer from military bureaucrat, it's a lot more fun than managing, most of the time. I've been voting in Florida since late '98 and I play the game theory choices with my vote, so Libertarian isn't an option, yet.

I think you are suffering from the same fears I've had with the Clinton's presidency and Obama's "I've got a pen. . ." Gerrymandering goes both ways over time, it's one of those evil Game theory anomalies that now is an institution, it went red's way this time, but I honestly had severe doubts where I had my money in the prediction markets, and while I'm very glad to see the results we've had I'd like any of Prof's recommendations to his constitutional convention near the end of /The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (TMIAHM)/ myself more than the republic we have, though some of theme are too democratic and I do fear mob rule, but we at least have a republic that, recent minor urban disturbances aside, frequently and safely changes regimes with [[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/11/09/man-who-predicted-nine-last-elections-including-trump-polls-stink-i-was-right_n_12885522.html][surprising regularity]]. In general though Prof's (from TMIAHM not Liechtman) recommendations are all conductive to a smaller system and I don't think we'll see as much of that as either of us want.

The system swings both ways, and it's always looks scary from the side of the minority party. The coup of swinging all three branches is sobering, and we will see if anything effective comes from it, the red tribe is better at being a minority party and sticking to it's lost small government principle by blocking action than implementing good reform when it has power.

I'm hoping, at a minimum, we finally see a line item veto but the arguments for and against that after the last 8 years of executive activism are sobering. The precedent against appointing a supreme court judge in the last year [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1SUn0zTGUQ][came from Joe Biden's speech in 1992]] but it's not all that new for [[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/26/long-supreme-court-vacancies-used-to-be-more-common/][nominations to be blocked]]. I'm personally glad this blocked another Kagen; Citizen's United and Heller are important victories for the 1st and 2nd amendment IMHO and I'm embarrassed for the court by Kagen embracing partition behaviour even more than I'm usually bothered by her minority briefs. Heck if Heller's implications ever get's fully implemented I might consider moving back to California.

As to the media's success conflating trump with Hitler or the really scary tribal racist idiots** /sigh/ try reading Scott Adam's blog, but do it the way you would a lesswrong article: look for what the assumptions are and see how the logic looks. I won't say I'll be second in line to assassinate Trump if he tries to be Hitler, the drives too far, other people will get there first, and I the tactics I taught were submarine tactics, but I know plenty of people reserving judgement. On the flip side Pence is good assassination insurance. New York Morality, as a southerner, a sailor, an occasional conservative, and probably at least a former membber of the intended audience makes me think of vice and Mammon, or the DeNiro film /The Devil's Advocate/

I think I'm overly optimistic, but I am hoping against hope for useful de-regulation to make starting businesses require less waste paper.

Personally we need both forces conservatives to return us to our principles, progressives to make things better, but often I think we've gotten to the voting themselves bread and circuses state on both sides.

- (this comment I predict will trigger tribal oriented voting)

** (I guess we have a set on each side: racism is dumb where it isn't just vile and it's usually just vile. I'll no more defend Trump for the KKK celbrating him than I'll attack Hillary for people rioting in the cities that voted for her. It gives the hecklers too much of a veto if they play smart.

I guess, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_members_in_United_States_politics][based on historic congressional KKK members]] you could infer at least some democrats support Trump <not joking>

As to allegations Steve Bennon [[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/yes-steve-bannon-asked-why-a-school-had-many-hanukkah-books.html][is anti]][[http://forward.com/news/israel/354402/how-steve-bannon-and-breitbart-news-can-be-pro-israel-and-anti-semitic-at-t/?attribution=more-articles-carousel-item-2-headline][-semetic]] I' do not give much credit to this type of allegation when it comes from a custody battle. Is there some other source beyond the acrimony between Shapiro, a wonderful public speaker IMHO, or just the same over-broad racist brush the "basket of deplorables" and Brietbart in specific (to me it seems a conservative Gawker, but I read from many news sources)

How very sad, how very hollow the indignation of those who call limiting immigration to legal immigration racism, even as both parties compete for a Hispanic voting bloc. <Sorry couldn't find a good article I want to use on this, there's been too many; I think we can both, cynically, agree that is where the two tribes leadership has been focused on the immigration count. If you can stomach her, I am told she is as infuriating across tribal lines as I find her amusing, Anne Coulter's articles this season have been excoriating to the republicans institution on the immigration issue, and generally contain extensive factual citations***> As an aside I'm really sick of people assuming someone's vote base on their race, but statistically it's a marginally good indicator, barring education and class, but I prefer people.)

***If you are willing to go that far she, also has some good articles on McCarthy that may make you raise the rent on some of your priors.
