  In general though Prof's (from TMIAHM not Liechtman) recommendations are all conductive to a smaller system and I don't think we'll see as much of that as either of us want.

Uhhh for those of us who haven't read that much Heinlein?

  I'm hoping, at a minimum, we finally see a line item veto but the arguments for and against that after the last 8 years of executive activism are sobering. The precedent against appointing a supreme court judge in the last year came from Joe Biden's speech in 1992 but it's not all that new for nominations to be blocked.
#+end_quote

Ok, so that is precedented. Ok. That evidence is removed from the pattern, mostly.

Funny thing: I don't like executive activism either. I would honestly much prefer grassroots activism that eventually hammers the legislature in submission. Generally the only time I've cheered for executive activism has been when it swoops in to make up for the total failure of the legislature to listen to shifting popular opinion, and even that's got a little danger of turning the executive into a Big Man.

What do you think are the chances that we could get a somewhat bipartisan consensus in favor of weakening the presidency this time around?

  New York Morality, as a southerner, a sailor, an occasional conservative, and probably at least a former membber of the intended audience makes me think of vice and Mammon, or the DeNiro film The Devil's Advocate

Funny, because it makes /us/ think of, well, call it proletarian solidarity.

  I think I'm overly optimistic, but I am hoping against hope for useful de-regulation to make starting businesses require less waste paper.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry but I think that's overly optimistic.

  Personally we need both forces conservatives to return us to our principles, progressives to make things better, but often I think we've gotten to the voting themselves bread and circuses state on both sides.
#+end_quote

That's strange, because I feel like we have the opposite problem: we're allowed to vote ourselves all the circuses we please (see: Twitter), but no bread at all. That is, the more material issues where legislative action is more meaningful (minimum wage, health-care, education, infrastructure, where army bases go, procurement, corruption, etc.) are precisely the ones where legislative /action/ seems to be almost banned.

  I' do not give much credit to this type of allegation when it comes from a custody battle. Is there some other source beyond the acrimony between Shapiro, a wonderful public speaker IMHO, or just the same over-broad racist brush the "basket of deplorables" and Brietbart in specific (to me it seems a conservative Gawker, but I read from many news sources)
#+end_quote

I don't read Gawker, so it's not like I've got /that/ much standard for comparison, but isn't Gawker known to be well, /completely batshit insane/?

  How very sad, how very hollow the indignation of those who call limiting immigration to legal immigration racism, even as both parties compete for a Hispanic voting bloc.
#+end_quote

I think this needs some corrections. The Republican Party competes for the Hispanic bloc. The Democratic Party simply assumes it, often to their own detriment.

But also, we both know that this isn't really about "legal immigration", because there isn't quite such an actual thing in America. Sorry, but if the process is so complicated that the immigrant themselves has to retain a bunch of lawyers inside the USA to navigate the process for pay, /and can often be defrauded and then thrown out of the country after years of living here peacefully/ (happened to a friend of a friend), if police can stop people and demand to see "proof" of citizenship but the state refuses to supply a universal national ID, then the /point/ of that process, in effect, is to create holes people can be punished for falling into.

  As an aside I'm really sick of people assuming someone's vote base on their race, but statistically it's a marginally good indicator, barring education and class, but I prefer people.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's pretty fucking irritating and the Democrats need to drop that shit and become a left-wing party of the working class.

  ***If you are willing to go that far she, also has some good articles on McCarthy that may make you raise the rent on some of your priors.
#+end_quote

As amusing as you apparently find her trolling, I did not appreciate her implication that I ought be stripped of my right to vote to ensure a Trump victory. My grandfather was an immigrant, you see, so I don't pass her four generations test for voting.
