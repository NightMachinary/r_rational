  Does it make sense if you imagine yourself as living in a self-sufficient bio-dome?
#+end_quote

No domes, they were more practical, caves. More importantly the idea of less laws and less government, being alien. . . /sigh/ PM me a non-audible using email and I can send you an [[http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/Reagan-in-His-Own-Voice-Audiobook/B002VA36LW/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1479440312&sr=1-1][audible book]] that include a speech about this, that predates us both. I have it in other formats, but if you're interested it's worth one of my credits. To use another quote from the same book to try and sum up the frustration with governmental busybodies that might speak more clearly to you:

  Must be a yearning deep in human heart to stop other people from doing as they please. Rules, laws --- always for other fellow. A murky part of us, something we had before we came down out of trees, and failed to shuck when we stood up. Because /not one/ of those people said: Please pass this so that I won't be able to do something I know I should stop. Nyet, tovarishchee, was always something they hated to see neighbors doing. Stop them for their own good. TANSTAAFL.

Though if you rather have a copy of the moon is a harsh mistress and can stand some 60ish free love/sexism and anthropomorphic AIs message me with an email address you haven't used on audible. It's one of those good stories about ways a society could be turn out based on initial conditions, well that and orbital mechanics.

  Like, I've lived in a country with a conscript army, and I felt safer there than I do here.

While state service is compulsory I don't know if it is fair to call Israel's army a conscript army. But thank you I'd forgot to consider them on my own potential bug out considerations.

A far better communicator than I has answered your concerns wether or not trump is a racist: [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][Slate Star Codex : You are still crying wolf]] read it: this will allay, at least, your fears in that direction, and the author does consider trump a bad thing, just very clearly not a racist one.

EDIT: for those wondering why I so often quote Heinlein here is a list of [[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein][notable quotes]]. He's one of the big three: "Doc" Smith gave us idealized heroism, Issac Asimov gave us maps of the future Heinlein tells us about the human condition, though I am biased: he's a fellow alumn' and I found him later in life when I started discriminating between mind-candy fluff and substance.
