I don't know. Clearly there's a point when you must admit that turning the other cheek isn't going to work, and that your enemy is dangerous and should be treated as an evil threat. I don't know where that point is, and I just... want it to be as far away as it can.

I don't know. Sometimes people are hateful, they're bullies and thugs and they hurt people no matter how kind and sensible you are to them. I don't know how often that is, and I don't know how effective being reasonable really is. But what the fuck. Being angry and aggressive and brutal can't be better; people don't become less racist, less hateful or less thuggish when you shout insults at them. Maybe shouting insults at them, and generally tit-for-tat-defecting against them really is better, because it makes you win signalling games and makes their opinions unpopular; if think it's not, but it's way too fundamental a question for me to address it with more than my subjective experience and my gut feelings.

Scott Alexander makes a much better argumentation of being nice to assholes than me in "In Favour of niceness, community and civilization", and I agree with all his points... yet I don't know if they're really valid, and not just wishful thinking and rationalizations of my inner bias. In the end, clever argumentations aside, I just have this deep belief: fuck defecting.
