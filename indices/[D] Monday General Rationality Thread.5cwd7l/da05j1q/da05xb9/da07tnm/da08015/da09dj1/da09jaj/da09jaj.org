Of course most everything has /a/ good point to it if you drill down far enough, but policies as a whole can very well be evil.

Consider a game like Stellaris: You can settle planets in that game and sometimes there are natives on them. You may choose to purge those natives from the planet, and yes that might be objectively better for your people, but it's still an evil action to take, and other nations in it regard you as such for engaging in it.

This is not intended to be a direct comparison to any policies, merely hyperbole for the sake of making my point.
