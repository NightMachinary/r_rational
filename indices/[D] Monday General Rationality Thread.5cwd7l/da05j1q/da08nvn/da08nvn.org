I think you've made the common mistake we all make of attributing the opinions of the few to the opinions of the many.

For example, and with regard to our recent election, a lot of people from the democratic hugbox are claiming that, with Trump's victory, we've some legitimized a bunch of -isms, and some are even going so insanely far as to phrase as it as though a huge chunk of the country have peeled off face masks, put on their Grand Wizard costume, and spontaneously gathered in the town square with pitchfork, torch, and "burn the niggers, jews, and fags" signs, like some sort of twisted hate-musical number.

Obviously, this hasn't happened. Hell, many people are rioting and protesting in states that voted very far left, which makes it hard for those individuals to claim to be on the moral high ground.

But, if you stop and actually think, you'll realize that most people aren't "burn that thar nigger fag, pa". They don't wake up and say "God damnit, I hate people whose skin color is different from mine". Instead, they have a way of life they've grown used to, and tend to be wary of anything that represents a change to it.

This is normal. This is evolutionarily beneficial, since in the ancestral environment a change to one's way of life could very well represent death for the individual or the tribe.

This is why you get so many anecdotes from non-WASPs who hear something like "Those damn negros burned down some stores in [City]. They just aren't like you, (black) Mike. No offense, man." The known quantity, black Mike, is safe and familiar. The unknown quantity, the black Mike over in (city) who is part of a protest/riot, is an unknown quantity, and is quickly demonized for being different, other, and apparently dangerous.

The solution to this should seem obvious, but to many people it isn't. The way to fix Jethro's wariness and dismissal or black Mike in (city) is education, not name calling, dismissal, and demonization.

Yet, that's what we get. The country has become so partisan that, rather then reach out to people who wanted to vote for (candidate you don't support), we instead demonized and insulted them.

So, you may go online, and see some idiot has posted "Now that Trump is president, we can purge the gays!".

That person is both wrong, and an asshole. Firstly, we elected Trump President, not God Emperor for Life. Secondly, I woud wager that not that many people voted for Trump on a platform of -isms and -phobias. I would wager that many people voted for him DESPITE an apparent platform of -isms and -phobias, because the other option was Clinton, a politican who exemplifies the current status quo. A status quo that most were strongly dissatisfied with.

A Trump presidency is a stick in the eye of the current established powers. It's something new. A terrifying new, with a madman at the reigns, but it's definitely shaken up the existing power structure.

What we need now isn't demonization and partisanship. What we need now is to come together as a nation, and keep Trump the fuck in check with the checks and balances that our government is set up to have. We've stuck the stick into the powers-that-be's eye. Now we need to keep the body upright as we fix the brain and excise the cancers.
