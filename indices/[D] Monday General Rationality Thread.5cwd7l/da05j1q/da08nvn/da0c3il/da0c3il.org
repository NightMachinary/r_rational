Just as it's too early to say that Trump is going to execute all the gays (or whatever), it's also too early to say that Trump has shaken up the existing power structure. I said months before the election that Trump would select cronies and standard-issue Republicans, and that they would probably be the ones running things. I stand by that prediction, especially having seen Trump's opening moves (like appointing the head of the RNC as his chief of staff and Mike Pence as vice president).

And if that's the case, then I don't think now is the time for coming together as a nation, because we'd be coming together behind policies that liberals have been against for decades, which, as mostly a liberal, I'm not going to do. And those same Republican policies are not at all amenable to checks and balances, not when Republicans control the Senate, the House, the executive, and soon the Supreme Court.
