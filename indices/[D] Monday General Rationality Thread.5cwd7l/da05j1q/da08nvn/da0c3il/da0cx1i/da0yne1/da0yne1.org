I'm upvoting you because I think whoever downvoted you did so unfairly, but I think your comment, much as I agree with the spirit of it, is also unfair. He didn't stand upon a rock of "refuse to listen to the Red Tribe because they're Red," he specficaly said it's because he knows who these particular Red Tribe members are, what they represent, and why he opposes them.
