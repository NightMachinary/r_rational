We don't need to come together behind Trump, I don't think. I personally think Trump is a loon, a monkey in the reactor room.

I think we need to come together as a nation and a people, and continue to shake the tree of government until we shake as much curroption out as we can.

Most people are not, inherently, good or bad people. Most people simply want to live a comfortable life, and with a informed self-interest want their neighbors to live a comfortable life, because they understand that a fire in your neighbor's house can very quickly become a fire in your house.

Trump is likely going to do some stupid shit. We, as a nation, need to stand together and prevent it. He wants a wall? We vote no wall. He wants creationism taught in public schools? We vote no creationism. He wants to disband the EPA? We vote go take a long walk off a short pier into shark infested waters no.

The politician class will always be composed mostly of the worst of us. The system is set up in such a way as that to seize power, one benefits much more from heartless, sociopathic actions then one does from kind, altruistic actions. As such, the system naturally selects the worst among us to rise to the highest positions. We, as the people these government officials are supposed to serve, are not limited by that. We can, and should, push for understanding, education, and altruism. If not for every man on Earth, then at least for our fellow man on this continent.

I have to say, I am a bit disappointed to see tribalism in your refutation. You're not saying "Trump will appoint cronies who share his lunacy and sociopathic desire for power", you're saying "I, as a blue left tribe member, refuse to listen to anything that a red right tribe government says". There is no reason to do so. Democrat, Republican, Liberal, Conservative, whatever your damned color, you're at heart still human. People are global warming deniers not because they are somehow beneath us in intelligence, but because of faulty education. People are not anti-gay, racist, misogynist, misandrist, or any other -ism or -phobia because of some inherent factor that makes them irredeemably evil; they simply have a faulty education and a disinclination to question and empathize.

The solution is not divisive "us vs them" tribal mindsets, but "us together" education and empathy.
