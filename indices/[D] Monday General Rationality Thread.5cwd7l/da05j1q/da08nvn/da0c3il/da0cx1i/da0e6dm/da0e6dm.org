That's what I believed and still want to, but then [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5c5utp/im_a_liberal_who_wants_to_try_and_bridge_the_gap/][I spoke to them]] and they expressed far more disagreements with me than who to vote for. They were almost all respectful to me as a person, but very few of them respected my beliefs and I felt the exact same way towards them. Even knowing that we both have reasons that seem rational from our perspective didn't make either of us more capable of coming together.
