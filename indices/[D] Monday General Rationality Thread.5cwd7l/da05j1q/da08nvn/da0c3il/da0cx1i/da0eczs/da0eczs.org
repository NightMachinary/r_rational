  We, as a nation, need to stand together and prevent it. He wants a wall? We vote no wall. He wants creationism taught in public schools? We vote no creationism. He wants to disband the EPA? We vote go take a long walk off a short pier into shark infested waters no.

How are we going to come together and vote against a wall when half the nation very enthusiastically wants a wall? Moreover, how are we going to do that immediately following an election? I've been arguing against a wall since the Secure Fence Act on the basis that it's an expensive solution that doesn't fix the problem, I've voted against a wall to the extent that I was able to, I've written letters to my congresscritters about the wall, I've supported congresscritters who were against a wall ... and here we are, with a President whose rallying cry was "Build that wall!", so I don't know what else was expected of me, given that this ridiculous security theater has been going on for something like ten years now.

  I have to say, I am a bit disappointed to see tribalism in your refutation. You're not saying "Trump will appoint cronies who share his lunacy and sociopathic desire for power", you're saying "I, as a blue left tribe member, refuse to listen to anything that a red right tribe government says".

I am not saying that at all. I am saying that I /have already listened to the people Trump is going to select/. I already know Chris Christie's policy positions. I know Giuliani's. I've read speeches, I've watched debates, and then I rejected them on the grounds that most of what they say is simply not good policy - not policy that I feel is grounded in reality, or policy which is grounded in reality but which I feel prioritizes the wrong things. I'm perfectly willing to listen to the red tribe, but what I hear from the red tribe is a bunch of stuff that I disagree with ... which is why I'm in the blue tribe in the first place (which has its own stupid ideas I spend half my time arguing against).
