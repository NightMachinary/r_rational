  Have you heard of the game Alien Frontiers? Not to advocate plagarism, but some of its mechanics seem suited for this game.

I'll check it out, thanks!

  How do you plan to publish?
#+end_quote

Not thinking that far ahead yet, or I'll stall creatively. My talents lie in writing and design, so for now I'm just enjoying myself putting the ideas in my head down (and the numbers onto spreadsheets). If it gets to the point where I actually finish it, maybe I'll see if there's interest in getting it published too.

(I've already designed one fully complete game, with a prototype and playtests and everything, but I lost motivation when I tried to look for an artist that wouldn't break the bank and faced the monumental marketing task of a kickstarter (which realistically needs an artist to have a good chance of getting funded).)

  As far as ending scenarios go, it would be pretty cool to have something like the scenario booklet in Betrayal at House on the Hill, where you look up the conditions at end of game in a table, and are directed to a page explaining what happened.

Yeah, I mentioned in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55o2ah/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d8cethq/][previous post]] that it'll have a flowchart or something similar to describe bad outcomes, but I like the idea of making it tied to the type of organization you are too. I'm just wondering if having specific outcomes for your win condition can help people be more or less likely to form alliances or oppose one-another, rather than make it a clear free-for-all.
