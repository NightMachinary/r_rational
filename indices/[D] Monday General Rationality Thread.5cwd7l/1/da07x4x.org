Hey all, back again for an update on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5bmlsq/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d9pxhja/][my Singularity game.]]

I've made a rough sketch of the factions, and here's what I have so far:

*Military Research Team*

The Military's starting funding is the highest, at $10(billion). Their goal is a Sovereign AGI, which has the highest starting Risk of 99%.

Their Passive Ability is that they get double the reward for researching technology with the "Military Applications" tag. This reflects their country's willingness to dish out more money for ancillary benefits related to their field.

Their Active Ability is that they may cancel Sabotage cards by spending money equal to their cost. This reflects their ability to use other real world assets to keep their project and personnel safe.

*Humanist Research Team*

Starting funds are fairly low, at $4, and their goal is an Oracle AGI, which has the lowest starting Risk of 85%

Their Passive Ability is that they win ties on bids when recruiting Researchers. Generally this reflects that people are more likely to want to work for them, so all else being equal, they're more likely to get good talent.

Their Active Ability is that, upon making a trade of completed Research with other players, they can choose to stop either side from drawing a Sabotage card (which normally happens if two players make a trade of research or technology).

*Private Research Team*

Starting funds are fairly high, at $8, and their goal is a Genie, at the moderate starting Risk of 92%.

Their Passive Ability grants them twice as much money from new Technology Research rewards, reflecting their better ability to leverage the advanced technology commercially.

Their Active Ability lets them use an Action token to keep a temporary researcher on staff an extra turn (they still have to pay their minimum bid each turn). Since researchers always provide at least one extra Action token, but can also have other bonuses, this can be a helpful way of extending benefits during a crucial period.

*Revolutionary Research Team*

Was going to call this the "Terrorist Research Team," back when Win Scenarios were fixed, but changed it to Revolutionary now that they're decoupled. Starting funds are the lowest, at $2, and their goal is a Genie AGI, at 92%.

Their Passive Ability lets them continue to use Action Tokens after passing in a round. Normally once you pass you continue to get skipped for the rest of that round until everyone has passed and the next round begins.

Their Active Ability lets them spend an Action to take the top Sabotage card from the discard pile. Usually you get Sabotage cards by spending funds, and what you get is random: this gives them a cheaper alternative with some limited control.

So those are the 4 factions I have in mind right now. The Win Scenarios used to be fixed to them, but now I'm thinking they'll be assigned randomly, or maybe people just get to pick between:

Domination - You Win

Transcendence - Everyone Wins

Obliteration - Everyone Loses

Not quite sure how that each play out yet. Will probably have to get to the playtesting phase to figure it out, but any feedback is welcome!
