Sometimes I feel like being too attached to your current epistemic state is the worst thing ever, but other times I think it's practical. I mean, as a human right now, work is a part of my utility function. I don't just do things because I want the end reward; effort is not anti-utility. But we also make things more efficient so that we have more time to expend on things that require less effort. I don't really envision a wire-heading scenario as the best thing ever, but doesn't that seem like the direction we're headed in?

  And my first thought was: if your job can be done more cheaply without you, and the only reason you have it is because people would feel sorry for you if you didn't, so the government forces your company to keep you on -- well then, it's not a job. It's a welfare program that requires you to work 9 to 5 before seeing your welfare check.

I don't see how welfare programs (ie. basic income) factor into the existence of art and music. I get that, in the ancestral environment, we were much more at home with hobbies like that than working 9-5, but I don't know why we can't find the art in working. It certainly isn't a desire to be exposed to complicated and interesting problems, because there are plenty of productive jobs that do that!

It seems kind of strange to say that humans like a /certain fixed/ amount of complexity. (I'm using complexity in the sense of the distance N between the action and the reward) Like, too much complexity and the utility calculation ends up being negative, but we find the state of "eternal wireheaded bliss" to be /too simple/ and /too rewarding/. Where's the cutoff line?
