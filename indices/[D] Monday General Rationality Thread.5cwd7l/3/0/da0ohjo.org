I don't think that hypothetical major research program changes much; the researchers just fail or do what they wanted to do anyway. In the short term it would drive up the price of private AI research, and in the long term it would lead to increased entry in the field because of increased prestige and salary. The government also cannot legally pay salaries high enough to compete on salary for even the median DL researcher.

I could be very very wrong.
