I think it's a fairly big step from specialised AI to a general AI. A key intermediate step, at least by my limited understanding of the problem, is creating an algorithm that can learn to solve general problems without requiring manual tweaking of hyperparameters.

So, for example, we have AIs that can outperform humans at Go and Chess, but it's not the same AI doing both. It's not impossible to create an AI that context switches between specialised networks, but that's not the same thing as an AGI (unless it's training the specialised networks and overseer itself).

The other issue is that we currently train some of our AIs with manually compiled data. It's a very different beast to actually have one scrape its own data from the wild.

That said, I believe that within 25 years there won't be any specific task that humans outperform AIs on, provided there's a metric for judging that (so art, writing, etc. would need a quality function first) and that it's not just because it's obscure.
