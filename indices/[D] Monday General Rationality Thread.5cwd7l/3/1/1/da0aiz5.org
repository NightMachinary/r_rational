I agree because narrow AIs are now out performing people on tasks like [[https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/the-face-recognition-algorithm-that-finally-outperforms-humans-2c567adbf7fc#.n1slbjclp][face recognition]] which is a task that we have explicitly evolved specialized neural circuits for.

Sorry I can't provide an actual paper instead of a news article, I couldn't find a paper on the algorithm.
