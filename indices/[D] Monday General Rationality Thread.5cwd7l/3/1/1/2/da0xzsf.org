Hell, I have prosopagnosia so I'm quite used to being outperformed by computers at this task.

Aside (obfuscated to minimise spoilers): I remember last week I was watching an episode of /Dr Who/ where the Nth doctor has a faux-flashback to him doing some heroic deed in the past. I thought to myself, "of COURSE it's the Nth doctor who is in this flashback, never mind he has N-1 other forms he could have been in for this!". Much to my surprise two scenes later it turns out that the Nth doctor was remembering himself as the N-1th doctor doing that deed, as is demonstrated when something timey-wimey occurs and they are both in the same place at the same time. "OHHHHHH. They are different actors!" I say to myself, surprised by the totally-unsurprising-reveal.

And their respective actors [[#s][(]]) aren't exactly twins. And each new Doctor /gets an entirely new outfit/.

Oh, and I'm only /borderline/ faceblind (3rd percentile). I weep for my lesser brothers and sisters.
