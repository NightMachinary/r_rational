I'd recommend you just try again, harder. If your social circle is made mostly of people with the same political ideas as you, finding people with compelling opposite ideas is going to be hard.

I'm not sure what you tried, but I'd recommend you avoid dealing with groups that identify as supporters of whatever position you're trying to understand. They're likely to wear their beliefs as a mantle, and if it comes down to a choice between being objective and self-critical, or showing their loyalty to the group, they're more likely to do the latter.

I recommend looking for people in your extended social circle (colleagues, people who practice the same sports as you, etc); people who you're familiar with, but don't necessarily associate with you because of their similar tastes / outlook / social origins. Ideally, avoid public confrontations; actually, avoid confrontations as hard as you can: the closest a debate is to the "who is going to sound the most convincing?" format, the least you'll get out of it.

Also, um, kudos for going in the right direction and all that :)
