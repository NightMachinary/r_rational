From the perspective of a gray who has been closely watching the red tribe bubble for a solid 8 years now, that line comes across as schadenfreude that expects to be taken as signalling/hyperbolic. There is a train of thought that exists in the red/gray tribe that believes that nothing short of "a taste of their own medicine" will remind the blue tribe of the folly, of, say, weaponizing federal bureaucracies as tools of political oppression, or using bucketfuls of lies to push counterproductive policies that serve no purpose beyond attacking and harassing the other side (i.e. the gun control movement). The blue tribe has shown very few scruples in regards to defecting while in power, so the red tribe is only shooting itself in the foot by, say, protecting the filibuster that blues were so recently willing to delete. And frankly, I see more reds cautioning their own tribe on the folly of /that/, than I saw blues arguing for civilized restraint when they thought they were in for 40 years of one party rule.

I see that line, and I can see how it comes off as evil in a vacuum. But the most legitimately evil comments /I've/ read /in the last three days/ were calls for the rape and murder of all Trump supporters /and their families/, because that's just the appropriate thing for Red Army fanatics to do to Nazis.
