  I doubt the world where the implementation of such thoughts on property will be a feasible and civilized in less than a Type 1 civilization

I have similar doubts about your view on property. No single moral principle /can/ be maximized to the exclusion of all other moral principles without a post-scarcity civilization, and even then it would be morally perverse to do it.

  How would a socialist society be constructed so that the same people you complained about in american politics do not gain power over the system of distribution?
#+end_quote

Come on, unpack this statement. "How would a mostly egalitarian, top-to-bottom democratic society in which ownership of materials is defined solely by personal usage be constructed so that a shrinking minority of identity chauvinists obsessed with constructing hierarchies with themselves on the top don't gain control over the system of distribution?"

And it answers itself: the principles behind socialism and anarchism are not about "redistribution" in the social-democratic sense at all, but about /pre/-distribution. So the shrinking minority of identity-chauvinistic hierarchs would actually have to /fight/ the overwhelming majority of society.

Whereas in this reality, they basically played a narrow set of procedural games, won on a narrow set of procedural technicalities, and now get to walk around in fancy suits pretending that everyone loves them and supports them, while actually devolving society further into a corrupt orgy of death-worship.
