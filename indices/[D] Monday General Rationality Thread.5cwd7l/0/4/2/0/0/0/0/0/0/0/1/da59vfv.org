Apologies I forgot to respond to this. I think, in basic we think similarly, but have dis-similar levels of respect for the law. I'd add an old man rant about how every un-enforceable laws adds to the contempt of the law and distance between the ethics and the law which contributes to the divisiveness in your later post, but I'm tired and I'm hoping you already know that:

  But also, we both know that this isn't really about "legal immigration", because there isn't quite such an actual thing in America.

I very strongly disagree. I say this in that, half of my programming team-mates are or were green card holders (not to mention immigrant spouses): 3/5 or 2/4 with recent downsizing (one of the citizen's wife voted for the first time this year).

We do, however agree, after your hyperbole, the system is entirely too complicated as demonstrated by an Indianan co-worker of mine tele-working for a lot of this summer (not sure if it was ~60 or ~90 days), because he had to go back and then get a new visa, I personally might have given up at that point, but thankfully he's back and I'm able to give him advice on buying his first car in the states. I think all three of them will become citizens.
