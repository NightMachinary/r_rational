Great. And like I said: in this case, I'd like to live in the world where I'm falsely pattern-matching and there's no actual danger. I just have to hear the alternative explanations enumerated and see how they're simpler than this explanation, for the same apparent facts, to actually update in that direction.

And for the record, yes, a permanent majority for the Blue Party is bad too. It's just a lot less /possible/ given the current (and collapsing) party system.
