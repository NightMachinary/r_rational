Please don't take the following harshly. I mean absolutely no personal offense towards you. Keep in mind as you read the following that I'm a socialist who voted for the Green Party and who basically considers the core of the Blue Tribe to be roughly equivalent to Charles Stross' Vile Offspring.

Thing is, the Blue Tribe disturb me and creep me out in many ways, but the Red Tribe seem to outright want to destroy me.

  To put it more constructively how could we live in the country we see if even 1/5 of the country thought that way, or even though it was okay to think that way?

Tell your tribe to stop trying to disenfranchise me, and to please protect basic civil liberties, human rights, and the ecological soundness (ie: suitability for human habitation) of our land and water.

Those are my long-term, big-deal issues that go outside the normal flow of electoral or tribal bickering: can the world support the society I live in, am I in danger in the society I live in, am I a full and equal citizen of the society I live in.

[[http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2016/11/we-are-in-it-all-right-but-figuratively.html][Here's a guy from your tribe voicing most of my major concerns.]]

If you guys win an election, that's mostly fine. Things happen. I hated fucking Clinton, and voted for the Green Party. I only encouraged friends and family in swing states to vote Clinton to stop Trump, because I consider him, well, an out-and-out fascist. If he's not a fascist, he's cultivated a fascist constituency and enjoys bathing in their love so much that he's going to govern like a fascist. [[http://nypost.com/2016/11/11/kkk-celebrating-trumps-election-with-victory-parade/][He's got the KKK marching in the streets celebrating him.]] Do you get how that looks to a Jew? [[http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-04-08/does-ted-cruzs-new-york-values-comment-convey-anti-semitism][And yes, the "New York values" thing /did/ sound anti-Jewish.]] As well as just plain anti-New-York, which doesn't play well with me since I was kinda born there.

But my problem is: the party of your tribe consider themselves the /only/ legitimate political force, and at every opportunity has tilted the rules to ensure that we are stripped of representation.

Before you jump down my throat, consider the following:

- The 2010 redistricting gerrymandered a lot of seats in the House for Republicans.
- The result of the above was that in [[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/][2012]], the Democrats got more votes but the Republicans got more seats. We'll be coming back to this theme.
- The result of the above was that in [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/senate-democrats-got-20-million-more-votes-than-senate-republicans-which-means-basically-nothing/][2014, the Democrats got more votes but the Republicans got more seats.]] This was mostly due to the way small states and small-time elections work, as the analysis linked points out, but that's cold comfort for those of us who don't /really, deeply love/ political procedure.
- The Senate is structured to ensure small-state rural votes are overrepresented relative to large-state urban votes. Note that this means small-state urban votes, such as mine, are double-screwed: we don't have the House seats or Presidential electors of California, Texas, or New York, but we're not rural /enough/ to really get any force multiplier in the Senate.
- Even the name of our state is used as a kind of politician's slang for an unimportant, irrelevant state nobody should listen to.
- The upshot of the Electoral College system has, /twice in the last five elections/, been to hand the Presidency to the Republican who won a strict minority of the votes over the Democrat who won the plurality.
- Likewise, the "more votes, fewer seats" effect in Congress from 2014 has repeated itself in 2016, and will continue to do so until a Census and redistricting.
- [[http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/newt-gingrich-house-un-american-activities-committee/index.html][Gingrich may have /said/ his neo-McCarthyism]] will be directed only at Islamofascists, but that's very difficult to /believe/ when the /original/ McCarthyism was chiefly intended to force everyone in both the Republican and Democratic Parties rightward on penalty of being called a Communist.
- And [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination][let's mention]] how the Senate Republican majority said they would refuse to fill a seat on the Supreme Court, not because the nominee was really bad, but because it was a Democrat doing the nominating.
- [[http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/whats-the-opposite-of-court-packing/506081/][This was then coupled to the same Senate Republicans saying they would not allow a President Clinton to fill the Supreme Court seat /either./]]
- [[https://www.propublica.org/article/under-obama-more-appointments-go-unfilled][And various federal agencies]] and [[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/obama-courts-judicial-legacy-226741][courts]] now have numerous positions unfilled /because/ the Republican Party has been sandbagging those, even for stupid things like /public printer/ (yes, that's an actual office), until they can fill those seats themselves.

Most of these things, taken in isolation, would not be so alarming. But each of these things /is not the only one/, it's part of a larger pattern. What it all adds up to, in my eyes, that actually hurts, is this: your tribe's party is trying to convert the USA into a one-party state, and where we have more voters in the "blue tribe" or in "purple states", they simply dismantle majoritarian democracy and the normal functioning of bureaucracy so as to permanently entrench themselves.

It is very, very alarming to me that in order to win elections, the Democrats need landslides, but where Republicans get /even slight/ numerical edges, they end up utterly dominant in actual seats held. It is very, very alarming that when Republicans win elections, they quickly work to staff bureaucracies and courts with their own people, while when Democrats win elections (again, /with more of a numerical edge/), Republicans roadblock the entire process until they can win again.

Again, the pattern seems to be a creeping one-party state in which "Republican or nothing" is the motto.

Maybe you can tear apart my view of the facts here and teach me a whole lot about why nothing is actually that bad. I invite the reassurance. I also don't trust the reassurance, not least because Democrats under Barack Obama gave basically no indication that they even oppose this process in any vigorous way. As far as I can tell, the "Blue Tribe" and the "Blue Party" who represent them /also/ believe in one-party Red Tribe/Republican government.

At least, they [[https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/11/explaining-it-all][believe in the weedy details of political procedure]] more than they believe that their own constituents deserve equal representation, so when something happens along the lines of "Democrats get more votes, Republicans get more seats, for Complicated Procedural Reasons", they stick by the Complicated Procedural Reasons at the expense of their own constituents. When /Republicans/ win more votes, either by Complicated Procedural Reasons or by the simple means of having more supporters, /nothing/ is done to get Democrats disproportionate power for Complicated Procedural Reasons.

I realize that the federal system was original put in place to ensure that small or low-population states received fair representation. I realize. I /live/ in a small, low-population state: we've got fewer people living in this whole state than in New York City alone, or in Israel as a whole (other places I've lived). However, as my tribal peers in, say, Oregon or Washington could point out: right now, the federal system is not enfranchising /us/. It is extra-enfranchising /red/ states, correlated with smallness, /at the expense/ of blue states, correlated with largeness.

It is /logically possible/ to have a fair and egalitarian federal system. This just isn't it. This is a system that, in my lifetime and as far as I can tell, is designed to make sure Republicans govern, no matter what. The ideology driving this seems to be Red Tribe ethnonationalism, which unfortunately comes with a desire to eliminate the political influence of the Blue Tribe and its constituents as alien influences to a "rightfully Red" country, again completely discounting how many Red people there actually are versus Blue people.
