  More importantly the idea of less laws and less government, being alien. . .sigh If you message me off here I can send you an audible book that include a speech about this that predates us both.

  If I were asked to answer the following question: What is slavery? and I should answer in one word, It is murder!, my meaning would be understood at once. No extended argument would be required to show that the power to remove a man's mind, will, and personality, is the power of life and death, and that it makes a man a slave. It is murder. Why, then, to this other question: What is property? may I not likewise answer, It is robbery!, without the certainty of being misunderstood; the second proposition being no other than a transformation of the first?

  While state service is compulsory I don't know if it is fair to call Israel's army a conscript army. But thank you I'd forgot to consider them on my own potential bug out considerations.

It's a weaksauce, unconvincing article that keeps trying to take Trump "literally but not seriously" while ignoring basically all the horrible shit printed on Breitbart. Trump himself doesn't have to be a /particularly/ racist human being to be head of the most monstrous fascist movement in decades.
