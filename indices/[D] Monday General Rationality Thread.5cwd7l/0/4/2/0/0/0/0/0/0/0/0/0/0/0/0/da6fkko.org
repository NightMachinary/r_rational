  If I were asked to answer the following question: What is slavery? and I should answer in one word, It is murder!, my meaning would be understood at once. No extended argument would be required to show that the power to remove a man's mind, will, and personality, is the power of life and death, and that it makes a man a slave. It is murder. Why, then, to this other question: What is property? may I not likewise answer, It is robbery!, without the certainty of being misunderstood; the second proposition being no other than a transformation of the first?

I doubt the world where the implementation of such thoughts on property will be a feasible and civilized in less than a Type 1 civilization; rather attempts will probably be descents into France's terror, Stalin's purges, or Cambodia's oligarchy depending on the structure of the organizing body. How would a socialist society be constructed so that the same people you complained about in american politics do not gain power over the system of distribution?

What short of force would compel me to work harder when there is no payoff for it?
