  I think, in basic we think similarly, but have dis-similar levels of respect for the law. I'd add an old man rant about how every un-enforceable laws adds to the contempt of the law and distance between the ethics and the law which contributes to the divisiveness in your later post, but I'm tired and I'm hoping you already know that

I'm really not sure we have different levels of respect for the law. I have very little actual respect for laws. I mostly only respect moral outcomes. I only consider laws valuable for their expected utility in terms of outcomes.

  I very strongly disagree. I say this in that, half of my programming team-mates are or were green card holders (not to mention immigrant spouses): 3/5 or 2/4 with recent downsizing (one of the citizen's wife voted for the first time this year).

I mean, that's great, but our immigration system is also a Byzantine mess meant to ensure that people with deep-pocketed sponsors get through while everyone else ends up going back to their home-country. And that's before we talk about the "illegal immigration" issue, in which employers basically ship people in en masse, on a regular basis, and we all look the other way /until such time as the employers want to be rid of their workers/, at which point we suddenly decide to enforce our borders with deportations.
