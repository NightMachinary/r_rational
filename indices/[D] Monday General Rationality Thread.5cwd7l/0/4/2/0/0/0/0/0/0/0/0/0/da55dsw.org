Ok, sorry, but the whole thing comes across as... counterfactual? Alien? It comes across as a politics or a morality for people who really live in a completely different sort of world than the one I live in. Does it make sense if you imagine yourself as living in a self-sufficient bio-dome? It also seems really obviously ripped-off from early American history, in which, well, people thought of themselves as living in self-sufficient bio-domes that /just happened/ to have been sitting around unclaimed /if you ignored the ongoing genocide/.

Like, I've lived in a country with a conscript army, and I felt safer there than I do here. There, you see, there was some sense of social solidarity, and people were craving more. People here seem to want to rip society apart and literally live every man for himself, or worse, recently they seem to want to rip society apart and murder everyone who's different from them.

There's too much hate here and too much liking for death. I'm trying to have plans to leave if I need to, but even so, I'm told the poison is global at this point and needs to be resisted before it reaches everywhere.
