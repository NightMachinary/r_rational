People are not rational in any conversational sense! Yes, when someone says that masses of people must be exploited, or enslaved, or must /die/, because goodness can only exist in the world when the correct kinds of social domination are implemented, and when they dismiss all evidence to the contrary as lies, they are reasoning irrationally and acting evilly.

The sun still rises, even after the Aztec Empire fell and hearts were no longer cut out for the sun god. Germany did not return to prosperity by killing Jews, only create a rolling disaster.

I expect similar measures in the future to have similar results. Political regimes of blood sacrifice to made-up gods of social hierarchy never, ever work.
