I agree that it's possible in a "you will encounter such people in your life" way, but I don't think you should actually expect it, or even /treat it as a possibility/.

There are a lot of non-evil people with beliefs that will /appear/ evil to you, and few evil people. If you meet someone that sounds evil, odds are heavily weighted towards "immense and fundamental ideological divide" against "just evil".
