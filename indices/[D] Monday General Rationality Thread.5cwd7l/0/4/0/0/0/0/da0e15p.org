I want that point to be on the other side of the fucking multiverse from me! I don't want to fucking be there, especially because an authoritarian regime breaks down the signal precision of journalism and other information mechanisms, so by the time you're even close to that point you're relying on priors and very deeply uncertain.

/But here we are./

I agree that shouting insults and derogating people who live on the other side of imaginary lines is counterproductive. It constructs and reinforces those dividing lines. I want my actions to be direct and forceful, to achieve my goals with the minimum of harm or insult.

And I still think I can minimize insult. Though if I ever find the asshole responsible for the "don't shoot and cry tears" slogan on the Israeli far-left I'm going to fucking beat the shit out of him/her as a demonstration of why you /definitely/ cry after you shoot someone. /That was a human life you just took/, and even if that harm, that violence, was the best you could do at the time, /it should never have come to that!/
