I'm Jewish. Open antisemites are now high up in the new White House staff, and will be handed the greatest machines for surveillance and state-sanctioned killing created in decades. These people don't have to be evil /me'Sinai/, in some handed-down-by-God-for-all-time sense, to be a material danger to me, my friends, and my loved ones.

Go and reflect, let yourself step outside time for a few moments, and then tell me the history you would write for the world is one in which this many people are threatened and attacked, in which the whole of complex civilization is in danger, just because a shitty political party ignored the working class. Can't you hear the hollowness of causal connection just in reading that sentence to yourself? Doesn't this seem like a grimmer, darker world than we ought to be living in?

Isn't this evil already?
