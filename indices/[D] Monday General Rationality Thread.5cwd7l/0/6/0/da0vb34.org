I agree that this is one of the reasons why politics has become so polarized, but I'm not getting outraged by anecdotes publicized by news sources to gain attention. I'm upset over trends of what I'm actually seeing people say and how their peers react to it. That doesn't make my response rational, but it does make it much more difficult to be rational.
