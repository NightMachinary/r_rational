The people I spoke to didn't care much about the wall, most of them agreed that Trump had said absurd things they didn't support. They either voted for him anyway for similar justifications liberals had for Clinton in spite of her controversies, or they dismissed his rhetoric as grandstanding without concern for how it would effect his policy.

That wasn't all that reassuring to me and there are still some who adamantly support extreme positions who aren't being reined in by their peers, but there are plenty of moderates. I still disagree with many of the moderates about things I consider very important to agree on in order for our political system to do good, but they aren't all in agreement either.
