Don't forget that he might build a fence instead and/or only build it in some places. I'm not even sure conservatives in congress have a coherent plan at this point since even they didn't expect to end up in this situation. All anyone in the right agrees right now is that they are okay with Trump being in office and don't express interest in denouncing other supporters they disagree with, possibly because they see liberals as monolithic.

This is either going to be the most easily malleable voter base in decades or the least and there's no way to tell. I have no idea whether they'll go along with anything Trump does, turn against him the moment he does something they don't like, or turn against each other when he does something that only some of them support. Western countries are all going through a massive populist movement right now and I don't know what will happen next.
