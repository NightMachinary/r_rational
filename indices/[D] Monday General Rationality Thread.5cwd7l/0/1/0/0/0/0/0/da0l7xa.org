I have heard that:

- Trump isn't going to build a wall, that's just his starting point for negotiation
- Trump is going to build a wall, it's going to have Israeli anti-tunnel technology, it'll be 50 ft. high, etc.
- Trump isn't going to build an /actual/ wall, it's going to be a "virtual" wall using satellites, lidar, CCTV, etc.
- Trump isn't going to build a wall, he's just selling himself to people who don't know any better in order to get elected

And that's without getting into whether or not Mexico was going to pay for it or how.
