The problem with escaping the bubble is that 99% of the time you just end up looking in on a different bubble, where they talk about your original bubble like it's a fucking hellscape populated by demons. I think the best you can do is try to look at those other bubbles and ignore them when they talk about /other/ bubbles - you only pay attention to internal bubble views, not external bubble views. But a whole lot of bubbles are entirely outward-facing, so sometimes that's all there is to understand.

My personal solution is to cast myself as the skeptic and devil's advocate in whatever bubble I find myself in, which helps to eliminate some of the bad effects of the bubble, but is also exhausting and so not actually that great a solution.
