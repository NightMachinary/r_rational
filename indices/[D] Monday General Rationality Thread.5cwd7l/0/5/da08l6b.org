There are reasonable Trump supporters out there, but I would contend that the vast majority of them simply hated Clinton more. Clinton and Trump each got fewer votes than Romney did. They were the 2 least favorable candidates for as far back as we have polls.

The democrats chose to run someone who embodied the establishment, in an election where people wanted change. Obama won on change in '08 because people wanted the great recession fixed. The people in the midwest that lost their home and pension in '08 haven't recovered still- the only people to recover are those with homes or stocks. So in '16 the election is about change again, and Hillary vastly underestimated her opponent.
