I do get the anti-establishment sentiment, that makes sense even if I don't agree with the actions they took. The problem I have is what they want to happen next seems to be mutually exclusive with what I want to happen next and even without practical considerations I can't find a way to reach a compromise between our interests when they either conflict with each other or are based on ideas the other side rejects the validity of.
