I did point out the human cost, specifically regarding their stance on LGBT rights, and they didn't listen. They claimed to be perfectly tolerant of gay people and saw no hypocrisy in their explicit belief that gay marriage should only be legal at the state level or that people should be allowed to discriminate against gay people for religious reasons. That was all after I mentioned that I was bisexual, so I'm finding it difficult to think of them as having hearts and minds.
