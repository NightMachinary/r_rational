With regards to the 20k+ bombs/drone programs, etc... I understand the reticence with regards to them, but I have read that the alternative, as far as interventionism goes (saying nothing about just... not, because I have no idea about how ideal that would be) would be putting boots on the ground, which according to multiple (unfortunately unsourced, or I would link them) articles I've read, drone strikes and bombing runs as such deal /less/ civilian casualties and involve no threat to the U.S. military ground forces that would otherwise be at risk of casualties as well.

Now, there is an argument to be given for the decision-theoretic drawbacks of having no real damages done to our nation by our efforts against others', but to make that argument would be anathema on a national political stage.
