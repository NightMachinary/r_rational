I agree with you, but would rather call them "dangerous" than "evil." They're too ignorant to really understand the problem with their beliefs, for the most part.

"Evil" I mostly reserve for people who relish seeing the world as a negative-sum game, and have values that promote negative-sum interactions with others.
