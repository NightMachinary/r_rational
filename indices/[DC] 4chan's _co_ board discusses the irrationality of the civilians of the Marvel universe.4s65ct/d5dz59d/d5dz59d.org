On the other side of things, you have to wonder how come those things keep happening without the world (well, USA and appropriate scenic shots of a few capitals to imply that shits also happens in other countries) changing as a result except becoming slightly more violent and racists.

Like, hundreds of criminals can put a silly costume and start robbing banks, and the banks never change their money storage methods or buy silly-costume-proof protections. I remember watching a BtAS episode where the Creeper barges into a shop to steal a costume and thinking "Come on, this is Gotham City post ten years of the Joker. Shouldn't every shop have guards with machine guns by now?"

The military never upgrades its weaponry or recruit mutants in bulk (except when they do it in the most unethical way conceivable), or improves in any way that would let it compete with the rampaging paramilitaries and supervillains, or the individual heroes that need to save them.

When 9/11 happened, security everywhere was changed forever. Superhero universes never change, so it looks like the millions of people who died just disappeared in a vacuum.

Worm is a bit more consistent than average, with the PRT being ubiquitous, shelters for Endbringer attacks, and few tidbits of worldbuilding, but it's still lightyears away from a realistic portrayal. Like, there's a band of serial killers that regularly go on very public rampages in the USA, they have been going at it for decades, and there's almost nothing done to stop them; no martial law, no task force dedicated to stopping them, no firing your way through PRT directors until you find one who can finally do the job. In comparison, the French military is still on high alert for last year's shootings, which are way less dramatic or deadly than a band of serial killers going on a rampage every few weeks.

So, yeah. Turns out superheroes stories are irrational.
