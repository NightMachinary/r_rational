I agree most of the time Superman's time would be better spent pumping out that energy. But When Zod comes along, clean energy isn't exactly going to stop him.

Though I suppose the implication is that widespread free clean energy would lead to the invention of other technologies which maybe could help us keep the peace with all the alien invasions and such.

But given how frequently potentially city-wide or world destroying events occur in either universe, I think we're still going to need to fire up the coal plants while Superman punches some super-powered villains now and then.
