  "Come on, this is Gotham City post ten years of the Joker. Shouldn't every shop have guards with machine guns by now?"

That's not something all the shops can afford. Also, the fact that the Joker is still alive defies logic.

  Like, there's a band of serial killers that regularly go on very public rampages in the USA, they have been going at it for decades, and there's almost nothing done to stop them; no martial law, no task force dedicated to stopping them, no firing your way through PRT directors until you find one who can finally do the job.

The problem is that they can't be put down all at once, one of the core members is functionally invulnerable, another can talk his way out of nearly any situation with another superhuman, and the third can do more things with biology than MacGyver can do with a Swiss Army Knife.

Also, isn't Cauldron behind the scenes manipulating things?
