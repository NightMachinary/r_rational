Quality is great and all, but quantity is attractive on its own merit, most especially when it helps to raise your species out of literal damnation.

  losing Night. Less Night would mean fewer drow, which means the altar for the Below is smaller for potentially hundreds of years.

I would argue that dragging in hundreds of thousands of, say, Ratlings would /expand/ the alter.

Yeah, there's a risk of losing Drow, but they only need to win more often than they lose to come out ahead. And this shouldn't be too hard: Cat talked about what a single, "second-stringer" Mighty would do to Procer/Callow, and subterranean routes to both countries exist.

One of their neighbours is the Chain of Hunger, and frankly the Drow should be fine against them: Procer's has held the off for millennia without relying on Named for the heavy lifting.

Sure, there would might be issues against the Horned Lords and such, and Cat has already said the the Skein would outmatcach Urulan.... but again, Procer's done okay for a few thousand years (with heiress, yes, but Cat's already compared Drow favourably to heroes) and more to the point, you have the Longstride cabal. A group of Drow that not only would totally be able to handle the Skein or an equivalent, but already has the motive to do it.

And again, subterranean routes are a thing.
