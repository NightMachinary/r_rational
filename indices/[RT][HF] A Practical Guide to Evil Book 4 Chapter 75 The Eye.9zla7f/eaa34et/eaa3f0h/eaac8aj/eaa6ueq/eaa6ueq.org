Interesting she fell for a story trap. The villain used her belief in monologing to get her to hold still.

I wonder if she sent a frost construct instead of her "real" body? She knows they are going to ambush her and has been visibly flitting around the field as a juicy target...so why not make two of her so they can blow their trap? Plus Akua is in reserve, plot still in motion.
