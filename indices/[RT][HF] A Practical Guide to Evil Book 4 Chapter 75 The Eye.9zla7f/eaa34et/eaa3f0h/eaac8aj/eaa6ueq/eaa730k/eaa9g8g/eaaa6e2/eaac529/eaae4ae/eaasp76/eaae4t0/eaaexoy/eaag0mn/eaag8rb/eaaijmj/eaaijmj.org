That's what the Gods enforce, the rules. Below and Above empowers their champions who stick by the rules each prefers, act in certain ways. But the Gods themselves are the rules. The story. The narrative.

I'm just saying angels are closer to Gods than your average Hero, they are their messengers. So maybe the angels weren't "tricked" by Catherine, maybe Above allowed it to happen.
