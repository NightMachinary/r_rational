I didnt call her a Hero or a Good Guy and I do not feel either title fits her. I said she could step away as an in-between. She takes actions that are both heroic and villainous, but she leans villain hard enough it isnt a contest.

Specifically her world lacks a concept of Gods-Of-Balance. Considering her Mantle is neutral and she thinks both sides are a pack of dicks, I see no reason why Cat couldnt grab a few minor godlings and form her own faction. A faction dedicated to flipping the bird at Above and Below on behalf of mortals.

If she did so, I don't think either side could act against her directly because she wouldn't be standing for either side. It would mean every act against her would give the opposing side a chance to make a power move. Even heroes wouldnt be able to act with a story on their side, since there is nothing heroic in attacking those standing up for free will.
