  It didn't quite feel like I'd be breaking our bargain if I did that, but somehow I suspected it was close enough I wouldn't like the ensuing backlash.

This seems to imply that Cat has some sort of restrictions to what she can do with her Drow. I really, really want to know what the hell this refers to.

None of the oaths we've seen suggest anything about Drow rights - one of the oaths is essentially "do anything and everything Cat says to do, exactly the way she wants you to do it, or immediately die". This does not indicate limitations on what Cat can do with her slave army. There's (seemingly) nothing stopping her from just ordering them to accept the alienation.

I mean, hell, this chapter alone has Cat sacrificing her troops for the sake of tactical expediency. This "bargain" really does not leave Cat with any responsibilities or restrictions, outside of whatever this one is.

  “There are only a few of us left, Losara,” the Mighty said. “Those who knew this land before Night fell upon it.

This whole section, with the story of the Everdark and the Night anf the fall of the Drow, was kind of awesome. "The only sin is death" indeed. Not to mention why Sve Noc are the "Priestesses" of the Night.

  And the slaughter isn't a mistake or an unforeseen consequence, it's the entire point. Every kill is a sacrifice. Willing. Eager, even. Merciless Gods, Archer was right -- this entire realm is an altar.”

I'm still not sure why raiding parties aren't more of a thing. Sacrificing as many Ratlings as a group of Mighty can get their hands on seems like it would certainly help pay back their debt.

At the very least, I can see why it's seen as a huge task, sacred enough to redeem any disgrace.

  the Longstride Cabal entered the fray.

And now Cat has to deal with the Longstrides. This could be an issue for her, considering none of her plans are in play here.
