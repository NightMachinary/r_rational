  I'm still not sure why raiding parties aren't more of a thing. Sacrificing as many Ratlings as a group of Mighty can get their hands on seems like it would certainly help pay back their debt.

The opening quote partially addresses this:

I think it's a little bit of the above and a little bit of the risk associated with losing Night. Less Night would mean fewer drow, which means the altar for the Below is smaller for potentially hundreds of years. I agree with your point though. If they had weaker neighbors raiding would become a cultural standard.
