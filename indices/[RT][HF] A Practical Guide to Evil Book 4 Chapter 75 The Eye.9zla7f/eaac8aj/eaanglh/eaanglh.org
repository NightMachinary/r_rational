Technically, they're not a match for the Winter Queen. But Cat holds back because of the alienation, so she's never actually gone full Winter Queen so far. She's able to ramp up gradually what she can do without changing her personality by shunting off the influence, first to Aqua and now to the Peerage, which will probably increase as she conquers the Everdark, allowing her to power up to match the scarier Mighty in the inner ring.

It's also been foreshadowed in this chapter that she can probably channel the Winter influence into drow who are merely sworn to her, instead of full Peers, but that will probably have a nasty backlash.

Putting both of those together, my prediction is that when she actually goes toe-to-toe with Sve Noc, she will have to bring all of Winter to bear in the fight, and her Peerage won't be enough - she'll have to use the other drow. The backlash will end up de-powering her and the drow enough that they won't be absolutely gamebreaking when they get back to the surface, as they would be in their current form.
