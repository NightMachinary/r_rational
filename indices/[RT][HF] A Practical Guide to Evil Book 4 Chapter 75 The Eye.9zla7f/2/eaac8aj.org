I've been largely dismissive of the complaints from this subreddit about power creep. But here I think we see the consequence of making average Mighty credible threats to the Winter Queen. For the entire time that Rumania was speaking, I could practically taste the conservation of ninjitsu concentrating down around them. The reveal that they are the oldest being except the dead king has a neat contrast with the Elf she fought in Keter. Even the delay for the hyper-competent team of Longstrider killers works out as a ploy to make it a fight of three equal forces (cat/Rumania/Longstride cabal)

But instead I'm left wondering how 3000 years of collecting Night wasn't enough for this guy to overthrow the entire Dwarven kingdom. If he has had so long to build power, how can he possibly have rivals with the other (younger) sigils. And how can Cat possibly keep up in a fight?

Answer: we're immediately going to see the payoff shards of winter in her soldiers as she finally cuts loose with the winter mantle. This will be a premature burn of a potential growth asset which lets Cat overcome a short term existential threat.

Of course she can't collect an army of mighty. If Callow ever stops being the underdog then Cat's role as avatar of the Callowan redemption arc would end. And the gods really want Cat to win.
