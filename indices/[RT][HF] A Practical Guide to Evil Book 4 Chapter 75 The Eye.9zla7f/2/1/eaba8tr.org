  But instead I'm left wondering how 3000 years of collecting Night wasn't enough for this guy to overthrow the entire Dwarven kingdom. If he has had so long to build power, how can he possibly have rivals with the other (younger) sigils. And how can Cat possibly keep up in a fight?

Probably the reason he's alive is that he was not agressively collecting more Night. Seems like the drow would gang up on whoever was becoming too powerful.
