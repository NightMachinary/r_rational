  The drow softly laughed. “And I believed myself to be ruthless,”

I really don't get lines like this. The Mighty have already shown that they /do not give a crap/ about their underlings' lives. They kill so casually that "getting killed by your boss for no reason" is part of their culture, to the point people are pissed at Cat for saying "you're not allowed to murder your colleagues anymore".

Soln should be praising her boldness, or her risk-taking, or her military efficiency. Him praising her ruthlessness makes no sense.
