  But the Gods themselves are the rules. The story. The narrative.

There's absolutely no evidence for that. Warlock believes that the Gods are Creation itself and they can't intervene directly in events, which is why they created the Choirs and the Hells, to act as their agents, but only indirectly, encouraging their interests in individual stories.

Either way, the Gods definitely aren't the narrative. Creation is basically an experiment to see how mortals behave. The narrative is the cumulative result of thousands of years of mortals making choices, shaping the stories and adding weight to the arguments of either Above or Below.
