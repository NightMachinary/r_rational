Creation isn't the narrative. Creation predates the narrative. The narrative changes depending on the culture that the Names involved come from. The Gods don't decide the narrative, it's determined by the stories that create Roles. Again, we learned all of this in Book 1.

'We know this wager as Fate, and thus Creation came to know war. Through the passing of the years grooves appeared in the workings of Fate, patterns repeated until they came into existence easier than not, and those grooves came to be called Roles. The Gods gifted these Roles with Names, and with those came power.'

- Book 1: Prologue.

“The stories have been around since the dawn of Creation, meaning there's an endless variety of ways they can go. A pivot is a point in time or a decision where the Named pushes her story in a particular direction. It influences the kind of powers you develop.”

- Chapter 19: Pivot.

'Roles are usually a reflection of the people they spring from'

- Chapter 15: Company.

Creation is more than just the story. Arcadia is the one bound purely to narrative, in Creation there are other rules, like physics, as well. The stories change depending on where you are in Creation, because they are a reflection of the mortals who tell them. The laws of physics remain constant, because Creational laws were imposed directly by the Gods.
