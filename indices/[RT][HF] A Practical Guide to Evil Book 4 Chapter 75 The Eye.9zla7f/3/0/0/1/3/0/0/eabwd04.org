I'll give you the "choking a smuggler" one (I don't remember exactly what is was, but I don't think killing her was super necessary), but otherwise, nope, that's a stretched interpretation.

The fact is, Catherine has shown on average to be extremely restrained and mindful of civilian lives. She has a professional army, unless Proceran nobles who throw conscripted, untrained peasants into meat grinders.

Executing hundreds of mages, and making a display of their corpse? That's really not extreme by medieval standards. William did the exact same thing on a lesser scale, for the exact same reasons. Sacrificing part of her army for a tactical advantage? That's war, and not doing it is insane and leads to losing the troops you want to preserve and the country you're trying to defend; Cordelia certainly isn't above doing that; see also her plan for trapping Black's army in a city full of burning civilians.

Seriously, I can believe that there are ideological differences between Good and Evil that go beyond the aesthetic, but saying that Catherine is a bad person is ridiculous. She did everything she could to minimize the loss of life when confronted with external pressures by murderous schemers, and there's little she could have done to preserve more lives except "murder the bad people sooner".
