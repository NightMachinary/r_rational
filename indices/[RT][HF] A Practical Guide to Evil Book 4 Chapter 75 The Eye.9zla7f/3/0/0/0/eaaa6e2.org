As I understand it, Gods Below are only letting this play out without interfering because they win no matter which side comes out on top. If Cat chose this battle to come out against the gods, they'd jump onto Sve's side of the scale.

Going against the gods is on the horizon, but there's no way Cat has enough juice to pull it off now even without the Drow demigod opposing her.
