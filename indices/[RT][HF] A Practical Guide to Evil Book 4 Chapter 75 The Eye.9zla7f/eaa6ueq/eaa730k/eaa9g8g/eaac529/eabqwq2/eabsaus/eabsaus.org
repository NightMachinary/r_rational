How about the time she forced a woman to choke on her own tongue just to make a point? She was a smuggler, sure, but does that warrant summary execution?

Or when she crucified hundreds of people for the same reason? Granted, they were complicit in mass murder, but she killed them to create fear among her enemies. She used their deaths in exactly the same way she condemned Praesi for practising human sacrifice: she used their lives for her own benefit.

Or her strategy at the Battle of Dead Dawn, which she herself admitted removed any delusions about being a good person.

Or her current campaign, where she's using the threat of death to force entire cities into slavery. Again, the drow are already an absolute abomination of a culture, but that doesn't make it any better.

Or maybe we should judge her by the company she keeps? Her father figure, an inhuman monster who has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the name of his personal pissing match with the Heavens. Her best friend and her general, who view honour and morality as worthless and have to restrain themselves from eating people. Her other close friends: a madman detached from reality whose only objection to human sacrifice is its inefficiency, a narcissist interested ony in finding good fights and strong alcohol and a thief obsessed with revenge against her people's enemies.

Or the fact she's willing to unleash the 'original abomination' upon millions of innocent people rather than accept the idea she might be wrong.

Now, there are rationalisations for most of these. Many of them are even valid. But the fact remains: Catherine isn't anywhere close to being good.
