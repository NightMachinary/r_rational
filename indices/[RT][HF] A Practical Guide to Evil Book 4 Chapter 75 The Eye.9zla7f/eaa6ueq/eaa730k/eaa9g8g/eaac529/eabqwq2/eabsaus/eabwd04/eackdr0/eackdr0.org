  She did everything she could to minimize the loss of life

You do remember how she planned to unleash the Dead King on the world, right? And yes, she planned to restrict him to territorial boundaries and warn Cordelia to evacuate. It still would have killed tens of thousands of civilians, and really, she only had guesswork and hopes that the Dead King could be restrained at all. She was willing to unleash an ancient undead monster on the world, with completely unknowable consequences for the entire continent.

  William did the exact same thing on a lesser scale

William 'brainwashing for the greater good' Greenbury isn't a good moral standard to judge things by. Crucifying hundreds of people is horrific no matter what way you slice it.

You also didn't address the fact that she's currently enslaving an entire nation to use as canon fodder in a war that has nothing to do with them. It's better than extinction admittedly but it's still an evil thing to do.

And again, there's also the people she surrounds herself with and enables. Robber and his goblins, while hilarious, literally think murder and theft are great. Nauk and his orcs, who Catherine has given permission to eat the corpses of her enemies to make a point. Oh, and don't forget the Butcher of Liesse. She's planning on killing Akua the moment she stops being useful, I know. She's still risking the survival of a mass murdering maniac in order to gain an advantage.

Oh, and one I forgot earlier was that general of Akua's whose soul she ordered removed out. Again, to make a point. And that guy wasn't a mage, so he wasn't directly involved in summoning the devils. He just happened to be on the wrong side and got his soul ripped out for it. Truly the act of a hero.

I'm not saying Catherine is all bad. She has plenty of redeeming qualities and many of her decisions are understandable. She's by far the nicest, most reasonable villain we've seen in the story. But there's a reason it's called 'A Practical Guide to Evil'.
