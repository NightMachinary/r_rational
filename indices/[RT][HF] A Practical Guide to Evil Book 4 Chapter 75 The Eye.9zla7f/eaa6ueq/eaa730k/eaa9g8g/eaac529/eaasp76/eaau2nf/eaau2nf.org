  Procer and their crusade are planning on wholesale genocide against the entirety of Praes

No, they're not. A small but vocal minority of Levantine leaders are arguing for outright genocide. The rest of the Crusaders want to partition the Empire into puppet states. And honestly, given how often Praes goes insane and commits acts of mass slaughter, can you blame them?

The nasty things the Good side in this story have done don't even come close to the horrific deeds committed by the Calamities and the Woe.

What the Pilgrim did was horrible, but let's not pretend he didn't save far more innocent lives than he took by stopping Black. Black is likeable and very cool, but even his closest friends admit he's a complete madman who has orchestrated the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents.

No, Good and Evil are not just different religions. Evil literally glorifies murder and betrayal, and even the most rational and reasonable villains in the history of Evil conquered a neighbouring Kingdom and practiced suppression and institutionalised murder.

Good on the other hand preaches justice, honour and mercy. Yes, they don't always live up to that and some of their leaders and heroes are take ruthless actions. But you can't argue that Cat is justified in taking extreme measures for the sake of her goals and then condemn the Pilgrim for doing the same thing for what is frankly a far more clear cut greater good.

Oh, and according to Erratic Errata Good and Evil really do more or less correspond to good and evil respectively.

I'm not condemning Cat. I like her character. But calling her a good guy is just silly.
