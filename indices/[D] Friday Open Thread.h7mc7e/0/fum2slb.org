I'm up to 36,000 words in my mid-year NaNoWriMo's knowingly-terrible novel. And I've gone to the second stage of re-developing my writing process, having managed to convince a couple of people to beta-read and offer comments on the draft. Next up, my daily word-count might be slowing down some as I shift focus from world-building and simple character interactions to a bit more on developing conflict and the motivations behind it.

I'm doing the 'write-by-the-seat-of-your-pants' style of plotting, so even I don't know exactly how the plot is going to go, but I do have at least one firm ending point for the story; which means I'm confident I'm going to end up with an actually-complete novel, by the time I'm done.

All in all, I'd currently describe myself as... pleased. Maybe even chuffed. (And I could certainly use another beta-reader or two, to help point out if I stray too far from the rational/rationalist tropes; I'll cheerfully PM a link to the draft's GDoc if asked. :) )
