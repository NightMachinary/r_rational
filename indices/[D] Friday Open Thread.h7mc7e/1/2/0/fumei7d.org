Mine's not in yet! My little story happened late last night. It'll be Burning Man when it's in.

Some games I would recommend:

- Celeste - Excellent hard platformer

- Super Hexagon - Abstract action game that's actually too hard for me

- Cardinal Chains - A fantastic abstract puzzle game

- Anodyne - Like Zelda, but it's a journey into the uncomfortable parts of your mind. (I would say though that the first dungeon is weak, and the game is much better once you hit the open world after it.)

- Minit - RPG / Zelda-ish thing with a clever mechanic

And games I've heard good things about but haven't played yet: Octodad, Hive Time, Oxenfree, Nuclear Throne, Starseed Pilgrim, Tonight We Riot, Lenna's Inception
