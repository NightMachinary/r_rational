This week I enjoyed browsing through the amazing [[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/ctnlistPubDate.asp][Timeline of Science Fiction Ideas, Technology and Inventions]] by Bill Christensen.

It's a great place to visit if you ever wondered about the first use in fiction of a:

- voice-activated machine ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=657][Detectophone]]),

- machine-translation of human languages ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=658][Language Rectifier]]),

- [[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=664][personalized news]],

- sleep teaching ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=678][Hypnobioscope]]) or a

- fax machine ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=652][Telautograph]]).

All from [[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60944][Ralph 124c 41 +]] by Hugo Gernsback, published in 1911. His writing is an acquired taste which I failed to obtain.

I also learned about the first man-made propulsion system ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=2069][Moon Machine]], 1657). It involves a man "falling from the Moon" on a tree in Canada. Alas, it was not the first story with a machine on the Moon. That honour goes to The Man in the Moone by Francis Godwin (1638). What could go wrong when a man "trains forty wild geese to pull his flying machine" ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=3228][Gansas]]) and "doesn't realize that they migrate each year to the Moone". Interestingly, the idea of migratory birds "was not widely accepted for more than a century after the writing of the story".
