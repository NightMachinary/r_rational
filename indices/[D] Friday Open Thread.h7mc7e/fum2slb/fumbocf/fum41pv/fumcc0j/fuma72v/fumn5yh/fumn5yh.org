I view it as a net positive for individuals but at best a net neutral for society. Academic and career success are ultimately competitions against your peers, and having an extra year of development is a massive advantage. You also get long term advantages from positive labeling and self identity such as "I'm smart" or "I'm athletic" that carry forward. Keep in mind that competitive advantages also compound so I would expect a 1% edge on classmates to result in more than a 1% gain in income.
