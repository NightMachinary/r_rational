Star Trek, especially The Next Generation, is relentlessly humanist. But not horribly scientific.

Asimov's writings, especially his short stories, tend to be puzzles about how the AI rules he is known for are insufficient, but they're not grim or anything, and tend to have an optimistic feel towards being able to actually solve these problems. (Disclaimer I read these when I was like 12.)

The only optimistic hard sci-fi I can think of off the top of my head is The Martian, in which everything goes wrong but we can fix it because scientists are cool.

As a bit of a weird rec, The Conquest Of Bread, an anarcho-communist treatise from 1892, is relentlessly positive about future technology and progress, but its idea of what's futuristic is more than a little outdated given its age.

(Also you can build friendly AI in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJP0tie-30][Space Trains]], which I think is an excellent game, but I'm biased because I made it.)
