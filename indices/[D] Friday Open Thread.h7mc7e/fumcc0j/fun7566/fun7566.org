Try Leonard Richardson's [[http://constellation.crummy.com/]["Constellation Games"]]. I won't claim it's all upbeat, or super high quality, but it does a decent job of addressing the problems it poses, ends on a relatively optimistic note, and contains one of my favourite descriptions of a post-scarcity anarchic society.
