So my birthday passed recently and one of the topics we discussed on my bday hike was academic redshirting: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirting_(academic)]]

What are y'all's thoughts in it? When done voluntarily, does it enhance and encourage success later in life? Naively, it seems like childhood developmental trajectories feature lots of positive feedback loops: extra years of physical development benefit your performance in social and physical competition -> increased confidence asking questions in class, navigating social environments -> increased likelihood of achieving leadership positions; OR increased cognitive development -> higher performance on tests -> placed in the advanced track -> higher test scores applying to college -> qualify for scholarships, attend a better uni, etc.

Skimming the studies in the linked wikipedia article, a lot of them seem to be retrospective (and some confounded by e.g. intentional planning of birth months), with the redshirting driven by a need to hold children back because they're underperforming. It seems pretty intuitive that the initial boost of being a year or two older than your peers will eventually fade as everybody's development plateaus (likewise, students who skip grades will probably do well in life relative to the broader population, since the same factors that allow them to skip might also engender lifetime success). What I wonder about is the state of the evidence on whether to redshirt children who'd otherwise do fine alongside their same-age peers? Have there been e.g. any studies using instruments that capture some underlying causality? (across multiple years' worth of redshirting, not just birth-month effects).

There also seem to be a few plausible downsides, e.g. academic redshirting might perpetuate inequality in the classroom, and unlike other interventions does so in a zero-sum way, or in a way biased towards the wealthy who can afford another year or two without free public school childcare. Or maybe being ahead lets you more easily rest on your laurels -- lacking the struggle to keep up, older students might become slackers without an additional source of challenge or stimulation. Googling around people also suggested the loss of an additional year of income (esp. compounded by investments), but it seems like even a modest effect to overall career success could outweigh that.
