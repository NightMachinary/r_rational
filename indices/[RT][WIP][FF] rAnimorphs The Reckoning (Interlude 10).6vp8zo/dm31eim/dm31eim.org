Yay, my words are immortalized in my favorite rationalist fic!

For the record, I was in fact playing a character (or trying to) with similar views to myself, but a different personality. At the end I sort of got tired and just lazily replied with the "I don't really disagree with any of that on a factual level..." sentence.

"ControlGroup" is not the modification of my username that I would have expected, given that it refers to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group][the mathematical kind of Lie Group]], but it works just fine. (In retrospect, it may have been a bad decision to pick a username that most people will associate with lying).

The reddit post you made giving a progress update was much appreciated... though it seems you fell prey to the planning fallacy... I would have preferred regular small regular updates, like twitter updates, to a single update without a follow up. Even if it's only to say "hey, lots of CFAR stuff this week, next chapter date unknown, will tweet next wednesday with revised estimates." Now that I think about it, I would totally follow a r!Animorphs twitter account - that's much better than using this subreddit. And maybe it would be extra motivation to write!
