Yes and no.

The short version is, I don't think there's any higher reason to be altruistic. There's no God, nobody exists for a purpose, we're all gonna die, etc. I do think altruism can be rational (Glimwarden puts it well enough with Philip's character), and altruism can be motivated by core values (you want to help people for the sake of helping people), which I think will come across better in the rewrite.

So this would be, like, evil!me's outlook.
