I think it's already widely accepted that Esplin is full of shit. If nothing else, he said he'd stopped in the invasion, but the Animorphs then captured several controllers semi-publicly.

But yeah, a lot of the information in this is pretty important. On the other hand, it's nothing the Animorphs haven't likely shared yet with American intel services. This is more of a second opinion, distributed more directly.
