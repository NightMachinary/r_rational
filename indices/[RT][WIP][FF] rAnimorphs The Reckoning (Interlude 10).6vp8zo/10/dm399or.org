Clearly Starrat 731 is someone who the authorities should be working hard to capture alive, in order to subject him to the finest rapport-based interrogation techniques. He already let a ton of info slip out through his AMA and seems like a perfect candidate for revealing more to the right sort of audience.

I wonder how many of the questions (and upvotes) came from the FBI, MIB, or similar. Plausibly mine (SoccerJack's) could have, with the ducks/horses question serving as a relatively skillful "How do you do, fellow kids?" At the very least, lots of important people have been reading it very closely.

Esplin, Ellimist, Crayak in relation to this AMA: who is fucking pissed, who is causally responsible for it, and who is amused & strategizing?
