The fact that it said "I get my sloppy typing habits from my host" is interesting, in that it suggests the Yeerk has to consciously alter aspects of the host's personality; by default they're unchanged. "I kept almost everything else the same when I moved in" seems similar.

So if, say, a bunch of death row inmates were offered the option of infestation instead of execution, there might still be a risk of reoffending.

And yet, that's not the experience of the Animorphs in construct bodies. They basically have to reinvent the host's behavior.
