I saw the thread about this one, but it's really improved here by cutting out so many of the comments. I like this presentation of the material quite a lot, and I think I saw things that I missed last time. I think I was frustrated with the direction of some of the comments there. Thanks for cleaning it up and posting it. I like that this kind of meta-fic can become part of the story.

Also, I wouldn't feel too guilty about the update schedule. Life happens, and I know plenty of fics with much worse update schedules. Mine, for example.

That said, I am looking forward to the next chapter.
