At first I didn't think I was going to like this chapter: on the surface it seemed to be about a character we've never met before, who is unwilling to talk about the main conflict, and is now likely dead. I thought it seemed a little disconnected.

But it actually turned out to be pretty fascinating.

Watching Starrat 731 dance around topics that we the readers are informed about, while the in-universe readers try to piece things together was great. There was a lot of information buried in there that only makes sense with our outside knowledge, and trying to puzzle it out was fun, and all the implications of what the Yeerk was saying were interesting.

And the morality debates were quite good too.
