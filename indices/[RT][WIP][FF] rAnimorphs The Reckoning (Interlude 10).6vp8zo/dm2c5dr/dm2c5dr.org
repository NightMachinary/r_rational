Brief and disconnected from the plot as it was, I love these meta-inspired chapters a lot; they make the world feel more lived-in and expands it past our imagination's first pass.

Also appreciated the cameo of sorts, though I'm curious to know what inspired its inclusion: it matched my attitude pretty well despite me not explicitly saying anything on the topic before :)
