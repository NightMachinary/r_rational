I'm currently at my grandparent's and internet connection is limited (also we're supposed to enjoy nature and stuff), so progress is going to be slow. But yeah, I'm in the middle of a pretty major rewrite. I'll PM you details.

I agree that the interlude lacks emotion, both from Starrat and the redditors. On one hand, I can sort of justify this as Starrat being very stoic and only answering level-headed questions, and filtering out streams of insult. But yeah, that's pretty thin. And there's a lot of cold-headed discussion of slavery, genocide, etc, and it could use more anger.

I'd absolutely like a vindictive/angry reaction from TroubledTrousers, as long as it's at least vaguely a question and not just a rant (I need to be able to answer it and engage what you say)

On the other hand, the interlude is already pretty packed. A lot of questions were asked, and I don't want to add too much; I don't want to skip existing questions either, since they're all great; I might merge some, and edit them to add more bile. I'll definitely add a "FREE OR DEAD" cameo now that you mention it.

I kind of want to leave it ambiguous what happens to the character. Kind of a "this is the journal's last entry" thing, where we presume that the guy just died.
