I wasn't too keen on this chapter. I think that there was a missed opportunity for including fictional-reddit's reaction to Starrat's assumed death, be it sympathetic towards Starrat's desire to have some of his experiences live on, or vindictive ex 'fucking slug, glad you're dead, hope you're okay Alexandre' or even at the most basic level 'RIP OP'. Personally, I've always been fascinated by humanity's capacity for empathy and hostility, and I'd've liked to see more of that from fictional-reddit. Also missed opportunity for a cameo of 'FREE OR DEAD'.

I feel like there's a similar issue here to the other reddit interlude - a lot of debate, and much less reactions/emotion (I did like ControlGroup9's comment, that was awesome). I remember there being comments in previous threads about the Animorphs in this universe seeming way older due to their rationality, which is fine if you're talking about a group handpicked by E/C. However, I don't think the rest of the world would react so calmly to an alien invader going 'yo reddit I'm an alien that's part of the group responsible for massacring a major city, AMA'. Overall the feel of the interlude to me was a bit too much 'How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?'

I got to the AMA thread a little too late - it had already closed, but I'm happy to go back and make contributions if [[/u/CouteauBleu]] is willing to reopen it :P Or hell, I'd be happy to write a vindictive/angry reaction to Starrat's death if you want to bring TroubledTrousers back, haha!
