So when Starrat 731 mentions multiple hosts here :

"The game theory and sociology bits are mostly from Alexandre and my other hosts. The philosophy and future predictions are me."

And when they respond "No and no. " to "Have you ever been in other species? Or in other people besides Alexandre?"

Along with going into the differences between different species of host and different hosts within a species, that they're drawing on shared knowledge of other hosts from the Coalescence of Starrat?
