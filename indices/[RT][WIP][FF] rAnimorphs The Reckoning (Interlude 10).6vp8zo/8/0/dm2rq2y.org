StrongerThànYou is Thàn Suoros, yeah. I asked the real-life inspiration for the character what sort of question he'd drop into such a Reddit thread, and he gave me some loose guidance, and I wrote it in for him.

The main line in the cover of /Zombie/ is "In your heeeaaaaaad, in your heeeaaaaaaaaaaaaad." Alexandre picked that as the username for the throwaway account. Also yeah, they referenced Alanis Morissette in canon a few times ("Note to Alanis: /that/ is ironic.").
