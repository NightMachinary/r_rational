Woop woop!

I'm sure there's much that I didn't pick up on, but a thing I did: is StrongerThànYou the username of Thàn Suoros?

Is ZombieAsInAlanis a reference to something, maybe to do with Alanis Morissette? It looks like she's done a cover of /Zombie/, but if that's what it is I still don't get it. Alexandre might have picked that username pre-infestation, but I'm guessing not.
