If you want an evil gaming genius, try Mewgle from Brave New World by Ri2. He's a clone of mew who loves games and he's one of the most powerful demons in the series, AND he nearly succeeded in usurping the big bad "ruler of evil" Deoxys himself, and almost turned all reality into an RPG in a prior incarnation of the Omniverse. But he was stopped by Ash's squirtle, Leonardo, who used his cool superpowered sunglasses to see through Mewgle's plan, and break everyone free of the virtual reality they had been trapped in without realizing it. Mewgle and Leo became arch enemies and reincarnated many times, fighting countless battles over the eons.

Long story. Literally.
