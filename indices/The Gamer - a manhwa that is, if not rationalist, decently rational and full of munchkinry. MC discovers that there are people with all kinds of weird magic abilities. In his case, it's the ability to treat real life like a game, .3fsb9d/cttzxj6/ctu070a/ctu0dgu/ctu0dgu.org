I hardly ever see games where you can level individual skills like that. The closest I can think of off the top of my head is Skyrim, and Skyrim's perk system is tied into its main leveling system so it's entirely different.

And existing skills mutating into new skills once you've hit a high enough level in it? Never seen it before. Maybe I should start playing Korean RPGs.
