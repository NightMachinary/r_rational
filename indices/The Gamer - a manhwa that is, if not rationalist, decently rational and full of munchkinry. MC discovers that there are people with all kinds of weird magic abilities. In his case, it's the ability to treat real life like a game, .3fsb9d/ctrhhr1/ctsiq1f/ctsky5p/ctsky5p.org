Yep - I caught up with it without having watched any of RWBY, and didn't particularly feel as though I'd missed anything. It convinced me to watch the show, in fact.

I mean, there's only about 5 hours of total content in the whole of the RWBY canon, counting trailers and the background-webisodes, so there's not a tremendous amount to miss in the first place. The lore of /The Games We Play/ is significantly more extensive.
