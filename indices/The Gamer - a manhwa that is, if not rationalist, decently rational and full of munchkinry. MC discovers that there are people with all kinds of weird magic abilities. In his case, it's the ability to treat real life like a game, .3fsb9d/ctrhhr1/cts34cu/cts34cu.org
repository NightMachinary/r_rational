Is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/#post-14816773][this]] the first entry in The Games We Play? It feels very much not an opening, so I'm thinking maybe I missed something. I'm familiar with the Gamer concept from other fanfic and enjoy it, but would prefer to start at the actual beginning.
