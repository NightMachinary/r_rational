Good rec. I've found that I'm enjoying the crossover fanfic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/][The Games We Play]] more than the original Gamer manwha. Reliable daily updates for just over a year probably have something to do with that, but it seems to do a better job of scaling up the periodic challenges to the exponential power of the protagonist's ability.

Another manwha you might enjoy if you liked /The Gamer/ is /Dice: The Cube that Changes Everything/, which is along mostly the same lines.
