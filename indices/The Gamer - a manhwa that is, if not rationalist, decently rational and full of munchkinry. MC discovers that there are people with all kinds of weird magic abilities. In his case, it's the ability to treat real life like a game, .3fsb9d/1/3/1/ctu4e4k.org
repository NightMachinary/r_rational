You /should/ watch it though, at least one ep. But the first season doesn't take much time, the episodes are short and it's 16 eps. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sGiE10zNQM]]

I rather like knowing what those flying things look like and I didn't get blake being a girl too early and it's nice to see what the grims look like. Not to mention our main character.
