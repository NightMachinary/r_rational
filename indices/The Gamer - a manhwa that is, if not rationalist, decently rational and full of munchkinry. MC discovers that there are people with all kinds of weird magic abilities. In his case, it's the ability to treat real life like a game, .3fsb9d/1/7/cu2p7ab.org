Read. Format aside, it's definitely way too drawn out, especially in the explanations and plot exposition, and am fairly in doubt on whether the protagonist is really winning because of his stats or because of plot, which is definitely not a good trait for a rational story.

On another side, I haven't found any mention of rationality in the thread, so I guess that's fine?

Either way, a very interesting story, but needs a lot of polishing.
