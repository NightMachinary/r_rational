Diminishing returns in levels gained through grinding. The ineffectiveness of staying where you are with the same enemies diminishes because they either net the same XP per kill while the to-level requirement grows, or the XP per kill gained shrinks to nothing. Sometimes both. It's a mechanical approach to encourage progression in the game.
