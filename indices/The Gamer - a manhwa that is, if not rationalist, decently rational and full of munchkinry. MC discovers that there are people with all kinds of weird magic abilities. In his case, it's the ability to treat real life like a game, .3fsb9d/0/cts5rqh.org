It's actually kinda crappy, but I still read it for some reason.

I don't like when it says "games has this and this thing" like it's some universal law and I have never seen anything like that. Like in chapter 6, "There is something called wall-hitting in games. Monsters won't attack you if you have a wall behind your back."

It would be way better if the character said there is this thing in a game he plays and checks if it works here, but that shouldn't work too often either.

The guy is a bit stupid too. Continuing school feels pretty stupid when he doesn't have to actually study anymore, it's mostly a waste of time he could use grinding and he could meet the guys elsewhere.

His friend says stupid stuff too, like in chapter 8, "If you want to live a normal life, don't train your ability anymore. If you plan on training, be prepared or else you might be killed." He has lots of stuff he can train without anyone noticing. And getting stronger makes it harder to kill you.

And he said you'll get killed if you win a lottery with your powers, but apparently his family can win all the sports competitions they want.

He should also really talk to his mother...

He's also said to be addicted to gaming, but how many times have we seen him play any?

The sister of the friend in chapter 10 checks if he is a fake with a hit that should crush his bones...

I did like that the guy started with melee before going to magic.

Another thing like this is Tate No Yuusha No Yariagari. It's actually a novel, but it has manga too, but the novel is way further. I think writing might work better for these kinds of works. The writing is a bit crappy both in that and the gamer, though.

edit: also, dlc? seriously?
