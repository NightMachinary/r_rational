No, come on. He needs to fight to level and his power allows him to create the mobs to fight, at the appropiate level. He also progresses much much faster than anyone in the world, just because (think of when he grinds Vit and Str, he gains in weeks what others gain in years).

Also, a power like this /could/ have limitations, like 'you cannot create your own skills' which is commonplace in games. But fuck it, it doesn't!

All in all, in two months he gets power levels that are on par and above people who've been training their whole lifes. I think it's not unreasonable to predict that in a couple of years he could be at the 'top' level in absolute terms. So yeah, OP as fuck.
