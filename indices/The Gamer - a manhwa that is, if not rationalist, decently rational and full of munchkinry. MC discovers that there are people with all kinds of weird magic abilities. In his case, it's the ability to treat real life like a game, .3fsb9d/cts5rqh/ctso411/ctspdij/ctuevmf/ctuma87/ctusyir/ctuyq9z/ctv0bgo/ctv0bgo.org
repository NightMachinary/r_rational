This is true. However, it's possible to strike a balance. Before 'big mission 2', he thinks to himself that the /safer/ way to speed level would be to have daddy take him out somewhere dangerous and guard him while he fought Grimm. That would certainly be much slower than what he does do, but he is young. What does it /really/ matter if it takes 2 or 10 years to catch up to the baddest badasses in the land? It's more enjoyable to read this way, it's just not paranoid enough considering how useful he'll be if he survives a few years.
