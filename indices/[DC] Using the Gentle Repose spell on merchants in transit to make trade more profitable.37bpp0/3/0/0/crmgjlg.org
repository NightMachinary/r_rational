  Gentle Repose doesn't change the fact that the merchant died more than one round / one minute ago.

Actually, it explicitly does. That's it's primary purpose.

#+begin_quote
  Gentle Repose

  You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. *Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see raise dead). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit.* Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

Revivify works the same as raise dead, only it measures its time limit in rounds, not days.
