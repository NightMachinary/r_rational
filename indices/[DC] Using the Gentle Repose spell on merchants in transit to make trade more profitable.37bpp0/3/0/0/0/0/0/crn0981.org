The whole thing about the Open Gaming License is that Wizards of the Coast wanted to allow the rules text to be shared while making the flavor text be their own exclusive property. As such, everything that makes it into the d20 SRD as opposed to the published Dungeons and Dragons sourcebooks is, at some level, rules text. The SRD /is/ the authoritative documentation of how the d20 system works, and any deviations from the text of the SRD are by definition DM fiat. And there's nothing wrong with DM fiat; it's explicitly encouraged by the rules themselves. But if we bring DM fiat into the picture, then it makes the entire discussion pointless because the Word of God has spoken.

Meanwhile: If the God of Death had the ability to break the rules of mortal magic enough to allow his clerics to successfully cast a spell that ought not work, then this whole mess isn't even necessary. He could grant his clerics a different spell entirely -- something like a Temporary Death spell that would perform the painless peaceful killing, maintain the corpse, and then resurrect the subject without penalty at the cleric's command if it didn't take damage during the spell's duration. Such a spell would be balanced because it's a MUCH stronger predicate on when the resurrection can happen: you can't use it to revive someone who died of ANY other means. (Juliet would have used a potion of this spell.)

The exercise here is to provide a way that the God of Death could do this within the rules as written.
