tl;dr:

- Cleric of god of death painlessly kills merchants and casts Gentle Repose to preserve corpses

- Dead merchants' souls go to a comfortable antechamber of the afterlife, by special arrangement with the god of death

- Caravan space that would've been taken up by merchants' food/water/clothes can be devoted to more sellable goods, allowing more profit for the merchants

- Cleric rides with corpses to maintain Gentle Repose, then casts Revivify or Raise Dead upon arrival at destination
