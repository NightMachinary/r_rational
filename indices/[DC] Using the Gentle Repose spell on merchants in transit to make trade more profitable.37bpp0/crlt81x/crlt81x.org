The more mundane commercial use of Gentle Repose is given in the Stronghold Builder's Guide. This specifies that you can have a permanent version of the spell cast as an area effect on a room, preventing decay and spoilage.

Apply that to your wagon and you can transport fresh spices while your competitors all trade in the relatively ineffectual dried varieties. You can slaughter animals in one place and sell the meat on another continent. It's what refrigeration wishes it could be when it grows up.
