This is a lovely thought, but why in the world would you do this? Load your goods and people into a set of Portable Holes. Have a mage Teleport to the destination. Boom, done.

Things to note:

- Portable Holes can be nested by RAW, so you can have a lot of space.
- There's 10 person-minutes of air in a Portable Hole. You only need two rounds to do this. (1) pick up Hole + cast Teleport. (2) Put Hole down. It is open, it has unlimited air.
- If you want more safety margin, there's lots of options. Darsson's Cooling Breeze (ideally + Permanency), Bottles of Air, those brass pipes from Stormwrack designed for diving bells, another PH that you open when you need air, etc.

Assuming you don't need the Permanency, you can do all of this with a 7th level mage. Teleport has a margin for error, but it's a percentage of the distance traveled, so you can walk your shots on target. Portable Holes cost 20,000 gold and therefore 3 weeks to make -- with demand as high as it would be, plenty of mages would be cranking them out. There's other options too -- Enveloping Pits, Bags of Holding (the largest), Teleportation Circle, etc.

I can see Gods of Death offering vacation packages, but not just to make trade caravans easier.
