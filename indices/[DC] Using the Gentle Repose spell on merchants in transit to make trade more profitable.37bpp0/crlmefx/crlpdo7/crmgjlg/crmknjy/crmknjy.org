Specific trumps general.

Gentle Repose has a general rule that says that the body doesn't decay, so as a result spells that raise the creature from the dead get a bigger window.

There is also a general rule in the PHB that says:

#+begin_quote
  Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.
#+end_quote

Revivify, at least in 3.5, has a specific rule that says:

#+begin_quote
  Before the soul of the deceased has completely left the body, this spell halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body.
#+end_quote

The specific requirement of Revivify ("before the soul [leaves] the body") is not addressed by the general provision of Gentle Repose ("[the remains] do not decay") and overrides the general description of life-restoring magic ("returning it to his or her body").

The reason Revenance+Revivify works is because Revenance does not override this general description and therefore it does in fact provide a mechanism to return the soul to the body, which then will not have departed before Revivify can be cast.

I grant that the change to the wording of Revivify in 5th Edition invalidates this criticism, and given that the article in question is referring to the spell costing 300gp instead of 1000gp, it seems to be written from that perspective. However, I also don't currently see a first-party source for the existence of Gentle Repose in 5th edition, so... you'd have to house-rule the spell in for it to work!
