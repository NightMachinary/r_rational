You're not conscious of the journey itself; you're conscious of a luxurious place of rest and relaxation, and you're NOT conscious of the nitpicky details of the passage of time. (Departed souls are explicitly stated by the rules as only knowing a vague idea of how long they've been dead.)

The thing that seems inefficient to me is that the cleric has to go on the trip, and the cleric requires supplies... although I suppose the cleric could just pray for Create Food and Water.

Additional inefficiency: The merchants themselves aren't nearly as much of a drain on the caravan's capacity as their guards are. Merchants with character levels can serve as PART OF the caravan's guard, which is more efficient than hiring henchmen AND stocking supplies for them (and musclebound henchmen probably eat a greater volume of food than merchants, even though the food they eat might be cheaper).

There's... also the problem with Revivify... uh... not working that way. Whether it's 3.5 Revivify or 5E Revivify, Gentle Repose doesn't change the fact that the merchant died more than one round / one minute ago. In fact, 3.5's description of the spell's effect is that it works by preventing the soul from leaving in the first place, so the suggestion that they have a cushy room in the afterlife to wait is explicitly contrary to that.

You can work around that with Revenance, which calls the soul back to the body for a limited time, and then Revivify locks the soul into the body. But now you're paying the cleric for even more spellcasting services. (Which is a good deal for the cash-strapped god of death! But not so much for the merchant.)
