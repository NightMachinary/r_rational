I call that fallacy "inability to read properly". That said, there are many lists of fallacies beginning with Aristotle and continuing to the modern day. All a fallacy does is point out a pattern of incorrect reasoning. So if there is no name for a fallacy, then there is nothing wrong with giving it your own descriptive name. Or you could just use "straw man" since this argument ascribes a position to Carson that he does not actually believe.
