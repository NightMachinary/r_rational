To be fair to GLAAD, doesn't it seem fairly obvious that this /is/ the intention of Ben Carson?

There's no particular reason to bring up homosexuality in the same sentence as bestiality and pederasty other than to draw a false equivalence between them. To say "No one can do it, no matter who" should be enough: to specifically name three groups of people whose only shared trait is that they are not heteronormative is a not-so-subtle way to link them in the listener's mind. He could have listed polygamists instead, and the association would have been far less negative, though still "strange" or out of the norm. I don't think it's accidental that he chose groups that would illicit a large amount of disgust in the general population.

As much as I hate the overuse of comparing arguments to the ubiquitous "motte and bailey" structure, this does seem a tried and true method of those against gay marriage. Their arguments focus on how unnatural or sinful homosexuality is, until those arguments are countered and they retreat to arguing that they're just "defending the sanctity of marriage," and nevermind that there are dozens of other things that they could be focusing on if that's what they really cared about.

GLAAD interpreted his words this way because it's highly unlikely to be accidental. His words serve to have a distinct and likely deliberate effect, and pretending that it doesn't, or that the argument has merits beyond the false comparison, is overall fairly pointless to their goals.
