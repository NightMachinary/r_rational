My experiences are me. If I keep my experiences, I am still me. I've personally lost a bit of my body in real life, and I'm not any less 'me' than I was when I had all my pieces and parts.

If it were forced on me when my body was healthy and I wasn't done with it yet, I might be very angry, but I would still be me.
