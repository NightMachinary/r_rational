In a certain sense, the "you" from each instant vanishes without any trace other than the "you" from subsequent instants. Call these p1 and p2. How are they related?

There are two fundamental connections we can identify here. One is the similarity: p1 and p2 have many very similar attributes including most past memories. The other is the causal connection: p2 would (with high probability) not exist unless p1 first existed.

A high fidelity copy of you meets both of these criteria. Two such copies, or 100 such copies, would meet this criteria equally well in terms of their relationship to the original. The copies would have only the similarity relationship to each other, however.
