If you make perfect copies, each copy would awaken as if they were you, from a deep sleep.

If you vitrify your brain and then later it's thawed out perfectly, you'd awaken as if from a deep sleep.

Each version of you thinks it's you and with 100% fidelity in the thought experiment, many here would argue that it's "good enough" or "what's the difference?"

The argument is actually about the procedure though... people who disagree do do because they worry that something is lost. Intuitively, they know who they are, but not at a level that they can intuitively believe they can be copied or cryopreserved or mind-uploaded with 100% accuracy, since they don't know what the cutoff is where you lose key attributes about yourself that are capable of answering these questions.

What is my consciousness?

What is my identity?

Edit: well, I guess we can't answer these questions NOW, but we hope neuroscience will improve. And develop to the point that we can understand the physical reality of the brain at such a level that simulating it would be indistinguishable from the psychological inner-thinking reality that's capable of pondering such questions.
