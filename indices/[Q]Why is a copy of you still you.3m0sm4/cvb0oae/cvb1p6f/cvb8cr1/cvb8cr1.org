It's complicated by the ball of electricity being shaped and maintained by the physical brain. You are able to fall asleep, fall into a coma, and even die for short periods, but barring physical/chemical damage, your brain is able to reform your pattern much as a switched-off computer can fire up and and proceed to automatically reload your preferred operating system and personal environment.

The question then becomes: does cryopreservation preserve sufficient information to allow a future reconstruction process to build a platform which would result in booting up a mindstate /sufficiently close to the original/ that it would be considered an instance of You-the-original?

From an internal perspective, the mind (assuming it was healthy and functioning) would have the original's memories and personality, and perceive the discontinuity as nothing more than a long sleep or coma.

From an external perspective, there would probably be a lot of legal issues, because current legal systems do not recognize transferral or copying of mindstates from the original substrate (admittedly, this is mostly because there has never really been a call for it yet). Identity is currently mostly based on physical markers - fingerprints, DNA matches, visual traits such as facial appearance. Your new body (assuming you had one and were not being run on software) would be considered a separate identity by default under modern systems.

You could get around this with some preparation - setting up a (probably nonprofit) corporate entity whose day-to-day maintenance is handled by lawyers, and whose corporate rules include something along the lines of "In the absence of designated source of CEO-level directives, CEO-level directives may be issued by any source which holds the passphrase." Your could then go to the lawyers, give the passphrase, and install your identity (if you had one) as the new CEO, both as your original self and after coming back from cryo. Have the corporation own all your personal resources in the first place, and you don't need to worry about them being dispersed if your original self dies.

The next major legal problem is attaining a legal identity if you are not corporeal. A little easier in countries where corporations are able to obtain citizenship status, but still difficult to be recognized globally as a human unless you are walking around in (or at least tele-operating) a meat body. The main problem is gaining identity for a body which was not 'born' in the conventional manner. Unless you have the resources to own and operate an orphanage, hospital, or other facility capable of processing paperwork for teenagers or adults who have 'lost their memory' and need new government-approved identities to operate in society, you are going to have problems.

(I presume there is at least some process for issuing new identity documents to adult civilians whose previous identities cannot be determined, but it would not surprise me if it required intervention and/or pressure from medical organizations. And gaining identity can itself be different from gaining citizenship.)
