I like this idea. My view is that "you" are a ball of electricity running in a certain pattern, bouncing around a brain. If that is extinguished, you are dead. Your description would be a way to carefully transfer the continuous ball of electricity over to a computer without interrupting its pattern or turning it off. The interesting question is what happens if you are cryopreserved. I guess according to my own definition, you would die, and a copy of you would wake up in your body. So if souls exist, your original soul would stay in the afterlife and another soul would animate your body, instead of your original soul being transferred back into your body.
