We also have comas where people do not dream, which people are capable of recovering from.

I guess I don't really think of dream consciousness to be the same as waking consciousness anyway. It's more like dream consciousness is just a side effect of your brain undergoing a defrag process, while waking consciousness is a side effect of normal brain operation. There's a potential bridge between them, in the form of lucid dreaming, but ... it's tough for me to say "oh yeah, that's me" when talking about dreams, simply because the dream version of myself behaves in ways that are far different from what I would expect of even an imperfect clone of myself.
