Are you sure about that, if you cease to exist then why do you have dreams? Additionally, I read an article somewhere that stated that even when sleeping you still have a minimal level of consciousness in order to experience dreams. So really, the only time you cease to exist is when you die, I don't think your mind can restart after a shut down,however, if you have evidence on the contrary can you please link it.
