  Would you want to live in a state of constant dreaming, unable to interact with the outside world, unable to realize that you're dreaming, constantly forgetting what you just dreamt?

The quality of the sensory experience does not have any special consideration for its existence. You are conscious while you're dreaming. I don't think you can even say for certain that experience is interrupted even in the case of anesthetic or comas, as there is still brain activity, and you might simply not /remember/ any experience you do observe. That is massively internal, and we need further research to say anything on the subject.
