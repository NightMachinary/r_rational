  If there's any basis whatsoever to this notion of "continuity of consciousness"---*I haven't quite given up on it yet, because I don't have anything better to cling to*---then I would guess that this is how it works.
#+end_quote

I don't know how I can make it any plainer; I haven't given up on continuity of consciousness because I don't yet feel like I have a full dissolution that works without it. Other people claim they do and that they're satisfied; I don't know if I'm missing something they know, or if they're just worse than me at spotting wordless dangling loose ends. Though frankly my priors are toward the latter. Real dissolutions should be both explicable and complete.

The thing I was tentatively suggesting might embed continuity of consciousness was Pearl-style causal relations, because material persistence obviously can't do it, because there is no such thing.
