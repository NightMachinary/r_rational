I question that materialism has any grounds for continuity of consciousness, as the concept itself seems to beg a Cartesian observer. Causality may sustain the illusion of identity in a material world, as each successor mind is continuing the cognitive computations of its predecessor and maintains a configuration consistent with the mind's past in a mind-readable format, and that is enough for a successor to identify with a predecessor.

I think we're using different meanings for continuity of consciousness. When I say that you say continuity is an illusion, I mean that you mean the intuition of a Cartesian observer arising from this identification is false. I'm not sure what you mean when you say you "haven't given up on continuity of consciousness," as I doubt you are a dualist. Do you mean continuity in the sense of the paragraph above, of continuing cognitive computations, or what?
