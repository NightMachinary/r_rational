Er, the disassembling "teleporter" problem, or destructive uploading, for example? I think this whole thing is a rare instance of a philosophical issue that will actually cause people to take very different views on technological possibilities in the future. Specifically, my roommate has stated that he sees no problem with uploading himself destructively once that becomes possible, while I myself think that's completely bonkers.
