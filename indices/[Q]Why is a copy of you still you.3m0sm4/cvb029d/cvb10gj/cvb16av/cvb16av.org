Eliezer holds that continuity of consciousness is an illusion. Anything sufficiently like yourself that functions in a sufficiently similar manner will believe that they woke up after some discontinuity, and that they are still alive. To the copy, it doesn't matter. To the original, they're too busy not experiencing anything to experience nonexistence.

Picture being frozen. You may very well "die," due to a large enough discontinuity that the homunculus staring into our universe loses its place on the record track of your life. However, once you're unfrozen (in a future where we are capable of unfreezing people without killing them), there's still a functional person there, with your memories and behaviors. That person is still alive, and it has every right to think it's you. In that sense, continuity of consciousness doesn't matter in the /slightest./ I'm simply more concerned with the original, since that's what I identify closer with, or at least my intuition does.
