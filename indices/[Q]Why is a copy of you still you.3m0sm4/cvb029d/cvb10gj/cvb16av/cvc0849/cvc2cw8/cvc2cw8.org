I'm not arguing that a copy doesn't feel identical to the original, I'm just wary that there isn't actually some strange metaphysical shit going on.

I doubt I would be nearly so reticent about copy-and-transfer once I was actually uploaded, unless I tried to keep a continuous awareness running for as long as possible.
