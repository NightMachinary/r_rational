I made a long post to say there is a difference in the sleep thing, possibly not knowingly losing the continuity, and making a 100% perfect clone of yourself and killing yourself and knowing you'll stop experiencing things and that the clone will take your place.

Especially if you upload just your mind. Then when you realize you are in a computer, you'll know the original you is probably still running around there and you are a copy. Instead of continuity, it's more of a split.

If you were to just boom, disappear and in the same moment there would appear new you which is 100% perfect copy of you, in your place, that I'd call theoretical bullshit.

If someone would replace you with 100% perfect copy when you were unconcious, that might feel like continuity in theory.

Of course, it doesn't really have to be 100% perfect copy, our bodies change all the time, so minor differences are not noticeable. Probably our minds wouldn't have to be 100% perfect copies either, it could forget quite a lot of things and it would still feel like continuity, and you'd probably not even remember you forgot something. ;) If it isn't obvious, like how to walk, but you wouldn't think you were replaced if it wasn't mainstream technology. Memory problems do happen and we change opinions and stuff, we aren't static.

Aaaand this got a bit long again, in a different way...
