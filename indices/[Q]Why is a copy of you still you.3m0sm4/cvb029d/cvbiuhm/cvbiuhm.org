I agree with your stance on cryonics - but with respect to deconstructive-reconstructive teleporters, would this prediction pay its rent? Would you actually enter such a teleporter? Telling me that the copy created on the other end is me does little to calm me, given that the "original" destroyed on this end is /also/ me. So, even given the fact that the copy is me - a point that you do make well - 50% of all mes die every time I enter the teleporter. It's a game of Russian Roulette, even if it doesn't look like it from the outside - and "the outside" includes previous teleporter users, because the ones you're talking to are obviously the survivors.
