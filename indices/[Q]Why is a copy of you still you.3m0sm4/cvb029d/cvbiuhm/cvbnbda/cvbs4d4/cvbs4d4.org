  Oh, you might say, but the tag is just an abstraction - it's just part of my model of the universe. But then I say, exactly what physical properties is that abstraction based on? It can't be something you perceive - all your senses are physical. So the forced conclusion is that "I" is physically arbitrary, or indexical. But if it's indexical, you're forced to admit that you "one second in the future" is a different person than "you now".

Welllll... sorry, but I've been starting into analysis and topology, so this now bugs me.

That is, I could just say, sure, "one second into the future" /is/ different from me. But it's only a /continuous/ change. I could easily charge that there are some /discrete/ changes which may be physical continuations of "me", but don't have the same "personal identity" (for all that such is a meaningful, rigorous concept, which is not much).
