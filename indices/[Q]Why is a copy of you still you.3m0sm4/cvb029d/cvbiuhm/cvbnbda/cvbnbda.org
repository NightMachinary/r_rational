Just modify yourself to only care about at least one copy of your pattern continuing to exist. It's saner in the long run.

The "just-a-copy" intuition is tempting, but it's physically unsustainable - you end up having to "tag" a particular configuration of particles as "you" and in the next breath say that another, physically identical configuration is "not you". Which is literally not possible without dualism - the tag is almost by definition superphysical (since if it was physical, we could duplicate it.)

Oh, you might say, but the tag is just an abstraction - it's just part of my model of the universe. But then I say, exactly what /physical properties/ is that abstraction based on? It can't be something you /perceive/ - all your senses are physical. So the forced conclusion is that "I" is physically arbitrary, or indexical. But if it's indexical, you're forced to admit that you "one second in the future" is a different person than "you now".

Then you get into continuity. But /the transporter clone has continuity too/.

By the way, this is why dualists-in-denial like to take refuge in quantum, since it offers some "promising" (if you're trying to cling to a single consciousness) claims about noncopyability. Unfortunately, our brains almost certainly aren't quantum computers.
