I'm not saying the version on the other end /isn't me/. I'm saying the version on this end /is me/. If I accept that the version on the other end is me, which I do, then 50% of mes die when the teleportation event occurs. It's directly equivalent to flipping a coin that kills you when it comes up heads - an activity that also "leaves at least one copy of your pattern continuing to exist".

You either accept quantum immortality (which has some really weird and interesting implications, but it's not scientifically provable and I'd prefer all things considered not to test it myself, because humans are survival-seeking mechanisms) or you accept that entering a teleporter is equivalent to the "I shoot you if the coin comes up heads" game I described.
