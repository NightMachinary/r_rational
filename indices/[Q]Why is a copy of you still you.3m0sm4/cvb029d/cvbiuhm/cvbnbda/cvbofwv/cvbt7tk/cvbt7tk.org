I really hope quantum immortality is true, or some other form of solipsistic immortality, because that gets me a way /out/ of this dying universe.

I imagine some really trippy and horrible mind-modifying effects would come about when your brain is being destroyed. Quantum immortality doesn't mean guaranteed humanity, wholeness, or mental health. It just means that you never stop observing. Ever.
