For the cautious, like myself, there is a different procedure to follow under the Ship of Theseus. It's called the Moravec procedure [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading][(Gradual Replacement on Wikipedia)]], and it's designed to effect digital upload with no discontinuity in consciousness or awareness. The brain is gradually eaten by nanotechnology, and the parts that are consumed are simulated by a computer and interact with the remainder of your organic brain while it is being consumed.

You function entirely normally throughout the procedure, and in the end you are an entirely digital mind, without ever doing so much as falling asleep or going under anesthetic. Still not something to follow if you believe that "quantum" plays some magical effect in personhood, identity, consciousness, or whatever the hell people call the soul nowadays, but it is sufficient to cover the objection you lay out in the OP.

This is borne out of a concern for some special internal reference frame. I consider copies to be the same as the original in every respect from the outside (barring actual technical differences in the behavior of the mind), but I have never left my brain (besides my dissolution under anesthetic and /maybe/ during sleep), so I am still somewhat concerned about leaving it within a discontinuity. The only times I've considered discontinuous upload for myself, I was more suicidal than less, so at the very least it is something I would have to change my intuition on, and I don't have enough evidence about discontinuities that already happen (general anesthesia, /maybe/ sleep) to convince myself on that point.
