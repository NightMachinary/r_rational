Hmm. Perhaps. Wetware makes things complicated - anything capable of suppressing electrical activity to the point of dispersing the overall pattern would most likely also damage the cells.

I'd like to think that it'd be possible to construct a copy of a brain cell-by-cell, load each cell with the correct levels of assorted biochemicals and electrical potential, and then let it all kick off. Tricky to not accidentally trigger something like an epileptic fit, though, although maybe it would be robust enough to settle down into normal operation?
