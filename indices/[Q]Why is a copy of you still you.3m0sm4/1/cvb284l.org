I think the traditional arguments on this notion that can be found elsewhere are strong, but if they have not persuaded you it might help you to think about it from this different perspective instead: I don't care about avoiding death per se so much as I 1. care about avoiding the painful and existentially unpleasant process of dying, and 2. care about getting to experience the enjoyable process of living. I can't see any sense in which death or nonexistence is bad that doesn't fall into one of those two categories. If that's so, then destructive uploading is no big deal. Do you see any third reason death is bad that I have missed here?
