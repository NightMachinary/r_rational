You're saying that you don't think destructive uploading satisfies 2. It causes a copy of you to experience the enjoyable process of living, but not you yourself to experience that process. I didn't anticipate this as a possible response, honestly. Maybe going into more detail will help get the intuition across better.

Under normal circumstances, when a human dies, they still exist as a dead body. Do you think that you would enjoy existing as a dead body? Likely not. Likely, you believe that personal identity in a moral sense is not found in the simple physical fact that mass and energy are conserved. Instead, you believe that your identity lies within the content within your mind. This is about information.

Similarly, like you, I care about my own experiences, not someone else's. But what makes an experience "mine"? I think that an experience is mine if external circumstances interact with my thoughts and feelings and memories. That is, if they interact with a particular pattern of information.

What is an "experience" in the first place? A certain kind of information.

If identity is information, then it does not make sense to say that information can be identical without identity being identical. To deny the equivalency is to say that identity is not information. For the reasons given in the above paragraphs, it seems like your value system commits you to the view that identity is indeed found within information.

Does this make more sense? If you disagree with the idea that identity is found within information, where would you place it instead? What additional pieces would you add to metaethics, and why are they necessary?
