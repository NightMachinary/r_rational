Your initial question was effectively asking people to explain what they think of as their self-identity, but this seems to be indicating that you already have an answer (your self-identity is your current physical body, rather than, say, your collection of memories, or your thought processes, or something else) and aren't especially interested in other opinions on it.

It's possible that's just how I'm reading this post and that's not what you meant, but that is how it comes across to me.
