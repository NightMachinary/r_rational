The one thing I've never quite understood of defenses of "continuity of consciousness" is what it's even an answer to, what requires it in this world, how a counterfactual world without it would differ from this world. I regularly have clear gaps in my continuity of consciousness; is there some important sense in which I should consider myself to have died?
