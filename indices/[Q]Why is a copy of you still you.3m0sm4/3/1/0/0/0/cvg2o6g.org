  The gold head only remembers the green heads, creating the illusion of a unique line through time, and the intuitive question, "Where does the line go next?" But it goes to both possible futures, and both possible futures will look back and see a single line through time. In many-worlds, there is no fact of the matter as to which future you personally will end up in. There is no copy; there are two originals.

  ...

  But on an ontologically fundamental level, nothing with a persistent identity moves through time.

  Even the braid itself is not ontologically fundamental; a human brain is a factor of a larger wavefunction that happens to factorize.

  Then what is preserved from one time to another? On an ontologically basic level, absolutely nothing.

  ...

  The computational pattern computes, "I think therefore I am". The narrative says, today and tomorrow, "I am Eliezer Yudkowsky, I am a rationalist, and I have something to protect." Even though, in the river that never flows, not a single drop of water is shared between one time and another.

  If there's any basis whatsoever to this notion of "continuity of consciousness"---I haven't quite given up on it yet, because I don't have anything better to cling to---then I would guess that this is how it works.

Could you elaborate on how you do not, then? Otherwise, it doesn't seem like you've explained yourself very well.
