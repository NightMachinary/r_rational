  I doubt I would be nearly so reticent about copy-and-transfer once I was actually uploaded

At least the version of you in the computer might not be, probably depending whether or not it was your decision to put yourself in the computer. Then again, it might not be a untampered copy, they might just have programmed you to think you wanted that yourself. We probably have the tech at that point.

If you were an uploded mind, would you have any way to know you are a perfect copy? No. Even if you do have a consciousness, you might be missing some of your memories, but still experience things. You still probably would not mind being experiencing things. You are you even if you had less memories, just as you are you today and you will be you tomorrow, though you have different memories. You might not be the same you, though you arguably have the same consciousness and point of reference.

Might also depend a lot on what kind of system you were put into. Something in somewhere without any connection to anywhere else, so you might still die?
