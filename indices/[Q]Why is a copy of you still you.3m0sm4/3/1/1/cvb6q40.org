If you're uploadable with 100% fidelity, then you are, or possess a 1:1 mapping to, an algorithm. In this case, the continuation of your consciousness is simply whenever that algorithm progresses a certain minimum amount. Continuity holds as long as the upload is correctly synchronized*, whether that next step is executed in 5 picoseconds, 1 hour, or 1000 years from now.

* ie. no further mental activity occurs in your physical brain past the point at which its state is captured.

If you are not (1:1 mappable to) an algorithm, then a) the question of continuity of consciousness is moot because what is uploaded cannot be the same as you, and b) you are most likely physics defying and may be about to disappear in a puff of logic ;)

I am assuming for the sake of argument that you believe human consciousness is computable, since your question implies that.
