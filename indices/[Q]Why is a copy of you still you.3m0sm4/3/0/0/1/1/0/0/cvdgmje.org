I'd rather there wasn't a handgun, because hey, why not two copies? But sure, I'd shoot myself if I got confirmation of receipt. If there exists a copy of my pattern elsewhere, the only value to "me" is the unique local interactions and the memories that I've diverged, which would be maybe a day at most. (The longer this goes on, the less I'd shoot myself.)
