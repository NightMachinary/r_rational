Suppose that we replace the instantaneous deconstruction component of the teleporter with a handgun. Now, I'll concede that if I /had/ to choose between being instantaneously deconstructed or being shot to death with a handgun, I'd choose the former, because it's a less unpleasant experience. But that's obscuring the reason that you'd choose just about any non-death thing over being instantaneously deconstructed - because you don't want to experience death.

Would you enter a teleporter that copies you over here, recreates you somewhere else, and shoots the version of you at the starting location to death with a handgun? I guess their instantaneous deconstruction mechanism must be broken.
