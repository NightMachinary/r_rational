Yeah but it's not a messy painful death - it's just a spontaneous ceasing to exist. And a you is still around. Our intuitions are not well suited for this situation.

Imagine I run two copies of you. I leave them running in perfect lockstep. Then I turn one off.

Try to explain to me how what just happened is /bad/.

Imagine being in the experience of that copy. You're just happily existing along - when suddenly, nothing whatsoever bad-feeling happens, and a version of you who had the /exact same experience up until that moment/ happily goes about their day. How is that a different person? It can't even /indexically/ be considered a different one, since you are literally incapable of diverging.

This is the part that I don't get. /Why on earth/ would you choose, when deciding "for both", to identify with the version that stops existing? It has no outside benefit- and the inside is identical.
