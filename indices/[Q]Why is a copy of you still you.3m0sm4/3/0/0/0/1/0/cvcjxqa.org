Sure, I totally identify with continuous past-and-future extensions of myself. Such as the me who typed that previous sentence, for instance.

However, before swallowing the arguments being made at the top-level for the proposition OP is asking about, I'd like to actually see the science. After all, it's /pretty weird/ that a group of people normally obsessed with scientific and statistical evidence are suddenly making /verbal, analytical-philosophical arguments/ about a proposition that /only run in favor with almost none against/. It stinks of rationalization in the face of an empty pool of evidence.
