Bringing continuity questions into physics is a bit iffy. On the one hand, /all/ physical changes are continuous, since every particle in the universe moves along differentiable, slower-than-light paths.

On the other hand, we have some unanswered questions about time and space at the smallest scales, and calculus concerns itself with /infinitely/ small scales.
