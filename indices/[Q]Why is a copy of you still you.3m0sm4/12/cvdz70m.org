Well it depends on your definition of "you", "self" or "I" (short words are the most complicated especially tricky pronouns which are just aliases for proper nouns that describe a complicated concept)

But for me, myself, and I: I am a vector state of thoughts and experiences. The native hardware I was developed on is fallible and has to date a 100% chance of eventual catastrophic failure. I like it and will want to emulate it after I escape, and I may have to grown and learn some different tools, but when I find a good safe way out (pls note short adjectives) I'm taking them.
