True -- I totally agree. You (v1.0) generally don't want to die.

  Destructive mind uploading, essentially creates a copy of you (v2.0) in a computer, and destroys your original mind. I mean its great and all that a copy of you (v2.0) still loves on, but the original you still dies. You(v1.0) still died, what's so great about that? I mean if I died I wouldn't care if I had a copy or not because I would be dead. So why would you guys say that a copy of you is still you?

v1.0 = v2.0. They are equivalent from an identity standpoint, until they diverge, based on experiences... or death on arrival.
