Nobody actually knows, it's just a guess.

These things get reasonably complicated once you have multiple copies of a person and have to decide whether the death of one of them matters as much as the death of someone else.

There are just a few standard "solutions" (guesses) as to the answer -

- just this copy (but how do you distinguish "this" copy in certain edge cases?)

- as long as one copy survives (but would you really be OK with dying just because a copy somewhere else lives?)

- as long as one copy "descended" from this one survives (implies odd shifts over as your fellow copies are merely "descended" from past!you, no current!you)

- radical rejection of "identity" (almost impossible for humans, leads to people rejecting death-is-bad because it's "illogical")

Stuff like that.
