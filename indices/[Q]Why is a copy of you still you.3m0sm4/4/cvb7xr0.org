It's partially a language problem. "You" is used to mean your individual self, but also used to mean "The organism which exhibits all the characteristics of yourself". As these tend to refer to the same thing pretty much 100% of the time outside of very specific SF works, there's never really been a need to separate the meanings, which is why it's easy to pose identity-based questions which are ambiguous about what they're talking about.

I find that a good analogy is to expand the idea of self to encompass a group or team of individual instances. We see this today in the form of companies - a company representative can be referred to as if they are the company, in many circumstances: "Oh, we had a meeting with BigCorp the other day" (i.e. we had a meeting with a /individual representative of BigCorp/).

So imagine the corporation of Alice. There might be two individuals, there might be a hundred. All are considered sufficiently Alice-like to be considered part of Alice. Any individual Alice-instance can be considered as their own person, but also in the context of them being an Alice.

In the case you mention, there is no confusion - the original Alice-instance is destroyed in a manner where they do not experience post-destruction continuity. The new Alice-instance is not the old one, but they are still /an/ Alice - and from an external perspective they are probably sufficiently Alice-like that they inherit the Alice relationships in existence.

Think of a major corporation which changes CEOs - the original CEO could be retired, or doing something else, or dead, but the corporation they helmed is still in existence and maintains all its legal agreements, resources, debts, contracts etc. From an external perspective, it hasn't changed.
