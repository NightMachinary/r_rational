A second copy of me is still me for all the reasons the first copy ever was.

I'm sad that a first copy was destructively uploaded, because it means there's not two of me, which I would vastly prefer. But once I'm uploaded I can't imagine there being much of a barrier to making more copies. Even if I do keep them in stasis as backups.
