Along with givewell as others have mentioned, if you care about animal suffering, some of that money could be sent to Animal Charity Evalutators: [[https://animalcharityevaluators.org/]]

I feel like $100b would probably be more than enough to research a way to get lab-grown meat at a scale large enough to be price competitive, which would essentially end factory farming and the suffering of billions of animals each year. It'd be a one time investment that solves a heckload of suffering (and no doubt a lot of nutrition issues in low-income countries like kawashikor/marasmus).

That said, suggestions like MIRI would be good too for the moonshot angle. I'd probably put $200m in ACE, give MIRI an endowment fund to last for 20 years (so maybe another $200m if we give them ~$10m a year), and put the remaining $600m wherever GiveWell recommends. Maybe reduce GiveWell's portion and distribute it in 5x $200m packages, to animal suffering, givewell, and 3x X-Risk charities (maybe include one to vaccinate pertussis or something out of existence?).
