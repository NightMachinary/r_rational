That's... a step too far. [[/r/science]] discusses papers, and unfortunately that gets really horrible really quickly. [[http://explosm.net/comics/3557/][Too many people don't love science, they love looking at its butt when it walks by.]]

And I don't mean "too many" as in, "the users here are bad and like that". I mean that if we opened up the sub that way, we would basically be flashing science's butt in front of a mass user base, who would then flood in to look at it.

Actually discussing papers from a level of even amateur fluency, by the way, tends to suffer the opposite problem: it's really hard to get two people in a room who understand the same paper unless you've got a community of experts. It turns into one person lecturing everyone else.
