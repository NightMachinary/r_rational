Well, here's the perspective I act on, hence the one I actually believe: 90% of what academia produces is shit. The difference is that you can't tell which 90% /ahead of time/.

I've published a shitty paper. I'm also reading a thesis that makes me stare out at the mainstream of a whole field yelling, "WHEN ARE YOU IDIOTS GOING TO DROP YOUR STUPID FAD AND CATCH UP!?" At the same time, I can see where the thesis author is cutting a corner or two and making some simplifications in order to finally fucking graduate -- but their results still stand in stark contrast to the field's mainstream paradigm.
