If I had $100 billion to distribute I would do a pretty ridiculous amount of research and consulting with people, but I would be surprised if I didn't end up giving at least a billion each to both [[https://intelligence.org/][MIRI]] and [[http://www.sens.org/][SENS]] who are working on what I percieve to be very important problems from promising angles and are heavily underfunded considering that.
