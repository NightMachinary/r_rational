That's a pretty reasonable perspective. But I'd also say it's true for pretty much any group. Academia also has a bunch of other perverse incentives causing trouble, and a bunch of people going into it for entirely the wrong reasons.

I mean, it's probably the best thing out there, but I stand by my opinion that academic culture causes a bunch of problems, and is probably something you want to mostly avoid if you're doing serious research and you /can/ mostly avoid it.

Is it an AI paper? Give me a reference.
