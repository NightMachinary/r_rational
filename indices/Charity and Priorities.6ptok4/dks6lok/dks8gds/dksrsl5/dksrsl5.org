To put this with the most possible /niceness/ towards people who are literally on this subreddit and will probably read this comment...

Has anyone tried paying the MIRI folks to go train at rather more productive institutions? I know most of them have PhDs by now, but come on, guys. The academic process and scientific method exist for very real reasons as applied to actually-existing humans, and reciting the formulas for Solomonoff Induction like Psalms is not going to make you anything other than an actually-existing human.

If you truly believe in dedicating yourself to solving the problems you care about, go subject yourself to being trained and/or beaten-up until you can demonstrate to a broad community that you're producing useful, understandable research.

If you truly believe that advocacy is the most effective way forward for the things you care about, become an excellent advocate for your cause, like McKaskill or even freaking Bostrom.

If you just wanna do you, keep at exactly what you're doing, since you're already you.
