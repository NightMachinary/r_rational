How latest is latest? I've read the one about logical inductors, I've read papers that came earlier than that, and I might have checked more recently than late 2016 or early 2017.

I like their work on the Loebian obstacle, but IMHO they need to find a way to generalize it. Several people have asked them, why work with first-order logical systems? They've said: because those make it easy to express [[http://www.retrologic.com/jargon/Q/quine.html][quining]], and therefore to express reasoning about systems that can quine themselves and how to reason reflectively (ie: under quining).

In the same way that most paradox theorems reduce to a fixed-point theorem or a theorem about needing some number of Halting Oracles, I'd like to see the various good results MIRI has produced on /individual/ forms of Loebian reasonig generalized into a single "Quining Problem" to which all other quined-reasoning problems can be computationally reduced. It seems like Logical Inductors might be heading in this direction, but even then I'd like to see a more computational phrasing -- just because I think an infinite loop is a "deeper" phenomenon than unprovability of reflective theorems.

I've also seen much of their work on decision theory, including the recent one on Functional Decision Theory. After a long period of thinking about it, including attending in-person sessions about it, I don't like it. I have a fairly specific set of reasons /why/ I don't like it, and here, in short, I'll just say that I disagree with some of the premises, and discussions have tended to get deep into the weeds and wind back a whole load of premises I don't share with people who like the decision-theory research. If you want to hash that out on a PM, we can, but I'm going to stop here. Elaborating reasons why I think their research is unhelpful on a reddit comment, without the professional philosophy and cogsci chops to explain why I think a whole subfield is /just wrong/, is an unkind waste of everyone's time.
