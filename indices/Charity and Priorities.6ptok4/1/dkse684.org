As mentioned elsewhere, GiveWell is among the most rigorous metacharities out there. In all honesty, I trust in the competency of people who's life work is evaluating charities over my own in regards to maximizing utility. So if I really had a hundred billion I'd shoot them an email and ask for advice, or maybe just give it to them straight up to redistribute at their discretion.
