I was just wondering if there was any preexisting work done on it; if anyone had taken a crack at HPMOR-ing(?) the series.

It would certainly be interesting.

Stibbons does make for a great rationalist character, although he was never explored in depth. Rincewind was fun, but he's not exactly rational, just cynical and terrified, and Granny is one of the most thought provoking characters of the series, and that saying something, but does not attempt to deconstruct the underlying laws of that universe.

It would be hard writing anything that would be as good or atmospheric as the novels were, but if it were accomplished, it would be very interesting to read.
