Well, there are rationalist characters like Ponder Stibbons, and many characters, like Rincewind, Granny Weatherwax, and really everyone to some degree is aware of the rules of the universe, understands something of their nature, and bases their actions sensibly around those rules. At the same time, the rules of the universe defy demystification, or else they are already demystified: the world runs on narrative causality because people think it does. So what do you want to see explored or done?
