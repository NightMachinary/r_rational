I mostly agree but Discworld does tend to show characters exploiting the laws of their universe (e.g. narrativium and million-to-one chances) to their advantage. Yes, this is played for laughs but that's because the entire premise of Discworld is played for laughs.

  The books do not put emphasis on characters thinking things through and solving their problems that way; even when characters do do this, their thought process is only shown (if at all) for the sake of humour, not for the sake of showing good thinking technique.

I haven't read all the Discworld books (yet), but the Tiffany Aching books definitely do it for the sake of showing good thinking technique.
