Oh, come on, let's not make "rationalist" just another word for "fiction we like". The Discworld doesn't even fall much into "rational" fiction, except in as far as "rational" overlaps with "having well-developed and believable characters and events".

The books do not put emphasis on characters thinking things through and solving their problems that way; even when characters do do this, their thought process is only shown (if at all) for the sake of humour, not for the sake of showing good thinking technique. The world admits very little scientific study, and bends itself this way and that to make the plot work; you're not going to have any luck with demystification or solving the story as a puzzle.
