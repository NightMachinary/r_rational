So, you're looking for more of a munchkin story taking place in the discworld settings? Because if you don't define what it is you're calling "rationalist" vs "rational", it's going to be very difficult for anyone to reasonably discuss the topic.

A large majority of the characters in the series already feel like they are doing the best that they can given what they have access to.

I suppose one potential story that might fit what you're looking for would be an explicit story detailing the "adventures" of Vetinari between the events of Night Watch and his actually becoming Patrician.
