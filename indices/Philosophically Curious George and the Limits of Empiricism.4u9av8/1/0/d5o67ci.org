I still think that articles fails to consider that we can learn from patterns in our observations, as well as the literal content of our observations. Though it appears that I am putting two headphones together with two headphones to get 3 headphones, I am fairly certain that I could puzzle out I seem to be perceiving a single additional illusory headphone, based on the behavior of said headphones.

Not that empirical observation isn't still key in order to putting mathematics to any actual use. Two plus two equals four because we say so, but that only means anything in a concrete sense because we consistently observe behavior in the world which it models well (mostly because, as you say with Geometry, because we designed it be a decent model to begin with).

Because something bothered me about how I phrased this, I put it in slightly more metaphorical terms.

You can't disprove a hammer does what hammers do, but you can disprove that your problem is a nail.
