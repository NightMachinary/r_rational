  is that words are noisy statistical symbolized optimized for coding length
#+end_quote

I have to know, was this on purpose? This doesn't parse for me, but I got your meaning anyway. Did you do that to demonstrate the noisy, coding-length optimised symbolism, or was it accidental?

(in particular 'symbolized' comes out of nowhere)

Aside: I don't think "optimised for coding length" is accurate. A lot of language is optimised for being self-correcting. You have redundancies in grammar, word choice, phrasing that make it possible to capture meaning even if you can't understand every single thing someone's saying. This is of course at the cost of coding length.

A language optimised for coding length would not have one or two-letter combinations not assigned to a meaning.
