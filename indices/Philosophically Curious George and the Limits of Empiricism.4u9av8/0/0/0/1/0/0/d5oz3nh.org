  I think maybe somewhere along the line some influential person had a compelling but wrong idea and it somehow mislead philosophers from the intuitive and correct idea?

Yes. The compelling but wrong idea was, "Once you clean them up and apply context, words are like symbols in a formal logical calculus: they precisely indicate a single, precise referent." This runs contrary to what the entire rest of linguistics ever since has found, which is that words are noisy statistical symbolized optimized for coding length.
