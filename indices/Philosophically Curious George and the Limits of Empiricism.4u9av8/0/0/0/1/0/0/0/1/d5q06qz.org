Isn't it generally a tradeoff between both? Our abbreviated words / portmanteaus are invariably based on existing words (so they satisfy both length and self-correctability). Occasionally a portmanteau becomes more legitimate than its roots, and then itself becomes a candidate for portmanteauing.

That said, my impression of everyday English language favors coding length somewhat (people generally say short things and complain if misunderstood, rather than saying somewhat longer, more explicit things.)
