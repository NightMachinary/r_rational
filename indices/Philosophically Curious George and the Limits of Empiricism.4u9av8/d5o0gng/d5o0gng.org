I might just have an unsophisticated opinion, but there's something about this comic that irks me.

Finding out that 5 - 3 = 2 wasn't magic, it happened because he counted bananas and fingers. Just because you can abstract that information and come to the conclusion that 5 - 3 = 2 is universally true, doesn't mean that it's not an empirical fact that was arrived at by observation. If you make a deduction and also realize that 6 - 4 = 2 without going out and counting things again, well that's because you got the empirical basis right in the first place. You deductions are only as good as your premises, and to get those right you have to go out and look! This doesn't defeat empiricism. If you didn't go out and look at the world, you wouldn't notice that there's a difference between discrete and continuous quantities and you'd be tripped up when someone asked you "Why do two puddles equal one puddle when added together? Does this make your math false?".

Then, it seems like he goes on to treat categories like they're real things floating out there in the abyss, rather than properties of brains that can't avoid classifying things. There are soft, red candles that smell like roses too! Categories fall apart when you prod them hard enough, they aren't these ideal things that you arrived at without looking at the universe! To think that you came to this idea of a candle without your senses seems blatantly silly to me, a blind and deaf person would never have that concept without being told about it. People get caught up in these classification problems like "Is it still a candle if I don't use wax?", and /that should be a hint, people/. A hint that we're making it up as we go along, and if a candle was a platonic ideal then you shouldn't be able to create an object where half the attributes point to "candle" and half the attributes point to "not candle".
