Ok, before I write anything else, it's worth noting that /I absolutely freaking love you guys on this sub/. Like, I drop a one-liner, and two other people come in with the /pinpoint correct/ objection to the comic.

That said, it's worth giving credit to the comic for just being about the history of philosophy as commonly taught to, most likely, undergrads. Philosophers working several hundred years ago didn't possess concepts like "causal role", "discrete versus continuous", "reduction", or "causal generative model", let alone disciplines like topology or information theory.

Hell, the way that abstract knowledge and domains emerge from the hierarchical correlation structure in empirically-observed data has /only just these past few years/ become readily apparent, to the point that I can still (somewhat) write a paper about it and be (almost, mostly) saying something novel.

Point being, freaking love you guys.
