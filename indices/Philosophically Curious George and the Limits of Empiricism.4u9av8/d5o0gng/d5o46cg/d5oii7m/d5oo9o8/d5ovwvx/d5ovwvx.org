Honestly, that's just how I've always thought about categories before I had ever heard of lesswrong or was exposed to any philosophy in general. It never occurred to me to think of it in any other way.

The meaning of words is rich with connotations and associations. The dictionary just attempts as best as possible to define what we mean by the words. I feel like this fact should be instantly apparent to anyone who has ever been asked to define a word or translate a word to a speaker of another language. The hard part is more making the belief explicit rather than an implicit background assumption. If I were to ask a random high schooler this question... well I'd have to do some thinking about how to phrase a question like this but I think they would give the right answer.

I think maybe somewhere along the line some influential person had a compelling but wrong idea and it somehow mislead philosophers from the intuitive and correct idea?
