Right, yes, I didn't mean to go too far in the other direction. What I wanted to point out is that there's multiple tradeoffs in every language, it's not all just coding length.

Another tradeoff, for example, is how fast people speak. Languages that are spoken more rapidly (like spanish) tend to have more redundancy in their grammar.

Generally there's a pretty set limit in how fast people can actually ingest verbal information; languages make different tradeoffs in terms of how it's transmitted.
