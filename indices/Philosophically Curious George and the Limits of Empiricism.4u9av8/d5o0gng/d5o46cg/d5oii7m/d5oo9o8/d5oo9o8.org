  If that's true then I guess previous innovations turn into a culture's subconscious background assumptions really fast

LW is a subculture whose founder happens to have reinvented (I'm not sure if he did it independently of Friston et al's theoretical neuroscience work) much of what later became the Bayesian Brain Theory, which has very clear implications regarding how categories and such work, without quite ever becoming a neuroscientist.

Or he may just have been transcribing the neurosci literature into the Sequences. I can't date and cross-reference all of it; I just think with the benefit of hindsight that Eliezer should have bothered publishing a lot of his ideas as "real" statistics, information theory, and machine-learning so he could get his name on what're now the best-in-class theories of how minds work.
