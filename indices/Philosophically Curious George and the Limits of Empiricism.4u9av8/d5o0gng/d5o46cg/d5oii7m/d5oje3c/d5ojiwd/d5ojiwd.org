Well yeah but that's Plato and he's an ancient. I assume he's mostly the foil against which new philosophers cut their teeth against than an actual representation of what people seriously think?

I feel like the naive view would automatically tend to the (ostensibly) correct one, and platonism is what you get if you think about it too hard and end up confusing yourself with your own semantics, but that might just be because I've been encultured with that view or something.

Heh, maybe "thinking so hard they get confused by their own semantics" describes a lot of philosophers actually.
