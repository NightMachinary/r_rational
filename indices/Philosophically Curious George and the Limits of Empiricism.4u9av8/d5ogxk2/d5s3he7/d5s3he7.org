I thought the ladybird was illustrating that empiricism doesn't bootstrap itself. You need a lot of background knowledge before you can empirically observe "there is a ladybird on the ground". And every part of this background knowledge, in turn, requires its own library of background knowledge before it can be empirically observed. The recursion bottoms out somewhere. There must be pieces of knowledge that you didn't acquire through observation of the outside world.
