I take issue with the comic as a whole (as I do most of those on that site), but the bit about the concept of time in particular annoyed me.

No, you don't need the concept of time to make observations about things changing. Look at something twice and you have observed a change in time, even if you do not know what time is. You don't need to have a concept of something to be subject to it, otherwise the concept of ignorance would be incoherent.

Naturally, once you have observed a change you can keep exploring the concept to discover that the rate of change appears unrelated to many things, like whether you are awake or asleep, bored or excited, running fast or standing still (for non-relativistic speeds of course). Maybe it's an external phenomenon, then.

Further, you can create a little device that "ticks" at a predictable rate and use that to measure the rate of other things and thus build up a vast and coherent picture of the concept. Heck, you might even find a more reliable "ticker" than your original idea if your results have errors.

In essence, not only is time a perfect concept for empirical study, our concept of it has been empirically improved since we initially developed it (see relativity).

And a brief bit about the ladybug: yes, you may need a lot of concepts to be able to understand a particular new concept. As the saying goes, no shit Sherlock. Breaking down a problem and studying its component concepts is kinda one of the core tenets of empiricism.
