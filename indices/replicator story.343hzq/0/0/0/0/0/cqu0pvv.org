They have the source code to the replicators that have been built by the lowest contractor. They can look for other holes in the code. Maybe they can use the replicator to push down a level of simulation, like Peer and Kate in /Permutation City/. Maybe they can find other implied spaces like the Jefferies Tubes that have to exist long term, but have spare computational capacity assigned to them. Maybe they can copy themselves to another simulation which needs more long-term extras if they can get over the existential issues of local death.
