I kind of forgot that I had shared that one. It never really got properly working, for reasons that are still a little opaque to me (which goes for something like half a million words worth of stuff that's sitting in Google Docs instead of out in the world). It's not actually Star Trek fanfic, which would just make it a let down for someone who came across it on ff.net. I really like the core idea, of a bunch of roleplayers running around in a version of Star Trek built by the lowest bidder, and a Wesley Crusher stand-in who's trapped there and has to hack his way out, but ... I don't know, maybe it's an idea that I'll attack from another direction at a later date.

It doesn't read too poorly though, I don't think.
