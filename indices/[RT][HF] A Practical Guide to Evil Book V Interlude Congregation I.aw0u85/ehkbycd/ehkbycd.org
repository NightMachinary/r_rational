Well, this puts an end to the speculation about Brandon and the Bells being involved in a skism back in Callow. I thought it was bunk the whole time.

It didn't make sense to me that Brandon as an individual, the bells as an organization, and the martial nobility of Callow would break from the first real opportunity in decades to become a stable, independent Callowan monarchy. It also didn't make sense for them to move against the largest military force in Callow as well as the only Named with any positive ties to Callow.
