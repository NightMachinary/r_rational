Bit of a longshot, but here goes:

Is anyone else a fan of David Brin's Uplift saga? I'm interested in hard science fiction where humans uplift animals, not as slaves, but as companions and fellow citizens. Where humans do their best to try to pay homage to the essence of the animal that's brought to intelligence, preserving something of the unique point of view of that animal, while bringing them into the fullest flowering of what it means to be sentient.

Bonus points, of course, if at least one character is a good rationalist role model.
