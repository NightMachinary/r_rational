After binge-reading half a dozen Worm fanfictions, I thought I'd leave my impressions here for anyone else who enjoyed Worm and is looking for more in-universe content. These stories aren't generally super rational, but if you've read Worm you know what to expect. In no particular order:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wake-worm-au-complete.305014/][Wake]]: Basically a must-read if you liked Worm. These two completed stories follow a regular bug-controlling Taylor as she attempts to dismantle all of the gangs in Brockton Bay after her father is killed in a bombing spree. Probably the closest-to-source adaption of Taylor's personality, all around an excellent story.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/collagen-worm-altpower-complete.578045/][Collagen]]: An alt-power fic of Taylor with Marquis' power: creating and controlling bones. Another solid, completed story that sticks pretty close to the main story beats of the original, but with Taylor becoming an independent cape instead of joining the PRT or a villain team.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/acceleration-worm-au.284714/][Acceleration]]: Taylor gets the powers of Accelerator from ACMI. Pretty OP, and closer to a crack-fic than most others on the list, but I still found it enjoyable enough to read the entire thing.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/glassmaker-worm-complete.433391/][Glassmaker]] Pretty much the most wholesome thing you can think of. Its a short, slice-of-life style story about Taylor with the power to eat various materials and make stuff out of them. No conflict, just pure WAFF.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574944/1/Brockton-s-Celestial-Forge][Brockton's Celestial Forge]] A self-insert in the Worm universe of a new Tinker who is connected to Jumchains' Celestial Forge(?) instead of a regular shard. I'll admit I don't know much about the crossover material, but its essentially a large pool of various Tinker abilites from other fiction works. The story is ongoing and pretty solid, though I feel it suffers from spending more time explaining the new tinkering abilities than actually using them to make anything. Still, that's probably partially due to having to wait for weekly releases, which makes me impatient for more content. Despite all that it solidly caught my interest, so I'd recommend checking it out.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/it-gets-worse-worm-au-fanfic-complete.366768/][It Gets Worse]]: Very much a crack-fic, Taylor gets a different shard -- one that causes random unlucky events to happen to anyone who wishes her harm. Features incidents like death via falling piano and other such shenanigans. Quite amusing, if not terribly serious.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-friends-like-these-altpower-taylor-worm.312205/][With Friends Like These...]]: Controlling insects is too easy -- instead Taylor gains control of all three Endbringers, who spend most of the time in Chibi form in her backpack. Another lighthearted read that has lots of fun moments of other characters discovering exactly what her powers are.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/][A Cloudy Path]]: A Worm/Supreme Commander crossover where Taylor gains Tinker abilities related to making machines from the SC universe. Much more serious, similar to Cenotaph and Wake in exploring Taylor's personality and fears, while focusing on slow character growth. Its a very long story but unfortunately not complete, but despite that I'd still recommend taking a look if you like a more serious tone.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/alchemical-solutions-worm-exalted-story-only-thread.283060/][Alchemical Solutions]] The only quest (afaik) in the list, this is a Worm/Exalted crossover where Taylor dies in the locker and is reborn in a new Alchemical body. The story starts off similar to the source material, but around the time the S9 show up things start to spiral out of control.
