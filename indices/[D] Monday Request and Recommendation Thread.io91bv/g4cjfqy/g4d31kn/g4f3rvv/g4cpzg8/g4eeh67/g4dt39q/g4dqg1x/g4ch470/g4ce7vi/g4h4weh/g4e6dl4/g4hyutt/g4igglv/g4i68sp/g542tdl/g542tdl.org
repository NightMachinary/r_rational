The first two books of snake report are good, but the third book is still being written. Not sure if it counts.

Edit: also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13325886/1/Ascension][Pokemon: Ascension]] probably counts. It's the other rational pokemon story where all the pokemon are sentient. The MC is still Red, but several scenes are from his pokemon's view. It's great, but doesn't update that often. I've read Arc 1, but am waiting until Arc 2 is over to continue with the story.
