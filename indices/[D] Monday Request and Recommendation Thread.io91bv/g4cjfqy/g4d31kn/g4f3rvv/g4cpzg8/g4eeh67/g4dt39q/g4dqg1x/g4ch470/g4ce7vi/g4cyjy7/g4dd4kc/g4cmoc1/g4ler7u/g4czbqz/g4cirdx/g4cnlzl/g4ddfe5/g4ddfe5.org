I have. I thought it was decent. Some fans complained that the story was 'wrapped up in a hurry' but IMO some webnovel fans have an extremely skewed view of what constitutes 'in a hurry' - it was still a hefty novel or two's worth of chapters. I thought the ending was reasonably satisfying, gave decent explanations to story questions and wrapped up most of the loose ends.
