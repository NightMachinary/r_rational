I think like a lot of crossovers, it hits harder if you're invested in the other story. I played Supreme Commander, and played through the campaign, long before reading A Cloudy Path, which made me a lot more invested in the cross over bits than I would have been otherwise. I kinda knew what was coming, both on the tech side and the story side.
