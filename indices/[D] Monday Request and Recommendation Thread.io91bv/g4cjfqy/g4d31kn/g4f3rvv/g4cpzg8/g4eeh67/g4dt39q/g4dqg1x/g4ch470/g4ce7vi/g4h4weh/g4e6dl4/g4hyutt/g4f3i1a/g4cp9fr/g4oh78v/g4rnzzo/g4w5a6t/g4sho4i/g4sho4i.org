Personally I'm enjoying [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights With Monsters]] more than Delve. This wasn't the case initially, but HWFWM has steadily improved while Delve has steadily gotten worse, in my opinion.

I wouldn't say it's a must-read, but if you're looking for something after the two you mentioned, that's what I'd suggest.
