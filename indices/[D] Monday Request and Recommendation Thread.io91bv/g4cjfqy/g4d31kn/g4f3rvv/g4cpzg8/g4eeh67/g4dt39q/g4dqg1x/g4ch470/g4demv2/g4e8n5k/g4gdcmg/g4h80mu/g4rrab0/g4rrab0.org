Gonna rec [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11820074/1/][Thaumaturgic Awakening]] here. Fate/Stay Night cross featuring Shirou/Rin/Saber in post UBW!Good route. Mainly features Taylor learning how to be a hero under the tutaluge of the familiar trio. Mainly rational in that it does a fantastic job of merging Worm with Nasuverse lore.

Character interactions between the three world hoppers, Taylor, and Tattletale make up the majority of this, and it's a great time, if a little unappealing to those without at least basic knowledge of F/SN.
