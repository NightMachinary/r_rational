[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/any-colour-you-like-mtg-multicross.378926/][Any Color You Like]] has an MTG mage become a familiar to Louise Valliere. It's pretty entertaining, and the main character is really powerful compared to his peers.

Inexorable Chaos on Royalroad is also like that, with the main character being OP but disconnected from the overall plot. It's not as good, but a good binge.
