Seeing [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] mentioned reminds me of a long-running question that I have no simple way to ask, because the concept doesn't exist in our baseline culture and has a lot of distracting wrong neighbors, but I'm going to ask it anyways: What fiction have you read that is written for the /cognitively intelligent/ reader?

This is distinct from many distracting-wrong-neighbor concepts like "Author mentions technical stuff you're supposed to have prior knowledge about" or "The characters in the story are told to play excellent chess" or "The story contains stuff that is difficult to understand because it is ambiguous bullshit". So far as I can tell, indeed, our baseline culture has no standard word that means "cognitive intelligence" in the sense that I defined it for "intelligent characters", which is why no such branch of literature exists; it has prior concepts only for status-markers vaguely associated in some way with cognitive horsepower, like big science words, playing chess, being educated, saying stuff that sounds hard to understand but like you are supposed to understand it, having high status in a scientific field, i.e., what a normal person would call "smart", which in standard-culture literature does not especially connote a character who correctly solves the many implicit cognitive challenges of a story.

What fiction have you read (besides Fall of Doc Future) that assumes the reader is cognitively intelligent, without that being a matter of demanding the reader have prior technical knowledge?
