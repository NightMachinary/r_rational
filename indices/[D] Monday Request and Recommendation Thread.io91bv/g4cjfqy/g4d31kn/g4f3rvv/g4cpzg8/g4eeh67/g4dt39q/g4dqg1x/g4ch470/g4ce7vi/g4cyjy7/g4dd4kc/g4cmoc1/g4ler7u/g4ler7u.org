For Kill Them All,

Gallant saves the world. In the most recent dozen or so chapters, Taylor is using empathy, telepathy, and learning from other heroes (and Mr. Rogers!) that the baddies are real people, to build instead of destroy, etc. It makes her uncomfortable and distraught, as much as that gets through Gamer's Mind.

I think Shayne is building up to an epic reversal on his usual take.
