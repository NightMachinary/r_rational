Not quite what you're looking for but maybe [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-breath-of-fire-iii.57643/]] ?

Or maybe any Culture novel with a Mind in it? If you've never read any of that before, I usually recommend /Player of Games/ to start.
