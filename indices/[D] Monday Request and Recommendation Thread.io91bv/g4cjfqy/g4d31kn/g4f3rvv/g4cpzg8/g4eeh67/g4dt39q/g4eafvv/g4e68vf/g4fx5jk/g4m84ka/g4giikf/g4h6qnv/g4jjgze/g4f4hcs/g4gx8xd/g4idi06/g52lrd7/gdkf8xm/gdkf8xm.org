This almost certainly isn't what you're looking for, but I think Joyce's /Ulysses/ falls neatly into this category.

One would need to have a classical British education and speak at least a few languages (including a couple dead ones) to even come close to understanding /every/ mythic allusion, untranslated snippet or nod to folklore. But I also imagine that comprehension/enjoyment of the book scales fairly well with "cognitive intelligence," just based on the sheer amount of wordplay and literary techniques he uses. Good memory and close reading skills are also rewarded.

As mentioned, certain niche areas of expertise will have outsize contributions to a given reader's enjoyment; as a lifelong Greek mythology buff I got a lot of mileage out of the whole Odyssey framework. Intimate knowledge of the Old and New Testaments, the history of Ireland, or the minutiae of Roman Catholic dogma/tradition/psalms would also be of great use. But even without any such specific knowledge, just having a good vocabulary and command of English (both linked to but obviously not the same as cognitive intelligence) will grant a better understanding of the book.

Just in case you end up reading it, I highly recommend reading certain parts aloud. Joyce was very aware of the Odyssey's origins as an oral tradition, and much of /Ulysses/ is written to be harmonious when read aloud.
