Wasn't the reason nobody read Greg Egan's /Incandescence/ that it was basically about deriving a system of mathematical physics on the go? Also I wonder if there's stuff in pre-WWII literary fiction that qualifies. Thinking of stuff by people like Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Borges and Proust who have some pretty complex stuff going with the plots and assume that the reader can keep up.
