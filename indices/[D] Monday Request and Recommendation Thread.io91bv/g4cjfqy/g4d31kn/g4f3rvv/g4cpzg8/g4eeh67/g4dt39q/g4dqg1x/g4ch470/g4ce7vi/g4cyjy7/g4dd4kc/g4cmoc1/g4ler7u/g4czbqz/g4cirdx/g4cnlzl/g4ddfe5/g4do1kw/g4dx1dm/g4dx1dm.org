Once story got beyond fairly simple engineering advances, the author needed a way for the hero to get his hands on a whole lot of engineers real quick to work on the advanced stuff, because he exhausted that capacity in the 'real' world.

Why it was a dream world specifically and what was that about was also explained fairly well, IMO, in the final revelations.
