That's how 40k Imperial Navy macrocannons work, I always assumed - they aren't gravitic (speciality of the Eldar) and they also aren't railguns (Tau only), and behave a lot like normal chemical-projectile cannons except that they fling solid thousand ton shells at many thousands of kilometres per second, far beyond the detonation velocity of any chemical explosive.

Explanation:

There is an inertial compensator in the cannon barrel, designed for incredibly high power output over a short time, the shell is manually loaded and fires its powder charge and imparts a certain momentum to the round, then the pulsed inertial compensation triggers while the round is leaving the barrel, mass goes down by a factor of 1000 and velocity goes from 1 to 1000 km/s. Extra kinetic energy (because v^{2)} comes from the power cells in the barrel. Fusion of giant guns and the highest of high technology is very 40k, apart from anything else - railguns are a far simpler technology, but /they/ are tech-heresy and there's no STC template for them, but inertial suppression is required for all ships in the Navy and must be used anyway.
