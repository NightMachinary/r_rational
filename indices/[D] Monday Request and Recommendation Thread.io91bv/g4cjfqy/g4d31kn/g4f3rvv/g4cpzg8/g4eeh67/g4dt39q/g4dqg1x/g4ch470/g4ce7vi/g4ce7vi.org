Putting in a request for stories that have kingdom building/societal restructuring as a primary conflict.

The list of stories I'm familiar with include:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][Significant Digits]](HPMOR, finished): Rat!Harry and co tries to reshape society after the end of HPMOR. I find the complexity of the plots to strain plausibility a little.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/#post-27571185][Purple Days]](ASOIF, ongoing): Timelooped Joffrey that tries to gather Westeros to battle the night army. Does a good job at instilling a sense of awe and comraderie but it's a little difficult to get into MC's head.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gospel-of-the-lost-gods-asoiaf-worm.760033/#post-58501312][Gospel of the New Gods]](ASOIF/Worm, ongoing): Isekai Taylor and a hero team to the world of ASOIF in which they call themselves gods and try to create a community for themselves. Interesting and believable politics and intergroup conflicts that are phrased so I end up caring about them. The author have a billion ongoing stories and I feel somewhat doubtful that it'll finish.
- Worth the Candle(Isekai/metanarrative rpg, ongoing) has super interesting elements of kingdom building but they are not the focus and there are so many (exciting) things happening that the kingdom building parts takes a background role.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/#post-65418408][Kill them all]](Worm/Gamer, ongoing): Taylor with powercopying gamer powers that can travel to other fictions. It has an ongoing plotline that is continually brought up with involve building a community in an apocalypse zombie-infested world. The murderhobo mentality and the self-righteous attitude feels like a strawman for the argument of killing villains, and frankly it's grating, but I've been able to roll with it so far.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time/chapter/477232/chapter-1-beginnings][An advance in time]](Isekai/upload, No update in 3 month so dead?): A guy is accidentally uploaded with a high tech 'modern' company and accepts a task to build a kingdom in a simulated 'medieval' world. Fair ammount of uplift. I enjoyed the kingdom building aspects and how insights in how the company tries to make money on it. Stopped updating just as it felt the ball were starting to really get rolling.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737/chapters/8979811/][Amalia]](Worm, complete): Panacea starts actually using her power and collects a team of overpowered individuals. Aside from solving a bunch of problems and fighting end bringers with zerg-inspired monstrocities, there are some(if not enough) focus the politics of multiple dimensions and building a kingdom in one of them.
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A hero's War]](Isekai, dunno): I'm being told it's about uplift and while the MC does do some kingdom building I felt the kingdom building efforts dragged on without payoff and found it difficult to connect with the characters, so I stopped around chapter 50.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire/chapter/300519/prologue][Enlightened Empire]](Isekai, dunno): MC is isekaid into an exiled prince and after king dies he gets a piece of the kingdom and tries to build an uplifted kingdom. I threw it away around chapter 200 because the the incompetence of the antagonists(which a lot of the plot were centered around) became unbearable.
