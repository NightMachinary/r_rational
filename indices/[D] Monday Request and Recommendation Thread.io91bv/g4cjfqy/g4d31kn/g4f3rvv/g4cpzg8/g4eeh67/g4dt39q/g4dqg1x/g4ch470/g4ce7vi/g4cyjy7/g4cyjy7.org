  The murderhobo mentality and the self-righteous attitude feels like a strawman for the argument of killing villains, and frankly it's grating, but I've been able to roll with it so far.

Dunno, if you've read that author's other stories his main characters are all like that (to varying degrees), I think this is just how he rolls.

As for your request, I can recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/][The King in the Long Night]], where the xenophobic Human faction from Stellaris finds Westeros and decides to pull an uplift to recruit from the powerful local psykers. Great read, it doesn't only have the uplift conflict, but also conflict between local agents and their quasi-fascist government, as they get invested in the locals' lives more and more.
