What would you consider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity%27s_Rainbow][Gravity's Rainbow]] to be? I've always been puzzled as to how such an intractable book managed to get so much mainstream recognition. I'm grateful that it did because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, but I still suspect an "emperor's new clothes" deal must be going on.
