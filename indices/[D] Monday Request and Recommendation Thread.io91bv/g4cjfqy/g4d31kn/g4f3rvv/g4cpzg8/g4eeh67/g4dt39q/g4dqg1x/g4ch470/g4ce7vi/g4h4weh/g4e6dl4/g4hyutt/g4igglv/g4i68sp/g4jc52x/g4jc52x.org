  Non human how?

I'd say there should be two main elements.

1. The character has thought patterns and values distinct from human. E.g., Mud is a maximizer AGI dead set on trying to achieve a certain goal, and Shade Touched's MC is your typical LitRPG monster that was born with self-awareness and insatiable curiosity. Both of them have thought patterns that no human would have, and their goals are also quite different from what you would normally read in a fantasy.

2. The character being different as described above prevents them from fully integrating with human/other sapient society. Or, at least, prevents them from dealing with the same problem a human adventurer might have. (This is why I /didn't/ put Super Minion on the list; he tries his best to pass as a human, so I can easily see his late game being the same as for any other MC in a superhero setting.)
