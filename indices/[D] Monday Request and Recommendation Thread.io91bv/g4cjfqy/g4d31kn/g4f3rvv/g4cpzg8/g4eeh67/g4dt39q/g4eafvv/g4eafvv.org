That's an interesting question, and one I'm pretty sure that if you hadn't spelled it out I would have answered wrong. Certainly, there are books where you can get more out of them if you're smart; ones with hidden twists and easter eggs, where it's satisfying to work out what's going to happen before the story makes it clear. And there are books that are hard to read, and require dedication and intelligence to understand, but most of the examples of this are mostly like this because they're badly written and hard to understand; ie, ambiguous bullshit. And there are stories with mechanics designed to demand the readers have high intelligence, either as a whole or individually, but these are mostly in the form of quest or games linked with the story, where the intelligence is required to succeed at the game, not the story; if you're just reading a playthrough, or following a story only thread, no special intelligence is required on the part of the reader.

There's genuinely not a lot of fiction like this, because the incentive isn't really there. You're not going to see many TV shows like this, because the ultimate goal of a TV show is to get as many people to watch it (and, for the applicable shows, to buy as much merch) as it can, and restricting your demographic to "cognitively intelligent readers looking for cognitively intelligent targeted works" is small.

I think simply by virtue of the defining characteristics of what you're looking for, you're not going to find much in popular culture, especially the monetized bits of it. The closest things I can really think of along those lines are Umineko and Serial Experiments Lain, and neither one is exactly what you're asking for.
