It's been recommended or at least mentioned multiple times in these threads, though it has been a while. I got a fair ways in and enjoyed most of it, I just really hated the combat scenes. Each character gets a ton of abilities and when they are fighting together I found myself bored because there was too much to keep track of. It seemed like the characters were going to only get more bloated with abilities so I just stopped reading.
