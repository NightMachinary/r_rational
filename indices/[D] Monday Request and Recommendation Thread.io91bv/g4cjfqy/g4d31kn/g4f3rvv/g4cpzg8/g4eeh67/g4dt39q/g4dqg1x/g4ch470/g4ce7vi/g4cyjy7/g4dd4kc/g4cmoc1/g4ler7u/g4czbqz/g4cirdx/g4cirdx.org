Release that Witch is a Japanese +LN+ WN that is pretty much entirely focused on kingdom building/uplift. I haven't read the whole thing but what I did read was decent. There were some story beats that were a little /too/ convenient, but nothing that outright broke the story.

Life Reset/ New Era Online is a published Kindle Unlimited series originally on Royalroad that features a VRMMO player trying to build a settlement as a monster race. Solid, published-level writing and a cohesive story, though I felt it was missing a bit of that spark that some of those rougher works have. Still, nothing to complain about.

Safehold by David Weber is a huge published book series about a cybernetic avatar who wakes up hundreds of years after they were put in stasis to find the world has been stuck in the middle ages by a global religious institution. Probably one of my personal favorite stories ever, though with all David Weber books they are so full of detail sometimes it feels like you might choke. Still, I can't emphasize how much I love this series, so give it a shot.
