Surprisingly enough, Blue Core is pretty rational. There are explicit scenes that require a bit of suspension of disbelief, but none of them are really integral to the story, and they are labeled, so you can skip them. The MC actually discusses his build and options to his companions, and tries to optimize it. The powerful enemies are also smart and resourceful, and generally don't hold the idiot ball.

I'd also recommend Ar'Kendrythist. It's not /that/ rational, but the worldbuilding and magic system are robust, and the characters always seem three dimensional. It's definitely on the level of something like Delve in terms of rationality, and personally I like it more. The magic is more mystical though, and the mc is middle aged and at first fairly set in his ways. It takes time for him to really come to terms with the new world.
