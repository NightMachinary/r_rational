Brockton's Celestial Forge is my favorite tinker story in the fandom. It's competent and does a good job of having butterfly effects and showing character. I also liked that the OC is a legit character on his own, instead of being just another self-insert or altpower Taylor. The author is pretty prolific and updates with 14k-16k words every week.
