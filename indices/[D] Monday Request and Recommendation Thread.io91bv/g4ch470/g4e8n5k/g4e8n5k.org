Tentative counter-recommend for A Cloudy Path. The early bits are rather formulaic and nothing really happens for a while. I still read through it all but it was super depressing for it to end unfinished.

He gets more creative later on, bringing in new villains but it just feels like a missed opportunity. All in all, I think I would've been better off reading a different 1.6+ million words. On the other hand, it did get me into Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, which still has a flourishing playerbase on FAF, so it wasn't a total waste of time.
