Came here to mention /The Fall of Doc Future/ and /A Miracle of Science/, but both had already been mentioned. /Miracle of Science/ is heartwarming fun. /Fall of Doc Future/ is to mad science what Worm is to comic books - unlikely to be surpassed in its rationalization any time soon. However - I can't be arsed to think of a polite way to say this - /Fall of Doc Future/ presumes the reader has a minimum IQ of 140. Not a technical education per se, just a minimum IQ of 140.
