Bloodborne, and to an extent the rest of the FromSoftware games require a lot of inquiry from the player to understand the story bit by bit. Bloodborne especially, which has a complicated story that is told in non-sequential bits all over the place. There's even a 30+ page essay in the subreddit that tries to explain the story in full. Imo it hits most of the requirements for a story that requires intelligence to understand, it's not something you can just absorb.
