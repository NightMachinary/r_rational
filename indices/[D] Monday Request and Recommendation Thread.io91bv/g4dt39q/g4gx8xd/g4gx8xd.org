I'm not sure if you mean a book that is only understandable by an intelligent reader, or one with characters that truly act intelligently instead of signaling intelligence or having the complicated parts of their plans succeed through plot armor, implausible talents, or handwaving the details offscreen.

If you are loking for books where the characters demonstrate actual intelligence, I think the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson has a lot of characters that accomplish their goals by intelligent methods and show their work. I've recommended this one here before, it is set in the 16th century and is written from the viewpoints of multiple characters. Lots of plotting and planning by everyone that involves alchemy, inventions, currency and stock manipulation, the royal society, bankrupting countries, cryptography, faking deaths, the English succession, round the world trading voyages, prison breaks, etc..
