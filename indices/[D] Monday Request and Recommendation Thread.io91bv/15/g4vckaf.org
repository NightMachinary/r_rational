Has anyone here read any [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/fallacies.32825/#recent-content][fanfic]] by Fallacies?

Recently got into reading their FSN fanfics, and if there ever is any fanfic author with detailed knowledge of their setting it must be them. Really goes deep into Fate lore, and demands quite a lot of the readers too, but I enjoyed the concepts and ideas brought up in their fics.
