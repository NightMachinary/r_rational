Any /completed/ stories with non-human leads? I'm following stuff like Mud's Mission (rip) and Shade Touched, and while they are great, I can't imagine the late game for such stories that wouldn't contradict their premises. If MC is sufficiently inhuman, they can't integrate with the human society, so any typical webnovel stuff (aside from the murderhobo route) is out.
