Looking for modern day/near future ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextSundayAD][Next Sunday AD]]/[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture][20 Minutes into the Future]]? But I digress...) uplift fiction, preferably with a strong (character-wise, but OP is fine too) charasmatic MC who has the advantage of being the first or only one with access to the mechanism for the uplift. Examples that come to mind are John Ringo's Live Free or Die, or I guess [[https://storiesonline.net/s/17944/micro-gates][Micro Gates]], but hopefully better written. Bonus points for featuring IRL people. (Selling the phlebotinum to Elon Musk or Bill Gates, for example)
