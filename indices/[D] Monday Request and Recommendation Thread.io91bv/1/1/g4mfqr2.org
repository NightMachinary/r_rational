You might like Eclipse Phase. It's a TTRPG, but there are a number of official novellas in the setting and you can find a few fanworks if you look around a bit.

The general idea behind the setting is that it's some unspecified but not /too/ distant point in the future (best guess around 2100-2200), 10 years after a cataclysmic event known as The Fall where some AIs got exposed to a hostile memetic (amongst other vectors) alien virus left as a trap, went through a hard-takeoff singularity, murdered most of transhumanity and then mysteriously fucked off before finishing the job, leaving Earth an uninhabitable ruin and only a few percent of the population as survivors (and most of those as as digitally stored egos, who had to abandon their physical bodies to escape Earth).

Before the Fall a number of species had been uplifted, and how they should be treated going forward is one of the points of contention between the various different factions.
