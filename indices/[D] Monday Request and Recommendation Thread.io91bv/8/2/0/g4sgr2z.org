+1 it's kinda like having a really greasy meal - feels good at the time, but later upon reflection you may be full of regret.

The story is super duper authoritarian. The only people who are ever right or good are the ones who bow down to, effectively, the Divine Right of Kings as symbolized by the Uchiha doujutsu.

Also, the second half of the fic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388642/1/Direct-thee-to-Peace][Direct thee to peace]]) ends in what's basically a deathbed conversion that's otherwise largely out of place except for a couple of hints here and there, so you have that to look forward to.

If you want something in a similar vein that's less likely to leave you feeling queasy, I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize][Sanitize]] - similar setup but with significantly less authoritarianism.
