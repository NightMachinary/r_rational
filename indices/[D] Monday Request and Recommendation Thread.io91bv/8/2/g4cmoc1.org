[[https://fanfiction.net/s/13338339/1/Compass-of-thy-Soul][Compass of thy soul]] and it's sequel are a Naruto pre-canon reincarnation isekai bildungsroman that attempts to achieve realistic depictions of day to day society in a pre-industrial martial world with magic supersoldiers. It's very Japanophilic but has a typical secular scorn for supernatural/religious worldviews which the characters ought to possess and significant pro-hereditary monarchy themes.\\
Then the last two thirds of the story sees every plot thread gradually warp themselves around the conflict between the aristocratic protagonists who are never wrong and the individualistic antagonist.

It totally failed on realism, is what I'm saying, but it's a really engrossing read. 5/5 schlocky genre fic.
