I have never seen this being recommended here but I recently stumbled upon [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][he who fight with monster]] on royalroad. I was surprised that I have only just found this now.

The genre and premises are a bit like your typical litrpg isekai but the writing is really good. The world-building is also superb and rational like. The protagonist is a clever smart ass that likes to nitpicking small stuff and make a reference to culture from his original world. As an outworlder, his power is uncommon and can be a bit OP but far from unheard of.

Another aspect of the novel that I like is the author willingness to explore stuffs which only briefly touched or just straight ignored in other isekai literature. This includes things like the identity and psychological aspect of someone who just moved world. In one chapter, the protagonist was described as vulnerable and exposed since his decisions in this world can be a matter of life and death. His principles are being put to the test, and he was forced to confront what it means when they bend or even break. Furthermore, the only thing he brought to the new world is his value from his own world, which often clashes with the local values. For me, this kind of exposition really enhances the story telling.

I was surprised this novel is on the first page of Best Rated novel on royalroad. So, if you haven't read it, I recommend giving this one a go.
