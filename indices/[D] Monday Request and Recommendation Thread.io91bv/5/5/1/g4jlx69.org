Yea, I tried to read that and while I'm a native German speaker and know a thing or two about rocketry, I had to give up on that book. Felt like my brain was melting whenever I tried to puzzle out what was going on, and if I didn't, the book would abandon the scene and move elsewhere without explanation of what just happened. If that book is the mark of a cognitively intelligent reader, then I can confidently say I'm not one.
