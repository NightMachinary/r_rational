I think you might enjoy Jacek Dukaj's works, especially those that deal with posthuman or AI characters. Sure, they ALSO contain some wrong-neighbour markers you mentioned, but at their core, the stories are of level of intellectual complexity that in my view, would attract and please a cognitively intelligent reader.

Or put it another way: me, as a guy with 2 Master's Degrees and about 120IQ, give or take, could barely keep up with the story and its ideas, and it was obvious to me that is not that the book is badly written, but my mind is badly written and thus unable to decipher it. I could feel that a cool plot and fascinating ideas on identity, philosophy and science are there, its just that I did not have enough RAM to launch these ideas in my head.
