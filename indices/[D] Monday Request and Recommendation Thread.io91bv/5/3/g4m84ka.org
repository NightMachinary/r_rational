I just read /Fall of Doc Future/ (thanks for the rec) but I didn't feel like it was particularly challenging, so I'm wondering if I missed something.

I am trying to stumble towards what you meant, and so I want to give an example to see if I'm on the right track. I suspect that a story that requires a more cognitively intelligent reader occurs when less is directly stated (via dialogue, infodump, etc) but is shown/implied and left up to the reader. The standard for this that I always remember is from To Kill A Mockingbird

#+begin_quote
  ... Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks...
#+end_quote

The point that Harper Lee is trying to make is that Jem has never seen Boo, but she doesn't tell the reader that. You have to notice it. (I didn't notice this when I first read it). Is that in the right ballpark?

I suspect that Jane Austen is like that for social and class-related commentary but I don't know. I can't get it. From what I've read, its Iain M. Banks and the Culture stuff. A lot of things are only hinted at, and the transcripts between the ships are dense. But on re-reading it, everything is there. There is certainly some tech concepts, but nothing particularly weird by SF standards. (The later books are more straightforward).
