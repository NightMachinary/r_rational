Thats fair. I did end up skimming a decent portion of it due to its length, and while Taylor never pushed her powers as far as I wished I still recommend it because of the interpersonal relationships the story builds. Especially towards the end, with Taylor, Lisa, and Theo together I felt the author wrote the interactions between the three of them very well. A shame it cut off where it did.
