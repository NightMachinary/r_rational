[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lost-in-an-isekai.866362/][Lost in an Isekai]] (Isekai, Ongoing): MC is isekaied into a roughly early middle ages + magic society. Gets to keep truck + smartphone w/ internet. Goes out to an isolated frontier area and starts an uplift via introducing additional ancient to mid-middle-ages to adapted-modern(#3) tech such as 1: Repeating crossbow 2: Water powered mill, 3: Compound Bow, 4:Curduroy Road. First 1/2 of what's written mostly focuses on small-scale adventuring in between tech introductions. Second 1/2 begins to dip into politics - and it's looking like that may become more of a theme moving forward.
