Strongly second this recommendation!

I binged through it this afternoon and it is absolutely fantastic. The author does a great job of going back and forth from kingdom building and adventure questing. Interesting POV and the author's experience as a carpenter guides how they've approached the uplift aspect of the story.

I'm somewhat astounded at the rate of update and hope they can keep it up for as long as possible. 140k words in the past two months for reference.
