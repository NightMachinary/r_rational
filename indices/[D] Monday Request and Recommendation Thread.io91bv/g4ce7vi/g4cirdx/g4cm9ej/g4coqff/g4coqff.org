  Is Safehold finished?
#+end_quote

Yeah, there are 9 books that cohesively wrap up the story in a nice package. There's apparently a tenth book as well that basically just a collection of timeskips after the main plot that show what characters are doing years later, but I haven't read it.

  Does it pick up?
#+end_quote

Not sure how you define "picking up" but the world gets a lot busier and more interconnected as the series goes on. Allies and enemies around the planet get more screen time so to speak, and as the war becomes global it opens up lots of action and characters. The writing style itself doesn't really change though.
