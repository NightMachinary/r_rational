Aodes anyone have rational dungeon-building stories that:

- Try not to kill;
- Realize that the standard setup of increasingly difficult traps and monsters work for video games, but makes little sense for an actually rational dungeon. A much better structure, for example, would be a few forbidden kill-zone floors, with the upper floors not geared to defense but left for utility purposes. If possible, with some hidden mechanism to turn the utility floors into kill-zones too, if the need ever arises.
