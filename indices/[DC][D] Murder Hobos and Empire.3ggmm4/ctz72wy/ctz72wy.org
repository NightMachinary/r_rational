The bits about stasis and eventual collapse are sensible. What I don't get is, if Murder Hobos are the answer to every problem that threatens the empire, why aren't they a threat to the Empire itself?

Is it rock paper scissors? Empire > Murder Hobos > Lich Lord > Empire? I can see how that'd be possible.
