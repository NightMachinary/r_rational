I figure it's something like that. I'd expect that eventually, many level 20 wizards would want to retire, though, and carve out a province for themselves. Perhaps they do, and that's where you get your lich lords in the first place.

However, government is based on the premise that no individual can rule on their own strength - power comes from the masses, whether you use money or royalty or status to wield that power. In Fantasyland, though. I'd expect any government would need to have some high-level mojo backing it, like in TYE.
