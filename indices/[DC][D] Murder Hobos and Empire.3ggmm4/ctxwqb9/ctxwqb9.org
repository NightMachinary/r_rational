/tl;dr:/

The writer deconstructs how a large fantasy empire can maintain [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis][Medieval Stasis]] within its borders for literally millennia--through isolationism, ultra-conservatism, the continuous rule of long-lived elves, and the help of native +murder hobos+ adventurers--until outside kingdoms that have embraced technological advancement crush it in a war lasting only a few weeks. The author cites Imperial Rome, Ming China, and Safavid Persia as inspirations.

/Some choice quotes:/

#+begin_quote
  The #1 social good promoted by the Empire is the existence and continued stability of the Empire. Every action must save the Empire; threats cannot disrupt the citizen's lives; the Empire must continue. The Emperor is good, the outside is bad, and heroes save the day by preventing change. First order of business: forbid all new things, especially technological advance. Order of business #2: worship the past and ignore the future. The long lives of elves incentivize them to protect themselves and their Empires. A new thing might unbalance the delicate machinery of power. Things that threaten it must go.

  If some internal threat arises--a wizard decides to invent new spells, a dragon trainer decides to breed a new "dangerous" dragon, a bureaucrat consolidates power--send in the Murder Hobos. These guys are clear and present threats to the Empire's stability. Destroy them before they publish a paper and tell anyone about their findings!

  Given an infinite timeline, even the mightiest of Empires become their own museums.
