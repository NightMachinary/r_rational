Not necessarily. The thread was locked due to discussion of eugenics. Whether or not the program is a eugenics program is germane to the discussion, even if you believe that it's good. Saying "this is not bad, therefore it is not eugenics" would be foolish, same as "this is eugenics, therefore it is bad". SamPatrick isn't making the worst argument in the world, he's stating 1) this is a eugenics program and 2) there are questions of coercion and power in play.
