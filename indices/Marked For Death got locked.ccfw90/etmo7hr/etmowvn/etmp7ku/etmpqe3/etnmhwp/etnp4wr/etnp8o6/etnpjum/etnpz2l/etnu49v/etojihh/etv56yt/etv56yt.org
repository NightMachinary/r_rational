And a shitton of chapters ago we had a discussion on wether to kill a boat full of civilians. It too weirded a lot of people out. Heated discussions were had before and after the vote and chapter. Nothing wrong with that.

On the other hand look at the people who voted "like" and "hugs" on the various mod actions or who voted "funny" on the subsequent infractions. More than half of them were people who I don't know if they ever posted in the thread, and at least a few of them took time to post comments questioning the character of anyone who didn't like what happened there.

Cool thing is that the various ratings are shown in chronological order.
