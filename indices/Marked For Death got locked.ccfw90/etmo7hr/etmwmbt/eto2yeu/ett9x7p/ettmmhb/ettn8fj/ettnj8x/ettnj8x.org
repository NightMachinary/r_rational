Honestly, I think you vastly overestimate your ability to control memetic viruses engineered to destroy your enemies. I'm pretty sure there's a whole TVtropes page about that. :p

As for this not happening in practice... I see it all the time on social media. And in person too for that matter. I've had people go "gross!" at me just for reading Orson Scott Card in public - or Scott Alexander even! Not exactly the kind of epistemology we'd want to cultivate.
