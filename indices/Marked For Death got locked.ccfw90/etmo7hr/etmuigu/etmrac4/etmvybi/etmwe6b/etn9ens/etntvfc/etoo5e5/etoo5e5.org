I was exaggerating a little for effect with the level of punishments they give, but those are the general areas that mods on each site focus their attention on curtailing (in the Fiction and Quests forums, at least. I don't lurk the Politics sections.).

SB nukes threads with mature content, and SV will infract you and maybe temp-ban you if you write something that might insult a minority. They don't do it if it's explicitly a character in one of your stories saying it, but then again it's not exactly the same thing as a ban on mature content.

It's true that the SV mods are a little more lenient than the SB ones, and their first reaction is normally to search the thread and apply minimal punishment to transgressors as opposed to the SB policy of dropping bombs and sorting out the rubble when they find the time.

Really though, it's very unlikely that you'll actually run into an actual problem with the mods on either site unless you act out significantly and end up getting into an argument, deliberately start breaking rules, or continue after they specifically announced 'don't do this!' to a thread.
