I generally lean towards the idea that moving would not be useful, but it would not be hard to convince me to do it if there was a good candidate.

By 'good candidate' I mean something like "acceptable aesthetics, a useful tally system, and good searching". That's what I can think of offhand, so it's a necessary list but probably not a complete one.
