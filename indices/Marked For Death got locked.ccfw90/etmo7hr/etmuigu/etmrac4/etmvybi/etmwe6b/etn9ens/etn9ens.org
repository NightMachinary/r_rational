There are three big websites for Questing and Creative Writing that share the same format/style, called SpaceBattles, Sufficient Velocity, and Questionable Questing.

Questing is like a story/game where people vote for what the main character does, and an author/Game Master/Quest Master writes chapters of the story based on their votes.

SpaceBattles is more dedicated to regular fanfiction as opposed to Quests, and occasionally you'll see the extremely rare and miraculous 'actual original content' there more often than on the other sites. It does have a Questing forum, but that isn't as active as the ones on the other sites. On the other hand, the mods are very strict and will ban you at the slightest hint of content that isn't PG-13.

Sufficient Velocity is more focused on Quests as opposed to fanfics, and formed as an offshoot of SpaceBattles over a controversy when they fired a moderator. It's probably the best Questing forum out there, and they have more leeway in regards to mature content. On the other hand, the mods will ban you the moment you comment anything that isn't 100% politically correct, even if it's very obscure and you had no idea there was a group that would take offense about it.

Questionable Questing is even more focused on Quests than Sufficient Velocity is, to the extent that there is barely any activity in their Creative Writing forums. I suppose you can infer this from the name. This forum's thing is that they let you be intolerant and write porn, but you need an account to access(or even be able to see) their 'Not Safe For Work ('NSFW')' forums. On the other hand, most of it isn't very good, and well, even when it is good it probably has erotica in it.
