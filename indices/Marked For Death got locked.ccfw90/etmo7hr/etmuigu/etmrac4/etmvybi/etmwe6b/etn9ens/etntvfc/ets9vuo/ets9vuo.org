  Questionable Questing is even more focused on Quests than Sufficient Velocity is, to the extent that there is barely any activity in their Creative Writing forums.

I don't mean to be rude but, did you actually look?

As for the SFW side, Creative Writing has like 40% more posts than Questing, and the entire front page of CW has posts only from the last week whereas Questing is so dead it has a post from April on its front page.

The NSFW side is considerably more active though, and the Questing/CW sub-forums are pretty much the same in terms of usage. There are of course far more comments in Questing, but that's just the nature of the system.
