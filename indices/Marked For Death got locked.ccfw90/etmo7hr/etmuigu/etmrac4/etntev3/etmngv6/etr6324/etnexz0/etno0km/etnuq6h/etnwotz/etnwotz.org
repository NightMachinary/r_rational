The fact that they are responding in a manner consistent with their incentives does not make their actions reasonable. /Why/ exactly do they have to read every post in order to make a determination of whether or not to take moderation action?

Further, I find the argument of "they have a duty" to be strongly at odds with any notion of us being "advantaged" by an action like locking the thread with nothing but blithe comments about the thread and it's conduct until well after the debacle. If their reasoning is indeed that they are acting to protect corporate interests, then they are explicitly making the tradeoff to devalue your time, the other QM's time, the players' time, the quest's reputation in the eyes of the community, etc., in favor of said interests. I realize your hands are tied here in what you can say and how you have to respond -- I just want to register that I find it appalling when authority is wielded as a tool to engender complacency in the face of value misalignment.

And RE: Making things worse.

Damn, I am so glad they are protecting us from what they might have to do to us if they let us run afoul of their sensibilities in protecting their corporate interests. So noble of them.
