Thank you all for the support. [[/u/absolute-black]] has nailed it in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ccfw90/marked_for_death_got_locked/etmo7hr/][zir's summary]] about what was happening in-story that caused the lock.

A few observations beyond that:

- Although I would have preferred a more communicative start to the lock, the mods have moved quickly and mostly been very pleasant to interact with.
- Things are moving in a generally positive direction. The mods read all the posts since the deal was originally proposed (76 pages, ~1900 posts!) in just a few hours and got back to us. They recognize that we took steps to be very clear that everyone involved was 18+ and consenting.
- There are still some questions to answer but I am cautiously optimistic that we will be unlocked by Sunday.

The timing on this is unfortunate, since all three QMs are heavily time-restricted right now due to IRL stuff, and SV is undergoing a major infrastructure change that I'm sure has been taking up a lot of the mods' energy. It's slowing things down as communications are running asynchronously. Still, I'm hopeful.
