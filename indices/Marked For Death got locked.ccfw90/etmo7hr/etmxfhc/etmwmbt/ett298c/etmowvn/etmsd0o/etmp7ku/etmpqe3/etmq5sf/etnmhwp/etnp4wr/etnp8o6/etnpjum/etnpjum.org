There are multiple questions:

1. Is this eugenics? If so, does it violate the rules?
2. Should this rule be in place? Should this story be removed/altered/locked?

It's possible to answer the first question with "yes" and the second question with "no", but saying that the second answer is "no" and therefore the first answer must /also/ be "no" is ridiculous.
