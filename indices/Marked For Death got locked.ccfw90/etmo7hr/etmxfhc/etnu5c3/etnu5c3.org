The Uchiha deal that I wrote was the ultimate cause, but there was more than that. I don't want to go into detail because the discussions are still ongoing, but their concerns are not entirely unreasonable. That said, I do wish that some things had been conducted differently -- for example, it would have been nice if the initial lockpost had stated /why/ we were being locked.
