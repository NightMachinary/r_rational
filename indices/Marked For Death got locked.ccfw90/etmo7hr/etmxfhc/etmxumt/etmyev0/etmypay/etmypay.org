I couldn't tell you much about SV in particular. I would definitely be disappointed if MfD got removed over this, or the QM's were forced to remove the 'offending' deal.

I know SV has a general reputation of being quick to ban but the only example I've personally seen seemed reasonably justified as 'banning a thread full of calls for straight up real-life genocide' and not 'banning a story with immoral content', so IDK.
