There was a political deal between the Uchiha and the Gōketsu (the protagonist's clan).

Years ago, nearly all of the Uchiha ninja were killed, drastically decreasing the clan's power and wealth. The deal that caused all this trouble involved money and votes moving back and forth in various ways, but the core of it was that (summarized) the Gōketsu would adopt a bunch of Uchiha civilians, including 11 women. Those women would be required to have children with ninja and the children would be adopted back into the Uchiha, the hope being that some of them would be ninja. The women were all enthusiastic (having children with ninja drastically increases a civilian's wealth and status), and were allowed to spend as much time as they wanted with the kids after they went back to the Uchiha.

The character who proposed the deal is currently pretty messed up, and when I wrote it I was very clear about the fact that everyone would be 18+ and enthusiastic. As a result, the story content was deemed acceptable. The problem was that (a) some of the players said things that could uncharitably be considered callous to the women and (b) the QMs did not serve as mini-moderators and call the players out for saying these mean things, nor did we run off and tell the mods that some of our players were saying mean things about fictional characters who were engaged in a deal in a fictional story that the mods judged unobjectionable.

And, just in case the SV mods are reading this: Yes, everything I said in our discussion is true, I do comprehend your point of view and I'll be a good boy and toe the line because I don't want more than 3 years of my work to get arbitrarily shut down. You're still being ridiculous.
