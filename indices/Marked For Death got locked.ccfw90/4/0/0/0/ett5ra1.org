  I really hope this doesn't mean self-censorship

That's exactly what it means. From now on, whenever I write a chapter I have to check it over with an eye towards "If the mods are feeling pissy, is this going to offer them an excuse?" No, I'm not happy about it.

  IIRC, With This Ring had to face a somewhat similar problem a few years ago too, though there it was spacebattles with a knee jerk and sufficientvelocity itself as the new safe haven. Seems like WTR had to switch once more since then and has left SV by now too. Seems like it's in the nature of the beast for such forums, over time.

Actually, I'm totally onboard with that last one. I'm not familiar with what happened on SB, but on SV Zoat went actively out of his way to earn that ban.

  I am sorry that this happened to your project.

Thank you, much appreciated.

  There are probably some concerns that the story's quest format could end up killing it in case of migration because of the risk of too many of the players not following to the new location for further participation?

Pretty much, yeah. Also, there aren't a lot of good choices. I refuse to use SB because of negative history with the mods and the community. Multiple players have asked that we not go to QQ. We could post on (e.g.) AO3 and have the discussion in Reddit, but then it's hard to do voting.
