  ... and I'll be a good boy and toe the line because I don't want more than 3 years of my work to get arbitrarily shut down. You're still being ridiculous.

I really hope this doesn't mean self-censorship. It's prevalent in modern-day mainstream media as it is. IIRC, /[[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yxxop/ff_with_this_ring_moving_threads/][With This Ring]]/ had to face a somewhat similar problem a few years ago too, though there it was spacebattles with a knee jerk and sufficientvelocity itself as the new safe haven. Seems like WTR [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing][had to switch once more since then and has left SV by now too]]. Seems like it's in the nature of the beast for such forums, over time.

I am sorry that this happened to your project. There are probably some concerns that the story's quest format could end up killing it in case of migration because of the risk of too many of the players not following to the new location for further participation?
