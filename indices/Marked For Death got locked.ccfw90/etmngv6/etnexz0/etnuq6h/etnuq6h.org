In fairness, them locking the thread has certain advantages for us.

First, they wanted to hold off on doing anything until they had read literally every post, all ~1900 of them, since the deal was first proposed back in chapter 271. As fast as the thread moves, the only reasonable way to do that was to lock it.

Second, the fact that it was locked prevents anyone from accidentally making things worse.

I'm not thrilled about it, and I wish certain things had happened differently, but I do understand why they did it and I can't fault them for doing so. They have a duty to protect the community, protect the site from legal liability, and protect the site from being associated with content that will harm its brand.
