I'm currently reading Deep Red on the same website and it has dealt with far more morally repugnant topics than a small scale consensual eugenics program involving adults (which probably won't be written about IRL for years). I'm not even sure eugenics is even inherently immoral, let alone a topic so egregious that it shouldn't be discussed in a fictional story. Honestly, this could have been a non-consensual eugenics program and still been tamer than some of the things in Deep Red.
