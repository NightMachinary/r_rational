You're right, QQ probably is what I was thinking of. Though I think I do also remember a couple of stories I've read being kicked off of SB and migrating to SV afterwards, so that probably contributed to me conflating the two sites.

  I think the real issue wasn't the in-story content per se, but a rather uncharitable reading of posts in the thread as dehumanizing towards the women in question

Ah. That's more understandable, but I'd still almost always side against the decision to shut it down. Obviously it depends on the specific posts as there are some things that simply cross the line, but I'm someone who plays Rimworld, a community where statements like "How do I optimize my human leather furniture production" wouldn't even seem particularly unusual, so I tend to give people a lot of leeway about 'dehumanizing' fictitious people.
