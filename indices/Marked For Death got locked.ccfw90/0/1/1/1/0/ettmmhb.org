I'm totally on board with fascism being bad, and I remember arguing that Less Wrong was making a mistake in allowing itself to become an alt-right haven, but... making certain views taboo has a really, /really/ bad track record. Making broad topics like politics taboo, okay, fine. But social taboos on sex, alcohol, prostitution, drugs etc. have *all* backfired in the past and I feel like we should draw a lesson from that. I think the biggest part of the problem is that once you make something taboo it becomes impossible to talk about it rationally, and that only ever makes things worse. If you even argue against the taboo you will be accused of defending the thing itself, making correction impossible.

In this case: I think that the actual result of making fascist ideas taboo is that well-meaning liberals mistakenly attack generic right-wing ideas as fascism, and then a lot of smart people get frustrated and leave, resulting in a downward spiral resulting in discussions getting dumber and dumber until nothing of worth is left.
