Not taboo, per se, just socially unacceptable. Discussing said ideas would be socially permissible, but actually HOLDING them would be widely viewed with the greatest of disgust, such that even those who DO hold them will feel disinclined to share that fact, thus limiting their ability to organize and communicate, as well as demoralizing them.

As for calling generic right-wing ideas fascist, I think this happens a lot less than people think it does. People call the US republican party fascist, because the US republican party is, by many definitions ([[https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html][for example this one]]), fascist. People do not generally call right-wing-but-not-fascist-or-fascist-adjacent opinions, like gun rights, low taxes, low regulation, etc. fascist.
