  The actual concern is that people will think being far-right is socially acceptable.

If I thought that was a legitimate concern here, I'd be sympathetic as I believe making fascist beliefs socially unacceptable is a worthy goal (though I still wouldn't support it, as I think making it socially unacceptable should be done by social pressure and public shaming rather than locking threads and such, or any other kind of censorship). But the situation here isn't that; this doesn't even seem like actual eugenics, and even if it were, depicting eugenics is not normalizing (or rather obstructing attempts to denormalize it) fascist ideology.
