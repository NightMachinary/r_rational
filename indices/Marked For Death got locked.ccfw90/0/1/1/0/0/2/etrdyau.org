All the definitions I've seen for it simply state that it's the promotion of desirable genetic traits over others through selective breeding. In this case, the promotion is simply happening in utero.

Besides which, it often is the government who is promoting prenatal screenings. While eugenics often has the connotation of a compulsory program, I think voluntary ones qualify as well.
