A lot of people interpret it that way, and worse, see "eugenics" as in "any action taken to actively improve the human gene pool" as the fundamentally immoral thing - not the whole "killing people" bit. I've seen eugenics brought up re: the situation in Iceland where basically there's no more babies born with Down syndrome due to prenatal screening. Now, if you're anti-abortion, at least that's a coherent position. But if you're pro-choice, then it's utterly ridiculous to decry as "eugenics" the sum total of a lot of free individual choices women take with their own bodies and lives (because guess what - raising a child with Down syndrome is /hard/ and emotionally taxing and most people would rather not go through that because of some abstract notion that some people with Down syndrome /ought/ to be born because... nature wants it? God? Or something). If we could just CRISPR away the genes coding for a thousand horrible genetic diseases that'd be eugenics by this definition. But what would be wrong with that?

Yet that's a position I've seen. "Oh, this is horrible, it's /eugenics/."

Even as far as unethical practices go, eugenics by arranged marriage isn't as unethical as eugenics by genocide. It's just as unethical as arranged marriage itself.
