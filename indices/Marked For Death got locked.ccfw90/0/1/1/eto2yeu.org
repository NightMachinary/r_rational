But nobody in real life is going to become a ninja or torture people based on this story, so that's not a threat /politically/. "Eugenics" on the other hand sounds like a far right belief, so the fact that some kind of 'eugenics' has been practised by royal families throughout all of history and this is just a realistic part of the setting becomes totally irrelevant. The actual concern is that people will think being far-right is socially acceptable.

It's just more of the same stupid culture war, IMO. Otherwise people would not have reported it.
