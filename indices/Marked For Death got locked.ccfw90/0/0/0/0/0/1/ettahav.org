SV in my experience are quick to hand out infractions (I've gotten them myself for condemning hateful ideologies, which is rather fucking ironic and is my main issue with the mods), but not super quick to permaban, and while they may lock threads it's usually not permanent and they'll unlock it when the issue is resolved. I've only seen an author permabanned and their story permanently locked once, when the author was a complete transphobic asshole (Both in and out of story, and the in-story is strongly relevant here because it's an SI fic and the author pretty much stated that his real views on the subject are more or less the same as his SI's, for obvious reasons). And even then, the author's ban and lock were only permanent because he threw a tantrum about it when the temp ban expired and doubled down on his transphobia. But granted, I don't read THAT many stories on SV, mostly only the ones with a reputation for being good.
