I get it now.

Yeah I mean private platform or whatever, but choosing to ban books IRL is “worse” than eugenics in a story, even if there are reasonable arguments that it shouldn't be /illegal/, in my quite reasonable opinion, if I do say so myself.

Would they ban any Fullmetal Alchemist content just because the core setting details are atrocious? Or are they assuming that if it's not explicitly decried very blatantly in-story that's tantamount to authorial (or player) support for an atrocity?
