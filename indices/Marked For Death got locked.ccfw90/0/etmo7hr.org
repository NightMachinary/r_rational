My very quick TL;DR is that a political deal was brought up involving saving the Uchiha Clan by agreeing to have (or facilitate the having of via other fathers) ninja-children with a fair number of (consenting, 18+ years old) Uchiha women. The player base went very far out of their way to make sure this was all morally tolerable by 2019 standards, but there were still apparently reports on this as 'eugenics'.
