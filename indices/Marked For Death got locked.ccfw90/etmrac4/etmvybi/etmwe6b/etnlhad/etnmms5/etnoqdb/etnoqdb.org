I wonder! If we assume (for the sake of rounding error) that we're having this conversation in 2020, then "20 years ago" means "2000", and "30 years ago" means the awesomely radical year of 1990. The second one is great, because it permits Sailor Moon /and/ all of Rumiko Takahashi's most popular stuff and Harry Potter and Naruto.
