I contend that is none of those things. What counts as "politics"? Tell me at which point the following becomes political:

The villain is a fat, ugly man... ...who stole the throne from the person the people actually wanted based on a technically... ...and he is portrayed as a narcissist... ... And he is phenomenally dishonest... ... And he cheats on his wife with a sex worker... ... And he refuses to pay the workmen who built his royal palace... ... And his name is Dan McUnobjectionable ... Or Ronald Dump.

What counts as political commentary is subjective. That means it is not simple or consistent. And it is most definitely not a good idea to ban it.
