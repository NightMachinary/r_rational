I mean, if you push your story explicitly close to the line, you're gonna find out where people draw the line. But there's still huge areas of unambiguity, and in general QQ is way more politically tolerant than SV, see the WtR debacle. As I understand it, the point of the rule is more to make people take reasonable steps to avoid political topics of debate; as long as you don't deliberately and sustainedly push things /towards/ (irl) politics, you should be fine.

Not a mod though. You should ask them!
