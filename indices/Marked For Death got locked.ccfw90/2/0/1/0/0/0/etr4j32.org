  Really though, it's very unlikely that you'll actually run into an actual problem with the mods on either site unless you act out significantly and end up getting into an argument, deliberately start breaking rules, or continue after they specifically announced 'don't do this!' to a thread.

Not sure I agree; this whole affair was ridiculous. The mods unilaterally locked our thread for multiple days and handed out a bunch of infractions and tempbans because of reports about bad content in the story, which they later decided was not bad. (Granted part of the duration was down to the fact that all of the QMs had IRL commitments that made it hard to get together and explain ourselves to the mods, and then there was about 10 hours of downtime as SV moved to Xenforo 2.)

At the end of the day, the mods acknowledged that the actual content of the story was legit -- one very messed up character set up a deal that was...ethically gray at best. There was a lot of money and political favors involved, but the core of it was that a bunch of Uchiha civilian women would be adopted into the protagonist's ninja clan and required to have a certain amount of children who would then be adopted back to the Uchiha. Mari, the massively messed up character, was the only one to speak positively about the deal and everyone else objected. I, the author of that particular piece, was extremely clear about the fact that everyone involved was 18+ and that the women were all enthusiastic, since having children with ninja would drastically increase their social and financial status.

No, that wasn't the issue. The issue was that a few of the players had said things that, if you read uncharitably, were mean to the fictional characters.

And yes, I understand what the mods were angry about and I'll be good and never ever ever do that again, and I'll keep in mind that apparently as a QM I have a duty to be a moderator for my players and tell them not to say bad things about the characters and to delete the bad things they say or I will have to tell on them so that the actual mods can rap their knuckles.

Yes, I understand and will comply because I don't want the project that I've been spending 15-20 hours per week on for the last >3 years to be arbitrarily shut down.

It's still ridiculous.
