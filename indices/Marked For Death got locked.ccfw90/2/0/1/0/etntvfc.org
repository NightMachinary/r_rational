  On the other hand, the [SV] mods will ban you the moment you comment anything that isn't 100% politically correct, even if it's very obscure and you had no idea there was a group that would take offense about it.

My experience of SV is limited; MfD takes up so much of my time and energy that I don't tend to browse the rest of the site all that much. That caveat stated, my experience of the mods there has been very positive. Especially when I was participating in the politics threads, I felt that they used as light a touch as possible and usually didn't drop the hammer too fast. Sure, there have been some cases that I thought were a little much, but nothing egregious.

In contrast, my experience with SB was that the mods there +went off faster than sweaty nitro and their standard tactic was to nuke everything in the general vicinity+ used their authority far more often and in heavier-handed ways.
