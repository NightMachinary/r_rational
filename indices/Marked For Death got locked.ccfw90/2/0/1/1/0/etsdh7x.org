The last /week?/ Spacebattles' Creative Writing section is filled entirely with posts and comments from the last half-hour.

I'll admit that I didn't look closely enough at the NSFW Creative Writing section, which does have posts on the front page that are around the same age as the ones in Sufficient Velocity's User Fiction section-which is also pretty slow.

Even so, I still feel justified in stating QQ's focus remains on Quests when it has Questing in the name.
