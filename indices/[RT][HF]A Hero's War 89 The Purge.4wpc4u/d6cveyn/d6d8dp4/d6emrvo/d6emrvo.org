It's a lot of things actually. First thing is the lack of atmosphere which was present in the beginning. For example - what's was the color of clothes which people wear? And that is related to both plot and worldbuilding - colors mean dyes mean chemistry and trading routes and money turnout. Was there smell of refuse on the streets? Again related to worldbuilding. And all other small things. The behavior of guilds were completely off. If it was because of reasons and not careless writing there should be explicit explanation. In our history guild wouldn't hire anyone to deal with competition. Because they themselves would be most of fighting force of the city. The knights look like shadows in the text. If they are ruling class they should be in the center of narration - characterizations, relationships, talk with them or about them. The worldbuilding is not only maps and prices and administrative structure and economy (all of which are underdeveloped in text) The most important part of worldbuilding are people. What do we know about Tom (fox-boy turned traitor)? He was bullied, he has mother, they lost farm. Is he shy? Or brave? How his family make living? Do anyone in his family died? What he is doing during the day? What about assassin? Why do he work for guild? Is he coward? Is he man of (criminal) honor? Do he has family? How did he learned his trade? Do he despise his employer? Those thing should not necessarily be in the text explicitly, but they should be in the background of author mind and reader should get glimpses of it. Last and not the least - all the protagonist inventions look too easy and too fast. I had read several books with similar plot - usually protagonist had a lot more of tries and failures. Looked more believable.
