Tried to read it and beginning was not bad. However it went downhill fast as soon as protagonists started uplifting feudal society. I've read dozen of sf/fantasy books on uplifting ancient, feudal, magical-feudal, magical-ancient, early-industrial etc societies, and "A Hero's War" somewhere in lower 30% by quality. It's simplistic, naive, careless to key details and not quite internally consistent. I'd recommend "Island in the Sea of Time" instead, even though it's not perfect.
