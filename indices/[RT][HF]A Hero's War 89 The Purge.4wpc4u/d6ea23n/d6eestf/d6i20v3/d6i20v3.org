AO3 at first, dunno how I found it in the first place though. Then the GitP forum when the AO3 one stopped updating.

I can see why that lack of plot or key scenes would stop you from wanting to write more, but I didn't care about any of that, I figured us readers were reading it for just the catharsis of seeing the thought experiment/curb stomp play out rather than any plot.

Btw, I just wanna say, my favorite part of the whole series was the Serephis Secundus arc. I just found reading about the economic expansion of the company improving the Imperium really fun, those kind of 'powering up' stories just really do it for me.

like 2 Year Emperor or Mother of Learning
