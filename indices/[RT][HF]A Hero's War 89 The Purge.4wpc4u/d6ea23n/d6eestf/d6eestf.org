Oh, someone else actually read that! AO3 version or GitP thread?

Well, thank you for reading!

The main reasons why I stopped had to do with the entire premise of why I started writing it in the first place. There, in fact, wasn't a good motivation to start writing the story. I had no key scenes, no overarching motivations or plot, basically I took the ball and rolled with it and kept rolling with it.

Literally, the story started with me writing a short three week scenario detailing how fast the Culture would run across an Imperial planet and get warned about Chaos contamination. So the story technically started off as an illustrative thought experiment to make a point on a forum discussion. >.>

So when the 40k universe ran out of material to truly explore and I had to start actually writing plot instead of people reacting... well, I found that wasn't so easy anymore.
