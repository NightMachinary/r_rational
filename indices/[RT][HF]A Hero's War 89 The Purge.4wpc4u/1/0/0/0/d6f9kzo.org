... hahaha... /insert bitter laugh/. To think I received a criticism a few weeks ago that I put TOO much words into developing random side characters...

\opens notebook and scribbles

Yeah, I fully understand. In fact, I had known that developing the side characters is seriously lacking. This was actually a deliberate choice in order to push ahead with the 'main plot'. If I were rewriting, that part is what I would focus on.

Funnily enough, despite the fact that I've written 8 story arcs, we still haven't reached the point that I really wanted to write. It is in fact only just beginning.

And yeah, Cato's ability to ask all the right questions is seriously cheat. Um. Well. No excuses can be made really. This is where realism meets narrative requirements, namely that I wanted to reach a magitech era within a narratively short period.

The story was supposed to be about the start of a magically powered industrial revolution. I'm looking at my future plot notes and little scraps and wondering where that's gone to now.

Thank you for pointing those out! If I ever rewrite, I'll be sure to keep it in mind.
