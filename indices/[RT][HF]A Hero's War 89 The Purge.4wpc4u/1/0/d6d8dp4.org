Hi there! Thanks for commenting! Now if you could just tell me what went wrong for you...?

Obviously, my writing needs work and the way I plot it out, step by step in my head like a simulation with some nudges, is not conducive to thematic unity. Well, pointers there would help! Also practice, which is why I'm writing.

You said that the beginning was not bad but it went downhill fast. Many other comments I had gotten said the exact opposite. So your perspective is much more informative than others as it seems to be unique.

I do understand that the all parts of the worldbuilding are lacking except the magic system (which is probably too detailed), but specific examples of which parts bothered you or seemed to lack detail would be helpful.

They're probably not even the same parts I'm thinking of.

And while Hero's War is probably not salvageable with how far it's come, I can always do better next time.
