More like adult retraining courses than schools. While they can now easily afford to take all the children off the farms, doing so is a future investment with little immediate payoff. (The simple magic training schools Cato is trying to do aren't like public education, more like a crash course lasting a few weeks)

Pushing adults into a nascent manufacturing industry seems like a faster way to do things. For uncomplicated sweatshop like work, you can train someone pretty quickly to just do it by rote. Especially if you have a more qualified core to provide QC and guide rails/jigs/measuring blocks tailored to the process.
