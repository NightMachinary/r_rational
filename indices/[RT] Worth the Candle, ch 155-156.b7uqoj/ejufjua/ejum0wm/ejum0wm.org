Still Magic 100 is definitely a game-changer (literally). This virtue and its force-multiplying synergy with Essentialism 20 was the axle needed to catapult him in power to match the coming challenges because otherwise he was never going to get enough levels to reach his caps naturally, with how fast threat levels have been escalating. It's almost certainly exclusion-worthy, were it anyone but Joon to unlock it (not that it'd be easy without a GUI), but I'm guessing narrative armor protects him from this.

Harold's the one whose infected mindslaves summoned MR ("chorus is ripe"). Finch obviously didn't know about the antimemetic MR, but judging by Lartin showing up, he already knew or suspected that Harold was active in Li'o and Lartin was Uniquities' agent on the ground.
