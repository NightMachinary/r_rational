What a fantastic chapter! The fight against Mome Rath was a great payoff.

Still magic 100 seems overpowered -- you can now easily get essentialism 100 back and keep it there (or another good option would be bone magic 100, with the gigantic Mome Bones). Presumably, sleep deprivation is a physical ailment which can be relieved by bone- or blood-magic, so Joon should be able to stay awake forever -- after all, if END lets you "go on forced marches", it should let you stay awake for longer. It would definitely be a good move for a little while to upgrade the party with souped up skin magic.

​

Repeated skilled-trades which are locked in by still magic seems like an excludable combination

​

The fact that Harold is different from Mome Rath is a bit surprising! I don't see the cause-> effect that made MR show up anymore. It makes the appearance of Finch a bit suspicious...

​

Why didn't Joon still the air around his party members to keep them in one place?

​

Burning Mome Bones for MEN might not be a bad idea, briefly- just to see what would come out
