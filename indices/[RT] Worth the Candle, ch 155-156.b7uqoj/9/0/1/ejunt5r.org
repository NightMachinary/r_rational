I presume he already had it, so he didn't get a notification, but that's why he said he was too busy to check.

My memory might be faulty, but at one point, didn't he get a ton of quests about dangerous things in the world? If so, he probably got Mome Rath then, missed it, and so never got it again during this fight.

If he had the time to check, I bet it would've already been there. I'm betting on him realizing it next chapter, since Amy wondered about it in this one.
