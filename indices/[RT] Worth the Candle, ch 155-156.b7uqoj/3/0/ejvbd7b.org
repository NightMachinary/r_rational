To be fair to Mary, all climbing the leg got him was two burned unicorn bones and a few levels in Still Magic. If he had waited for an actual plan (rather than “start climbing, and hope I figure out something along the way”), he might've been in a better situation once he got up top.

On the other hand, maybe he wouldn't have been able to reach Still Magic 100 without those levels he got by killing bats.
