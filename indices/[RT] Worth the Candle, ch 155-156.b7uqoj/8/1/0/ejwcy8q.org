I agree that there has to be a threshold of knowledge to invoke the antimemetic effects, beyond just knowing the name (otherwise, the party wouldn't have been able to spend any time trying to figure out who/what Mome Rath was).

But Arthur knew more than just the name:

  “So movie two is all about the Mome Rath, this giant, skyscraper-sized beast, one that no one can think of unless he's there.”

  “Wait, memetic?” asked Arthur.

  “Antimemetic,” I said. “Totally different. He's got hair like fingers, he's got --”

  “What the fuck are you even on about with hair like fingers?” asked Arthur with a laugh. He could be loud. Previews hadn't started yet, and some people looked at us. “Prehensile hair?”

  “No,” I said. I held up a finger. “Okay, picture this finger as three links of a chain. Extrapolate that out for like, ten yards, then multiply it by a thousand. He's got a full head of hair, like fingers.” I stopped for a moment as a thought caught up to me. “But like, randomly rotating the angle of each knuckle in his finger-hair, I guess, so that it doesn't all go one direction.”

Admittedly, Joon, having built the creature up to the point where it has stats and an ecology, would have more knowledge than Arthur, and it's certainly a possibility that Joon is over the threshold of "knows enough about what Mome Rath is to trigger the antimemetic effects" and Arthur isn't, but my personal feeling is that it seems, from just the above, like Arthur has plenty enough knowledge to trigger the effects.
