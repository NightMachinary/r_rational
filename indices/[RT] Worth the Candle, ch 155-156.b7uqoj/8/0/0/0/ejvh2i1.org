Grak says that the effect is wardable, and Uther was a warder. Maybe one day Uther warded himself against all outside magic, and that let him suddenly remember Mome Rath. And then wrote it down or something, maybe placed a permanent ward against the effect anchored to himself.

That speech he had in the mirror is a good candidate time for it. He was sitting under "uncrackable wards" and was presumably working on the list of things to test the dream skewered with.
