Imagine its hair fingers interlocking against each other in a growing clump that closes down the beast. Do some handwavy tie in to the hairy ball theorem too. You find a badly "combed" point and work from there, extending the knot outwards, finger chains interlocking to shut down whatever those hair fingers are doing for the body or it's ecology. Maybe somehow paralyzing the thing. The monster isn't topologically a sphere, but maybe its holes are where other party members come into play.

I like this because to me "outgrabe" has four weak connotations that work well with this victory condition. First, it makes me think of grabbing, which implies the fingers should be relevant. Second, "out-" makes me think of words like "outsmarted" or "outplayed", the implication being that you've beaten the monster at its own game in some respect, extending one of its qualities beyond the norm. Third, "grabe" reminds me of "groove", eg carving or combing. Fourth, the poem says that in the beginning when everything is good and nice and mimsy, the Mome Raths are "outgrabe". Not "defeated", or "dead", or "non-existent", or anything straightforward like the Jabberwocky having its head cut through and through, but some more specific technical term indicating they are no threat. It's most tempting to see that as implying total incapacitation.

The only other route I can see, if not utilizing either the fingers or ecology or both, would be some kind of self-powered memetic attack. Tricking the monster into forgetting what it's doing, or some such. But there aren't any obvious hooks for that.
