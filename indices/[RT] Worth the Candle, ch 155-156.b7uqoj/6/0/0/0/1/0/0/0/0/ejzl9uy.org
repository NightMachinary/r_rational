The encounter has to be made interesting if it /is/ an encounter. The alternative is narrative time compression - a montage in cinema - where you just say, "and then we summoned several and harvested their bones."

Kind of like how in Vampire the Masquerade you only run feeding scenes if they're /going to be/ interesting. That doesn't mean every feeding scene has to be interesting, just that they don't all occur on screen.
