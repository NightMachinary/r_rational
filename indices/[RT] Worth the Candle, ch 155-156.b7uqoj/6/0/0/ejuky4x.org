Yeah, like any RPG endgame, this is a suitable mook boss to summon to kill over and over. With the right equipment and knowledge of all his attacks, Juniper could kill him in 5 minutes with no casualties or consumption of any irreplaceable resource like the Unicorn bones.

Just summon him in some remote area and whack him down for the XP and loot.
