Getting updates to this story feels like how Juniper describes the Level Up. Minutes of uninterrupted, incredible joy- and then the downtime starts, and you turn into an evil shell of a human willing to do anything for the next chapter.

Also:

*/Quest Complete: Mome Rath, the Forgotten - Mome Rath has fallen, his corpse evermore a record of his existence. (This quest cannot be repeated if another Mome Rath is summoned from beyond space and time.)/*

I do not like the sound of /another/ Mome Rath.

Although, if Joon's progression is anything like Uther's, it won't be long til he's ploughing through Mome Raths like they're the irritating time-wasters.

More like MOOK Rath, amirite?!
