In Ch 156, is Joon missing the "Double Overcapped" affliction for Still Magic?

#+begin_quote
  There were very few game effects with durations, at least so far as the revealed text went, and I would have to touch base with Reimer to see whether there was anything he'd failed to mention, but there were at least two that I was currently under: the Skilled Trade and Overcapped afflictions were reducing my bonus to Still Magic.

In Ch 78, Juniper explained that for "The Sacrifice" for Essentialism 100, he intended to move points from PHY and SOC to KNO and WIS "for a cap of 70 on Essentialism", although it seems like he never actually did that, so his actual soft cap on Essentialism at that time was less than 70. Then in Ch 80, when he scraped out Fallatehr's Essentialism skill and "was up in the 180s for Essentialism", he became subject to a further affliction called "Double Overcapped":

  Scaphism came with another affliction as well, a point lost every ten minutes until they were gone, which meant that I had four afflictions eating away at my points at once, Skilled Trade, Overcapped, Double Overcapped (a larger penalty for being more than twice the cap), and Scaphism. I'd still have hours of time above 100, thanks to Fallatehr.

If skills are "capped at three times primary or five times secondary, whichever is lower" (per Reimer in Ch 144), and Joon's highest primary attribute is MEN at about 13 (or anything less than 17) and highest secondary attribute is CUN/KNO/WIS at about 10, then he should have a soft cap of 39 to 50 on Still Magic. (Those figures based on stats reported in Ch 105 and a quick but not thorough skim through subsequent chapters.)

In Ch 156, he started with Still Magic 21+ and funnelled 81 points into it, plus whatever skill increases he had during unicorn time, so unless his soft cap on Still Magic is over 50 for some reason it seems like he should also be afflicted by Double Overcapped (which would in turn also be stilled by Instinctive Halting and Meta Stilling).
