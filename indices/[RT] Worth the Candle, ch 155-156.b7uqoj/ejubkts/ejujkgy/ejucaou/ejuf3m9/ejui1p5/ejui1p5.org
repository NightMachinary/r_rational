Good god, he could just spend half an hour burning his own bones, soul-resetting them, and repeating until he's gotten max stats in everything. Not to mention the BIG corpse of BIG BONES ripe for the picking. I wouldn't be surprised if some stat has a secondary effect of letting him stay awake longer.

Even better, if he does take a detour to get Kenner's eye, couldn't he just make its “no sleep required” duration last forever? This could very well be the moment he starts to snowball into godhood.
