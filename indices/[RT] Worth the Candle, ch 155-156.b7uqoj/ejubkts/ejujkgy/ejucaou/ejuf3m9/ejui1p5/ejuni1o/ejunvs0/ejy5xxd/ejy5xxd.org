My assumption is that as soon as Amyrillis hears what the still magic 100 perk is, she's going to hop into the time chamber, expecting to come out with a build optimized to exploit it to the fullest (my first instinct was "sacrifice woodworking to 100 and build a nanofactory or friendly general AI or copies of entads or whatever the most gamebreaking thing you can do before it unstills is"). What she'll actually come out with is a lot of caution about how easily Jun could get all his best tricks excluded if he isn't careful. Come on, there's no way woodworking 100 in particular isn't exclusion bait. Build ANYTHING out of wood indeed. And we already know that mundane skills can lead to exclusion (farming).
