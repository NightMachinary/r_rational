Basically:

1. Use bone magic to drain/burn his bones for stat bonuses

2. Meta stilling keeps the stat bonus from expiring

3. Use essentialism to copy and paste undrained bones to replace his drained ones

4. Repeat as necessary.

Since previously we've seen that draining multiple bones imparts a higher stat gain, those gains must stack in magnitude, not duration. Therefore, doing this cycle enough times should give him arbitrarily high stats in everything but luck.

Some people on the discord though have argued since there's been no mention of an in-game timer for bone magic buffs meta stilling wouldn't be able to affect it, so who knows if it'd actually work like that.
