That fight was orgasmic and it read like a fun DND encounter in a nutshell. It did remind me to ask: does anyone else have any particular mood music for WTC? Just like DND campaigns are improved with fitting BGM, I've always liked reading long fantasy works with a complementary playlist that I come to associate with the story. Not in the sense of Pavlovian conditioning (because it was the music I was listening to while reading), but rather like a music director would choose fitting music for media.

For reference, I thought [[https://youtu.be/JYFU_RiefKk][this track was a great accompaniment to the MR fight]]. (edit: plus this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma-WJUidpRU][track from the same OST]]) I haven't found a /just-right/ playlist for WTC in general, but I do often listen to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EWYk854uIs][this dungeon music compilation]].

P.S. I also like the metaphorical implication of Amaryllis being so good at climbing. I never thought about it before Joon put a number to her Skill, but she really is a model workaholic. Glass ceiling, get fucked.
