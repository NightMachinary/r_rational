I generally agree - Joon certainly isnt perfect, he could have been a bit more methodical. But the experience also gives him knowledge as well as levels - about their being mooks, about how it moves, how tough its skin is, etc. For an unknown beast like this you cant always sit back and make the plan, you learn by doing a lot. In this case he went about learning in a non-optimal way, I def admit that.
