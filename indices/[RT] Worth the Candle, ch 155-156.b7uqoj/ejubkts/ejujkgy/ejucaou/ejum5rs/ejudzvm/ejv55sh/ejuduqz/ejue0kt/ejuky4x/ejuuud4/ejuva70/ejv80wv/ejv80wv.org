The bones are certainly a valuable resource. Grak said Mome Rath had "novel magic" - the antimemetic effect, or something else? Either way, it might be accessible or otherwise usable from the bones. I just think the DM is going to be rather hostile to a "let's summon an elder god several times for loot" strategy, not to mention the XP rewards from future Mome Rath kills could be minimal.
