Ah, so if you had the knowledge and the resources you could just build a normal rocket.

As regards to magical entities, I disagree. In Aerb anyone could be described as a magical entity except for non-anima etc. If a magical entity can throw someone to create a velocity mage, then anyone with sufficient magic or entads could make more velocity mages.

Maybe there's an extra clause to it, something like "Magical assistance, in this case, is defined as any active or passive magical effect". So then sufficiently strong non-magical beings could launch people into velocity magedom (they have latent magic, but if they're not using active or passive magic (i.e. phys buffs or entads) then it satisfies the clause and they can create velocity mages).
