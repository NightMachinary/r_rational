Dunno about loot, but most of the XP in WtC seems to come from completing quests rather than defeating enemies, and the quest for Mome Rath specifically says it can't be repeated.

Even in best conditions, I wouldn't expect Joon to get more than a couple more levels out of it, and this DM seems inclined to add unanticipated complications and EXP maluses for munchkinning.
