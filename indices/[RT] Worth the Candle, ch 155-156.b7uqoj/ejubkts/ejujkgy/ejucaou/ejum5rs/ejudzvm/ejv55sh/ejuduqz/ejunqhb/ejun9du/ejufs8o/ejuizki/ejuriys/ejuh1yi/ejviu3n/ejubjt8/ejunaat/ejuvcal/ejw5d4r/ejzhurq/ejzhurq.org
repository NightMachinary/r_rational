I do something almost identical. I call mine the "deep end with a rope". A situation stacked against the player with no visible way to win. More or less what you described, Throwing extra complication as they come. But then I plan one single out. A clear (yet hard) path to win that they can't do without one extra bit, be it information, a person, a object or a change of terrain. It's my "Plan B".

If they can come up with a crazy plan, that is it. If they can't and the fight drag out, I "open up" the plan B and keep pressing on adversity. The important part is that no matter if I'm railroading or not, they need to work for whatever they are going for.
