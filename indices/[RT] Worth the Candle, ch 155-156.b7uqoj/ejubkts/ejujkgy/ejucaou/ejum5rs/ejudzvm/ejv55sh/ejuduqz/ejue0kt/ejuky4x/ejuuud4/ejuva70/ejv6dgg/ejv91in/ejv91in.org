I looked through the full story a while ago with ctrl+F. Funny thing, the same thing happened with Aumann before: "Aumann defeated, level up, quest complete, level up".

In both cases, the enemy defeat finished up a level that was partially complete to some unknown degree (possibly right at the threshold of the next one). Before Aumann, Joon had been complaining about a lack of level ups for a while. Both enemies were decently out-of-depth for them at the time, and the quest objective was to deal with that specific enemy. In that case, the kills might be well-rewarded, with the bulk of the XP still coming from the quest completion - this would be my preferred anti-cheese strat if I were the DM.

Joon's DM would probably also add extra complications to the fight if he tried to repeat it. So even if Joon /really/ needed the bones, I wouldn't expect it to work more than once more without getting horrendously difficult.
