A 5 man level 20 DnD party would probably make pretty quick work of it. Nothing we saw of Mome except the limbs themselves would be 1-shot threats for high level characters, the rats can be AoEd down, especially if you have a non friendly fire point blank AoE. Once you get on top, it doesn't really have much it can throw against you. Then you just need to deal absurd amounts of damage, and you have plenty of kinetic/planar shenanigans capable of that under standard dnd rules.
