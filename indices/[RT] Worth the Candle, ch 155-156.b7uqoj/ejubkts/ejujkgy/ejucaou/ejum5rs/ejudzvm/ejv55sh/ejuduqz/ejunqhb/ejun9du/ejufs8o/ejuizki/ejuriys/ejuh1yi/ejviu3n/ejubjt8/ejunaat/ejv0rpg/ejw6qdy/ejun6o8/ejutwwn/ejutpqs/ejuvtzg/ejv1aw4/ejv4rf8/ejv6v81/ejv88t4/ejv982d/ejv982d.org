Well, yes, but so what? The effect isn't permanent, and it isn't contagious. Every time Mome Rath would enter a major city, it would cause millions of people to "notice" incompetent infrastructure planning, shortages of resources, power vacuums, signs of personal insanity, et cetera. Minor to moderate to major chaos, depending on how closely each individual person interacted with the city. Then, once it leaves --- a few hours later, likely --- everything would mostly go back to normal.

Why do you believe this isn't the case here?
