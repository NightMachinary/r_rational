  All references to the affected city/people would be suppressed.. it prevents you from figuring them out?

But dude, this just goes back to my point of reality no longer making sense. If you can't infer it, then that functionally means wiping whole cities out from history, memories, everything. And if you do that, then... then... I can't even.

Seriously, I don't know how to convey how insane that is. Imagine if every iota of information pointing to the existence of New York suddenly vanished. Plane routes, gas mains, pipe lines, internet cables, established infrastructure, roads, political structure, all of it just has to vanish from not only perception but also acknowledgement. Reality no longer makes sense at that point, no alternative explanation is sufficient. Inference of Mome has to happen, at which point the person realizing gets swallowed up by the effect too until everything is forgotten.
