I don't think there's a canonical answer. If I was running a game like this, where I've got some very creative players with a massive grab bag of very flexible abilities, I'd just throw something crazy at them without any kind of plan at all.... after throwing at least the basic ways to fuck up player's plans (aka, mooks, etc).

MR is a giant whatsit. Clearly the first thing you need to do is get onto it, and you're going to try climbing it, so put some obstacles there. Then, through some unknown-to-me-means, you're now on it, so, throw some more obstacles there. Finally, once you start doing anything that'll work and dealt with everything else, explosion eye beam to break THAT plan. Although I might have gone with a dog shake, or flesh that flakes off, but whatevs.

Basically, instead of thinking up a solution and guiding players to that, block every solution you can think of and then hand your players abilities that let them out-creative you. Best way to GM, IMHO.
