And then, what, hid the corpse?

Or, wait, the quest completed text said the corpse stands as evidence, implying that the effect is broken, and people can know about it. But evidently, if one /had/ been killed before, the species in general was still unknowable. ...So if the antimeme extends through external references, including Joon's own metaknowledge, where does it actually originate? Would the potential existence of future Momes Rath cause the party to forget this entire encounter anyway after a certain time or distance, independently of this guy's demise?

The obvious solution, narratively, would be that defeating Harold breaks the effect more thoroughly/permanently, possibly revealing a few Mome bodies at certain disaster sites, but, still. I think the information we have contradicts Arthur killing one, and it's about as likely that the conversation with Juniper was one of the last things he remembered from Earth.

But then that still doesn't explain why Arthur wasn't affected by the antimeme, /or/ how he could transmit that information at S&S, right?
