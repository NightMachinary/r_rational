That would be breaking the law, would require bypassing protections around an artifact that's critical to an Athenaeum's existence (and would be protected as such), and may well be reconiseable, which would basically put the world's biggest bounty on Joon's head.

And would take /time/ to steal. Join would be better off trying to claim the corpse of the Mome Rath, and use the END to stave off sleep.

Better yet, trade half the bones for an official bone-mage permit and a master-level teacher (who could also feed him the END from the bones more efficiently due to being master-level) - I'm guessing lv 100 bone magery would at /least/ double his bone-mage efficiency so it'd be worth the trade.

There's no sense pissing off The Powers That Be just for short-term gains.
