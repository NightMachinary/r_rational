Game messages have been slowly phased out in general, for a few reasons.

1. On a Watsonian level, Juniper has more or less gotten used to them, so they're phased out within the narrative because they're simply less noteworthy. They're much more likely to be mentioned in passing, rather than big and bold, as a way of reflecting that. They're part of Juniper's life, and less worth noticing, in the same way that, say, a commoner who got thrust into the position of a noble might start out remarking on all the fine clothes and fancy meals, but gradually start seeing them as background.
2. On a Doyalist level, game messages can get really stale and wear out their welcome, which would especially be the case if every single one of them were printed out for the reader. They're best used sparingly, IMO, as part of the texture of the story, rather than as a literal (and constant) output of the story's game system.
3. Game messages interrupt the flow of a story. /Sometimes/ they can be used to heighten a particular passage or amplify the preceding paragraph, but I think it's somewhat rare, and can overstay its welcome. Part of the problem is the original formatting I chose; if I had to do it over, game messages would be italicized but not bold, so as to be less intrusive, which is something people have complained about. Another part of the problem is that game messages are typically on their own line, with in-line messages being exceptions rather than the rule, which means that any game message will usually come between paragraphs, rather than in the middle of one ... and an action paragraph probably shouldn't be broken up by one.
4. As time goes on, there are more systems in play, more complex action scenes, more moving parts, and more things to be tracked. Juniper has a ton of virtues, entads, abilities, and applicable skills to bring to any given encounter. Since part of the prose function of game messages is to bring spice/flavor to encounters, that means that they're functionally replaced in some aspects, or that continuing to have direct output of all notifications would risk overwhelming things or making them even harder to conceptually track.
