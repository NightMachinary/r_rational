I kinda expected the way to defeating Mome Rath to be cutting off his head, with Bethel acting as the Vorpal Sword. I guess not though.

Also, the quest completion confirms that Juniper was suddenly subjected to anti-memetic stuff the moment he was isekai'd. The quest had to have been there, but he just didn't realize it because he wasn't around Mome Rath until now.
