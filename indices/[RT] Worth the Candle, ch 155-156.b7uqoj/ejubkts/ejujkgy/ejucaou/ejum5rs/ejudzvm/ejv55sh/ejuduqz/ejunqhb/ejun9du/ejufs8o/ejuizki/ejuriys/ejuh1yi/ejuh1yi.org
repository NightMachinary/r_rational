This is some good shit. Still Magic OP, Plz nerf. But seriously the fight scene was incredible and this is an excellent pair of chapters.

Made me go back and look it up in his kit (I hadn't paid much attention to this as a piece of his gear). It's probably intended to be a [[https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Type-33_Guided_Munitions_Launcher][Halo reference]] of course. But I want to envision it, personally, as Devil May Cry 4's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK6UaPnRYcc&t=45s][Lucifer]].
