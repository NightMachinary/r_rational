That's not what I'm getting. I mean it supposedly is preventing communication to the outside world. Joon says "Phones and entads dont work."

I'm saying it's powerset goes beyond antimemetic if it's doing that, like implausibly large area warding against communication, or reality warping or something else. I don't see how you can get those effects with just antimemetics.
