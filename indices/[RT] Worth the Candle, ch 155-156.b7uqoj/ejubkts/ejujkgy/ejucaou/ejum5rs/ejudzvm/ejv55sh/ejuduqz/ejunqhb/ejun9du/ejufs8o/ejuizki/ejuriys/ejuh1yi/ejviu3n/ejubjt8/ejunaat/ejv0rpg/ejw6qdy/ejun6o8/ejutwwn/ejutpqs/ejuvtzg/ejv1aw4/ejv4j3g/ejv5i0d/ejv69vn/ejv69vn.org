  This is what /has/ to happen if it's not possible to infer Mome's existence.

Could intelligently rewrite memories to make sense. In the scp grey story everyone elses memories changed to fit a new narrative of the guy not existing, but the narrative had some holes of unlikely things happening, like the complex being massively undermanned. When Mome enters a city, people just look at it from a far(hear phone calls etc) and see business as usual, then your memory changes to your dad dying from an earthquake when Mome moves on and leaves the bodies behind. And there's no need to entirely erase people from existence to maintain the effect.

  If Mome is this powerful, why the heck is he turning /down/ his power when he gets into a city?
#+end_quote

Direct presence has the opposite effect? With the fact that Mome is summoned from somewhere, I'm guessing that the antimemetic effect is just part of their natural "biology" suited for a bizarre environment. Motives don't have to make sense here either, it's from bizzaro world.
