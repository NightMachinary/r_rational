Nope, the text for Bloodline, ch 51, states:

#+begin_quote
  Bloodline: When you have forced your blood into another person, you can use it to heal or harm them. Apply a bonus or malus of up to your POW/SPD/END to them, at the cost of your own, with five factor modifiers.
#+end_quote

Healing someone or hurting someone with Bloodline costs you your own attributes in return. Juniper is burning Mome Rath's bone to increase, his own PHY, then using Bloodline to apply a malus to both their END.
