I quite like the idea of author-based cinematic universes, although Joon is on kind of the wrong track imo. Or maybe the right track, if he's trying to come up with the dumbest possible. I think you could get a successful one by using an author where 1) no one individual work completely outshines the rest (scrapping Rowling and Lewis), 2) there is at least some consistency in atmosphere and genre, and 3) there is some element of magic/the supernatural (imagine a Miss Marple/Hercule Poirot crossover. Oh god.)

Stephen King would be more or less perfect if he weren't so meta about it himself, as Arthur points out. The SKCU would just be the back half of The Dark Tower but Carrie and Mother Abigail are there. Actually, that sounds awesome. I imagine Neil Gaiman might be good? I haven't read enough of him to say for sure.

However, if you ask me, what we really need is a Roald Dahl Cinematic Universe. I mean, you'd need to spice up Charlie Bucket a lot, he's a pretty bland dude, and Sophie from BFG needs some real character too, but Matilda, Danny(, the Champion of the World), George('s Marvellous Medicine) and Mr. Fox all squeezed into Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as they fight off The Witches? Come on, that would be amazing.
