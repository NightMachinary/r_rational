I don't think that the one for 'et cetera' is correct. There's nothing special about 'et cetera', it's the same as 'and so forth', and there wouldn't be a comma there. Compare:

#+begin_quote
  “So where steampunk, cyberpunk, and so forth borrow from an era's aesthetic, you would borrow from their fictional characters?” asked Arthur. “I guess I can dig it. Seems like it would mostly end up lame rather than dumb.”
#+end_quote

vs.

#+begin_quote
  “So where steampunk, cyberpunk, and so forth, borrow from an era's aesthetic, you would borrow from their fictional characters?” asked Arthur. “I guess I can dig it. Seems like it would mostly end up lame rather than dumb.”
#+end_quote

Fixed all the others (though not Sanic, that's a meme).
