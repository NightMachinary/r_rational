  Could intelligently rewrite memories to make sense.

  Motives don't have to make sense here either, it's from bizzaro world.

If it intelligently rewrites memories to make sense, that means it has control over it's own power and how that power is exercised, so it would be a choice to turn the effect down rather than a byproduct of it's biology.

Also, evidence of an earthquake is very easy to recognize. It would be impossible to mistake the damage of a large multi legged creature striding through a city, impaling buildings and smashing it's way through in a specific path for earthquake damage. In fact, I'm struggling to come up with a memory it could rewrite that /wouldn't/ point to a large monster.

The reason I thought the person has to be swallowed up by the effect is because that person would become too thoroughly infested by nonsense that they would become inferant information. A person that visits a city destroyed by something that could only be a large monster who later leaves would have a gap in his memory, because he has to forget what he saw. If he has a gap in his memory, people put it together and we can't have that.

This is what I imagined when you said "It was very legitimately a possible end of world scenario, with the world making less sense and nobody noticing." An antimemetic threat that keeps swallowing up reality piece by piece whenever evidence of it spreads. It just keeps spreading because people can't help but notice and that's when it gets them.
