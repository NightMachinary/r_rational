The main reason I'm going down this path of rejecting this version of Mome non inference is because it spawns more questions than answers. I'm thinking Occams Razor has to apply and something simple is the right explanation.

See, I don't think it's a false dichotomy because the second part can't be a thing, or if it somehow is, that just makes this harder to make sense of.

1) A permanent anti-cognitive effect/no inference possible theory means cutting off hundreds of billions thoughts when they stray in a certain direction every day since every thought that concludes Mome/A thought preventing monster's existence has to be cut. Entire branches of logic must be prevented. This must be an all powerful, universal effect that leaves no trace and cannot be discovered.

How does this level of power match with his displayed level of power?

2) The effect must be this powerful because if people /remember/ not remembering, then the obvious conclusion is something took your memory. Everyone will reach this conclusion constantly. Even if it is simply /impossible/ to conceive of Mome/Any monster that prevents thinking about it, you should /still/ be able to conclude your thoughts are compromised, unless your saying the anti cognitive effect extends to the concept of thought tampering, which just makes Mome even more absurdly powerful.

It should be impossible to destroy a city, leave evidence of memory tampering in the entire world among every individual, and prevent the conclusion of 'something did that'. And if it somehow is possible to do that. Then there's no winning.

Edit: I just realized, logically you have to extend the power to include preventing the concept of thought tampering because if you're allowed to realize that something tampered with your memories, then that itself is inference of Mome's existence.
