  Nothing wrong with this theory

B-but there is! The world stops making sense.

OK so let's take the power to it's absolute extreme. Mome attacks and destroys a city. Your dad was one of the killed. When you look at family photos, not only can you not see him, but you glaze over the fact that there seems to be an invisible force holding you up. Payroll at work, his car, everything tangentially related to him is just glazed over and goes unnoticed even if you physically bump into it. No one ever asks about your father because that would spawn the thought "I have a dad obviously, why don't I remember him?" which leads to 'something took my memory of him'. Everyone that gets close to the ruins of the city is swallowed up by the effect and forgotten too. No one even notices the forest fires spreading from the city because that would lead to inference and all burnt land becomes more antimemetic deadzone. Any and all information pointing to Mome's existence is truly and utterly glazed over.

This is what /has/ to happen if it's not possible to infer Mome's existence.

If Mome is this powerful, why the heck is he turning /down/ his power when he gets into a city? Does he just have a really sporting attitude? He just wants to give the little guys a chance for once?
