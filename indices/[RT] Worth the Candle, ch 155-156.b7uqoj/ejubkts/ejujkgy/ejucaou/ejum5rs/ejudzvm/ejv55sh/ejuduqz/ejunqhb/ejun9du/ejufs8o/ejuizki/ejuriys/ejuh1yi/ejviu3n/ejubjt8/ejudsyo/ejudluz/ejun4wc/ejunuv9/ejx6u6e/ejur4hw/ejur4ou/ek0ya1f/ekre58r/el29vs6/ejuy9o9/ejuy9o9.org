*Chapter 155*

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    So where steampunk, cyberpunk, et cetera borrow from an era's aesthetic
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Et cetera, when abbreviated, ought to have a comma after it ends a list.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Investigating this phenomena
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Should be "these phenomena" or "this phenomenon".

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    whose edifice had been smashed and doors were hanging open
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Should be "whose doors".

 

*Chapter 156*

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    with the probability blade with abandon
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Probably ought to change one of the "with"s, too close together.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sanic the Hegehog
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I don't know if this is a joke or if it's supposed to be Sonic and Hedgehog...

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Mome Rath, the Forgotten defeated!
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Should have a comma after Forgotten.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    I highly expected to be
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Should be "I'd" or "I had"; otherwise timing of the expectation is confusing.
