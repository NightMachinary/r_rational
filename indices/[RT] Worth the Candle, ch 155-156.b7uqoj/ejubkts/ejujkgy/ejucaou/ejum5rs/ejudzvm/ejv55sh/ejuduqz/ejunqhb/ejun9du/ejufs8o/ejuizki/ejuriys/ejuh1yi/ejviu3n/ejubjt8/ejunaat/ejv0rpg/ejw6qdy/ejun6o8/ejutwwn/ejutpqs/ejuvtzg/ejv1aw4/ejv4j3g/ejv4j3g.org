  Mome slowly wiping out city after city with no evidence of anyone or anything lost until Joon finally defeated it right now.

  But if /that's/ the case, the world stops making sense. Wiping out cities would result in huge chunks of reality being jibberish. Books, maps, so many things would have chunks missing from it.

Nothing wrong with this theory - That's exactly what would have happened if Joon didn't stop it. It was /just/ summoned right then, so it didn't have a chance to wipe out cities previously and mess things up much. It was very legitimately a possible end of world scenario, with the world making less sense and nobody noticing.

I do think the first one is also possible, but we need more information on attempts to communicate.
