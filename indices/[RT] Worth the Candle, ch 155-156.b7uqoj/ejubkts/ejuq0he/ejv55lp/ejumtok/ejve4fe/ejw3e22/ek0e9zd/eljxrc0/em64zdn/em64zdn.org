  Trying to get a bit better about putting out chapters not in giant 40K chunks, but no promises. Enjoy!

Well, this resolution appears to have been granted by an evil genie. I assumed the intent was to publish chapters more frequently going forward. Instead we are looking at the second month with no updates at all (unless you release some chapters /right now/), only unlike the last time you skipped a month of updates, your progress log shows you've written a little over half as much.

...Did the IRS repossess your muse? I mean the fact April 15 coincides with the release date timeframe you were hoping for does point to a governmental conspiracy!
