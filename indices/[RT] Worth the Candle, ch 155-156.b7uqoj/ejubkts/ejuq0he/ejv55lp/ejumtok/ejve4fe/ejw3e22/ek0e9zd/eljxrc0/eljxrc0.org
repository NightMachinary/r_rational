question/comment.

in chapter 68, juniper uses the idiom “earth-shattering.” this is relevant because he's talking to pre-twinned souls valencia, who is possessed, and so (as juniper says later in 68) he avoids all references to earth during their conversation. but not quite!

it's a neat little slip, and it's almost kind of fun given the line it directly follows, maybe even intentional?

but in theory devils who are aware of the dream-skewered, and have maybe heard the word “earth” etc etc could catch on. and that could have had bad consequences, though valencia almost immediately leveled up and took control.
