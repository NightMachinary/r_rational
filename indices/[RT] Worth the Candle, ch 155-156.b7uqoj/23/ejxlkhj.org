Regarding meta stilling, I think its application is much more constrained than we're thinking: it refers to "game effects", and I think that must be something specific, rather than "anything that has a duration in-universe".

Otherwise, Joon would be glowing from prince's invulnerability, the unicorn bone magic would still be active, and some of his demigod capabilities from Mome Rath's bones would still be there (he didn't spend it all against him, since he was still super fast when going for Valencia and the connection was already lost).

My guess is "game effects" refers to anything that has a duration specific to the game layer and which is only applicable to Joon and his companions.
