I don't see why this antimemetic effect prevents you from getting help.

If you have a chain of command, anyone under you will come to back you up if you give them an order to meet you at x location prepared for a fight, gather these things, I can't say why. (Side note: Keenan had Kel help him with antimemes on the regular).

Unless the antimeme extends as far as to make that vague an order impossible to hear or remember.
