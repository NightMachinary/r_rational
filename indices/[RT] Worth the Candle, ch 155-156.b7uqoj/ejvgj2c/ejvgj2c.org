I've been guilty of not commenting on the last few chapter batches, so I just wanna thank you for your continued efforts to bring us new installments of concentrated awesome.

​

I read the entire Mome Rath fight with some Shadow of the Colossus OST playing in the background and it was glorious. I'd recommend any reader to try it as well to really enhance the atmosphere! Speaking of which, I want to believe that Mome Rath also had some Colossus-like weak point somewhere along his upper surface- most likely on the back of the head or perhaps on the nape of the neck, if it's more Titan-inspired.

​

I'm happy that you included another Arthur flashback scene- those have really been getting rare lately and I love them so much, so I really hope we'll be getting more of those as the story goes on.

[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen][u/cthulhuraejepsen]] A question I've been meaning to ask for a while is: it occurred to me while re-reading the first chapters that critical hits and critical failures used to be a much, much more common occurrence than they are now. Is there a reason for that? Were the tutorial mechanics just different or is the game layer simply omitting them because they are less relevant as the power creep happens? I kinda miss them..

​

Finally, here's the tentative Joon Companion Power Level Tier List:

​

(in a standard fighting situation with little to no prep time)

​

S Tier: Bethel

A Tier: Raven

B Tier: Valencia, Solace (as representative of the 6E-Doe)

C Tier: Amaryllis, Fenn (as of her last appearance)

D Tier: Grak (sorry, our favorite warder would be much higher under a "with prep time" scenario)

​

This is of course just some fun speculation and doesn't take my personal like or dislike of each companion into account! I'd welcome any further discussion on the matter.
