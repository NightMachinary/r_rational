Thanks for taking the time to write such a detailed and satisfying answer! It's true that in the past it got a bit distracting at times to constantly have messages such as "X person defeated" pop up during fights. However, the way you used them in this chapter to name Mome Bats and Rats was pretty neat, and then of course it always feels very satisfying to receive the notification of a boss's defeat.

Still, a well placed crit or crit failure every once in a while might spice up fight scenes, so I hope to see them again sometime :)
