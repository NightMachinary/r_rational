Not giving them a defense against bone magic per se - that /would/ be quite cheap - but adding more mooks/complications that weren't encountered the first time around, that make it harder to get to the bones in the first place (which was only done the first time around through liberal use of unicorn bones and a Prince's Invulnerability). Or have something go wrong with the summoning.

Basically, the cheese plan would be subject to the Unspoken Plan Guarantee (in effect in WtC since it makes for a better story, and in effect in-universe since it makes for a better game). It worked the first time around because we didn't know it would - but if Joon and co. tried to cheese it, both [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] and the DM would be obliged to throw a spanner in the works.
