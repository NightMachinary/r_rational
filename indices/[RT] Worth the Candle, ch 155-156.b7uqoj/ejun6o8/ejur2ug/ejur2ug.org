Because unless you've got the political power to call in a fully loaded army for /no reason at all/ then you aren't getting support.

Maybe Uther could mobilize an army on his say-so, but nobody else is able to bring up an army without any reason, and it being literally impossible to share the reason. Maybe you could lie and say it's an <x> invasion, where <x> is some non-antimemetic threat, but you might not even be able to do that.
