The antimemetic effect works on induction as well. It might not literally block communication, but it prevents anyone from outside it's zone from thinking about it even in the abstract. You call someone, talk to them, describe Mome Rath only as a large creature that needs to be fought, and the person ends the call with absolutely no recollection of what happened or even the ability to deduce that there was something strange happening. The other person might even forget what you're saying as you're speaking, so they end the call because they think it's just silence on the other end, the words you're saying not even able to make into short term memory.

If what I'm thinking Joon is implying is correct, it's a ludicrously powerful effect, but that's fitting.

That's why he's glad that the Mome Rats have a much weaker effect. He can't notice them, but he can deduce where they are based on where he was hit from and where his weapon takes on a static form. If they had Mome Rath's full ability with no minimum range to the effect, he would be completely unable to think that there was anything off about his health points steadily dropping lower.
