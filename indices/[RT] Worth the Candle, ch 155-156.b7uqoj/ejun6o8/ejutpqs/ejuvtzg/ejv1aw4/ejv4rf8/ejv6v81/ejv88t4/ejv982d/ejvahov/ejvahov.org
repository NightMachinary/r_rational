Wait what? I wanna check if I'm understanding you.

You're saying when Mome enters a city, the entire outside world forgets about that city and everything inside it, and that they come up with any explanation they can to wave away the inconsistency.

After Mome leaves the city, the outside world suddenly remembers the affected city again? Do they remember themselves noticing the inconsistencies or not?
