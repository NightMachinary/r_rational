  I'm thinking Occams Razor has to apply and something simple is the right explanation

Eh, sure, I also think that "it prevents communication with the outside world" is a simpler explanation. Like you, I'm just arguing for the sake of the interesting thought.

  How does this level of power match with his displayed level of power?
#+end_quote

I don't know, you tell me. Do you think it doesn't? The whole Aerb thing is probably a simulation, which means the DM can put in arbitrary rules detached from any "sensible" "power levels" as long as he can come up with /any/ internally consistent explanation (to avoid breaking people's Suspension of Disbelief).

E. g.: Maybe Mome Rath doesn't need to manually edit every thought process; maybe thought processes are connected to/informed by some universal "space of ideas", and what Mome Rath does is blocking certain areas within that space, thereby achieving a universal effect by "local" interference. (And he doesn't target the physical area around himself because he doesn't want to forget about himself.)

  Even if it is simply impossible to conceive of Mome/Any monster that prevents thinking about it, you should still be able to conclude your thoughts are compromised
#+end_quote

So? People will realize that there's a phenomenon which compromises their thought processes, and that it's probably related to the phenomenon that destroys cities. It's still pretty far away from the truth.
