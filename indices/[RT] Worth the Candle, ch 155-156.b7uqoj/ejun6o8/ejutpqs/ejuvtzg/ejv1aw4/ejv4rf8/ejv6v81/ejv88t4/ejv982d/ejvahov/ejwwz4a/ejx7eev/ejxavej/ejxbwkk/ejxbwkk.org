  I don't know, you tell me. Do you think it doesn't?

Well, I mean on the one hand, it would be a planetary scale effect compromising entire regions of thought space. And on the other, people close by can see and think about it clearly. Your explanation works, the DM could just be like, yeah this is how it works because I said so, but that's just unsatisfying.

  So? People will realize that there's a phenomenon which compromises their thought processes, and that it's probably related to the phenomenon that destroys cities. It's still pretty far away from the truth.

Is it though?

I think it's functionally the same thing as inferring Mome's existence, which breaks down the logic of it all. You recognize that a phenomenon is compromising your thoughts, and that this phenomenon surrounds a small area and leaves physical destruction consistent with a large physical being smashing a city. Even if the two ideas are separate, used together they work to identify Mome and then it all breaks.
