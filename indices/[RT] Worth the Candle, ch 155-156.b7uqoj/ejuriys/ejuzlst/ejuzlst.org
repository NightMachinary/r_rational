  Do we know what this is?

Impact-factor, I believe. See [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/38858123][Chapter 131]], Raven's commentary:

#+begin_quote
  “Impact factor analysis. It's part of entad studies at Speculation and Scrutiny. ‘Once the metric has been applied to a sample population of entads, it becomes clear that i-factor follows a power law, with high i-factor entads being more and more rare as i-factor increases. <...> However, this difference is not accounted for by distribution of effects alone, and in fact appears to only be fully explained by a combination of usage restrictions, timing restrictions, and identity restrictions. These restrictions occur in various entads at exactly the rates necessary to ensure rough adherence to the power law, despite the distribution of raw effects following its own quixotic pattern.' Translated, there's some apparent force at work which limits entads such that they can't be too strong, and it's /not/ along the lines you would expect.”

Basically, how narratively important that entad is supposed to be.
