Thank you. Normally, I'd say that it is a ridiculous idea that the GM would slap down in an instant. However, Reimer did say that there was a massive argument as a result, implying that it was a massive breaking of the system, so there is precedent to it.

The downside is that Joon removed Woodworking back in his first foray into his soul, so he'll need to put it back in order to put any points to it. It looks like this should be possible by using Partial Stilling to freeze only some portions of his soul while editing the others.
