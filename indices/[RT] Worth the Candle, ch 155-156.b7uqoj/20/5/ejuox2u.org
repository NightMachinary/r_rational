  Repeated skilled-trades which are locked in by still magic seems like an excludable combination

I wonder how that would be excluded though. Exclusions always seem to target specific powers or magics. Breaking the game using the still magic virtue involves several different game mechanics. What would be excluded? The simplest way to disallow it would be to just change the level 100 virtue, but, nothing like that has actually ever happened before for Juniper, he's never been penalized for exploiting the rules by the rules being changed. The only times the rules changed were when his mind was being overidden. Other than that, he's been allowed to do what he wants with the game layer.
