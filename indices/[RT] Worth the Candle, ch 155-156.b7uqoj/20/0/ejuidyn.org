If I understand things right, Harold invades people and takes them over, once he grabbed enough people he makes them do the hum-drone, which is (part of?) a ritual to summon a Mome Rath. The way Finch and co. talk about him, Harold doesn't directly try to end the world, but rather heralds(lol) a world-ending threat by summoning/activating/etc it.
