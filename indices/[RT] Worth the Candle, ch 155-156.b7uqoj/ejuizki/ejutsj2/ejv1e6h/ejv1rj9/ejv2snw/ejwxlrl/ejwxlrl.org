I did the math [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zbyej/wiprt_worth_the_candle_ch_79_rule_zero/duohhko/][a while back]]. He needs 34/20 in the primary/secondary stats (with a freebie base of 2 at the start of the game) to hard cap a skill. The soonest he could have done it was at level 22 with a pure specialist build, but now that he's spread himself...it's not happening anytime soon. We also don't know what the primary/secondary stats are for Still Magic.
