Amaryllis, Pallida, Raven.

  I was blown from Mome Rath's back, my body twisted by the blast just to the point of being mildly uncomfortable and no more. I was twirling so quickly that my brain would probably have been smeared around the inside of my skull, had Prince's Invulnerability not protected against that. I couldn't see anything but blinding white until I was well clear of Mome Rath, and even then, everything was whipping around so fast that I couldn't make sense of it until I'd applied still magic to stop my rapid rotation.

Let's take votes for who dies and who lives, and how they live.

Amaryllis has the immobility plate. All she has to do is activate it before Prince's Invulnerability runs out and she stops the spin, then can just float down. Her not responding on Parson's Voice means she's either dead, unconscious or out of range of "Parson's Voice, would work on the scale of miles". Which is not impossible, but seems unlikely. If she wasn't able to activate the plate before the invulnerability ran out the spin would have rendered her unconscious and the fall would likely have killed her. She could theoretically have used half of Junipers still magic to stop the spin while still flying away, but that seems unlikely when she could activate the armor with just a thought.

The other two I'm less sure about. As far as I could tell, neither have an obvious method to stop the spin in 6 seconds, which honestly would likely kill them straight out as soon as their weren't invulnerable. And if not, it would at least knock them unconscious. I also don't think we know of any methods they have to stop long falls, but it seems likely that they both have something hidden away, which may or may not work with them unconscious.

So most likely case from a narrative point of view, they all get blown miles away but end up being fine and just take a while to get back. That lets us worry about them while Juniper is fighting Harold, but not overusing the "companion dies when you fight a big bad" narrative too much.

Small chance Pallida or Raven die, much smaller chance Amaryllis does.
