We get her perspective too much for this to be really possible, she is too consistent and crucial to the actually narrative stakes of the actual Narrative (not the internal meta-narrative) for her to be a simple bait and switch character like that, I can see why Arthur's wizard friend was, cause he was the mentor and he was necessary to pick Arthur out of his slump after his whole performance troupe got slaughtered due to him, if I had to pick a GM PC in our group it would be a toss up between Solace and Finch, or maybe Pallida, in that order of possibility.

Edit: in the process of a re-read I am even more certain about the solace guess, and absolutely believe that Uther was right about Vervain, one of his lines in Bethel's story screams DM to me "I am curious to see his reaction when he sees you like that, it might be the push he needs." Or something close to that, as if he knew who tiff was and had some understanding of how Uther might react to her likeness.
