Unicorn bones really make for such great fight scenes. It's like a time loop, only shorter. Lots of considering possible options, searching for viable solutions to difficult problems, it's a nice match for [[/r/rational]] I think.

Someone should totally write a fic where the protagonist has a similar power in a fight-heavy universe (Narutoverse? Worm?).
