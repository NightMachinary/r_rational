I feel like if he starts using Still Magic 100 to go all Apotheosis, it will get excluded.

I'm kind of expecting Joon to get /something/ excluded at some point in the story, just because it's an interesting mechanic and seeing it from the inside will explore another part of the world. Breaking the game and spiraling up into trivializing the rest of the story seems like a candidate for that.
