Even with this buff (however long it lasts), they're still short of the point where that's a good idea.

Taking the creature down burned a number of expensive, difficult to replace resources, and even then there was a fair bit of risk and luck. They would probably succeed should they face one again (in this state), but it's not nearly certain enough to do unless the situation is especially dire (while still being amenable to summoning and fighting).
