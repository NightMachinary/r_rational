Fucking fantastic chapters. Best fight scene I've read in forever. Bethel really shows her stuff, and I love the line "This creature has affronted me." Companions getting still magic is great, burning Money Rath's bones to fight it using blood magic is fantastic, Still Magic 100 for at least a day is great and potentially longer is amazing. These were totally worth all the build up.

I love the idea that Amaryllis is better at climbing than Joon is at anything.

Payoff for the Claret Spear was amazing. Still magic seems exactly as amazing as it seemed to be from the start, and future utilization will be neat.

Only minor gripe is that he probably should have used vibration magic pulses to fight the bats and rats, since it's an AoE attack that doesn't need much aiming.

Amaryllis is probably fine, as she has still magic and the Immobility Plate. Raven is likely fine, as I doubt that she adventured with Uther for years without a way of surviving large falls. Pallida may be out for a while if she dies and needs to be aged up with the time change.

Still Magic 100 probably makes Glassy Fields achievable, since they were reasonably confident in their success when Joon was much weaker than he is now.

Love this line mentioned in the early birds chat:

  [I'll check,] she said. [We're on our way up. Don't do anything rash.]

  I had reached the leg that was sticking through the building and was staring straight up. Mome Rath was enormous, maybe the biggest thing that I had ever seen in person, and I was just going to, what, stab it in the face until it died?

  Yeah, that seemed like what I was going to do.

"Don't do anything rash" Amaryllis says.

"I'm gonna stab the skyscraper sized monster in the face." Joon thinks immediately afterwards
