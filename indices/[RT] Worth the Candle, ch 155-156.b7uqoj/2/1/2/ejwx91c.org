Normally, I have little idea what's going to be happening in a batch as I start it, so I don't do music, and the battles are normally short enough that I don't have time to queue something up.

This time, though, I listened to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzmZOU5hVr8&list=RDJzmZOU5hVr8][one particular song]] from the Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance soundtrack. It was excellent.
