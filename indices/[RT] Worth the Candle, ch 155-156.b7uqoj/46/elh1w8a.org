Am I wrong in remembering that level ups refill Joon with blood? It happened in the sewers under Silmar city I believe.

Seems like either he didnt really level up in the temple and something else happened, the spirit thing fucked with the level up effect more severely than it seemed, hypertension is considered extra blood that doesnt get restored by lvls, or a mistake was made and he should have popped like a blood balloon when his blood pressure was suddenly doubled under the effects of blood magic wards.
