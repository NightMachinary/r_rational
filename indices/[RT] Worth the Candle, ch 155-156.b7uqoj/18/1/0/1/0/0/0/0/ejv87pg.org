Just so you know I've been putting out multiple theories and seeing what sticks, which is why I seem like I'm contradicting myself. Maybe I'll find one that solves all the problems.

  If it intelligently rewrites memories to make sense, that means it has control over it's own power and how that power is exercised, so it would be a choice to turn the effect down rather than a byproduct of it's biology.

Oh I didn't mean that Mome itself did it, just that the effect was "smart" enough (like a computer program) to rewrite instead of erasing.

  Also, evidence of an earthquake is very easy to recognize. It would be impossible to mistake the damage of a large multi legged creature striding through a city, impaling buildings and smashing it's way through in a specific path for earthquake damage. In fact, I'm struggling to come up with a memory it could rewrite that /wouldn't/ point to a large monster.

A) Could be memory of /another/ large monster, though arguably that is itself information about Mome, as you are narrowing down possibilities - this is kinda where logic breaks down you're right.

B) When Mome leaves people behind it, they have a fake memory (or memory hole) and suddenly find themselves in a ruined city with no idea of how it happened, with the happy city in one direction morphing into the ruined city before their eyes as Mome moves away.

  If he has a gap in his memory, people put it together and we can't have that.

Inferences could be allowed. I'm starting to think it's either a stupid strong power as reality appears to break down for people and they can't think, or a "relativity" weak one where a lot of inferences can be made, like you would quickly be able to work out it has lots of long legs and that it's big.

  An antimemetic threat that keeps swallowing up reality piece by piece whenever evidence of it spreads. It just keeps spreading because people can't help but notice and that's when it gets them.
#+end_quote

Yeah like that.
