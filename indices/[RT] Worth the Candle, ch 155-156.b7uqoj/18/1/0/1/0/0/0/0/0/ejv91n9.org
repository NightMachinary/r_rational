Lol, honestly I just want the author to straighten things out and say, oh yeah it also can do this. But I am having fun with thinking this through. Your end of the world scenario is actually terrifying. I keep thinking about the idea of a creature that uses every stray bit of information pointing towards it as a fishing line to reel people in. You can't fight it, you only lose.

  Oh I didn't mean that Mome itself did it, just that the effect was "smart" enough (like a computer program) to rewrite instead of erasing.

Yeah this works. The DM could be the programmer of whatever AI runs the effect.

  Inferences could be allowed. I'm starting to think it's either a stupid strong power as reality appears to break down for people and they can't think, or a "relativity" weak one where a lot of inferences can be made, like you would quickly be able to work out it has lots of long legs and that it's big.

Yeah this is the key thing for me. I just want to know if inference from the outside can be made. If you can, then it's not that big a deal. Just a big monster. If you can't, it's fucking broken and wrecks the world.
