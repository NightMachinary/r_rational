Hm. I'm thinking it's not just antimemetic, but... /anticognitive/.

With antimemes, given sufficient secondary evidence, you could figure out what they do: if you see a trail of destroyed cities, you would be able to infer the existence of an antimemetic monster.

But what if Mome Rath's deal is that not only does it erase memories of concepts, it /prevents you from figuring them out/? In that case:

All references to the affected city/people would be suppressed, and people outside would pick /any/ explanation for the inconsistency except the true one. You grabbed a blank paper by accident, the article's title contains a typo, you've never had a brother so you must have been thinking of your childhood friend instead, and so on.

Nobody outside would ever determine that a monster is on the loose. No effective response would be possible: first of all, because you won't be able to figure out that a threat even exists; second, because nobody would notice a blind spot if they encountered one (except post-factum, which is largely useless).

I'm sure /some/ kind of response would still be possible, by a sufficiently competent government, but I don't think the text states otherwise? Said response certainly wouldn't be /reliable/, and several cities would be destroyed for sure before even a pattern would be noticed.
