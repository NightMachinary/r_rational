Yes. While objects are inside Mome Rath's sphere of influence, people can't remember/conceive of them. Once Mome Rath leaves, people remember them again, and they /do/ remember not remembering.

However, since Mome Rath himself is /always/ inside his own sphere of influence, nobody could ever conceive of him --- even though the civilization at large would quickly notice a trail of destruction and start trying to figure out the pattern, they will never /succeed/ at that.

*Edit:* Yes, I think this is the source of our disagreement. You think that /either/ Mome Rath permanently erases cities from everyone's memory, causing gradual end of the world, /or/ the civilization figures out that Mome Rath exists from secondary evidence, effectively negating its effect. But that's a false dichotomy: the anti-cognitive effect is temporary for cities, but permanent for the monster itself.
