Yeah I thought about that but didn't consider it any less jibberish. Consider the following, you're looking at a picture of the mayor of New York, you know this man, he was at your wedding, you have plans to see him to discuss state issues tomorrow. A second later you either can't see the portrait or wondering why you're looking at a portrait of a stranger. You go sit down and read an article about the top 5 most iconic American cities but there are only 4 listed, strange you wonder. Several hours later you suddenly remember New York is a thing as well as the people there. There are tens of millions of people with similar stories of suddenly forgetting things that would be impossible to forget during a time frame in which New York was destroyed by some unknown force. It becomes easy to figure out what the threat is on Aerb and now you even have a way of detecting attacks; by tracking the blank spots.

If Mome's antimemetic ability is too powerful, it truly doesn't work. It has to be a low intensity antimeme backed up by some kind of communication blocker, but even in that case, a response by the government should be possible since there are so many workarounds and loopholes.

I'm really just arguing for the sake of the interesting thought at this point. I don't mind at all and really enjoyed the chapter.
