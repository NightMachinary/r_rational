I've already read the whole series.

The effect of Mome Rath doesn't seem to be as powerful, at least not how it's written. Grey's effect is powerful enough even after your dead and he's long gone, people won't notice the dead bodies (the logistics of this confuse me though).

But for Mome, people will still see the aftermath of his presence, the destruction and death. Even if something is scrubbing itself from your memory, if you see a destroyed city but no evidence to what caused it, you should be able to puzzle things out, like the rats and the sword, you can tell by inference.

If the effect only covers itself and not anything tangentially related, then messages not about it should work, such as a signal fire, or the flames of a burning city, or simply saying "come here."

If the effect covers everything within the 1 mile range and propagates with outbound information, for instance people don't notice phones ringing, letters sent, entads used or see the smoldering ruins of a destroyed city from a distance, then this description stops making sense because this functionally means infinite range which means it should work like Grey or the one in the later story that covers the whole world. Mome slowly wiping out city after city with no evidence of anyone or anything lost until Joon finally defeated it right now.

But if /that's/ the case, the world stops making sense. Wiping out cities would result in huge chunks of reality being jibberish. Books, maps, so many things would have chunks missing from it. Nothing about that works, so that's why I thought it had to be doing more than antimemetics to block messages.
