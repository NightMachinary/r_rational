The bit at the end with Finch seems suspicious. Finch sent Juniper here blind, and now suddenly we find out that not only is Finch in town, and not only does he have a secret Bethel-communication device, but he also has up-to-date info on Harold?

​

How does Finch even identify when someone is infected by Harold? I mean, unless they're standing still and humming.

​

I think Juniper's next step is to check if Finch is infected by Harold.
