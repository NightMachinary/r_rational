My takeaway from this chapter was mostly just how fucked Joon will be once his unicorn bones run out, tbh. He abused it a /lot/, and died a lot of times. Mome Rath was outside the difficulty curve (hence two levels), but it still seems like a bad omen that he had to savescum to bats or burn several loops trying to get Valencia to not die, and only succeeded in a way that would be impossible without the loop.
