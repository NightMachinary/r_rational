Nah, Amyrillis won't die, the story just can't let her, I see it as far more likely that she was punted into some wards that stop her replying with Parson's voice. I can also see her being separated from Joon for awhile, she needs some time to develop as a character away from him, she got some when the soul mage hijacked, and that was great for her character development and progression, I can see her possibly having been captured and having to break her way out without Joon's help, this would challenge her over reliance on narrative, as the idea of her breaking free on her own is counter to the idea that this is solely Joon's story, and also give her some time to think about June from a less objective and more emotional perspective.

All of that and I will also be /supremely/ pissed if she dies, like, dropping the book level pissed, Fenn's death was tragic but had obvious benefits story wise, in teaching Joon how to healthily deal with grief and changing the dynamic between him and quite a few party members, Amyrillis' death would serve little purpose but to halt the stories progression until Joon found a new motivator, as she is more or less the driving force of the party, the person with ambition and foresight, even if Joon is nominally the leader.
