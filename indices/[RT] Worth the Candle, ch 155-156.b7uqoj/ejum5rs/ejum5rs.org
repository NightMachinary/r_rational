Ok, more thought out comment! I enjoyed that the core resolution of the "puzzle" of Mome Rath didnt actually depend on still or vibration magic. They helped him get up there and survive the consequences, no question, so the quest goals clearly connected to the (sub)Boss Fight. Yet the actual key was the blood spear and bloodlines powers, which he picked up this arc by...making friends. I appreciate how its these smaller and personal connections that continually make the actual difference - those points being put into social were probably well spent, and it might continue to be a good investment.

On a wider level, its very frequent for Mary to resent Joon for going off "impulsively", and thinking that he has no plan, and I feel like that misunderstands how thinking can work some time. Joon certainly did not have the "suck-bone-to-power-bloodlines" plan in mind when he first started climbing the leg, but he had all the parts in his mind - he knows he has multiple magics, that they will synergize *somehow*, and he just has to figure out the right way. This improvisational approach is often how plans in combat are going to have to work, given that its combat. I think its something she thinks can be "solved" with proper planning, but it actually cant, and going into a situation without a plan - but with the knowledge that you have enough pieces to devise one in the moment - is not in fact a bad play all the time.
