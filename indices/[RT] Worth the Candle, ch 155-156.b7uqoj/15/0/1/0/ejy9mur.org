Interesting you get those associations from outgrabe. For me, what comes immediately to mind is "grave," that and some idea of growth. "Outgrabe" by itself makes me think of a zombie thing of some sorts, or a spreading, cancerous parasite that is beyond its normal containment. In the poem, I read different connotations:

#+begin_quote
  All mimsy were the borogoves/And the mome raths outgrabe.
#+end_quote

That reads to me like a thing the Mome Rath is doing; although it does come after the Jabberwock is dead and I think is supposed to make one think of frolicking woodland animals (not moon-sized Kaiju).
