This. June munchkined the blood-bone combo to ultimately win but even with those tricks he would have been smeared across the sky several times without Prince's Invulnerability and unicorn bones. Really curious to see how some archetypical 5-man party would have done it, given it was moving faster than the speed of sound and they (probably?) wouldn't be able to just kill it from the inside.

I can think of a couple potential solutions, or maybe parts of solutions. As you mentioned, turning Mome Rath's weaponry or ecology upon itself, which they do in-story, sort of. Or managing to completely evade its notice, only killing the Bats and Rats; avoiding the red acid pores; and maybe something a next level up in terms of difficulty in the finger-hair until they find some sort of secret weak spot (although typing that out it sounds very video-gamey). Then Mome Rath isn't so much a boss in-itself but a living dungeon with a different more level-appropriate challenge awaiting at the end.
