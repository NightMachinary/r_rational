Path to Victory: Write down a bunch of conjectures about arbitrary things. Ways to reverse magical entropy, for example. Organize them in a grid. "How many of these conjectures are true?" If >0, keep subdividing the grid until you find the true ones. Iterate this process until you have a way to return magic to the world. Repeat for any other desired outcome.
