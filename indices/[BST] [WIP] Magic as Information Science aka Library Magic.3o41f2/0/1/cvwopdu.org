That might fail because of the fudge factor. On the other hand, it might work if the fudge factor only comes up when the question is inherently vague.

Also, assuming the fudge factor doesn't turn up, what you want to do is ask the question "what is the number which consists of 0, +1 if the first question is true, +2 if the second is, +4 if the third, +8, etc. Whether this or the grid method is better depends on how likely it is for a conjecture to be true--the grid works better if the conjectures are only rarely true. Also, you have to word it carefully if you're only allowed to ask questions about how many of something. (How many apples would be of a quantity equal to the number you get by....")
