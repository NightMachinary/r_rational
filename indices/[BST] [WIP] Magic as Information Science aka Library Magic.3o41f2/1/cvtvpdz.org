I haven't quite managed to squeeze my head around this, but it sounds awesome. I think the first thing I'd do, if I had enough resources, would be to crowdsource the complete dataset - figure out optimal quotas, then assign people that amount of data to categorize or cross link or subcategorize or whatever. Build a system to verify all categorizations, and penalize anybody who tries to cheat the system. What do they get in return? Access to raw, unmined data. While public catalogues are free to access, the vast tracts of unmined information represent a possible goldmine - and if you stumble across a drug compound produced by an extinct species or an untapped iridium source, you get to exploit the information as best as you're able. There could be tiers of computation, organized by risk and reward - working on pure stats straight from the Questionomicon would give you the best access to data, doing subcategorizations would be less so, all the way down to Wikipedia-esque summarizations of sets of abstracted data.

Basically, you're sitting on a goldmine. Exploit it with carefully managed capitalism, and some shiny public-interest nuggets should fart out the back end.

I feel like I have the whole concept wrong, though.
