The story I am writing is a Steven Universe fanfic.

The healing powers in that one is a fountain's worth of water that does not really regenerate, and the saliva glands of a young boy. Said liquid will cure most things incrementally, up to and including aging if given in large enough doses. We're talking a glass of water, here.

Not many people you can save that way.

In fact, the characters reason about the healing saliva power and come to the conclusion that healing sick people in hospitals would be counterproductive; in a direct expy to Worm's Panacea.
