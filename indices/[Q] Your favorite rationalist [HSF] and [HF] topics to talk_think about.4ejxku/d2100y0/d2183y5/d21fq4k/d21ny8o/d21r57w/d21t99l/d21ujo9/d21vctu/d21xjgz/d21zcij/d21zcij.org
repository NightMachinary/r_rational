That's why it's important to be smart about the money you spend to guarantee your own freedom. The first step is to make a shit-load of money reasonably covertly. It really is amazing what a sufficiently large pile of money can accomplish. Next, you make massive campaign contributions to /every/ politician, focusing on the ones who have more say over areas that affect you. You simultaneously go public and pay for large, expensive public awareness campaigns that spin a narrative that makes locking you up morally abhorrent to a large percentage of the populace. Shouldn't be a hard sell, relatively few people are utilitarians. It should also include the fact (lie) that you are already giving blood at the maximum rate physically possible without long term effects.

At the same time you hire a truly excessively large guard detail, comprising of members from at least 3 different companies and set up a series of well-known and not-so-well-known contingencies that will send out information implicating whoever attacks you for public backlash purposes. Make it so that you /will/ be seen as a martyr if you go down, and everybody knows that. Next you set up a trust (or five) whose job would be to perpetually campaign for your freedom if you are ever captured. Then you put away some money to set up a series of bounties on your own head, promising a million dollars per person to anyone who works as part of a force to free you. If there is any feat you can do as the prime regenerator that no-one else can do, you should do it in public as frequently as practical. Best to keep a schedule in fact. That way it becomes extremely obvious if you've been replaced. You attempt to become friends/allies with the non-political figures of power in your chosen country, and possibly some other countries as well.

You want it to be political suicide to try such a thing. You want it to be extremely difficult to physically accomplish. You want it to have large and clearly outlined consequences even in the case of success. You want most people to believe that it wouldn't accomplish anything even if they succeeded. None of this is a guarantee of freedom, but it most certainly improves your chances a great deal.

That, is the power of properly applied money.
