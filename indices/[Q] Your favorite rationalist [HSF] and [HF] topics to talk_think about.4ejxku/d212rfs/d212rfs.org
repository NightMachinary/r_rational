I like to think about how to rationalize biological humans outside the solar system, and how a human-AI war might /at all/ be balanced.

It turns out that these two problems actually solve each other:

1.  Enter a second cold war. Humans build automated underground bases.

2.  One of these bases is given too much autonomy and starts a secret development branch for weaponry.

3.  This base launches an attack on all other military bases in an effort to remove all military threats on the planet.

4.  Humans manage to thwart the attack by quickly adapting to non-electronic machinery and blasting AI-controlled areas with EMP, employing microwave weapons, etc.

5.  AI weapons now require heavy electronic shielding in order to operate, which reduce some of the advantages AI weaponry have over humans, such as the need for heavy life-support systems, maximum G's, etc.

6.  The war drags on, the AI finally gets the upper hand, and humans send colony ships into space to escape destruction.

7.  The AI, having achieved its objective, stays on Earth and continues to invest in greater computing capacity and researching more advanced weaponry, as commanded by its programming.

8.  Humans spread a small distance into the galaxy over the following centuries.

9.  The AI exhausts the resources on Earth and the solar system, looks outward, and decides humans are still a threat.

10. The AI builds space fleets, but humans already have an established presence and can bring the combined resources of a hundred systems to bear on the superior AI technology.

11. Over the following milennia, humans continue to run deeper into the galaxy, while trying to destroy the AI. Meanwhile, the AI continues to expand, its intellect growing larger over time.

12. Hundreds of thousands of years later, the entire galaxy is occupied by the two warring forces, both sides having completely optimized weaponry, tactics, and strategy.

13. War has been perfected, and will not change until the galaxy finally fades into darkness as the stars cool and entropy ultimately strangles the last warrior on some scarred planet orbiting a cold, dead, star.
