  I don't think a backpack a day, or even an hour, or even every ten minutes would do little for more than SEVEN BILLION people.

The regen has some maximum flow rate of blood, and given the amounts of money we're talking here you could pay people to stand around and change out the containers in your backpack every minute of the day if that's what needed, or if that's impractical then set up a fixed feed. Yes it might be a bit annoying, yes it'd look a bit weird, but it's still a whole lot better than the alternative which I'm given to understand is basically being strapped to a table for eternity.
