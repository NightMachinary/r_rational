  Would not the most moral course be to allow yourself to be strapped into a giant blood suction/nutrient input machine 24/7 for the rest of eternity (or until technology can do the same, which it probably never will since there will be no profit in the research)?

Technically speaking, there's no need for the suction/nutrient machine to be particularly troublesome to a regenerator of Clair's level of power. A few tubes stuck into your back leading into a backpack which contains some tech, and you're good to go. You use most of the absurd amounts of money you could make from selling perfect healing with a side of effective immortality if regularly dosed to spend money on medical research. Smaller amounts of money are spent guaranteeing your own continued freedom and generally living a pretty great life. You're essentially immortal, so you've got very good chances of living long enough to see the need for your blood taper down to nothing, at which point you're one of the richest people on the planet. J K Rowling has got nothing on you.
