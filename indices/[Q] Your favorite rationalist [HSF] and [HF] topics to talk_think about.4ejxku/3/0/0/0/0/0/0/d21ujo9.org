  A few tubes stuck into your back leading into a backpack which contains some tech, and you're good to go.

Ahem. I think a backpack a day, or even an hour, or even every ten minutes would do little for more than SEVEN BILLION people. However, a regenerator of Clair's level /might/ be able to come close to supplying enough for everyone. It seems to me it would take a whole lot more than a few backpacks per day, and I don't think she would be doing any walking while losing that much mass per minute, but she might be able to do it. . .
