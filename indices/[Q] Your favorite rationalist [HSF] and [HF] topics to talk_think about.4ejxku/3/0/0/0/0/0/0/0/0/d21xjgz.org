Would it be allowed, though? Panacea would be a problem -- she could either refuse to heal or else put deadly time delay breakdowns in anyone important she heals and then hold them for ransom. But Clair can't stop making more blood if she's injured. What's to stop a government from cutting off her arms and legs and hooking her up to vacuum pumps in order to maximize production in the name of the greater good, or something equally gruesome? And even if they didn't do that, why would they pay her lots? I would at least expect the government to notice the massive flow of funds and impose a 99.9% windfall profits tax or something like that come next budget crisis.
