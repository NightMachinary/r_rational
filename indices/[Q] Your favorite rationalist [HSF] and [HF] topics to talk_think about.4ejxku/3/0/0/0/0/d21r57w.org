How about Panacea from Worm? Hands on healing of anything in a fairly short time, limits are no "wellness plague" or creation of magic nanotech equivalent, no self healer/power cloning. Just one of you who can heal any illness (including old age) or reshape someone's body however they want, a requirement of two to ten minutes per patient depending on complexity of request, and seven billion people needing your attention. Feel like committing suicide yet?

I've spent some time thinking about how a person like that might go about becoming emperor of the world since they are the only supply of the most valuable thing on earth.

Or suppose you got Clair's power from the otherwise moronic show, "Heroes." You regenerate like Wolverine and injecting a drop or two of your blood into someone else will heal them of anything, including being dead but not yet decomposed. Would not the most moral course be to allow yourself to be strapped into a giant blood suction/nutrient input machine 24/7 for the rest of eternity (or until technology can do the same, which it probably never will since there will be no profit in the research)?
