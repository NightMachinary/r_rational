The vast majority of stories had other works as influences, but I'm arguing that Eragon has a much higher degree of parallelism to A New Hope than most stories. The Hero's Journey is a pretty general pattern, as you say there are lots of books that follow it, but I wouldn't claim anywhere near the same resemblance between most of those and Eragon. Lilo & Stitch is a textbook example of the Hero's Journey, for one, but which looks nothing like Eragon.

Meanwhile, from memory- a farm boy raised in a backwater area by his uncle with no knowledge of his father, amidst an evil Empire, leaves home and returns to find his farm and family destroyed. Flees with a wise, eccentric old man who turns out to have been a member of the powerful magical order of which no one else remains because the Emperor and his right hand (who used to be a promising part of that order and ends up being the farmboy's father) murdered them all and overthrew the old republic.

The first scene? Princess carrying the key to beating the Empire gets ambushed by the Empire and manages to randomly cast her key until it reaches the main character, setting everything in motion.

A quick web search shows that apparently others have thought this as well and done more [[http://inheritance.wikia.com/wiki/The_Star_Wars_Connection][in-depth comparisons]] if that helps. I wouldn't say he plagiarized it by any means as there are [[http://impishidea.com/criticism/why-eragon-didn-t-really-rip-off-star-wars][some differences]] and he very much made the story his own.

I'm also not saying this is necessarily an extremely negative thing, because it led to something very different and original, but that doesn't mean I should dismiss it either.

Edit: Also, obviously your examples are debatable, but I don't see how using examples of other works that copy each other is a good argument. It doesn't matter if everyone falls back down to Earth after jumping, gravity still clearly exists.
