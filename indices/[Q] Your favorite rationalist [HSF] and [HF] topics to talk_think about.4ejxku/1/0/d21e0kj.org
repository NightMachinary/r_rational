I get my thrill for this from watching competitive video games. There's probably a similar level of strategy with physical sports, but it's more opaque to me.

One pet example: in the game DotA 2 there are two teams of 5 players controlling "heroes" (each with a unique sets of skills, picked before the game begins in a strategic draft) attempting to destroy the other's ancient (hence the name, "Defense of the Ancients").

The standard way to do this was, for a long time, trying to win a massive 5v5 fight and attack the enemy base. Do this enough and you would destroy their ancient.

Some teams, notably Alliance, realised that you didn't actually /have/ to do the "massive 5v5 fight" part, you could just go straight to destroying the base.

So they more or less used guerrilla warfare, splitting their force so that one group could tentatively engage the enemy team while the other attacked the enemy base. If the enemy team tried to disengage so they could defend their base, the engaging force could prevent that.

The strategy was extremely successful. Opposing teams often wasted their bans in the pre-game draft phase to counter heroes often picked for this strategy, which gave teams known for their ability to utilise it an early advantage (able to get key heroes for other, more traditional strategies).

"Ratting", as it became known, has waxed and waned in popularity along with changes to the game's balance, but it's been a fascinating inclusion in the game's meta.

I'm skipping a lot of the detail here as it's likely extremely boring to anyone who isn't already interested in the game. Hopefully it illustrates that you can find examples of military strategies writ small in competitive video games.
