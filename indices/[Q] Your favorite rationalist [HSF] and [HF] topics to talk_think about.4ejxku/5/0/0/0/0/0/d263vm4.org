The other thing about R! Animorphs i'd like to ask, is how does it handle half-morphs. Animorphs, being stuck halfway was a legitimate concern. Is that a thing in R! ?

You're right for outright killing people, but I wouldn't just want people to be wiped out, I would want them to destroy themselves. Having 3-4 che guevera's running around still alive, trying to convince everyone they're the real one would do damage the the cause of che guevera than just killing him.

I think that having even more could utterly discredit the movement, you know? The other problem would be if the individual che's decided to work together. Therefore, I guess, I would rather have the person morph into a form of someone else who isn't a part of those movements. It's easier to take apart a gang by separating the people than it is to deal with a whole group.

The other interesting thing about people with the morphing ability, is that I bet you'd wind up with a lot of people walking around as their own spouses/children/grandchildren/sexually desired partners or pets, not so much random people, but people the person works with and touches on a daily basis.

If I was given morphing powers and had no idea about the rules of said morphing powers, I would think I'd end up as my girlfriend or some hot girl I had met and somehow touched/shook their hand more than I would anyone else. Especially if I was drunk, and my inhibitions were lowered to a fault.
