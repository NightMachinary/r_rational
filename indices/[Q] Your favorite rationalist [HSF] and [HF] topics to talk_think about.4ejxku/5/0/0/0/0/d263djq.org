It took the people in the story quite a while to figure out what morphing /really/ is. So I really doubt somebody would figure it out all on their own over the course of 2 hours, which they would need to do in order to trawl through the morph of you's memories.

Also your mind is separate from the morph you're controlling and stays in extradimensional space. Unless you know how stuff works you're just puppeting a body just like in non R!animorphs.

My plan goes like this: Abduct someone touch them with the cube, get them to acquire and morph into you, drug them unconscious and wait.

Also touching people without telling them the limit is a terrible method of murder, as a end result you might end up with an addition version of some random person. Plus you have /morphing/ you can just turn into a bear and fucking maul their ass, there's so many ways to kill somebody this way without giving them powers.
