All right. The R! animorphs morphs makes a ton of sense. So basically by morphing into someone, you're essentially a yeerk for 2 hours or you risk becoming that person completely.

The clones of myself thing would be a ton of fun, but if you are giving others access to your memories by forcing them to morph into you, that could backfire horrendously. I would force these people to morph into someone that didn't know the rules of morphing, so that they wouldn't be able to morph back out, as there is no way to stop them from going back and forth on their own without their choice.

Then there are other ways, such as letting them destroy themselves, by giving lower members of these groups the power of the cube and telling them that they can become anyone just by touching and thinking about it, without telling them of the 2 hour rule.
