Ok so just to clarify the main difference in morphing in the R!animorphs is that when you morph into someone you are literally morphing into a copy of them, with all the memories you had when you copied their dna and you are basically puppeting their body exactly like a yerk, apparently the means of controlling your morph was modelled after yerks.

So if someone stays in a form past the 2 hour limit they basically die and the morph they were controlling is now able to control it's own body. If I am the only group who can dispense morphing ability then I don't need passcodes, I will be able to communicate with my conspirators telepathically (you get that ability when you get morphing, but you can only do it while morphed, but you can morph into yourself)

Also you don't need yerks for any part of my plan even if they exist. When you morph into someone you are basically controlling a copy of them like a yerk, and you can actually get information out of them this way.

As I said in my plan I /would/ have allies, however because I can't trust more than a dozen people, everyone working for me who I gave morphing powers, would have to be a clone of one of them.

If you are overthrowing oppressive regimes they don't know to protect against shapeshifting. You could have a bunch of your guys turn into insects to sneak into all the high ranking officials houses, then bam you've overthrown the government overnight. Once you control everybody then nobody will be suspicious that nobody goes longer than 2 hours without excusing themselves to the bathroom to remorph.

Again I can't stress enough how overpowered morphing abilities are when going up against enemies who don't even know morphing exists.
