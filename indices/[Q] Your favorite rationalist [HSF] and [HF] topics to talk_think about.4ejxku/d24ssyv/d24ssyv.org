Recently I have thought a lot about how I would exploit R!animorphs morphing ability if I was after an invasion or if I somehow ended up with the cube and I'm not in the animorphs universe.

My main thought is that I would go to mexico and find a bunch of drug cartels (being full of ruthless murderers at the highest levels, and being very wealthy these are good targets), I would infiltrate the organizations with morphing to steal money, and I would kidnap ruthless cartel members I could justify killing and force them to stay morphed as me until the timer ran out.

Effectively given how morphing works in R!animorphs if you can find people you are willing to kill you can force them to stay morphed as you and then you end up with clones of yourself.

If I had this power on vanilla earth I could use it to gain control of a massive number of oppressive regimes and would end up with hundreds of forks of myself and probably thousands of forks total when you include the forks of the other people who are working with me.

Hell once I have control over several governments (all high ranking members being forks of me or my friends) then I can go through their prisons converting criminals who are utterly irredeemable into more clones. After a few months I suspect I would control what would collectively be the most powerful nation on earth, and I would have hundreds of thousands of clones working for my organization.

Hmm after looking at how many countries have serious human rights violations or lack of freedom of speech by my standards for oppressive I would end up controlling most of asia, africa and the middle east. Any advice on implementing democracies in countries, once you already have total control over their governments?
