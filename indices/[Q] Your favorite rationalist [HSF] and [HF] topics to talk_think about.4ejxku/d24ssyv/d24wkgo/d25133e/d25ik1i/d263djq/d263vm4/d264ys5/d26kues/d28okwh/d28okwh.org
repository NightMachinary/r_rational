I'll second the recommendation, and not just for the morphing rules - it also features a /competent/ Visser 3, able to extract the levels-within-levels strategic thinking of his Andalite host (despite his resistance) to supplement the Visser's own already-high intelligence.

The result of which is that there's no period of time where the Animorphs are playing on "easy" mode, against a foe that underestimates them or forgets to account for their existence; from the off the Yeerks' assumption is that they're playing against a high-level opponent using optimal strategy... which actually really confuses them for a little while trying to puzzle out the hidden purpose of certain mistakes. Also every chapter carries a non-trivial risk of them all dying horribly (I'm still having some trouble imagining how they're supposed to eventually overcome their resource disadvantages to /not/ inevitably die horribly).

It's a bunch of fun.
