Again to be very clear: in order to have an easy time taking over the world, I /NEED/ to make sure nobody knows about morphing and thus nobody taking precautions against it.

So the only people who would get it (except for the people who get it briefly before becoming a clone) would be me and the dozen other people I was willing to trust, plus the countless clones of me and my dozen conspirators. Having clones of an enemy running around would have uses yes, however it would tip people off that something was up and I can't have that, *secrecy is extremely important*.

Also I'm assuming I know how morphing works otherwise without knowing about the limit the first time I used it I would almost certainly die from the time limit.

Half morphs aren't really a thing, being stuck like tobias in a animal form also can't happen given how this R! morphing works, effectively you just die once the time limit runs out and the body you were controlling gets to live on.
