(Note: I don't know if R! animorphs changes the rules of the universe at all, but here's my take on the standard animorphs universe)

You make it sound easy though. What about secret pass codes or phrases these groups use to verify that everyone is who they say they are?

There's a lot to be said about the stuff you don't know about people.

And the having so many clones of yourself running about would be insane. Personally, instead of that, I would try to bring over at least two yeerks(?) with me, and convince them to be a part of my plan, so that I could have some allies along with me, and they could literally be the people I need for the moment.

The second part, is that I would have the ruthless leaders of these bad groups kidnapped and be forced to be clones of the 'yeerked' people. Sure, I'd have a couple of my own clones running around, but instead I would morph into the form which my yeerk friend is controlling, so that in the event of some kind of failure, I would have a way of getting out of the situation.

The last thing, would be to have the person be tricked into freely morphing into a form (say a sexy model) and then drug them past the 2 hr limit.
