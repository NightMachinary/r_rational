The experiment seems fairly strait forward. Microwaves and an enclosed copper cone. There is also a lot of excitement around it. I wonder if anyone (with a really well tooled garage) hasn't just taken apart a microwave oven to see if they could also create the same effect... although experimenter's bias...

I guess my question is if the scientists think that (if it works) they may be able to make it more effective, why some engineer hasn't made one effective enough to not ignore?

Although if I take a few different fictional futures with the various possible outcomes all being present, it seems either very silly/stupid to try, or very brilliant. If it is stupid, no one needs to know you even tried...

Edit: if this does work, would anyone with more knowledge than me (someone who has read more than just a few old papers on quantum physics, etc) point out why one couldn't try this /in/ one's own microwave oven?
