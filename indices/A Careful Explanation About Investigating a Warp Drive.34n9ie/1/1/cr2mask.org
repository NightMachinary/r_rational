Quite a number of engineers have repeated the original experiment in their own time and their results concur with the current results online. Probably the biggest reason nobody has made it better is that nobody knows why exactly it works - also one of the reasons many 'big' science groups haven't bothered testing it. (they'll probably just assume it's a crackpot's fabricated idea)

Until the Eagleworks experiment, nobody really cared. Due to not knowing how it functions - the best current hypothesis being microwaves 'pushing' against quantum bubbles - it would be very difficult for one to make it 'better'. I'm guessing that the scientists who think they could make it more effective are working on the premise that, by figuring out how it works in the first place, they'll be able to improve upon it.
