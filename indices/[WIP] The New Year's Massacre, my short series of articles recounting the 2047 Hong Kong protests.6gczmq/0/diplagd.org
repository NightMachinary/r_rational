Solid! I like the gist of it, and the world that it's setting up. If you haven't read "Nexus", you should read that.

However, the intro is a little jarring and a little lacking. For both the purposes of exploring your Hong Kong, and for the purposes of improving this particular narrative, you should start when the celebrations start, and walk us all the way through. I want to see the moment(s) the party turns into a protest.

Also, as good as this is (and it's good), I would also recommend, at a later date, a complete rewrite - when you know Rachel Hua's voice better, and your Hong Kong better.

Finally, I would also throw in more near-future tech / future references; 2047 is further away from now than the world before the Internet. Not a lot more future tech; but enough to let us feel that we're not in Kansas anymore (maybe the NY ball drop is the first shipment from the first orbital asteroid mine? Maybe the fireworks are all launched from zeppelins?), and to answer some of the current known future issues, like drones, oil dependency, etc. What role do private and public drones play in this world of yours?
