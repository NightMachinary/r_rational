On the politics side it feels more like a straightforward valiaet rebels vs evil government narrative than really makes sense in the hong kong context. [For background I'm no fan of the CCP, but have lived in the area and followed the politics for a while].

Would be interesting to see it split up more into looking at the perspectives of different factions. THere's some cool stuff available from the Tianmen protests that talks about different elements of the government trying to make compromises, different leaders among the students arguing about how to react to their offers, tensions between student protestors and beijingren who agreed on the general goals but not everything. etc.
