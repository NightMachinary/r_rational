Mm, you're probably right. I can see a good amount of stats, but not actually what percentage of readers come internally from FIMFiction, so I kinda forget it happens. [[/r/rational]] is small enough that my updates kick around on the front page for a while regardless of post time (and [[/r/mylittlepony]] doesn't care about my story yet =[) but yeah, maybe my FIMF readership could benefit.

Oh, and that sentence wasn't a typo, but it was still a poor choice. Thanks for the feedback!
