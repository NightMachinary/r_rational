You're probably getting more traffic from fimfiction than you realize. Shears has been up since November 18, so about two months, in which time it's had 884 visitors. I don't know what the baseline is, but I started a fic on the 5th of January, and it's had 100 visitors. Views increase exponentially, so adjusting for how long it's been up, that's 300-600. If we pretend for a moment that people on fimfiction are equally likely to click on either (which isn't really a reasonable assumption but whatever) that puts your fimfiction traffic at anywhere from a third to two thirds of the total.
