I have a theory, though no particular evidence to back it up, that posting updates in the evening will reduce your overall exposure as compared to posting in the afternoon. With fewer people on fimfiction looking through recent updates late at night, you may end up buried before prospective new readers can find you.

I just thought I'd share. Obviously the chapter is super great. Spotted a typo:

"Twilight tries to scan for blood her memories of the gallop back to town hall, but it's a technicolor blur."
