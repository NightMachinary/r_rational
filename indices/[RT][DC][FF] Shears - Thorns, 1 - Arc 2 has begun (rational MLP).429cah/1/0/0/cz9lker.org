As Calamitizer mentioned, posts on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] tend to stay up a while, so it's no special concern here - though it would certainly help for [[/r/mylittlepony][r/mylittlepony]]. I was referring to fimfiction itself, the site the fic is hosted on, where stories tend to only get attention for a few hours after updating. In that case, I suspect there are more people reading in the late afternoon, though as I mentioned that's only speculation.

Also: OMG /alexanderwales is talking to me/.
