[[/u/gramineous]] suggested that I mention that I have a Patreon campaign, so [[https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks?fan_landing=true][here it is]].

It looks like most "get early access to chapters" reward tiers are $3, so that's what I've set that particular tier at, but it's worth noting that I write a lot of other things, too, including worldbuilding resources and original fiction, and there's a $1 tier that just covers getting free access to anything I'm putting on my store. That's what the campaign was originally for, actually.

Recent releases have included "108 Titles & Epithets for Gods" and "Cooking for Vampires," which covers the kinds of flavors that vampires are likely to be sensitive to (and why), what happens when you bake or cook with blood (it can replace eggs in pancakes!), and stuff like that. Both of these are still available for anyone who joins the Patreon in the next couple of weeks.

(And for those of you who prefer to not mix Patreon with fanfic, rest assured that it'll be months before I talk about this again, if at all)
