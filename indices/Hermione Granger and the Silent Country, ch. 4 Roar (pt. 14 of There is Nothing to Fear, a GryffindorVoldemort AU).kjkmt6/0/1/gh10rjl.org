Serious question, as you have [[https://nordicfoodlab.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/2013-9-blood-and-egg/][linked]] a recipe and probably researched the matter:

What about the iron in the blood and all the pathogens. If you also eat meat and a lot of blood you should get an overdose of iron. And I guess they didn't always cook the blood enough to kill all pathogens. So it seems quite unhealthy.

After reading the linked article a bit: Egg intolerance as major allergy in Europe is new for me. Maybe only in specific countries? I have never even heard of that in the first place. Okay a quick google scholar search confirms at least that it is a thing.

[[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1398-9995.2001.056005403.x][This study]] says 1.6-2.6% of children have egg allergy.

Here the [[https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=egg+intolerance+prevalence&btnG=][search query]] if anybody is interested in further information.
