It's no different than keeping track of fiber, or vitamin c intake. Blood does have a lot of iron in it, but it's possible to not consume an unhealthy amount. Consuming blood is great for people with anemia, and [[https://www.amazon.com/Hematogen-50g-1-8-Oz-bars/dp/B01MSN40V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8][blood candy bars]] are relatively popular in the former Soviet Bloc (you shouldn't have more than one a day, but really, should you have more than one of /any/ candy bar in a single day?).

I haven't read anything to suggest that bloodborne pathogens are hardier or trickier to deal with than what you'd find in meat, and most of the recipes I've come across do thoroughly cook the blood.

Other fun blood foods:

- Black pudding

(To repeat what you said, though---real people shouldn't eat this stuff too often. Cooking for Vampires is meant for worldbuilding, not IRL meal planning.)
