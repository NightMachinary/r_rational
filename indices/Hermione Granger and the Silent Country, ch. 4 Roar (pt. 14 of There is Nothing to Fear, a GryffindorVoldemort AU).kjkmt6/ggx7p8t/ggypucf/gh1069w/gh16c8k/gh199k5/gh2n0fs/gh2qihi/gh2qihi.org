All of the previous stories in TINTF are canonical for HG & the SC. You can think of them as a very long prelude.

(HG & the SC will probably be as long as the rest of TINTF, and then there will be 2-3 more stories of that length, then an equivalently-sized postlude, plus some number of interludes scattered throughout).
