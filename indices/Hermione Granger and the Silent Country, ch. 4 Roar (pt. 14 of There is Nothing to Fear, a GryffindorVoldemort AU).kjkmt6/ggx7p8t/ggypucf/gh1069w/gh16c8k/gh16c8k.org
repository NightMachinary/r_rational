  Only read HG-at-SC of this series, but like it so far.

There are a couple of other people who are in the same boat, and I'm /very/ interested to hear whenever you have questions (as you do at the end of your comment). I'd obviously prefer if everybody read every story, but it's kind of a weird format and to be honest they were written over such a span of time that I feel like there's a noticeable quality difference in some of them, so I'd like to make sure that Silent Country is comprehensible for people who skip all that.

  I am also waiting for a believable explanation for why Malfoy is how he is.
#+end_quote

Erring on the side of brevity, and possibly leaving out too much: Abraxas Malfoy and Dumbledore were on the same side originally, but then Abraxas died and Lucius decided Dumbledore's defeat was inevitable, so the Malfoys turned their coats. Now that Riddle's won, however, Lucius might well be more useful dead than alive, and Lucius knows it, so he's spent the past decade or so being very terrified and hoping that, when he does die, Riddle at least won't have any reason to go after his kids.

(Most of the above is in "What a Very Nice Fire" and "Any Other Virtue".)

Incidentally, most of the "pure-blood aristocracy" types are no longer in Slytherin. Riddle isn't running wide-scale purges (perhaps because Britain simply doesn't have the population to support that) but he's still wielding the carrot and stick skillfully enough that many people want to show that they've "reformed," and when everybody in your family for three hundred years has gone to +Pure-Blood Supremacy House+ Slytherin House, telling your kid "anything but Slytherin" is a relatively cheap way to signal that you've reformed.

  And what happened with Harry
#+end_quote

James and Lily are dead, and Snape and Harry are hiding out in Denmark---where Snape is pretending to be a squib and Harry, last we saw him in summer 1991, is preparing to attend Durmstrang.

Some readers have suggested that Harry is going to show up as part of the Durmstrang delegation. One reader has suggested that the "sharp-looking boy" walking close behind Karkaroff is Harry.

  and why Cedric seems not to exist.
#+end_quote

Cedric exists, but he was in the wrong year to be in the Opening Duel.

A few months ago, I was all set to have Cedric Diggory be Hufflepuff's champion in the Duel, actually, and then I thought, /hey, maybe I should double-check his birth date/, and...he was a seventeen-year-old Sixth Year, like Hermione will soon be a fifteen-year-old Fourth Year, so I had to figure out a replacement. I'm pretty happy with the change, though, because Haywood is really going to shake things up in a way that Diggory wouldn't've (for one thing, Diggory would /not/ be setting anybody on fire, and Hermione would not have been so shaken by the Opening Duel).
