Only read HG-at-SC of this series, but like it so far. Especially the writing style and how Hermione and her thoughts are described.

The bullying in the beginning is realistic outside of the fact that this is a trope in HP fanfiction where Hermione is alone. The connection with Fleur was therefore necessary to build up Hermione so she isn't just the punching bag and manages to go to Hogwarts for the tournament. Still very okay for my suspension of disbelief.

But what would be a put-off and potential reason to drop this fiction is if Hermione is selected as Triwizard Champion although she hasn't put her name into the cup. I hope that doesn't happen. Her deciding to compete would also be quite unbelievable after the duel.

The duel itself didn't surprise me in its violence, not that I suspected it outright, but it is a society ruled by Voldemort, which shapes the window of your expectations.

I am also waiting for a believable explanation for why Malfoy is how he is. And what happend with Harry and why Cedric seems not to exist. But the latter two might be explained in the prior stories of this series.
