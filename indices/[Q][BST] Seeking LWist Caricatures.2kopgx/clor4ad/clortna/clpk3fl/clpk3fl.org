Then I very strongly recommend errors that you remember your own past self actually making, or finding very tempting; or at second-best errors that you have personally /seen/, not heard someone talking about someone else allegedly making. 'Errors' imagined by someone who holds the error-maker in contempt do not realistic characters make.
