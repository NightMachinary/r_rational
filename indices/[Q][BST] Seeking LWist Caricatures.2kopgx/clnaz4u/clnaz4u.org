The hypocrite: has absolutely taken to heart the idea of cognitive biases and takes great delight in pointing them out in others (using overly formal language all the while) without regard for whether it's an appropriate moment and without noticing their own enormous biases.

The calculator: insists on multiplying together a bunch of made up numbers before making any decision, no matter how trivial. Likely while muttering quietly about their utility function.

The "surely technology will save me": can talk at great length about existential threats to humanity and how we're morally obliged to oppose death with a convulsive effort and ought to be funding cryonics and life-extension like a new Manhattan Project, but hasn't seen fit to take any simple steps to extend their lifespan the 'regular way' through lifestyle changes involving their diet and exercise.

The phony-physicist: is very firmly convinced that the Many-Worlds Interpretation is the only correct way to view the universe but would be utterly lost within minutes if asked to solve (or even write down) any Schr√∂dinger Equation.

The "obsessively consistent under reflection": spends a lot of time deliberating about how they ought to make decisions, under the assumption that all other agents sufficiently similar to them will follow the same logical process and reach the same decision. May very well still be neglecting some of the more commonplace tragic-commons situations, because other people aren't literal self-clones.
