Ok, both sides makes sense to me now, hopefully that'll let help with the discussion. Both technical and nontechnical standards are acceptable but nontechnical ones held to higher standards in other ways. Question is then if particular nontechnical arguments for MWI are good enough to overcome the lack of consensus among those who understand the technical arguments for your particular epistemic standards. Correct?
