Well, I know virtually nothing about quantum mechanics, so perhaps I'm not contributing anything here, but you can understand and believe in the theory of evolution without knowing anything about genetics or DNA - and in fact, the theory predates the discovery of DNA (and even the rediscovery of Mendel's work on inheritance) by a large number of years. The theory of evolution can be summed up in eight or so bullet points that you need virtually no background or intelligence to understand.

I do not believe that the same can be said for the Many-Worlds interpretation - because while I generally understand the layman's concept of branching timelines, I do not understand that underlying math that causes this view to be "correct".
