Solving Schr√∂dinger equations is perhaps a slightly unfair demand, really meant more as a shorthand for "doesn't understand the technical details of a very technical subject that they nonetheless claim to have strong reasons to believe specific things about".

But there is also a difference of kind; evolution (the change of allele frequencies in a population over time) is an observable brute fact, and the Theory of Evolution is entirely and uncontroversially accepted by biologists as an explanation for that fact, with the disagreement between professionals being about details rather than the broad picture. QM is much harder to observe for yourself and question of deciding between the interpretations is still open, even among physicists.

I feel like the physics equivalent to evolution (easily observed, more or less settled theory, don't need to necessarily understand the nut-and-bolt details to have an informed opinion as a layman) would be something like gravity.
