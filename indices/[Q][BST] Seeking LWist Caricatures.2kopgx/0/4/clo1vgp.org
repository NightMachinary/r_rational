  The "surely technology will save me": can talk at great length about existential threats to humanity and how we're morally obliged to oppose death with a convulsive effort and ought to be funding cryonics and life-extension like a new Manhattan Project, but hasn't seen fit to take any simple steps to extend their lifespan the 'regular way' through lifestyle changes involving their diet and exercise.

  The phony-physicist: is very firmly convinced that the Many-Worlds Interpretation is the only correct way to view the universe but would be utterly lost within minutes if asked to solve (or even write down) any Schr√∂dinger Equation.
