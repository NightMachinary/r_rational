  The phony-physicist: is very firmly convinced that the Many-Worlds Interpretation is the only correct way to view the universe but would be utterly lost within minutes if asked to solve (or even write down) any Schrödinger Equation.

Not wanting to be this guy is why I don't discuss QM. I understand QM enough that the typical layman's office conversation on QM (today's sample, "There should be a Schrödinger's Wikipedia, where everybody gets a different page about every topic, and you don't know which one you get till you look". I have a weird office.) is ridiculous, but not well enough to either correct people, or have a discussion with a physicist.
