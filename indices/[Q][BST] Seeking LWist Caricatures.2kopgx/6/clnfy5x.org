I can't think of any way that someone could follow ALL of the rules of good, logical reasoning and rational thinking, and still make these kind of mistakes. It seems almost paradoxical. The only ideas I can come up with involve taking one aspect of rationality too far, to a fault, while ignoring some others. And I'm sure that is covered in the Sequences somewhere. (If it wasn't, once it was noticed that this over-specialization was occurring, "do not focus too much of one aspect of rationality at the expense of others" would simply be added to the scripture).

Assuming the memeplex taught real Bayesian/rational thinking/etc, and not phony stuff, any instances of flawed logic or irrational thinking would be noticed, isolated and corrected. Every time I think of how it could fail, I think of an article in the Sequences on Less Wrong that takes that possibility into account.

Having said that, you could have people who focus too much on developing their rational mind and eliminating their biases, to the expense of other skills they need to survive. Or be a master of hypotheticals but unable to apply their skill, or fail to notice when their hypothetical scenarios occur in the real world (possibly related to the void, from the twelve virtues).

Or simple human weakness: even if somebody tries to avoid all of the cognitive biases at once, they'll probably slip up at some point. We aren't robots.
