  I can't think of any way that someone could follow ALL of the rules of good, logical reasoning and rational thinking, and still make these kind of mistakes.

If it helps, I'm thinking of the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Valley_of_bad_rationality][Valley of bad rationality]], the idea that some of the initial stages of learning about reasoning can leave you worse off than before you started.

As an alternative approach, the cultists aren't necessarily /real/ rationalists, they're just the gang of kids who would have snuck into the occult section at their local library to find spells to try to cast, but got caught up in an alternative source of hidden knowledge to Have A Secret About instead. Possibly in the form of some surviving listicles, instead of the full Sequences.
