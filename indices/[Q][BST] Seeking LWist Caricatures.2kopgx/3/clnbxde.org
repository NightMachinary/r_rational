Mostly I think you'd have to have people that have other issues that are exacerbated by the memeplex.

- The guy who only sees human suffering in the context of the wider world and fails to empathize with people's petty problems when millions of people are dying around the world
- The guy who thinks that two people shouldn't take offense when arguing if they're trying to change their mind (I forget the name for this) and gives a lot of offense to people because he thinks they're being unreasonable by not taking his offensive comments in the spirit they're intended (and it might be that he uses his bluntness as a weapon and reasonableness is just his defense).
