The Epistemist

He (or she) spends a very large amount of time on the internet or reading books, honing his philosophical skills and understanding the nitty gritty of epistemic rationality. He understands a great many other topics as well - he's well versed in science, health, politics, social skills, and a great many other topics besides. He has the ability to perfectly articulate exactly what mistakes in thinking and action every other character is making (including himself). He sees the world clearly and is rarely horribly wrong about anything. He analyzes everything, spends hours thinking about word meanings and whether a certain bit of logic is /really/ sound and which hypothesis is /truly/ more parsimonious. He has boundless energy to do this, because it fascinates him.

However, he doesn't actually have the drive to do anything practical or accomplishing anything meaningful in real life.

(In general, I think the archetype of "genius who chronically underachieves because of some issue" - be it a mental health issue or mild personal defect, growing up in poverty, too many family responsibilities, or simply lack of desire to do things, is exceedingly common in all circles where smart people tend gather for some reason unrelated to practical networking or jobs - simply because the smart people who do accomplish things are too busy to participate.)

You could potentially give him a happy ending by putting him on stimulant drugs or something. Or maybe he could be the teacher!
