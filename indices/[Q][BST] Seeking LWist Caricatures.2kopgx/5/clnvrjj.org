The brand-namer. "Rational cooking. Rational training. Rational babies. So many babies. 400 babies."

The self-helper. "I've been working on implementing this sock-folding system I read on a blog." (this caricature is a bit more unfair than the others, but there are plenty of bad habits plausibly associated with consuming lots of self-help advice)

The casual insight junkie. "I don't see how this could be false."
