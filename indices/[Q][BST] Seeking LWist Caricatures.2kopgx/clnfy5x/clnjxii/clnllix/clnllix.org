Hm, if we're "allowed" to suggest ideas for characters who have picked up the wrong end of the stick and applied the LW tropes badly... that may create some extra latitude.

I'm thinking of the kinds of mistakes that EY describes his younger self making in pursuit of being "rational" like moving awkwardly and robotically because he thought that ought to be more efficient.

Or the other pseudorationalist failure-mode that can be concisely referred to as "Spock"; eliminating emotion in favour of logic (ignoring the perfectly real motivating forces of emotion) and expressing things as percentages with far more decimal places than you could possibly have real confidence in. If we assume that the particular post warning against that failure-mode was lost to the ages.
