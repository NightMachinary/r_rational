The typical SSC reader, who has gone so many levels of "meta" up in their reasoning and meta-reasoning that they now place no epistemic trust in anything whatsoever, considering all thought to be inherently tribal-political. In Bayesian terms (well, actually, Jaynesian terms), their subjective distribution assigns almost all of its mass to various levels of "deception" and "cognitive bias" hypotheses, and almost none to actual beliefs. When questioned, they mutter something about Loeb's Theorem and try to flee.

Oh, and then, of course, the typical Robin Hansonian, who believes that /absolutely everything/ is done just to get wealth and status, and whose plan is to take over the world by mind-uploading and then fork-bombing.
