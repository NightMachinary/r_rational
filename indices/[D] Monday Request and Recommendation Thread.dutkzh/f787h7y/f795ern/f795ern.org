[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/][Post Human]] and [[https://banter-latte.com/portfolio/interviewing-leather/][Interviewing Leather]] are both pretty rational and are excellent stories featuring entirely adult (well, close enough, for Post Human's case) characters.

They're also both fairly short, as far as webserial stuff usually goes.
