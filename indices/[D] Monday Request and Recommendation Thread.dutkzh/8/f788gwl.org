Hello, I am looking for alternate history fiction, any timeframe is appreciated.

Also, sometime ago I red alternate history fiction on some forum about selfinsert in to British airforce command during ww2 and I any search combination does not work to find it.

All I remember it was a fic on some forum from POW of a historian selfinsert in to a body and life of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Harris,_1st_Baronet][Arthur Travers Harris]], this fic or anything simmilar would also be cool.

edit: second request is probably a bit off, but from what I remember, characters behaved fairly rationally and adapted to changes brought by selfinsert.
