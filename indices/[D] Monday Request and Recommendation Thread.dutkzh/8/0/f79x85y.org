Not what you requested, but you will probably enjoy the beginning of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6833305/chapters/15597619][Wearing Robert's Crown]]. Personally, I thought it turned bad when the White Walkers showed up, but the part before that is solid, minimal-fantasy alternate "history".
