Worm, more than a lot of other fandoms (in my experience), has a vast majority of unfinished fics. There are a lot of good unfinished fics, and a handful of good finished fics. This is a fairly random sampling, based on my bookmarks. This is far from the only good stories; I'd recommend [[/r/WormFanfic]] if you want more.

Finished:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/][Tabloid]] is a story about a PRT photographer. This is a character study, not a action-packed drama.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/completely-unoriginal-yet-another-cyoa-si-mc-in-brockton-bay-complete.526825/#post-35103973][Completely Unoriginal]]: This is an SI fic, where the main character gets a pretty OP power and...fucks around with it. Yeah, this is also more of comedy/character study fic. (If that's unsatisfying, he did write a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/completely-unoriginal-yet-another-cyoa-si-mc-in-brockton-bay-complete.526825/page-110#post-37184182][speed run]] version.)

Unfinished (some updating, some dead):

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/constellations-worm-okami.414320/][Constellations]]: A comedy/fluff fic about Taylor befriending the main character of /Okami/, Amaterasu. For those unfamiliar with Japanese mythology, Amaterasu is a major deity and about as powerful as the phrase "major deity" implies. That said, the story is more about Taylor attempting to find peaceful solutions to conflict, rather than beating people up with her all powerful god-dog.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/stacked-deck-or-colin-wallis-vs-single-parenting-worm-persona.459689/][Stacked Deck]] is a Persona crossover where Yu is Arsmasters nephew (or something like that, I'm too lazy to find the exact relation) and is placed in his care. Again, this is more of a character study/slice of life fic, not Yu beating up the gangs of Brockton.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] is a crossover with a fake (at the time, it now exists) story about a villain named Dire. Dire is pretty much a Doom expy, except more successful with her schemes. A humor/action story, this one /does/ involve beating up the gangs of Brockton.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][El-Ahrairah]] is an alt!power where Taylor triggers with a Trump power and is immediately recruited into Cauldron because she's really damn good at analyzing and improving powers. This is probably the fic that comes closest to "rationalizing" the Worm-verse, insofar as the Worm-verse needs rationalizing. It attempts to explain a lot of Cauldron's subpar decision making, mostly by making the Entities and Endbringers a lot scarier.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16970325/chapters/39885288][It Starts With One]]: In a world without parahumans, a girl (we haven't technically been told it's Taylor yet) still gets powers and starts carving a bloody path through the world's rich and powerful. The results are about what you'd expect. This fic is half a mystery, with an OC non-powered person investigating and trying to figure out what's going on, and half following Taylor's actions.
