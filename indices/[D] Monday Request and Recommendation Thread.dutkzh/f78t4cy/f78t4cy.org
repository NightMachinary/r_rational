BIGPOST TIME

Read lots of /Worm/ stuff, not very much not!worm stuff, but I think it's all worth mentioning. STANDARD DISCLAIMER: none of this stuff is very rational, or if it is rational, it's on accident. It just met my bare minimum standards for being readable.

*NOT WORM:*

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wizarding-works-a-harry-potter-si.57804/page-2][Wizarding Works]] by Charlezany is a pretty bog-standard HP SI. I enjoyed it because it was refreshingly clear of bashing and stupid fanon. Don't get me wrong, there was still stupid fanon, but at least it was the /fun/ stupid fanon. Also, there's this one commenter on the SV thread that talks entirely in incomprehensible Dark Lord Potter memes, which is really funny. Quote (commenter):

  You should try and get life-debt slaves or something ,cause one always need minions or check to see if you can convince the house elves into getting every free elf to be your elf so you can have an army of obedient slaves cause how will you rule the world unless your mc has some other goal

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/son-of-man-nis-an-asoiaf-si.57501/][Son of Man(nis)]] by the same dude is a much more interesting story, all around. ASOIAF SI where the SI isn't the main POV character. He proceeds to rapidly modernize his little island nation. I like it because it actually engages with the characters of ASOIAF instead of just plowing over them or reducing them to useless props. Then again, if you're into [[/r/rational]] stuff, you might be annoyed at the lack of focus on the person who is ostensibly the main character and his industrial revolution.

Both of these stories are pretty shaky and inconsistent, probably coming from a rapid upload schedule. There's a lot of really dumb stuff going on, even when the author is clearly capable of writing smart plots. But they're good popcorn reads, and have a few interesting ideas.

*WORM:*

A little less coverage per fic than I'd like, here, but I read /a lot/.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-didnt-make-it-opm-worm.782704/][I Didn't Make It (OPM/Worm)]] is the best OPM crossover so far. Interesting look into Saitama's character, if brief. I'd wait on it to update more.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cape-in-konoha-worm-naruto-au.778357/][A Cape in Konoha]] is poorly written, filled with unnecessary Japanese, and basically neglects all of the interesting parts of Taylor's character. BUT, it's got a couple really cool fight scenes, and it's the only Naruto crossover that isn't dead. Take what you can get, I guess?

- Wait, no, I was wrong. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kaleidoscope.717019/][Kaleidoscope]] is a Sharingan!Taylor that also isn't dead. It's the edgiest Worm story I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Still, it's worth a laugh, and the edge is at least intentional.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/steel-hands-worm-mcu.791926/][Steel Hands]] is Worm/MCU, Taylor fuses with Ultron after he dies. The combo ends up evening out most of Ultron's idiocy, making them quite an enjoyable character to read.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tinker-taylor-super-soaker-worm-altpower.784870/][Tinker Taylor Super Soaker]] leans heavily on the unreliable narrator trope. She's gotten an intelligence downgrade and her power basically makes it so that trauma /washes/ off of her. Any more of the really good stuff would be spoilers. One of the better crack!fics.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-end-bringer.298982/][The End Bringer]] was one of the stories resurrected for Halloween this year. Well-written but ultimately so saturated in Worm (2014) fanon that it's hard to read nowadays.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harmony-worm-avatar-tla-altpower.548936/][Harmony]] is more interesting because I think it's /quite bad/. Taylor is fiercely independent - even more so than she was in canon, and unlike good stories like /A Cloudy Path/, she doesn't even have a proper reason. One of the stories where Taylor stumbles into forming her own team despite having zero qualities of a leader and being unlikable. The Avatar stuff is uninspired, and relies on the cosmological worldbuilding from Korra, most of which is really stupid. This is the only story on this list that I dropped.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-beginners-guide-to-stealing-brockton-bay-worm-persona.615233/][A Beginner's Guide to Stealing Brockton Bay]] updates slooow. It hasn't gotten out of what I would consider the first real arc, even at 130k words, but it treats Persona well, and Akira is a real treat to read.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/it-starts-with-one-worm-au.708580/][It Starts With One]] is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/][Tank]] but with less irony this time. A retelling of the recent recession from the perspective of billionaire-assassin Taylor, impressionable revolutionary Aisha, immortal pillar of the establishment Alexandria, and the detective looking into the weird case of industrial capitalists having a "change of heart"... I enjoyed this one a little more than I should have. It's interesting, but if the subject matter is hot-button, as evidenced by the thread being locked.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18761293/chapters/44507374][The Shadow Over Brockton Bay]] is edgy basically the same way Kaleidoscope is. I thought it was fun.

- Aaaaand finally, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/imperator-w-bravely-second-complete.612434/][Imperator]]. Mauling Snarks got me over my hangups with the "Taylor has a mysterious and unexplained new father figure" genre of wormfic, no matter how bad it was, so I've been going through stories I couldn't stand before. It's a relatively short and "completed" story, with an ongoing sequel. A con (or selling point, if you prefer) is that the POV character is Denys Geneolgia from Bravely Second rather than Taylor. I was skeptical about that before I read it, but now that I've moved on to the sequel, I have to concede that the author is way better at writing Denys as a POV character than Taylor (who is the POV character of the sequel). The writing is okay, if a bit garrulous.

*Ratings:*

Not gonna do ratings this time because I'm running out of time to write this post, and they're all honestly pretty mediocre. Try out Son of Man(nis) first, because that's the one that's most likely to resonate with the audience of [[/r/rational]]. TTSS is my favorite on an emotional level. After that, role some dice? Pick whatever story sounds interesting that I didn't explicitly not recommend. Or do whatever you want.
