Chapter 34

#+begin_quote
  Two boys and a girl rose from their stools and walked awkwardly to the front table.  They set a vase down, carefully, as well as two small bowls.  The vase was small, brown, and extremely plain.

  “Our solution was simple.  We had a broken vase, and we needed to make a working vase -- to ‘repair' it.  So it seemed to us like the best thing would be to just make a new vase, rather than trying to remake the old one.”  She gestured at the table, and one of her teammates dipped his fingers into one of the small bowls, lifting out a palmful of brown powder.  “We took the pieces of the original vase and ground them down into dust.  Then we took that dust,” she gestured again, and another teammate displayed a handful of dark clay, “and we added water, turning it back into clay.  We didn't use any magic on the pieces, before or after we ground them down.  We didn't even use Aguamenti to create the water -- we just used the tap.”  She sounded very proud.
