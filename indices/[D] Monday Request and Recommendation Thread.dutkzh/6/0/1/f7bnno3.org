There are a lot of plot elements in common with MoL, such as a world ending event that caps the ending of the time loop, multiple other powerful loopers, interactions with aliens with a self-consistent yet inhuman psychology, and politics. It also has a mana-like technomagical system.

Unlike MoL, it has a game interface of sorts, which so far just measures one's progress as a psychic/energy battery, and reputation with various factions. Similar to MoL, the first loop sets up a bunch of mysteries/conundrums to be solved later. It's only 33 chapters in, and depending how it is handled I could see it going downhill as the mysteries are solved and the character becomes super powerful, but for the time being I'd recommend it to MoL fans as something they might like.
