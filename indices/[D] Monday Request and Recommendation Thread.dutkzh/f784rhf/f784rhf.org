Hey everyone! I'm slowly going through the wiki recommendations, but I'm not very fond of some of them.

I'd like your recommendation on fics with good world building and character growth. The last fic I read like that is Worth the candle. Speaking of that, does anyone know when the next update is coming for it? (Fanfics are also welcome)

Edit: I've already read and enjoyed Worm (waiting for ward to finish but putting off wildbow's other works for now) and mother of learning.

I didn't like Methods of rationality( I enjoyed it in the beginning but it became tiresome later), and I've put a practical guide to evil on pause for now (it's not engaging for me)
