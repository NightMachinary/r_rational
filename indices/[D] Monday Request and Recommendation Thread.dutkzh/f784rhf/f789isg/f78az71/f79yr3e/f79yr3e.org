The fic on this reddit aren't very good on characterization. What quality of Rational Fiction is attracting you?\\
/Jumper/ by Steven Gould explores a Super Power intelligently.\\
/Street Cultivation/ kinda deconstructs cultivation novels\\
/Orphans of Chaos/ by John Wright has good character development and a little muckinry. Not technically rationalist.
