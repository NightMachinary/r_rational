The works that gets recommended here that I like the most are [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm/Ward]] and [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]].

Both have fantastic world building and great characters/growth, although I would give Worm/Ward the clear advantage on the character front, if only for the sheer variety of characters with their own distinct arcs.

I'd give more details on why I like them, but I'm not sure if you already tried them. It might be a good idea to list a few of the works you didn't like and where they fell short for you.
