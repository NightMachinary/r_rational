  I said character growth, I'm mainly referring to the protoganist learning from their mistakes becoming a better person

That's surprisingly rare in series. If you write a character growing and keep the series going, you then have to write a version of them that /has grown/, and most writers don't find that part interesting.

Genre Literature with growth...there is some pretty subtle growth in /The Murderbot Diaries/. /One Woke Up/ is about a former zombie relearning how to be human. /The Salamanders/ has plotting that would appear childish next to /Worth the Candle/ but has surprisingly sophisticated world building and character development, and has one character that tries very hard to learn from his early mistakes.
