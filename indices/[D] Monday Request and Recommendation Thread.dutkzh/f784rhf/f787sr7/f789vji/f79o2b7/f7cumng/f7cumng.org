It does get better. At this point, I actually think Ward is better than Worm. Her anxiety does mutate into something more like somewhat controlled /rage/ over time. Along with that, the other characters get interesting characterization and growth as more is revealed about them.

Given how dark her inner monologue is, it can be easy to focus on how seemingly crippling her anxiety is. Keep in mind, though, that the very first arc has her figure out a work-around to a fairly powerful stranger, fight a weirdly powerful grab-bag cape, and voluntarily enter into fisticuffs with a giant centaur man.

I'd say that demonstrates pretty well that she can be pretty active even with the anxiety.
