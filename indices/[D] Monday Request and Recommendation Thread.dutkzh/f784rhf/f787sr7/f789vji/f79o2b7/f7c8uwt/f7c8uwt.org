It does take quite a lot of words until Victoria feels more /anger/ than anxiety, but when she does it's fucking fantastic. Having a Brute as a protagonist makes for some /amazingly/ satisfying takedowns.

This side of hers starts to shine through around Arc 5 or 6, at the Fallen battle where she drops a fucking boulder next to people to chase them out of cover, and eventually has her /throw/ a villain so hard into a hill that for a while she's afraid she killed her.
