Following [[/u/sibswag]], fics either from my bookmarks or that I remember as being good:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-techno-queen-worm-au-humour-with-extra-ham-cheese.300011/][THE TECHNO QUEEN]] is a classic
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] is also good (author wrote the actual Doctor Dire series and sold it [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/27993770][The Dire Saga]]).
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nemesis-worm-au.747148/#post-57146551][Nemesis]] is very good, and more "feel-good"-y. Unfinished.
- If you like LitRPG (or if you can stand it at all), [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/#post-43385902][A Daring Synthesis]] is very good in terms of character growth.
- Another LitRPG: the best in terms of "quality" for Worm IMO: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/#post-32256937][A Bad Name]]. Unfinished.
- I'm partial to stories about Contessa/Contessa's power and also precogs so things like [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/loaf-worm-post-epilogue-humor-complete.467128/][Loaf]] are fun.
- As an eg. of the kind of story which is perhaps not so "high quality" but I enjoy, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/unstoppable-force-worm-fanfiction.354925/#post-18787625][Unstoppable Force]] by Saphrae is one. Unfinished and looks like it won't be finished.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bleach-worm-arana.305947/#post-14783724][Arana]] by Ryuugi is good, about Taylor taking over the Bleach-verse and "improving" it.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/camera-shy-worm-alt-power.685357/#post-51134179][Camera Shy]] is good for power-munchkinism.
