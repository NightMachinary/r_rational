Most of your fanfic recommendations in this thread seem to be presented as if you already read all the /good/ stuff available within those fandoms and now make due with shifting through the dregs that are left to at least find some halfway mediocre stuff to scratch that itch.

So my question is, what is the actual good stuff that led you down this path? What would you recommend to someone new, who has not yet jumped into the fandom sea and not yet exhausted its quality content?
