If you didn't make it too far I'd recommend giving Ward another chance. I initially dropped Ward then found the audiobook podcast and am really enjoying it now that I've gotten further into it.

Not having as much setting mystery and the heavy handed metaphors hurt the beginning of Ward a lot in my opinion, but it gets better. Worm also has a rough start in my opinion, we've all just forgotten about it.

Edit: I'd also recommend the "We've got Ward" podcast alongside it, especially if you enjoy narrative discussions.
