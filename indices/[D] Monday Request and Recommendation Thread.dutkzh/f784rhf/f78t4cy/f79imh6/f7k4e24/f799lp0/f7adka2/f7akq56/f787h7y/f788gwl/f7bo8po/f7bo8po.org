Looking for a short story I read a while ago, it features a man who was questioning his religion because he couldn't find any answers to his questions. To solve this he decides to join the priesthood. As he advances up the ranks, he keeps getting told that to find his answers he has to speak with God by becoming the pope. The story ends with him realising that God actually has no power or something like that.
