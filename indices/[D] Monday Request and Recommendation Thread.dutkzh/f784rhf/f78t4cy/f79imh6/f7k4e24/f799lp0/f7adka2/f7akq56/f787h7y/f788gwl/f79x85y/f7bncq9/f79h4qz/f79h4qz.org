British airforce self-insert: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/and-they-shall-reap-the-whirlwind-ww2-insert.547249/][And They Shall Reap the Whirlwind]], found by searching 'spacebattles bomber harris self-insert'.

[[https://spiritsofeden.com/][The Solstice War]] is a long-running web serial following not-WWII in Socialist not-India/Russia against not-Germany/USA. It's a fun read, but if you're looking for realism there are some magical elements that become more relevant in later arcs.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/castles-of-steel-lesbians-good-imperialism-bad.51361/][Castles of Steel]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/aircraft-design-company-matsuras-planes-are-always-fastest.48927/][Aircraft Design Company]] are two quests by the same author, both set in not-Japan around the time of the not-Russo-Japanese war. Castles of Steel follows the first woman in the Navy and is more focused on military life and politics, while Aircraft Design Company is heavily inspired by The Wind Rises and is serving as a playtest for the detailed aircraft design rules in the Flying Circus RPG.
