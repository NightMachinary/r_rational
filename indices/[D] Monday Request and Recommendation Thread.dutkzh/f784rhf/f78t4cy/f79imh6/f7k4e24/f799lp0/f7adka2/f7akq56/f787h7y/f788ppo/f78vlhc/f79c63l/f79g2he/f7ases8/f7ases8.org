I think you're overlooking that the mindwipes are explicitly only for the things that fall through the cracks - there are already plenty of precautions in place for the secret society to remain secret.

That said, you are correct that as population increases those incidents will increase as well, but there's no reason that innovation on methods of secrecy has to completely stop, and if nothing else that issue makes a great backdrop for fanfiction.
