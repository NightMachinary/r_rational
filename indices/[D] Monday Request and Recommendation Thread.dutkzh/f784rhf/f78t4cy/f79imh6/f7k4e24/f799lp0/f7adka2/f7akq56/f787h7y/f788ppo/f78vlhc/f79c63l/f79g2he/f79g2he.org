the mind-wipe thing is lazy writing, in most cases. harry potter, men in black, and so on, they all use it as a cheap excuse for why nobody knows about the hidden world. but it requires action, and that means as population increases you will start to miss people. people who could write things down and share information before caught. you hit a point past which it becomes impossible to keep the hidden world secret.

mostly im annoyed with how its primary use is to cover the largest plothole in the story, and just casually hand-wave the problem away without consideration of how it would change the worldbuilding. 1984 with mindwipes would be an entirely different book, and much more horrifying in a lot of ways- nobody breaks the law, because nobody can remember the ones who do.
