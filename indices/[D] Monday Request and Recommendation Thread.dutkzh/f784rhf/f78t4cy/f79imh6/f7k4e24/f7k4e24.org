Anyone know of any DnD 5e podcasts where the players do smart things and know the rules well? I feel like a lot of DnD podcasts have a cast of not very clever characters, and the players and DM are pretty bad with the 5e system.

In Critical Role, for example, spellcasters will regularly have to spend 30 seconds on their turn scrolling through their character sheet to find their spellcasting ability modifier, a number that they use /on a majority of turns/. In The Adventure Zone spells are often blatantly misused, like when a character casts Planar Binding while ignoring the 1-hour casting time.

I'm having a really hard time finding a podcast with competent, clever players. Most focus on comedy or drama instead. Do you guys have any recommendations?
