When I said character growth, I'm mainly referring to the protoganist learning from their mistakes becoming a better person.( It's present in both mother of learning and worth the candle but MoL seems to be a bit simple compared to WtC(same for world building as well)) I like it when people face the consequence of their actions. Strong professional writing isn't necessary, but absolutely poor writing is hard to enjoy.

I'll keep your recommendations saved as well, thank you.
