Quite a few things on RR are really bad, but there are some gems. Even in the top list. Sturgeon's law still applies IMO.

He who fights with Monsters, Blue Core and others aren't particularly rational, but they are still fun reads. Don't call everything trash just because you do not personally like it.

Also MoL is mirrored on RR and is quite liked over here...
