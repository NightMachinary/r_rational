*Seeking ideas: Stupid Em Tricks*

To help with one of my story projects; how many (useful, interesting, other) things can an uploaded mind do that a meat-based person can't?

I've got a GDoc with an initial set of basic ideas [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dWf61Df-jm5EicMp1NQv7nF32BXKqoYubt5GXvgL8B8/edit][here]], and I've temporarily turned on worldwide editing and commenting. I'd appreciate all the useful suggestions you can think of, there or here.
