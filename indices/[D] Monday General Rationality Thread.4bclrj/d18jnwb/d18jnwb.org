I'm building an AIML based chatbot as part of my first attempts at general artificial intelligence and as a hobby. I'm using Python due to ease of use and I'm modifying the learn function to transfer the data back to the application to apply NLP techniques on it.

I'm still unsure on what due to my lack of experience on NLP but I'm thinking of using some classification technique so that the bot can start building its knowledge base depending the category.

I'm also thinking of how to apply a neural network on a chatbot. I'm thinking of introducing one to detect patterns on it.

And yet I still haven't done anything to my thesis...
