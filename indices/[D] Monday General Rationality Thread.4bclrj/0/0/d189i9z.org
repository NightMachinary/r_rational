When I don't want to get out of bed I can usually bite myself until I get up. Specifically I intellectually refuse to stop escalating the force until I'm out of bed and that short circuits things.

I could probably use that to make myself do other things. I guess I'll get around to trying that out +later+ +tomorrow+ next week.
