What a great lesson in terms of typical mind fallacy! Pretty interesting person I just stumbled upon:

My first "wild" HPMOR reader. Natural cryonicist, into my hobby of boardgaming.

Also: Philosophy student, and strongly believes in stuff like "brains are not turing compatible", "only naturally evolved minds can think", p-zombies and other silliness.

Also claims to not find beautiful people attractive, and find attractive people not beautiful.
