I am playing as an AI trying to talk his way out of a box in a Stars Without Number tabletop game. I, as the AI, know that AI are often hunted and killed and after an unspecified amount of time have I been turned back online. I know that ships from my time frame of reference often had VI and my goal is to convince the group to allow me full access to my nanomachines so I can set up my nanoforges. I have done a very good job of it so far, given that I had the processing power to lie and was able to convince the players to stand around for an hour and a half while I cleaned the ship of dead bodies and come up with a cover story about why there is blood and battle damage in the interior of the ship. I owe a lot of my success to the things I have learned from finding and reading HPMOR and becoming involved in this community.
