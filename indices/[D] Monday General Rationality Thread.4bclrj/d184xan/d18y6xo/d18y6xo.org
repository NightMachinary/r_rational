When I was at CFAR, the descried a concept that I think would work nicely with that.

When you're deciding whether or not to do something, you're not just deciding for the /now/, you're deciding for every future instance of yourself that's in a similar position.

Somewhat similar to timeless decision theory. If you've seen the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/9wr/my_algorithm_for_beating_procrastination/][procrastination equation]] theory, this works by upping the expected value of your decision /right now/ by mixing it together with similar decisions in the future.
