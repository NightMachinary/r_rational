Just spend some time on what you want to do and what dreams you want to achieve in a way which (hopefully) isn't self-destructive. Then divide them up in terms of required time-ranges.

For example, I want to learn and research how the human brain works as a long-term goal. I'm just lucky that I have the chance to actually do this as a career. That's long-term and to get there, I have the goal of graduating college and getting into a good graduate school or working for a good company. That's medium-term and to get /there/, I need to be mentally and physically healthy, so I exercise and work a part-time job to save money for that brand-new book I want to read.

This is unusually academically-focus which works for me, but I like to structure my life in terms of starting from my 'end point' and working backwards to now.

If you can't come up with anything you want to do, then steal this nifty idea from [[/u/DataPacRat]] where you spend all of your time reading comics. It's a useful trick for depression where instead of obsessing over what you /could/ be doing, you do something pleasurable until you can come up with something you want to do more than reading comics.

TL;DR - Start with something simple that you like to do. Then spend some time looking for something else which you prefer to do over the first thing. Rise and repeat until you think you found your ultimate dream/desire to achieve and go for it. Why do you think teens do so many stupid stunts in the first place? They don't even know what they want yet!
