I think it begins and ends with how you feel, but the middle part is where rationality comes in.

Like this- you start by really searching deep within yourself for what your values are. This is more mundane than that sentence makes it sound. For me, it took a few years, and this part never really stops.

Then, you figure out the best way to optimise for these values. It helps if you've honed them down to one thing, because then you can work out your responses to potential trade-offs in advance.

Then, examine yourself to see if you think you had the right values. If not, get new ones.

It sounds like you're having trouble with the first part. I'm not sure how to help you there, though. I'm sure there are rational techniques that work for self-examination, but if so it seems to be a blind spot in this community.
