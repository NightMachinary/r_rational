Just nibble on a few and eat whichever one tastes best. If you ever find yourself nibbling on CS-AI or philosophy of intelligence you'll find that the Exploration/Exploitation dilemma is unavoidable anyway, so it's best not to spend too long overthinking things. Or you could always spend your whole life nibbling. That's not a particularly bad life either, to a certain sort of person.
