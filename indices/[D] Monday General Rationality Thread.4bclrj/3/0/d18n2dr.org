With a bit of save-state abuse, an Em could be immune to several biases:

- Order effects: the order choices are presented in affects how likely they are to be chosen, all else being equal. An Em can circumvent this by creating n! copies of itself whenever it is faced with a list of n choices, feeding each copy one of the possible list orders, then statistically comparing the answers from each copy. This is probably most useful when n=2.

- various forms of poisoning the well: It can simply /forget/ arguments and speech that are prejudicial without being informative.

- Framing/priming effects: Whenever an Em hears something that was framed in a certain way, or that had a certain priming, it can spawn off a bunch of several-minutes-previous copies of itself and present the same situation framed/primed in different ways. It can then look at the copies' answers, and therefore counterbalance the effects of priming and framing.

EDIT: I just realized that this is only one trick. The general version is "Feed your recent-past-self slightly different inputs than reality, and see how it changes (would have changed?) your reactions."
