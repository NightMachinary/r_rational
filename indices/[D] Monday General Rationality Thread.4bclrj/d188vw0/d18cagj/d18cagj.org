  Also claims to not find beautiful people attractive, and find attractive people not beautiful
#+end_quote

That kind of describes me too. In my case, I would use "attractive" as "I am attracted to this person" and "beautiful" as "this person matches the standards for beauty".

A situation that has come up a couple of times for me is that I see (and know) someone attractive, and just for a second, I see that they /aren't/ actually nearly as beautiful as I had thought, likely because of the halo effect. The opposite has also happened, where I realise that an unattractive person is actually beautiful, despite the horns effect telling my brain otherwise most of the time.
