"lest darkness fall" by L. Sprague de Camp is a pretty good novel about exactly this premise. IIRC it's fairly rational.

I don't recall the details very well, but IIRC the protagonist introduces distillation as a way to get rich quick, then moves on to other innovations like double entry accounting and not burning friendly time travelers at the stake.
