Not exactly rational, but there's the 1632 book series. It's about what happens when a 1999!W.Virginia town gots magically plopped into the middle of the 30 Years War. The Author recognized that eventually his historical schema would make the series non-rational, so he regularly collaborates with other writers and cannonizes fanfic.

It works.

There's no top-down optimization of a world, but you do get to watch a slow and juicy yankeesque tech/cultural innovation diffusion into renessance europe.
