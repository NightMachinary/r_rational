Don't give them any mechanical technology or scientific knowledge ahead of time. Instead, focus on preparing them to defend against advances in social technology. Unless your goal is to turn medieval Europe into something that fundamentally isn't medieval or European, what you should do is warn the ruling classes against the dangers of failing to defend the legitimacy of their institutions. The only legitimate uses of futuristic knowledge in this scenario would be things like convincing people that God is real, their ruler has a divine right to rule, and producing illegitimate children outside your dynasty is a bad idea.
