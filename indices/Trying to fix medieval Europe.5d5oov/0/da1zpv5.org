Previous comment threads [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a66h4/dbst_you_have_2_days_to_prepare_to_transport_to_a/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39rv97/you_cannot_create_gunpowder_what_invention_can/][here]] might be helpful, as they're about closely related subjects (and have lots of comments).

Edit:

The first question that you have to ask yourself is, "What's wrong with medieval Europe?" Slavery and pseudo-slavery to start with, high infant mortality, low life expectancy, death to random illness, quick spread of disease, horrible treatment of women, horrible treatment of anyone poor, lack of literacy/intellect/rationality, political instability, unjust rule hereditary rule ... I think that's fairly good as a starting point.

But I would be very cautious about something like introducing hygiene and pasteurization, because plummeting infant mortality rates and wildly increased life expectancy /probably/ lead to bad outcomes if they don't come with attendant advances in agriculture to feed all those people. And making it eight times more likely that someone will survive an amputation probably means that there are a lot of amputees going around ... in a world whose social safety nets I don't trust to handle the influx.

In other words, I'm skeptical about handing out scientific knowledge like candy. Yes, it's pretty damned easy to make an electromagnet, or generate electricity using a water mill, or calculate longitude and latitude, or whatever, but in terms of /actual results?/ That's a big question.
