This sounds like the moral fallicy that is the prime directive. To be more explicit: what is more important the social construct we call "medieval Europe" or the people our time traveler encounters? [[/u/alexanderwales]] has some very good arguments about considering second order effects, but frankly fuck that if: penicillin, crop rotation with peanuts for soil re-vitalization instead of a fallow year, citrus for scurvy, and /shrug/ not sure what else would pass determined self reflection can be introduced 3-4 centuries early?!? Yes the first generation of saved lives will probably die in migration/population pressure based wars (net population gain 0) but how much of everything else will go faster, how much net population gain, how many quality adjusted years of contentment will you net.

I rather be starving, and scorned as a cripple, than not be. With the former I have a chance to make things better. Yes there might be better things to do and you are going to want to sit and think, before you act but not living to see the reward is no excuse to not try.
