I'm not talking about Salinger - I'm talking about people who like reading Salinger. You're painting a very negative picture with an awfully large brush. I'm not going to defend /The Catcher in the Rye/, because it's been a decade since I've read it, but you keep dismissing people who claim to like something that you don't like as trying to signal something or seeking status, and then you call them broken. Why on earth would anyone who liked the book want to have a conversation with you?

I've already explained why I like stories with broken characters in them, but you seem ready to dismiss this as a lie, or worse, as me being a broken person. Do you understand how I could find this to be insulting on a number of levels?
