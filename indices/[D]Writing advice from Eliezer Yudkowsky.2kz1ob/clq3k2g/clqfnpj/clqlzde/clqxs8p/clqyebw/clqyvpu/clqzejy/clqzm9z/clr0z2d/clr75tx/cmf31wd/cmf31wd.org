Hm. I have that same feeling. I can't claim to speak for you or anyone else, but I'm going to try and articulate why I dislike broken characters.

In general, broken characters don't plan. They don't /do/ things. They don't /optimize/. You know that trope, "Villains Act, Heroes React"? Well, broken characters don't even really /react/. There's a reason stories aren't about your average Joe. I don't want to read a story about an average Joe. No wonder, then, that I don't like stories about /depressed/ Joes.

"But," someone else may say, "it is often the case that depressed characters have good /reason/ to be depressed. Isn't it fascinating to explore the psyche of a broken person? Broken people are /interesting/."

To which I reply:

It is entirely possible that a depressed character has an interesting backstory. However, unless the author writes that character /extremely well/ (and I do mean /extremely well/), I can't fathom how interesting that backstory is. As an non-depressed person, I cannot will myself into a depressed character's place. It's entirely possible that from whatever emotional perspective the /character/ is in, his/her actions make internal sense. But try as I might, /I can't place myself into that emotional perspective at will/, and not to sound callous, but I don't really want to, either. It's the /author's/ job to make the character interesting to me, not /my/ job.

And for some reason, writing a character that is simultaneously broken and sympathetic is /really hard to do/. Authors may do it to signal experience and cynicism and wisdom, but the end result is (to me) something that is neither enjoyable nor interesting to read. In Yudkowsky's essay on [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent Characters]], he wrote:

  The scriptwriter thought it would make a Dramatic Moment to leave Bilbo watching the side of the mountain alone. But the price of that Dramatic Moment was to populate the movie with strange, bizarre creatures who do not think like you or I; and so the Dramatic Moment fell flat, at least for me.

He was referring, of course, to movie!Thorin's decision to throw down the key in a fit of anger, an act that caused Thorin to lack an "inner spark of optimization", making him an "H-Zombie". But I think it applies just as well here. Broken characters don't lack an "inner spark of optimization" because they /no longer want to optimize/. That may be a good way for an author to signal experience and cynicism and wisdom, but the price of that signal is to populate the work with strange, bizarre creatures who do not think like you are I; and so the attempt falls flat, at least for me.

How do you write an emotionally sympathetic character? I don't know. Writing /ideologically/ sympathetic characters is (relatively) easy; just look at Professor Quirrell as an example. Writing /emotionally/ sympathetic characters, on the other hand, especially /depressed/ ones, is damn hard. Maybe if the reader is allowed to follow the character from the beginning, when the character /isn't/ depressed, slowly tracing the long, winding path to depression, crossing each step of inferential distance individually... but to my knowledge, authors tend not to do that sort of thing. Instead, they want to present the depression of the characters /firsthand/, /without/ providing any inferential steps for the reader to trace. This may work for the /author/, because the /author/ is already there (Salinger experienced clinical depression while writing /The Catcher in the Rye/), but to assume that the reader will instantly be able to follow along is to commit an example of the Typical Mind Fallacy.

TL;DR: Writing broken characters that are nonetheless interesting is hard as heck. If not for my knowledge that the human memory is fallible, I'd say that I've never seen it done quite right.
