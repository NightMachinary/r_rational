Wow. Actually, this is one of those times when I'm just unequivocally agreeing with Eliezer. There really are some stories that offer no deep meaning beyond the fact that the author is just kinda an emo kid who needs to grow the hell up.

But then again, there's a large fraction of the human race that's constantly obsessed with its own brokenness, so much so that I've often wondered if /we're/ the unusual ones for simply /not wanting to be broken at all/, or not wanting to dwell on such.
