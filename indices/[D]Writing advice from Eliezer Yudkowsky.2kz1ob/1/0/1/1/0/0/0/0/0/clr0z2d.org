I like reading about broken characters because if they're written well, they're complex, and there's an intrigue that with understanding them, and seeing them do the (often stupid, selfish, etc.) things that they do. I believe that there's both interest and value in looking over a character's shoulder as they do stupid things, if only to realize what it is that they're thinking - whether it's a housewife who has an affair because she's bored and lonely, or a soldier who's suffering from PTSD and kills his wife, or yes, even a bratty teenager who thinks he knows everything. I may not care about the characters - I may even despise them - but I want to know what happens because they're fleshed out and in some way real, and I want to understand them even if I don't feel like I will ever sympathize with them. For me, at least, reading that gives me something to think about, and enhances the richness of the world by teaching me things that I didn't know before.

In other words, I like reading stories about people making bad choices, because if they're well-written there's an enormous amount of complexity there - even if the character isn't sympathetic. I can understand why someone would feel otherwise, but being called a liar and a broken person for enjoying a certain kind of literature is not something that I take kindly to.
