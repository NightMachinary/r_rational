But people do care about Holden. People like the book. They're out there (hi). You might dislike the book yourself, clearly. You might feel contempt for people who like the book. You could even call them broken, although that would be stupid and wrong (doing quite fine here, thanks). But saying things like "there's no reason to care" is just wrong on its face.
