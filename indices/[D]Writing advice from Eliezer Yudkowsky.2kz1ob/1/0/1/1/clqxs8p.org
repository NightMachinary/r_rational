  Sometimes a story is just an exploration of how a person thinks, or how the world works, and I think that there can be an immense value in that.

Taking Catcher in the Rye again: It's about a worthless person there's no reason to care about, and doesn't say anything interesting about anything else. That's a big part of the 'broken people' piece; there's nothing to engender any /respect/ for the worthless character. All Holden's problems are of his own making, he's not just an ass but a /stupid/ ass, and he's incredibly self-unaware about those things. Salinger doesn't give anyone who isn't a broken person themself (which, OK, Salinger was himself) a reason to care.
