Data and Philosophy here: Yes. Yudkowsky is trashing a vast number of stories. I think that there are large classes of fiction that would be better if people followed his rules, including most mainstream SF&F, detective novels, and most other things that get called "genre". That's part of why I linked: I expect most of the things I see written this NaNoWriMo to be "genre" in this sense.

I agree with you that there's a lot of other good sorts of stories, that portray people and help one understand something different. It took me years of being exposed to "great books" to finally get my hands on All The King's Men, which showed me this alternate path. I imagine most people have a book like that. But those are a fairly small minority of what tends to get written, so I felt comfortable including his advice.
