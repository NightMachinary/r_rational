/The Catcher in the Rye/ isn't about accomplishment. And I don't think that stories need to be about resolution either. Sometimes a story is just an exploration of how a person thinks, or how the world works, and I think that there can be an immense value in that. I watched a movie recently - though I can't recall the title - that was all about broken people being broken. And at the end of the movie, no one had gotten any less broken, and stupid decisions had been made, but those decisions were realistic ones, and those broken people were fully realized characters. I like reading stories about people making bad choices, because if they're well-written there's an enormous amount of complexity there - even if the character isn't sympathetic.

It sort of goes without saying that I heavily disagree with Yudkowsky on the topic of literary merit. Those essays are a great guide to writing stuff that Yudkowsky would like, but he seems to be betraying an enormous lack of empathy for people who aren't himself. The jab at "literary" works was probably the worst part of it.

But I'm an English major, so maybe I'm just showing my biases.
