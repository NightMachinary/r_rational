  Batman generally isn't all that interesting.
#+end_quote

Really? Batman is a normal man(*), but he competes on a pretty even footing with people like Superman and Wonder Woman, who are effectively gods. He's been shown able to one-shot the entire Justice League, and he does it purely through intelligence and good planning. Lots of people say "oh, he only wins because it's his book and PersonX would totally beat him", but even those people can't deny that he brings things to the League that they need and that no one else brings: planning, tactics, leadership, contacts, detective ability... the list goes on.

There's nothing interesting about that?

(*) I suppose "normal" is stretching it -- he's human max on every axis. Still within human possibilities, though.
