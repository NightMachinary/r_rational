None of them I've met has ever been able to articulate why those stories are not considered trash, when it's come up, so I'm fairly sympathetic to the notion that they are, in fact, trash, and are admired only because it signals sophistication.

Also, I have met certain teenagers who were as stunted and unsympathetic as Holden Caulfield or the Lomans (Linda excluded; she's the only remotely sane person in that story). Those people might find the story more interesting, since they could actually see themself in the characters to some extent.
