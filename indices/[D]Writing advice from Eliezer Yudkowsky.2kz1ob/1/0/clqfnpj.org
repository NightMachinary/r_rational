My view on this: This isn't a property of sad stories, it's more specific than that. The examples of the genre he mentions I think of are /Death of a Salesman/ and the collected works of J.D. Salinger, particularly /Catcher in the Rye/. They're about unsympathetic, stupid people, who make poor decisions and end up less sympathetic and just as stupid as they started.

It's OK to write stories where the challenges are insurmountable and the main characters lose, or where you make them suffer a lot. (Luminosity does the first, and nearly everything Alicorn writes does the second.) But if the characters aren't worthy of any respect and neither are the things they accomplished, and there isn't any pleasure from the resolution, there's nothing to draw in the reader.
