  And as long as I'm on the subject: â€˜literary' stories about broken people becoming even more broken are not fun to read on grounds of pure hedonics. If you try to countersignal that your story must be very hip and contrarian because it offers so little merely pleasurable reward for reading it, don't expect to sucker anyone self-aware enough to have moved on past meta-contrarianism.

I'm not sure if I'm misinterpreting, but surely there's nothing wrong with sad stories.
