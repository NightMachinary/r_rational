I think Damien might be red robe....

Red robe was a mind mage, not a good one in Zorans opinion, but a capable one.

Who is totally out of the picture and never brought up In this storyline when it comes to red robe? Damien.

When Zorans shot red robe in their confrontation, what was red robes reaction? Disbelief with the reaction as being "You actually shot me?"

Though we don't know all of Damian's characteristics yet, but we may have a possible culprit....

If I'm right... Some one repost this, or I will have to.
