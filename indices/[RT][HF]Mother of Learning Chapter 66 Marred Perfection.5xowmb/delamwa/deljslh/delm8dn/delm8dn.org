Red Robe has had a long time to train his unstructured mind magic, but Zorian was better at it after less than a year, without even having proper mental combat tutoring in that time, just a few friendly spars. That says to me that RR isn't Open; he's just trained heavily, as Xvim indicated (chapter 48) is possible.

Plus, if RR was psychic, Zorian should have been able to recognise that when they fought.
