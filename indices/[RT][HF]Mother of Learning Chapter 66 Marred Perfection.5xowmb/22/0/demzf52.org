I was thinking a bit about this when rereading recently, and I concluded that there is a definite moral difference between giving someone a good, even generous deal, and having it negated by the loop, vs committing a crime against them and having /that/ erased by the loop.

First, it's a difference in yourself. "You are what you do," so it's much better to be in the habit of paying handsomely for what you get. It affects how you subconsciously think about people, how you approach hard problems, and basically your whole mindset. Zorian is very aware of that. If the loop turns a good deal into a scam, that's not something he can help; he didn't start it and can't stop it. How could he treat them any better? Sitting on his hands to avoid deceiving anyone would not save them from being erased at the summer festival. In fact, in light of the invasion and primordial summoning, teaching him is their best chance of surviving in the real world.

Second, when those copy-souls all float off to wherever souls go, carrying records of everything that happened to them, and Zorian floats off to join them someday, wouldn't he rather that they record he treated them well despite having every excuse not to?
