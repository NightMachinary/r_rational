  How are they being treated well?
#+end_quote

Those copy-souls are only embodied for a single month - no matter what Zorian does. Giving them immense wealth during that month seems to me like about the best thing he could do for them.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think any of those subject would agree on the terms knowing that they're in a time loop?
#+end_quote

No, I don't. Actually, I think that if it were feasible to explain the loop to all of them, and if they really believed it, then they would accept much /smaller/ payments, in hopes of ZZ saving their lives from the invasion. They might also want Kael-style deals - which Zorian is, in fact, doing to some extent for the golem-makers etc. Whether he'll have time and attention to get to them all and reward them in the real world remains to be seen, but he intends to try. And incidentally, it seems to me that finding a price they'll accept would help him to know what kind of real-world reward would work best for them.

However you slice it, he really is doing his best by offering outrageous bribes.
