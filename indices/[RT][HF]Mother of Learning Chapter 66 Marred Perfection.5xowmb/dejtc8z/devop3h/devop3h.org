  "Those robes are supposed to be a marvel of magical engineering,"" Zorian said. ""They are made from very rare and impressive materials -- specifically, *scarletite threads and crimson sea silk* -- and densely embedded with powerful defensive magics and privacy wards. If they are as impressive as the mage I memory probed thought they were, I'm not surprised that Red Robe would want one. I want one too, now. We're definitely stealing one in this restart so I can take it apart."
