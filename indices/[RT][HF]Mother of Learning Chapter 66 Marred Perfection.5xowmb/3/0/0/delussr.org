Yeah, I remembered Neolu talking back in Chapter 63, but I was honestly surprised when I found the earlier mention of her father and desire to time travel all the way back in Chapter 7. If this does end up being significant later, Nobody103 deserves a pat on the back. There aren't many authors who plan out their character histories so carefully.

Your reasoning re:Zorian's grandmother was essentially the same as mine. I can't help but wonder if her relationship with Zorian and subsequent death will be discussed. There could be an interesting story there. We /did/ eventually get an explanation for Zorian's aversion to the police and his lock-picking skills, so I don't think it's unlikely.
