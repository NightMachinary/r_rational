Yeah, it does sound like her wanting to go back and fix something is specific, not general. And it would be both logical and interesting for them to have her help in searching Xlotic rather than doing it themselves.

  it seems like Zorian's grandmother has since passed away

I'm not sure. However, his recollections of his grandmother seem somewhat positive, yet he told Kiri that she's the only part of their family he likes, so probably yes, their grandmother is no longer around. Not to mention how much she might be able to tell him about his bloodline, so surely he would have visited her at some point during his country-hopping if he could.
