"What kind of mage uses a gun!?"

This could actually say a lot about RR's character. What kind of mage thinks that mages shouldn't use guns? Probably someone from a Noble House, with a long tradition of pre-firearms military service and turning up their noses at such commoners' weapons.

It wouldn't make any sense for Daimen, who is civilian-born, to have this attitude.
