"Uh huh" seems to me to fit the context better. Daimen is dubious about Zorian's claim that he randomly visited another continent and then suddenly remembered his brother was there. "Uh huh" can have a similar tone to "Yeah, right". Whereas "Ah ha" suggests a discovery of some kind.

The eyebrow thing, if it had a comma, would have a nice [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28writing%29][three-part]] sentence.
