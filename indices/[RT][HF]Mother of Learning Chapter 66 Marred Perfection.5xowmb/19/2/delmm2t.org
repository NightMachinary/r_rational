  whether Daimen is a better psyker

Not a chance. How could he be? When would he have put in the kind of time that would let him learn that level of skill, and who would have taught him? And if he were a /better/ psychic than Zorian (who has, at this point, hit diminishing returns with the /aranea/), how could he possibly not have done or said anything for his little brother who faints in crowds? Jerk he may be, but not /that/ level of jerk.
