So Damien is psychic but didn't see fit to tell Zorian about it, wonder why that is.

He could just be a dick and didn't tell Zorian about it cause he's an asshole but a theme I've noticed so far is that the more Zorian actually gives his family a chance the more he finds out his initial impressions were at worst wrong and at best missing some critical info to explain the behavior. Like Fortov giving him space or his sister's reasons for stealing all his crap. Admittedly, Fortov is still a dick for the creeper rash thing and his Dad doesn't seem to pleasant.

Also I've noticed all of the bad stuff we've heard about Zorian's mom has come from his own internal musings or talking to Zach about all of which could just come from Zorian being bitter. There hasn't been much in terms of specific examples regarding his mother's, for lack of a better term, maliciousness. The closest to actual evidence I can remember seeing was her criticizing Zorians appearance every restart to put him in a bad mood when the subject of taking Kirellle to school with him comes up. So admittedly she's manipulative but I doubt she has malicious intentions.

We haven't seen Damien's psychic abilities yet so I suppose it's possible that Damien still has no idea that he's psychic and has just been using his passive empathy to become more successful. That would bring up the question of why Damien didn't encounter the same problems that Zorian had growing up.

Earlier in the story they were talking about people with large mana reserves not being able to control their mana as well as people with little reserves. Perhaps with Damien having a large mana pool his psychic abilities aren't as sensitive as Zorians thus avoiding the whole problem with crowds and such.

Personally I'm betting that Damien isn't trained as a psychic, No way is he as good as Zorian and maybe he's received some training to shut off his mind or something, maybe even the unstructured mind shield but I doubt much more than that.

Interesting to note that the house he's marrying into is able to control bees, combined with the somewhat ominous title of the chapter apparently relating to Damien's fiancée I wouldn't be surprised if they control their bees with mind magic in some form (maybe like Zorian and his golems or the crows). If their method to control bees involves mind magic I highly doubt that Damien, a (I'm guessing) genius untrained psychic from a faraway country just so happened to fall in love with the heir of their clan, it just seems way too suspicious to me.

Additionally Damien was supposed to be hard at work researching something, but he's apparently spent the past few weeks hanging out with his fiancée. Possibly out of character for him, at least his mom seems to think that nothing would get in the way of his work, and she seemed worried enough to make the trip to check up on him. I know Zorian thinks his mom is worried she wont be able to make use of Damien's connections but I wouldn't be surprised if Zorian is completely wrong about that and she's just worried about her son. Would also be a bit of a slap in the face to Zorian when he finds out his mom was just worried about Damien.
