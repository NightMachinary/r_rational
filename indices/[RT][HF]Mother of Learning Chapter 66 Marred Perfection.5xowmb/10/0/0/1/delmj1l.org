Fair point about the actual interpretation being narrated by Zorian, and being subjective. But her dialogue checks out with that interpretation.

  [...] Bad enough that he wants to marry some distant foreigner when there are so many perfectly good local girls he could go for. Daughters of influential families that would be happy to forge ties with us in exchange for getting a genius mage of his caliber into their fold. But nevermind that. I could stomach this if this was just random girl he picked up in Koth and brought home. [...]

Basically, conflating "perfectly good local girls" with "influential families that would be happy to forge ties". And particular mention to her "stomaching" Daimen hypothetically picking up a random girl.

Her past behaviour also doesn't go out of sync with Zorian's interpretation - her apparent interest in Zach possibly being from a Noble House, and marrying off Kirielle already. Though I'll concede that neither of them was heard from her directly and could be imagined or have mitigating factors, respectively.
