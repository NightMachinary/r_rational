  she's simply worried about Damien.

No, she's pretty clear. "The girl is fine". Orissa is even nobility. The whole objection is, first, she's foreign, and second, Daimen will be staying with her instead of bringing her back.

Direct quote, "No matter how amazing he thinks this girl is, he could do so much better here in Eldemar." That /could/ just be a desire to keep her family close, except that her first preference would have been "Daughters of influential families that would be happy to forge ties with us in exchange for getting a genius mage of his caliber into their fold."

She's not concerned about Daimen's happiness; she's treating him as a bargaining chip, or a piece on her gameboard, and so when he stops playing her game, she's upset and takes steps to regain control.
