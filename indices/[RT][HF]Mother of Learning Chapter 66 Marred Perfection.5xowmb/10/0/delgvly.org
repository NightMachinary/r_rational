Re: Zorian and Daimen's mother - you can actually see her unpleasantness directly this chapter, when she comments about Daimen's marriage that "he's making a big mistake and he needs to know that". Remember that the crux of her disapproval with it is that he's not making a marriage that's useful to /her/.

I believe the term for this kind of behaviour is "self-entitlement". With perhaps a worldview where her children are assets for further gain rather than people in their own right.
