You're at least partially correct, here's the relevant [[https://www.patreon.com/posts/chapter-52-fall-5200677][patreon post]]:

  2a: Zorians 'Natural Psychic' / 'Open Minded' bloodline. How does that work? When he uses his abilities like that is it actually unstructured magic using mana shaping and power from his mana reserve, or is it something else entirely, and if he depleted his mana reserve he could still use his mental abilities?

  2b: If this is an ability that can be acquired, any Zach (hypothetically) was given that ability, what would it mean for his shaping? Zach was supposed to be someone with an extra strong mana reserve, and correspondingly bad shaping abilities. Would he still have a large reserve and crap shaping ability EXCEPT in mental magic where he is a virtuiso?

  2a: Special abilities like that are effectively unstructured magic, but the users does not have to exert much effort into shaping the effect because it's all instinctive to them. If he depleted his mana reserve, he could not continue using his mental abilities, no. But they are extremely mana efficient, even more so than regular mind magic, which is already very cheap in terms of mana requirements.

  2b: Your guess is correct. In addition, his mental abilities would be far worse than Zorian's, because they would use his general shaping aptitude as a base to build upon, and he kind of sucks there. He'd be a virtuoso in mental magic compared to regular humans, but Zorian would still leave him in the dust. Telepathy benefits greatly from finesse and good shaping skills, and not so much from awesome mana reserves, so he would be worse than Zorian in almost every way when it comes to mind magic.

I don't think this necessarily precludes Daimen from having a weaker version of their psychic bloodline than Zorian. nobody103 doesn't directly address whether higher reserves affects empath sensitivity, just that "Telepathy benefits greatly from finesse and good shaping skills".

As far as empath sensitivity, that seems to be something that needs to be trained separately from mana control. Zorian was affected by it before ever becoming a mage, so even after improving his shaping skills, people and especially crowds were still an issue until he trained with the aranea.
