Well, Fortov wouldn't have paid any cost in reserves, since Zorian has stated that he's not psychic.

A lack of initial reserves is not something that can fixed with blood magic, or even really something that needs to be fixed at all.

Nobody103 stated that inherited magical abilities are always "minimum cost", as opposed to acquired ones, which have an additional cost depending on the efficiency of the ritual that gives them that ability.

But since reserve growth isn't negatively affected by inherited abilities, Zorian will also gain greater relative growth than a mage without an initial ability cost. Let's assume that the cost of Zorian's ability was 3 units, his max reserves should be around 44 [(8+3)*4], even if Daimen's cost less, say 1, he still probably has far higher initial reserves, if Taiven thinks they're "huge", let's say 19 or so, which would give him a max of 80.

Simply put, it's not a disparity that Zorian can make up for, unless he gets the same strange doubling benefit upon leaving the loop that Zach already has.
