Well, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that Zorian's mind magic is particularly strong. I don't think he's ever had the effects of his mind magic on his natural reserves explicitly measured - and he's proficient enough with his mind magic that he's able to break down Xvim's mental barriers after something like 3-4 years of training. Which is absurd.

I know inherited magical abilities are always minimum cost, but Zorian could potentially be an anomaly? When you think about it, his growth is absurd. He's been in the loop for six years and he's actually almost caught up with Zach, although his proficiencies are in different areas that aren't combat magic.
