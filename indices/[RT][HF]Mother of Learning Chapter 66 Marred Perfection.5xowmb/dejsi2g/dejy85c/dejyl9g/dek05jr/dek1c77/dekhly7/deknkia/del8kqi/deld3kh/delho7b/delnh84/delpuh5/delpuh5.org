Well, the effects of Zach's soul being combined with Zorian's were never really addressed - they were dismissed once Lukav told Zorian that the foreign bits of soul were being converted and integrated. This seems like a particularly unique result of what would normally be soul mutilation, much like the partially functioning marker he got.

That is to say, adding bits of soul is likely to make someone go crazy, but it doesn't mean they don't gain power.

As far as the Sovereign Gate goes, what we know so far seems to imply strongly that there are some people who should be aware of the time loop. If it's a ritual, someone has to enact it. The Gate is supposed to create a perfect copy of the world the instant the spell is cast - does that mean it excludes the person who cast the spell? Surely the activation of the Sovereign Gate requires some wide-scale research. Under what conditions does Zach enter the loop under? Is it perhaps the reason Zach constantly gets in a fight with Tesen at the start of a loop?
