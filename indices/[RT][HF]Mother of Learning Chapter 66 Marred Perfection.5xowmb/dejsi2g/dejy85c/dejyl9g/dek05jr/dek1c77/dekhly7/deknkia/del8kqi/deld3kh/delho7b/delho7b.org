Hmm. Come to think of it, another possible reason for Zorian's speed of growth and his mana reserves - in addition to his increasing mana efficiency - could be due to the piece of Zach's soul that was welded to his then slowly converted into a part of him. Zach has absolutely monstrous reserves; even a small part might contribute a few points of magnitude to Zorian's base reserves.

Honestly, though, I just want to see Damien beaten by Zorian. Damien is kind of an ass.

On an unrelated note that just occured to me: Shouldn't the Sovereign Gate researchers know if it was recently used to conduct the ritual to begin the loop in the first place? Why were they totally unaware of it?
