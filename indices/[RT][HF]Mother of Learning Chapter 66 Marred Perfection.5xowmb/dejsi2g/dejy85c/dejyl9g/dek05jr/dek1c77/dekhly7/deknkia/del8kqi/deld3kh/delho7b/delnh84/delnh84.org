I've gotten the impression that Zach's soul fragment did very little to Zorian, and simply adding bits of soul doesn't seem nearly as likely to increase reserves as it does make someone go crazy.

Daimen is kind of an ass, but I'll have to wait until next chapter to decide if it was at all malicious or just a mix general older brother jerkiness + popular/genius kid entitlement. If he was aware that Zorian's trouble with crowds and excited people stemmed from his empathy, but didn't tell him about it, then that puts him a bit more in the "ass" category. But if he's an untrained, weaker mindmage, he was probably using his empathy in a mostly unconscious manner. Which isn't that much of a defense for him, because he still should have been able to pick up on Zorian's hatred of the body puppet spell he practiced on him.

We know so little about how the Sovereign Gate works, there's not much point in speculating about it. Getting a marker requires either the Key, the Maker, or one of its agents giving it to the Controller. Do they need to be near the Gate to get a marker? Would they need the full Key or is one piece of it fine? Do they need to be near the Gate to activate it? Even when Zorian and Zach touched it, Zorian only was able to activate the Threshold since he sensed the Gate interacting with his marker. The researchers might be able to see signs of its activation in the real world the next day once it's exhausted its energy reserves, but that's meaningless inside the loop, where the Gate only really functions as a metaphysical doorway back to the real world.

  "That is the only reason I'm talking to you. I know the Brand and I know what it means. Most have forgotten it, dormant as it has been in the *past few Cycles*, but I am older than the mountains and rivers, and I remember. I remember the crimes they did -- the way they made me fall..." "They were regular like the progression between night and day," Ghost Serpent replied. "Every four hundred years, whenever the planets aligned. But the Gate has been lost for some time now, or perhaps the Key. Alas, it seems someone has finally enacted this wretched thing again. May he burn in the molten heart of the world forever, ever, ever!"

Even if "few" is as low as 3, it's still been 1600 years since the last activation, probably even before QI's was born.
