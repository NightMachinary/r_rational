Zorian might still get that doubling/increase in reserves upon leaving the loop. I think Zach got his from his original real world soul being merged with his initial loop soul, and it could work in reverse if Zorian's current loop soul is merged into his real world soul when he leaves. Of course, I could be wrong about why Zach's reserves are doubled, or I could be right but that still might not be an option for Zorian.

nobody103 had a comment about Gamer-type series, one bit of which is somewhat relevant:

#+begin_quote
  Too often, the Gamer in these kinds of stories receives a whole string of incredibly good items, skills and opportunities right at the beginning of the story. I'm talking mid-game or even end-game content here.

I take that to mean he thinks that in both games and literature, the creator can be more generous with powerups at the end of a story.
