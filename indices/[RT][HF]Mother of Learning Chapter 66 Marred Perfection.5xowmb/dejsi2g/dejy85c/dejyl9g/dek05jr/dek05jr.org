You might be onto something, I hadn't given thought to the Zorian's limited mana reserves being a result of the price paid for his psychic abilities, I knew it played a part but I didn't think that Zorian might have had to pay a bigger price than his brothers. Maybe with his research into blood magic he could somehow fix that, seems more likely to me that Zorian would use blood magic to help his psychic abilities rather than develop new ones.
