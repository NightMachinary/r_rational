I wonder why Daimen's abilities gave him social powers, whereas Zorian's made him faint in church? And why are Daimen's mana reserves so much larger than his siblings'? If he had control of his abilities, why did he use a divination to determine Zorian's abilities, not just a surface read of his thoughts (which would have been more discreet)?

Quite a few questions. My best guess is that Daimen has a weaker or less controlled version of Zorian's abilities. Fortov may be open as well, although Zorian hasn't commented on it yet.
