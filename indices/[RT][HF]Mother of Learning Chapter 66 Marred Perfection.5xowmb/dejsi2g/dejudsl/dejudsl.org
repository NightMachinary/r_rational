Zorian did comment on Fortov's and Kirielle's ability in the chapter where he's taking about inherited bloodline skills with Batak in the Church, and specifically mentioned that neither were psychics, nor was their mother. This was the first chapter where he considered the possibility of Daimen being a psychic himself.
