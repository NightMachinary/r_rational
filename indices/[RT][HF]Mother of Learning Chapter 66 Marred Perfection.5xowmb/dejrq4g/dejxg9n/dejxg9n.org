The aranea treasury is another thing.

Stealing from the invaders/cultists might be a bigger source of income than you realize. After all, there's supposed to be a lot of supply caches, with cash and other valuables, there's also several high ranking politicians and mages among the Dragon Cultists, and stealing their secret stashes of cash/crystallized mana/valuables or even from their bank accounts directly somehow seems likely.
