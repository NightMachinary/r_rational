Zach became a full-time treasure hunter for, what, a decade or two? All sites he raided before are still there, and most of them loaded with artefacts. I'd assume that something like the Simulacrum scroll could fetch a pretty price on black market, not to mention all the things either of the two don't have any use by themselves.
