I'd agree.

If you put Zorian in a situation where he could either compel a teller to write him a bank check, and get out of the loop, or refrain and vanish into oblivion when the loop ends - no other options - then he'd be walking out of the bank with the check within 5 minutes, and the teller would have forgotten he ever existed. However, given many avenues of training and research, he very much prioritises ethical ones.
