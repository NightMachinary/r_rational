That raised a legit question. Any chance Zorian mind-rape the whole bank's staff to have that number written on his 'prepared' account book?

For as far as I can understand, mana crystal is very liquid, but Zorian once said even if he focused entire restart to mine them, he wouldn't make a dent to the market. Monster part is equal to chump change compared to mana crystal. And raiding the invader is not really a breakthrough either.
