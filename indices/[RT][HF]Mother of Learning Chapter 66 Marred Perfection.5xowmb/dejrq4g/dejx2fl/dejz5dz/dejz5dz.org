I'll have to disagree on the raiding invaders part. Everything else compared to that is bound to be small potatoes. The cult leadership has infiltrated the top of Cyorian government and surely these people are filthy rich. But disregard that, the invasion is funding an entire army delivered via one-of-a-kind trans-dimensional gate. The amount of resources poured in by invaders is insane on a scale of one person. Leeching these cash flows is a great and morally clean way to get rich.
