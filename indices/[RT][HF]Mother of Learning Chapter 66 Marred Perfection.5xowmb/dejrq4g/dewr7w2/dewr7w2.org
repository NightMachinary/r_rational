Because the invaders are supplying an entire army with food and equipment, there is probably a lot of wealth to be stolen there.

Think 10k people, $10 of food per day, plus say $10 per person for miscellaneous expenses per day, for one month---so that's $6M right there. Say Z&Z get 10% of that. Plus crystalized mana, the simulacrum scroll, and whatever other artifacts and valuable carcasses they've found.

Oh, and Zorian knows the identities of the cultist red robed mages, who are powerful politicians with fortunes perhaps on the scale of $1--100M. Reading their minds could have given him access to their bank accounts. That's probably the biggest source of wealth for them by an order of magnitude or two. The mana crystals, loot, etc. might just be chump change compared to the combined wealth of several politicians.

Enlist seem simulacra to sell the wares around the country and that's a sizeable fortune, probably equivalent of $10--100M. And if their currency is 100 pieces to the dollar, then showing up with a check for $100k is 10,000,000 pieces, and that's definitely "a lot of zeros".

Maybe [[/u/nobody103]] can comment on the size of their wealth.
