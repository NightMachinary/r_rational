Not much to say, really, except to note that Z&Z could gather lots of money in any number of ways, but usually resort to robbing the cultists blind and raiding the Ibasan supply caches to fuel the bulk of their activities (because it's fastest). They could plenty of money by selling looted items and rare materials too, it's just that it would be more of a hassle so they use it as a supplement rather than the main deal.
