I've got to say, nobody103 has been very consistent about giving multiple good meanings to chapter titles. This one could be applied to Daimen as a person, and Daimen's relationship with their parents.

Still, I'm guessing that Daimen's talent is a good bit weaker than Zorian's, since apparently he was never as negatively influenced by it as Zorian. And that he uses it more as a passive guide in dealing with people than influencing them outright. Basically, "I'm pretty sure this person would like it if I did this, so I'll do that." and vice versa, possibly like how Zorian originally was with his empathy. If Daimen had gotten professional training in mind magic, either from humans or aranea, given how insular the community is, I think Zorian would have found about it in the course of his own training and investigations.
