Hey, if the invaders' gate is based on realising that the Bakora icosahedron is a stabilizer, shouldn't it be theoretically possible to cast a stable gate spell inside a regular Bakora gate? I don't see why they need to duplicate the knockoff gate, unless they need to build a gate in a more suitable location.
