Thanks! I was rather worried giving [[https://yow.eventer.com/yow-2014-1222/stop-treading-water-learning-to-learn-by-edward-kmett-1750][that talk]] as it was given to a large "general" developer audience that was by-and-large afraid of math, at a conference that had more of an IT/development focus than computer science per se. Talking even in general terms about life lessons from mathematics and computer science seemed risky, as I was quite worried at the time that it'd come across as feel good drivel. Despite all of that, the response has been quite positive, overall.
