Hrmm.

I'm rather partial to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-internship-worm-au-au.483163/][Deputy]], which is an AU of an AU in which Taylor has no powers and works as an intern at the PRT. In general low-powered altpower!Taylor fan fics are probably my favorite sub-genre.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gambit-worm.430580/#post-25701419][Gambit]] is surprisingly good given the premise. I wish the author would get back to it. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.360121/][Dire Worm]], likewise.

I adore [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9920320/1/Starry-Eyes][Starry Eyes]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/constellations-worm-okami.414320/][Constellations]] despite their odd structure. I keep reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/taylor-varga-worm-luna-varga.398991/][Taylor Varga]] despite the fact that its clearly just OP silliness. At least the author of the latter keeps pumping out content. =) They make a good break from other worm stuff.

Of course, most anything by Ack tends to be worth reading, e.g. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/security-a-worm-si-story.300658/][Security!]] and the like.

Stepping outside of Worm a bit, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] is a Naruto fan-fic that I rather enjoyed. Bit too literal with the mind-rape for me, but it did manage to tie things up in a much more satisfying manner than I expected.
