For rational(ish) fiction? My recommendations there tend to be pretty vanilla. Mother of Learning (obviously), Unsong (not rational, but hey), Worm, Metropolitan Man, etc. More or less the popular stuff around here. I've also probably read far more Worm fan-fiction than anyone would care to admit, but any recommendations coming out of that slush pile are relatively reader-specific.
