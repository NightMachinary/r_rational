As I explained in my edit after I thought about it a bit, I think yes, but at the same time you have to remember that, by canon and WoG, Leet has two real problems with his ability, not 1. He can't repeat himself, which is an inherent limitation of his power set by his Shard at the time he triggered, *and* the fact that his Shard hates his guts, which is a result of his behavior and choices. If I were writing it, I would interpret that as being sort of like his power is a DM with a grudge against the player. The limitation is the same, but it might be interpreted broadly, even unfairly.

A Shard that's cooperating with Leet might say "oh, that idea you had? It's a good one. Get some materials and I'll walk you through making it, but just this once." "Oh, you need something similar to an earlier project? Well, we can't do that, but maybe I can help you figure out just how different it needs to be, since we're buddies like that."

A Shard that's sabotaging Leet might say "oh, that's a cool idea you have there. Here's a sudden, migraine inducing flash of inspiration on how to make it. What, you didn't catch that? You can't interpret or retain that much information at once and you didn't even have your workspace ready? Well that's too damn bad, because I'm not repeating myself, so you can just try your best."
