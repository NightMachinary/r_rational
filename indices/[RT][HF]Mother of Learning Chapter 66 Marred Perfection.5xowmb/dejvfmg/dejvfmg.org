Daimen being a natural mind mage helps explain this in chapter 3:

  "The spell moves you around like a puppet on a string until you learn how to move along with it, if only to make the feeling of something jerking you around go away," said Zorian. "Eventually you no longer need the spell to dance correctly."

  "I see you have personal experience with this method," Ilsa said with a smile.

  Zorian resisted the urge to scowl. Getting put under that spell by Daimen was one of his childhood traumas. It wasn't amusing at all.

and then later in the chapter:

  "...Animation spells targeting people are restricted material, after all, and not something normally available to students."

  Huh. So how did Daimen get a hold of it then? In his second year, no less?
