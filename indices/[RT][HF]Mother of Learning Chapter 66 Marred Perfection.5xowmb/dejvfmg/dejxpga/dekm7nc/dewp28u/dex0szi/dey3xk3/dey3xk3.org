Good point about the ambiguity of the quote. I didn't even think of that.

I disagree that the prevalence of bad things means a love potion would fall by the wayside. Trivial things in our world, like sex or smoking marijuana, are considered immoral behavior by some, and given focus despite the fact that things orders of magnitude worse are happening all around.

People see what's in front of them. If Daimen felt he was drugged, I'm sure he'd be super resentful.
