I got the same feeling when I read this chapter. However I did not think of Damien being magically compelled through mind magic, but through magical honey. From his girlfriend's perspective, Damien is a good catch. This is especially true if the local mages of the region know of the 'compulsion' honey and are wary. It makes Damien a much more valuable opportunity for their clan.

If Damien is a untrained psychic, then he might not notice the compulsion. If he is a trained psychic, then there is still a chance its more of a biological compulsion then a magical compulsion. Finally, he might be turning a blind eye to it as he wants to believe he is in love, or was falling for the girl before the honey pushed the him right into 'love'.

Also, it'd be cool to see it pan out as fatalistic love. His empathic powers pushed her over the edge and in response she /had/ to be with him. Hence magical honey to ensnare him with love. It could be tragic or comedic, but it'd be a cool interplay of magics within the world/setting.
