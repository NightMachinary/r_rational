I really like this theory. If the woman from this chapter is the house's current matriarch, then it makes sense that her daughter (Damien's fianc√©e) would stand to inherit. Damien is the best drone for the job.

Of course, if Zorian and Zach can effectively free Damien from this compulsion, then he'd probably be quite inclined to help them in their search for the keys.
