You know, things about mind-mage in this novel distort your expectation by quite a bit. Daimen insisting that his wife-to-be is perfect raise a suspicion in me that he is mind-manipulated, although the chance for that is infinitesimally thin.

Upon this realization I say, no, it could be other factor in the play as to why Daimen can get things he got.
