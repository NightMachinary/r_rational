I do not mean to demean the ethical dilemma of magical roofies, but in a world where an individual can strip your soul and create an animate body puppet while you can do nothing but watch, it really falls by the way side on the moral scale. This is doubly so with mind magic able to alter and implant memories being a thing. Also, "dancing" magic also can force people to do actions they are not willing to do normally. Love potions are fairly tame if they just incite feelings of love which probably fade with time as the potion works its way out of the system.

Regardless, I was using comedy in the archaic sense where it two groups are in an amusing conflict, not in the modern 'haha' funny sense. I'd find it amusing to see two compulsive magics duke it out and thinly veil it as relationship troubles.

As for your points, most of the story has had character interactions centered around Zorian breaking his assumptions of individuals. I would not be surprised if we saw his mother really break down act motherly and not act gloatingly. Also, we know nothing of the girl except whatever has been told to Zorian via his family, which could be very biased. Again the author likes to break Zorian's views on people, so it wouldn't surprise me to see the girl being plain or underwhelming.

We can even turn every point you brought up as a positive for the girl into a negative. Being a princess would mean restrictive potential match pool making bagging Damien more important. Her 'intriguing specialization' might limit her pool further (control raw elemental forces vs bees, wonder which one most people would choose), or it might make Damien more attractive (using the assumption that they know he has mind control genes). Being well-educated and well-read are base necessities that who ever he chose would fulfill. As for her thirst of adventure, if they knew Damien was a potential catch, sending your daughter off to interact with him isn't a bad plan.

As for your quote, didn't this chapter indicate that it was a lie fabricated to allow his mother to not tell him that Damien was engaged? Also the wording is ambiguous enough to allow the important thing be a wife.
