There are serious moral issues with the love potions trope. Love potions are essentially advanced roofies. From certain perspectives, they're worse than rape because they create a life long commitment without consent, however they do so with none of the trauma (assuming the love potion is permanent), so in an uncomfortable sense, they're not as bad. However, I don't really see any room for it being comedic. Abusive relationships are not terribly funny (how else would you characterize using a substance to force someone to love you?); dramatic would be the appropriate tone.

Either way, I don't feel this love honey approach and the ensuing ethical discussions really fit the tone of MoL---though I wouldn't mind it at all. I'd welcome a good treatment in fact, especially because Zorian needn't do anything about now other than discuss the moral dilemma. It would be a project for once the loop business is settled.

However, I also don't see the love potion happening either because it would allow Zorian's mother to incorrectly assume the moral high ground. For Zach, Kirielle, Zorian, Daimen, the readers, and the author, having to listen to Ms. Kazinski gloat would be utterly insufferable. That's not a great reason not to do the love potion, but it's a decent reason.

Also, Daimen's girlfriend is already enough going for her that I doubt she'd a love potion. She's a princess of a magical family with an intriguing specialization in a land far away from his parents. She's probably well-educated and well-read and she seems to like adventure, seeing as she came along with her family's trackers for Daimen's expedition. As long as she has a chill personality, she sounds pretty awesome.

However, the suddenness of the marriage is a little surprising, so I agree with huh there, and the special bee honey was mentioned . . . and seeing as how competitive treasure hunting is, I'm surprised Daimen is taking the time off for all this. Plus, if the Taramantula House requires a male heir, it would definitely be worth her while to wed Daimen, especially if they know he's a kind mage because of their ability to mentally, perhaps, control bees.

However, he /did/ supposedly discover something recently, so maybe he figures he'll celebrate and take some time off.

  "He's in Koth," Zorian said. "Apparently he found something very important in the jungle, but he's been very secretive about it. I'm sure you'll hear all about it when he finally deigns to unveil it to the world."

Honestly, I can see it going either way.
