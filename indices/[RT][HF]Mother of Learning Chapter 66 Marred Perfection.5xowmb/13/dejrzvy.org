  "The Taramatula family breeds several species of magical bees and uses its secret family magic to control and direct them. They're supposedly very versatile. They produce some sort of extremely valuable honey, they can be deadly in battle, and they're very good at tracking things down."

The last three members of [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kamizuru_Clan][the Kamizuru Clan of Iwagakure]], capable of controlling bees just as [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Aburame_Clan][the Aburame]] could control [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kikaich%C5%AB][/kikaichuu/]] and related insects, were the villains of an anime-only filler arc in /Naruto/. IIRC, however, non-combat applications of their abilities were not discussed in those episodes.

(Note: The manga-appearing, 100%-canon characters listed as members of the Kamizuru Clan on the linked wiki page were listed there on the basis of claims made by the filler villains' leader. Those claims have been neither substantiated nor contradicted elsewhere in /Naruto/.)
