Woo, family backstory! At long last!

*Daimen's Psychic Powers*

This chapter confirms it. I find it extremely unlikely that Daimen was trained by aranea or has as much experience sifting through people's thoughts as Zorian. I think there are three options for Daimen's control of his powers then:

- He discovered (perhaps unconsciously) how to control his empathy to the extant that it didn't negatively affect him.
- He has no control over it, but his empathy is weaker than Zorian's. This could give him his social edge without the drawbacks.
- He has been trained by another psychic.

I want to expand on a theory for point 3 a little bit. We know that Zorian and Daimen's abilities are inherited from their mother's witch lineage. Since Zorian received some lessons from his grandmother as a kid, it wouldn't be unusual if Daimen had as well. Perhaps Zorian's grandmother taught Daimen how to control his powers. Though it is never stated explicitly, it seems like Zorian's grandmother has since passed away---and before she could train Zorian, no less. Then Daimen either purposely keeps quiet about Zorian's psychic powers (because Daimen is a spiteful asshole), or doesn't recognize Zorian's symptoms as psychic pressure (after all, how could anyone be as special as him?). I guess we'll found out more about Daimen's abilities (and his awareness of Zorian's) next chapter.

*Neolu Foreshadowing*

From my perspective, this chapter confirmed that Neolu is an important character. She's been mentioned more than just about any other classmate at this point--even if it's just because she habitually eavesdrops and gossips. I scoured the earlier chapters for more references to her backstory:

From Chapter 7, when Zach first explains the time loop to Zorian:

#+begin_quote
  "You're the most interesting person I know of at the moment, and the only other person who believes me about time travel except Neolu,” Zach said.

  “Neolu?” asked Zorian incredulously.

  “She's an avid reader of speculative fiction and mysteries and is very imaginative and open-minded,” said Zach. “A naïve dreamer, her father would say. It was surprisingly easy to convince her I'm really a time traveler. I guess she wants to believe it's true.”

From Chapter 63, when Simulacrum #2 tells Neolu that he is using a time machine to cheat at school:

#+begin_quote
  “Really?” she asked suspiciously, like he had just told her something unlikely but still entirely possible.

  [...]

  “No, I was just joking with you. I don't really have a time machine,” Zorian explained patiently.

  “Pity. Having a time machine would be grand,” Neolu said, smiling. “Sometimes I really wish I could go back in time and fix things before I mess up.”
#+end_quote

Though she seems happy on the surface, I think she seriously regrets whatever scandal she got caught up in back in Xlotic. We know one of the keys is hidden in the Xlotic desert, so maybe she will end up aiding Zach and Zorian in their search in a future restart. At any rate I think she will /at least/ be given the Raynie treatment---privately confiding in Zorian after he goes to her for more advice.
