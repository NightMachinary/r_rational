  Timelooping Tinker

Bakuda protagonist? That's interesting. Although I have to say, when I first saw the title I instantly thought of Leet. I kinda want to write that one. There aren't many characters in Worm or even in fiction in general whose powers are constantly worsening with every use, and that would be interesting to pair with the mother of all self-improvement powers.

Edit: Also, I believe there is WoG out there somewhere that the reason Leet doesn't have the full cooperation of his shard is that he tends to play it safe and avoid conflict, which is antithetical to the shards' purpose. A time loop could fix that, even while it exacerbated the limitations inherent to his power (ie, the inability to repeat designs). So he'd probably improve at slightly different iterated designs that are functionally identical, and if he's lucky he might even learn the actual operating principles of very basic Tinker equipment after enough time, but he would still be losing access to specific designs with each and every loop.
