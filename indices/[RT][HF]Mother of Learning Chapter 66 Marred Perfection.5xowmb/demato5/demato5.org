  "As for the rest... how much did you really offer them for their life's work?" Zorian asked.

  "I'm always fair in my dealings, mister Kazinski," Xvim said with a frown.

  "Yes, but what if you gave them an outrageous offer?" Zorian smiled. "The collected secrets of dozens of mages. More money than they'd ever seen in their life. Rare materials that cannot be obtained on the open market. A chance to hire a group of archmages for a task. That sort of thing."

It's weird to me that Zorian thinks stealing secrets by breaking into a civilian's mind is wrong, but scamming them by offering a trade for their secrets that they don't know is temporary isn't.

I guess the idea is that if you restrain yourself to things that are only abusable within the timeloops, you won't have as hard a time adjusting back once/if you get back to the real world? I.e. scamming someone in a trade is less emotionally scaring for the scammer than mind-raping someone?
