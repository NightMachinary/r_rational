In the end you might be right and his mom is a great big self entitled asshole.

However, the crux of her disapproval being that the marriage is not useful to her, is only supposition delivered by Zorian. It could be completely wrong, as the reader we don't know for sure one way or another. Considering Zorian has largely been wrong about his family and their motivations so far it wouldn't be surprising to me that Zorian is just assuming the worst in his mother and she's simply worried about Damien.
