Yup, I agree. Zorian starts at 8 that looks like below average but really was 11-3, and will end with 11*4-3=41. However this means even if Daimen has his cost reduced to 1, he still has bigger natural reserves, 15+ I'd say. Psychic ability cost disparity alone can't account for Zorian having 'below average' and Daimen 'huge' mana reserves.
