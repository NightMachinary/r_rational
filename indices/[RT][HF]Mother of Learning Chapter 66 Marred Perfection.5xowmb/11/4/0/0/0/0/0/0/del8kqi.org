That seems unlikely, though. This cost means that if the baby's reserves are average, and average is around 8-10, that baby is a zero-mana mage in the beginning. This doesn't seem right, especially since inherited abilities have maximum possible efficiency. So a ritual-gained psychic powers have a 20 mana cost? That's... not reasonable.
