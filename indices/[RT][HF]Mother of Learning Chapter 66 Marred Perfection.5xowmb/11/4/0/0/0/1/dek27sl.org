Yeah, you're probably right. Especially since this is a story about largely thinking your way out of a situation as opposed to blasting your way through. For Zorian to suddenly get a boost in mana reserves would take away from the struggles and compromises he's had to make to make his magic/whole fighting style work as efficiently has possible to make up for his deficiencies.
