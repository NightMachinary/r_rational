Taiven commented way back in chapter 12:

  "Err, really?" Taiven asked. "I guess I kind of assumed your mana reserves are huge, like your brothers'. How many magic missiles can you cast in one sitting?"

  "11," Zorian said, pointedly ignoring her first remark. "It started out as 8, but I increased it somewhat."

  "Eight!?" Taiven gaped. "But that's...practically below average!"

I wonder if it's possible for Daimen's psychic ability to be a lower cost/power version than Zorian's own, which could be part of the disparity in natural starting reserves. Still, I'd guess Zorian is a bit on the lower end while Fortov and Daimen are on the higher end of reserves.
