Didn't mind magic require a superior mana control? And isn't mana control and manipulation adversely affected by larger mana reserves (i.e. harder to train with more mana)?

So if Damien received both mind magic and large reserves, it could have limited his empathic resonance and that might be the factor that caused him to turn out like he did (sociable, outgoing, charismatic), while Zorian with his smaller reserves and mind magic had a became more empathic and he turned out as isolated and grumpy to shield himself.

Also most mages don't improve their mana control beyond its useful limit as they can just pump more mana to overcome any deficiencies. It could be that Damien just never developed his control and therefore doesn't understand what his mind magic tells him or doesn't link it with magic but just social cues.
