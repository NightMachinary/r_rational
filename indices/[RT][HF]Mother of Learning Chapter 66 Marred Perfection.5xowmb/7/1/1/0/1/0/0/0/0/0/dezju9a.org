I'm not quite saying RR reproduced the fluke. We know other souls can be included into the loop, and we know this is something QI is aware of:

#+begin_quote
  "The aranea were never part of the-" began the lich, but Red Robe already teleported away. (Ch. 26)
#+end_quote

The sentence is most likely lacking the word "loop". Mind you, this phrase was uttered by the same person who brought Zorian into the loop by accidentally copying Zach's marker.

In any case, it's possible that the temporary marker can be altered to become permanent. That wouldn't be an insistence of copying the marker as much as alerting a temporary one. If anyone is capable of such magic, it's QI. What's more, while Kael knows a lot, he is a rank beginner compared to QI, so QI may be aware of ways to get around some of the limitations of soul magic.
