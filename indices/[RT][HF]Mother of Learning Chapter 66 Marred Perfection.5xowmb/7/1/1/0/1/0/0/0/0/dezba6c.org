  There's a difference between /being able/ to duplicate the soul by freak accident and /necessitating/ a freak accident to do it.

Kael discusses this in chapter 39.

  "I'll be blunt," said Kael, ignoring his glare. "Your marker shouldn't work." Seeing Zorian's confused expression, he moved to explain. "I was immediately suspicious when you described how tightly the marker's entwined with your soul -- why would someone make such a deeply embedded marker and then make it a simple unchanging identification stamp like you assumed it was? The desire to make the marker resilient to damage and harder to remove could explain some of it, but it was still excessive -- there are less invasive means that would have only failed if the soul was so mangled that the person was effectively dead. Those methods do have a noticeable flaw, though -- they are a lot easier to copy than what you have rooted in your soul. That, I felt, was key. The marker was designed to foil attempts at copying it to other people. And in order to do that-"

  "...there are some things about its functions that are obvious to me, and one of them is that the marker is designed to consult the soul of its host -- the core, unchanging part of it, anyway -- and alter its identification tag according to what it detects. Transplanting the marker to another person should result in a totally different identification value...It's broken."

  "...But the main part of the thing works?"

  "In a sense. It does everything it is supposed to, consulting the core of your soul, but for some reason it is still stuck on the same value it had while it was still inside Zach. It's broken, but it's broken in your favor."

  "...If I'm right, then whatever convergence of circumstances aligned to pull you into the time loop along with Zach was a fluke. A fortunate fluke, but a fluke all the same. It is not consistently reproducible."

I'm very skeptical that RR could deliberately reproduce such a fortunate fluke.
