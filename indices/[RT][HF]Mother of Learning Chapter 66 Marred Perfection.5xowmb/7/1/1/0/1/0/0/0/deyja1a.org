  Yeah, I mentioned that. It literally requires splicing the soul of the owner of the mark with someone else, which puts you in a coma for at least six months, and probably longer. If it doesn't kill you outright.

There's a difference between /being able to/ duplicate the soul by freak accident and /necessitating/ a freak accident to do it. It's not far-fetched that starting with a temporary marker and converting it to a permanent marker is another way to duplicate the marker, and that this process would be significantly easier and safer. If that's the case, it's certainly possible the Cult could have been able to make that happen.

  Red Robe would have had to have somehow removed the incredibly tamper-resistant marker system from himself (as he doesn't show up on searches for the primary marker)
#+end_quote

Valid point, however if RR exited the loop at any point before Zorian learned how to cast the marker search spell, RR would not have shown up on scans.

It's also possible that RR left the loop immediately after his soulkill rampage. If he believed that the loop would end of a Controller exited the loop, and if he feared that now with many Controllers, there was a chance someone else might leave the loop soon, then RR might have decided to take the initiative and leave first. If this is true, there was no hope for Zorian's marker search spell to detect RR because RR was months gone already.

Also, I should point out that Zorian's search spell only ever defected himself and Zach, which means it did not distinguish between original mark as Zorian's mark, even though Zorian's mark /is absolutely different/ from Zach's in that it is an incomplete mark.

This means we cannot assume that Zorian's tracking spell would not ping the temporary marker, because even deformed markers are similar enough. I'm not saying that's a certainty---Zorian's marker may be intact enough to seem like a good copy to the tracking spell---however, we have no basis to assume one way or the other.

  The Gate spirit confirmed the marker Zach and Zorian have is the mark of the controller
#+end_quote

That's not great evidence, seeing as then Guardian /also/ said the Controller already left the loop. In other words, the Guardian /also/ confirmed that RR had the mark of a controller. What's more, RR has abilities that may be consistent with him having a Controller marker---namely the "soulkill" spell and knowledge of the Gate's location and operation.

Lastly, I must concede the point that I see no obvious reason for Zach to have been included in the loop after the fact. However, I can imagine a few scenarios: For example, maybe the Cult was trying to recruit young, vulnerable, and easily manipulated noble heirs to their ranks and thus it was their MO all along to include Zach and Veyers. I don't believe that theory---I'm just saying one can imagine reasons that are within the bounds of reason.
