Hmm, okay. I concede that skill removal should be within the scope of advanced mind magic. But I'll point out that if the /only thing/ passed around between loops is the soul, and since Zorian retains knowledge between restarts, knowledge must be contained within the soul. This means the gain of knowledge and mental abilities /is/ soul modification. Alanic has no problems with this type of soul modification because it is natural.

We know that mind magic allows one to read or control a person's brain. We also know that mind magic allows one to permanently modify the brain---memories can be altered and the brain can be damaged. We also know that knowledge is imprinted onto the soul---not only from the above paragraph, but also because we know that a primary function of the soul is to be a record of a person's experiences. Thus, if mind magic can alter the mental record of one's life, then this means that such mind magic indirectly modifies the soul.

  As for making it permanent...I actually had an idea about that, involving RR getting a temporary marker and then using mind magic to make Zach place it on him again in between the time when it wears off and the next reset.

I like this solution. If a geas were placed on Zach, he could include as many people as necessary.

As for temporary markers giving Controller powers, that's certainly possible, however I feel like that would be a terrible design flaw that the Maker would not have implemented. If the Controller judges someone incorrectly and includes them in the loop, that person could then cast the loop erasure spell inappropriately and a lot of damage, or maybe even start including their own people in the loop. However, maybe the temporarily marked person needs to be /taught/ those functions and RR simply ripped the knowledge from Zach's brain.

Another possibility is that the loop erasure spell doesn't require a marker at all---it's just a spell like any other, but it only works inside the loop. Thus, stealing the knowledge from Zach's mind would be sufficient.

--------------

There is another issue: If RR and Zach meet every loop in a situation where Zach is essentially at the mercy of RR, then Zach should be more easily controllable. Why isn't he captured every loop, drugged out of his mind, then memory wiped? Certainly, if abilities like soul awareness can be erased, then RR (and his allies?) could erase the memories of an entire loop spent in a coma---it's not like there would be many memories clean up.

This may be a point against your hypothesis, as it seems Zach is not so easily accessible at the beginning of the loop.

The above also makes me wonder: If the cult is in on RR being part of the loop, why aren't more cultists included in the loop? RR may be an independent actor, but in my previous reply, I indicated that QI probably knows of the loop.

It must not be so easy to include people in the loop---or at least not so easy to convince Zach to include (multiple) people in the loop.
