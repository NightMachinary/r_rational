Soul awareness cannot be a bodily adaptation, or else it would be erased by the restarts.

I highly doubt it involves actual soul modification, since that's always treated as significant, dangerous, and morally charged, but Alanic would teach personal soul awareness to the masses if they wanted to learn.

Therefore, it is simply a technique learned in the mind. Therefore, by default it's vulnerable to mind magic.

It's definitely a marker. Again, that's in chapter 55.

As for making it permanent...I actually had an idea about that, involving RR getting a temporary marker and then using mind magic to make Zach place it on him again in between the time when it wears off and the next reset. It's a way of gaining full loop continuity, consistent with all the known rules, and it would neatly explain why his control of Zach broke down (because Zach became too suspicious of him, overriding any embedded compulsion to ignore him, like what happened with Veyers, and then hid himself from divinations so RR couldn't get him again) and why RR then exited the loop (because without Zach, his marker is temporary). The outstanding question is how he a) used Controller abilities like loop erasure; and b) persuaded the Guardian that his marker was good enough to actually let him leave, since I'm pretty sure only the Controller is supposed to be allowed to do that.

On the other hand, it's theoretically possible that a temporary marker is sufficient to use Controller powers if you know how? We don't really know much about temporary markers.
