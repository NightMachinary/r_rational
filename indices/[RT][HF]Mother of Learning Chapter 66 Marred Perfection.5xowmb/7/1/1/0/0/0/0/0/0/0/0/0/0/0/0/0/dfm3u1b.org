You said:

#+begin_quote
  It seems most likely that the Gate/Guardian is using the record in their souls to populate their minds.
#+end_quote

If your statement is true, this requires the Guardian to not be aware of or to not be telling the whole truth:

#+begin_quote
  "Because only the Controller has their real soul pulled into the time loop," the Guardian said. "Everyone else is a copy." (Ch. 55)
#+end_quote

Because we see it withhold sensitive information, it's more likely the Guardian is either being forthright or is unaware that it's wrong. While it's been wrong about the marker due to shenanigans, my hunch is we can take its word here: the original looper's real soul is in the loop.

However, I can also see the sense in only using a copy. If real damage is done to the soul, if you have a previous loop's copy is on file as a backup, you just rewind one loop and the problem is solved.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, there are pieces of evidence suggesting that RR had a full Controller marker
#+end_quote

If RR had access to a Key, this might explain his extra abilities---it's not suggested anywhere that the controller needs the keys to leave the loop, but rather to unbar the Gate.

#+begin_quote
  If RR was only able to make a small number of changes to his mind with each loop, he'd probably stop bothering once Zach was sufficiently docile.
#+end_quote

This is a good point. RR knows something about how the Gate works, so he might know there's a threshold of mind or soul that can be done to Zach before the loop is reset.
