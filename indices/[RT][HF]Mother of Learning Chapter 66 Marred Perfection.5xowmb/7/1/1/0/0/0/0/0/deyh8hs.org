  I'm pretty sure that you have to assemble the whole Key to mark someone, and we know it's not assembled. So presumably it wasn't used to mark the original Controller.

As you say, the keys are not assembled, so they are not necessary to mark the original controller. They may not be necessary to mark additional loopers either. The "soulkill" spell is precedent for a Controller ability that we've seen been used without access to the keys.

All we know is that unbarring the gate requires them, and that we have several lesser functions that do not. Thus, we can't assume loop inclusion requires key access.

It's very possible that the soul exclusion and inclusion functions are built into the marker, but Zorian's marker doesn't have those functions because his marker is disfigured.

--------------

This actually hints at evidence against Zach being the original marked individual---he lacks the soul awareness to engage with his marker. If the loop was well planned, you'd think the original looper, pre-loop, would have been been at least setup with a soul mage to teach them how to use the marker.

Although it's possible that Zach was brainwashed of soul awareness, however we know they long-term memory adjustment is very, very difficult, and trained skills are unlikely to be wiped. What's more, we do know RR has facility with the Controller functions per his use of the soulkill spell, which is a point in favor of him being the original looper---though admittedly brings up the nagging question of why would Zach be added to the loop then? It's more likely the cult was trying to piggyback on the original looper than Zach trying to piggyback on the cult.

--------------

If Zach /is/ the original looper, Zach's lack of soul awareness suggests that the loop may not have been terribly well organized or was a last-minute effort to impede the invasion. Again, this assumes skills cannot be easily brain wiped, which . . . maybe they can.

Also, while I do favor Zach being the original looper, I should point out that your statement

  On a related note, Zach's family actually had the Sovereign Gate in their vault until recently.
#+end_quote

works both ways. The Gate being moved /from/ Noveda possession may also mean /someone else/ wanted access to the Gate---possibly to hack it to allow a second looper.
