  if the only thing passed around between loops is the soul, and since Zorian retains knowledge between restarts, knowledge must be contained within the soul.
#+end_quote

Zorian noticed that he was confused about this, in chapter 51, after Batak explained souls to him. It's not yet clear, but to me it seems most likely that the Gate/Guardian is using the record in their souls to populate their minds.

  temporary markers giving Controller powers
#+end_quote

Yeah, there are pieces of evidence suggesting that RR had a full Controller marker: he was able to exclude the aranea from the loop, and for that matter leave it. On the other hand, the more power you assume he had, the more you have to wonder why he didn't have his own army of time travellers.

Perhaps it's because only one can leave? He doesn't want competition, even from allies.

  Zach should be more easily controllable
#+end_quote

That may be a matter of "can't do much to him without his marker triggering a reset". If RR was only able to make a small number of changes to his mind with each loop, he'd probably stop bothering once Zach was sufficiently docile. I'm envisioning his control as being less "memory wipe at will" and more "pay no attention to the red-robed guy behind the curtain", which was enough while Zach was oblivious but broke down once Zorian and the aranea tipped RR's hand.
