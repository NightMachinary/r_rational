oops, thanks.

I also encountered this passage yesterday:

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe seemed to want to say something, but the lich had already returned to scrutinizing Zorian some more and eventually simply bent down to Zach's motionless form and started casting some complicated spell before placing a hand on Zach's head.
#+end_quote

So RR did at least some structured mind magic to Zach. This indicates RR has in-depth knowledge of what will and will not trigger the Gate's soul defenses.
