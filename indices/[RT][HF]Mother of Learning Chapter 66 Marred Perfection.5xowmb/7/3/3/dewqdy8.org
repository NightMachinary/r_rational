I'm also a native speaker of English (from the East Coast originally). I've run into that usage of torpedo, so you're right. He torpedoed the idea of Daimen being RR = destroyed that idea.

In another context, I could see it to mean promotion. "With the help of his tutor, he torpedoed to the top of his class by the end of the semester."

You're English is really good! Where are you from?
