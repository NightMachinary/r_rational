Yeah there is still a lot to learn about what happened and how it was possible, but there is no denying that RR has a strong connection to Veyers. As for any powers that RR showed that can all be explained by the many years spent in the loop. I don't buy the dismissal of Veyers simply from the fact he could not have had those powers before the loop. I highly doubt RR entered the loop with brute force, it seems more like a logic or programing type flaw so you really can't rule Veyers out like most seem to want to do.
