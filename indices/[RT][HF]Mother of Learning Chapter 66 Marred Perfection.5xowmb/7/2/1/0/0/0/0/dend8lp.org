My working theory is that Vatimah Tinc (head of the Mage Guild) recruited Veyers Boronova (heir of a house) to have him share some of his house's secret magics in exchange for revenge against those who wronged him (both his house & the city). As Veyers would be part of the true ritual, Veyers would have to be part of the inner circle. If Veyers has a soulbond-like tie to a fire elemental, his magic can potentially give him insight to subjugating an alien force. Assuming this is true, then Zach's early loop activities (convincing anyone he can of the time loop) could have got the inner circle's interest. When Zach sought out Veyers, for a laugh, the inner circle used that meeting to set a trap to capture Zach & study him at their leisure. This theory means that anyone of the inner circle could be Red Robe. However, as the time loop seems vulnerable to unstructured magic, Veyers' unstructured fire magic may have given him a slightly better opportunity.

Regardless of my theory, I think its likely that Red Robe is an inner circle member. At the very least, Veyers would be prime cultist material for his /potential/ hatred for Eldemar & Cyoria (looting his House & training commoner mages), as suggested in ch 50 by Tinami.
