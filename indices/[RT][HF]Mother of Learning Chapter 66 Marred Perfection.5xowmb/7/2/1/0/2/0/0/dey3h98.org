You're right. But also rationalist fiction doesn't do plot for plot's sake, so both approaches are appropriate. Forcing RR to be someone we know because /that's how stories work/ is out (not to say you implied that).

Also, I think a better approach for rationalist fiction is that, yes, if a character can figure out a mystery based on common knowledge, then the readers should be able to---however, not all problems have a solution for the readers or the characters.

And that we've all sat around and scratched our heads and discussed the RR candidates to determine who is more likely is, as far as I'm concerned, already a rationalist success.
