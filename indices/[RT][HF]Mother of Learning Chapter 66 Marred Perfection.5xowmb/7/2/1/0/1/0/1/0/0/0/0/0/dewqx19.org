The only issue with RR being one of the main cultist red robe mages is that those mages were the supposedly elite mages involved in the ritual. Our RR is clearly not an elite mage, seems impetuous, volatile, and Zorian said his build was a bit on the small side, if I remember correctly, which might indicate he is younger.

While I agree that in a rational story, the mysterious villain is unlikely to be someone we know, and I personally don't think it's Veyers, there is a decent case for him being RR.
