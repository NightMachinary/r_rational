Maybe Veyers has a hot step-sister? Would neatly solve almost everything. She is included into the cult to get access to Veyers himself (he doesn't have to be cooperating to exploit his connection to the elemental or steal his magic, now does he), has the same reasons to hate the city, finds out about the loop because Zach is an idiot and probably tries to impress her at some point, has reasons to erase memory of Veyers from Zach's mind to hide herself, and since she is an unknown we can't say anything about her Slytherining proficiency.

Really, the only reason I have doubts about this is that I don't remember any foreshadowing on the topic.
