That's the thing, a feigned apology is strictly inferior compared to a simple good first impression. There is no need to let the situation deteriorate to the point where an apology is needed.

And there is no need for a disciplinary expulsion, either. He can fail the exams (which many former classmates did) or just... /not enroll/. "Hey, my legal guardians think academy sucks, I'm now homeschooled." - simple, plausible, reversible at any time if needed.

The whole being a dick for 2 years type of behaviour just does not fit the 'secret agent' MO. It just doesn't without a HUUUGE complexity penalty.

Same applies if his behaviour was genuine and he was recruited shortly before the loop. Why bother? Why risk the one-in-four-centuries chance relying on this unstable kid? Get someone, no, /anyone/ else. Zach's personality is not a secret, it can be accounted for. He doesn't need a heir to the Noble house to be his friend, he's okay with lowborns.
