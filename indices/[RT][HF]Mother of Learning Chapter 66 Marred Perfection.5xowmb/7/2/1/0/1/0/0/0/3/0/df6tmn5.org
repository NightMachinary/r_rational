That's an interesting idea. I agree, ZnZ have to look into Veyers' connections, family, business, friends, everything, even if the boy is nowhere to be found. Maybe it's not step-sister necessarily, but cousin, aunt, mentor etc etc. He was erased from memory and went mia for some reason, after all. (Unless he was erased just as a decoy, leading nowhere and is physically mia for no related reason whatsoever).
