i concede the complexity penalty, but even without the elemental possession, the plan still pans out if there's some other connection between Veyers and the cultists. Seeing as how some wealthy politicians are in on y cult, this is not far-fetched.

As for befriending Zach, think about how Zach would react to the following:

"Zach, hey. Uh, listen, i want to apologize. I've been going nuts lately with the stress from my house guardians. I know you can understand with what Tesen has put you through. Can I buy you a drink or something?"

You know Zach would eat that up. Done. IMO that's entry level Slytherin.

As for the expulsion, it could be part of the plan, and it would be a part of plan I hey Veyers would just love to carry out. Getting expelled gives him more leeway to act as an agent and more time to spend with Zach without having to raise suspicions at school and without Zach being like, "Hey, how are you so willing to abandon school for this potentially fictitious time travel story?"

Instead it's, "Well, it's not like you have to go to school anymore, so what do you have to lose?"

And he wouldn't need to do a 180 to accomplish this stuff. He is expelled from school. He could just show up at Zach's estate the first day of the loop. Zach would accept that after being expelled, he'd be MIA for a little.
