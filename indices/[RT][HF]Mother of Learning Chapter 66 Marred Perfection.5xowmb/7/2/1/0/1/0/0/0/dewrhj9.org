I invoke complexity penalty.

While step 1 is possible, step 2 is extremely unlikely. And 2+5 even less so. Why? Because Veyers did anything but befriend Zach.

Veyers was alienating the whole group, Zach included. If he was an agent at the time, his performance would be surely reviewed, and corrected. It wasn't. Next, Veyers escalates some unknown to us minor conflict to a physical fight with no one else but the person he's got to befriend, Zach. If that wasn't enough, he got threatened with expulsion that would make his task harder. But he fails that, /again/. Instead of having this shit together he loses it and gets expelled about one week before the loop. He just /has/ to suck it up and endure the humiliation if he is an agent. This makes even less sense if he or his superiors have a prior knowledge of the loop imminent. So up until this point, this can qualify only as a low level Gryffindor.

Several days before the loop starts, Veyers goes MIA. The loop starts. This is the unchangeable timeline, this /has/ happened. We know it from Zorian, an independent source.

Now, for your theory to be valid, he'd have to reverse his behaviour, straight up do a 180 heel-face. Then in one month he is supposed to undo all the damage to his relations with Zach, convince him to give a temp marker, and then maintains the facade for 5 more months. This is highest level Slytherining right here. Making amends with Zach and being not suspiciously friendly would be downright impressive for anyone.

Veyers /as a person/ is simply a sub-optimal agent, from every perspective, outrageously so. I mean, I can improve this plan in two easy steps: a) the agent is a hot grill, b) the agent kisses Zach in the face, instead of punching. I think these would more than make up for the lack of nebulous unstable connection to an unknown elemental.

Veyers is so bad that I consider the scenario of Veyers' body being completely hijacked by some hostile soul/spirit/lich, which then carries out the plan, to be infinitely more likely. It's still unlikely overall (complexity penalty! complexity penalty!) but less so.
