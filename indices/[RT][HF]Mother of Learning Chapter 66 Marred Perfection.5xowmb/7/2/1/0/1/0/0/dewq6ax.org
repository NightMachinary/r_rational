Honestly, Veyers is a decent candidate:

1. He's recruited by the cult due to his wealth and nobility, and perhaps he is soul bound to an elemental, which might be old enough to have knowledge of the primordial.

2. Knowing the time loop will occur, the cult has Veyers plan to hang out with Zach somehow with the goal of being brought into the loop. He uses the fact that he and Zach share somewhat similar upbringings as the young living heirs of their houses.

3. Veyers feels his friendship with Zach has progressed enough and Veyers is brought into the loop. The cult tutors him and also conducts research on his temporary loop marker to figure out how to make it permanent.

4. Once finished, Veyers and the cult set an ambush for Zach. They steal what knowledge they can, wipe his memories, and then proceed to perfect the invasion process. Veyers continues his training.

5. After many years, Zorian enters the loop and the story as we know it begins.
