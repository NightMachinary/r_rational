The Cult's power structure is nebulous enough for this theory to work. RR can be the lowest member of the 'council of red robes' or whatever that group is called. Red Robe can be an assistant, a confidante, a close relative... anyone, who has a significant standing in the cult and in the public power rankings, but not necessarily /the/ top dog.

As for the build, RR might be simply a woman.
