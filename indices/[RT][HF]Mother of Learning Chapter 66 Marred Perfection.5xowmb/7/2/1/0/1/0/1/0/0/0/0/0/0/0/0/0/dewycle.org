/beet/ Lol nice.

We're unaware of the power structure, that's true, but I have a hard time believing the individuals with the red robes were even a little disorganized. The human resources infrastructure and planning needed to summon then mentally subjugate a primordial seems like it would demand as much. And seeing as these red robes are bigwigs, they're unlikely to be strangers to organizing. Whether the cult far below them is organized or not is less important because RR was recruited right into the ranks of the top brass.

Also, Veyers being an easily manipluated idiot has its merits. His lack of willpower and experience means he would be easy to subjugate with mind magic. His resolve could have been artificially bolstered and dialogue could have been given to him via mind magic.

Whether or not RR is Veyers, the above point is important because we know that RR probably inexperienced. We know RR is a weaker mage than Zach although he had been looping, but that he was a stronger mage than Zorian in most respects, but not all respects.

This means that RR is unlikely to have been much older than Zach when the the looping began because RR also must've honed his skills over the years of loops.
