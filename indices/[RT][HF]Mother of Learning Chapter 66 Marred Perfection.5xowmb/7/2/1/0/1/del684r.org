So that original Veyers does not posses magic to subdue Zach, get information out of his mind about the loop and forge a copy of a soul marker. And no, mind magic is not trivial to learn, by virtue of being illegal. We are talking about Veyers Boranova, not Veryers Aope after all.

Zach doesn't need to have any proficiency, since he is an original looper. Hell, the whole point of the loop is to make Zach a good mage.

Zorian was just a fluke and got into this using, so to speak, the lich and not his own skills.
