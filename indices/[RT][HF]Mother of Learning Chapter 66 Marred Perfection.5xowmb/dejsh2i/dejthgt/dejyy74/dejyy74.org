  If anything, Damien messing around the likely Gate Key

He explicitly isn't though. The crux of that theory is that he somehow activated a bakora gate or the sovereign gate at the beginning of the loop, which is already an outdated theory because we know Zach is the center of the time loop.

But he hasn't even been at his mysterious project. He's been hanging out with his girlfriend for "several" weeks, which as this isn't the end of the loop, likely means he's been there since before the time loop started.

So the theory now relies on Zach having become powerful enough to teleport to Koth before the end of the loop, which he can barely do now (seriously, how many updates did that take with Zorian's help?), having found Damien (who wants no visitors and has all members of the house he's at turn away people looking for him), then been either voluntarily bringing Damien into the loop via a temporary marker, or Damien somehow mind-probing him and getting in...somehow.

It's just incredibly unlikely.

  and being Open (RR used mind magic)
#+end_quote

RR used very crude unstructured magic after years of practice, and when he probed Zach's mind for details on the Aranea, he used structured mind magic (he's explicitly described as casting a very complicated spell, then placing his hand on Zach's head. Zorian's mind magic requires no visible gestures.)

Xvim told Zorian mind magic shaping exercises could give someone very crude unstructured mind magic. That's probably what Red Robe has.
