  This sentence is most likely lacking the word "loop".

I /highly/ doubt that RR told QI about the loop.

- Why would QI bother threatening to kill him?
- Why would QI question the value of RR's information, and why would RR respond that "we have a leak" instead of blaming other time travelers?
- Why would RR take the huge risk of waving such power in front of QI's face and then saying, "Sorry, can't share"? Way too much danger of QI capturing and experimenting on him.

I assumed that the missing word was "deal" or "arrangement".

Note that even the cultists - or at least the inner circle who wear the red robe - wouldn't want QI to have the power of the loop. Too much danger of him discovering their real plan for Panaxeth.
