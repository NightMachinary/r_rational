  Zorian is also marked. Clearly, there are ways of duplicating the mark.

Yeah, I mentioned that. It literally requires splicing the soul of the owner of the mark with someone else, which puts you in a coma for at least six months, and probably longer. If it doesn't kill you outright.

Red Robe potentially could have mastered soul magic, and copied or made a marker for himself. He would have /no/ reason to make that whole protected setup for Zach though, if he even could.

If Zach isn't the original Controller (and RR is) Red Robe would have had to have somehow removed the incredibly tamper-resistant marker system from *himself* (as he doesn't show up on searches for the primary marker), then somehow give that how setup to Zach. Then turn on him, and brainwash him, and escape the loop without him.

It makes no sense for RR to be the original time traveler, given what we know.

  I personally believe there is good evidence for Zach being the original, but that's not conclusive.
#+end_quote

Zorian used his continent wide tracking spell on the marker dozens of times. He only found his and Zach's markers. The Gate spirit confirmed the marker Zach and Zorian have is the mark of the controller. I don't know what more proof you need.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe the temporary loop marker was converted to a permanent marker.
#+end_quote

That's one theory as to how Red Robe entered the loop, yes. It likely wouldn't show up to the tracking spell Zorian used on his own marker. It still wouldn't make Red Robe the original Controller though.
