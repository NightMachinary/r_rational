Well, we know that Zach has a fully-intact Controller marker, and that RR either /couldn't/ outright eject him from the loop or couldn't afford to.

We know that Zach remembers spending decades and hundreds of iterations in the loop, and that it's only been going for about 30 years. RR, on the other hand, has clearly spent a long time there, but Zach found it easy to beat him in a straight fight (which might, or might not, just be because of Zach's abnormal mana reserves).

We know that Zorian considered Zach to be a prime candidate for the loop, with lots of underdeveloped potential that has now come out, whereas RR is most likely a cultist. With the gods silent and the Key scattered, the choice of Controller would have to be made by the Maker's agents, who are unlikely to favor the guy who wants to mess with a primordial.

And if Zach was the original Controller, we can easily think of reasons that he might have tried to include others in the loop, or been tricked/compelled into doing so, but if RR were the original, why would he have ever chosen to include Zach? And why wouldn't he have done more radical mind surgery /before/ turning Zach into a Controller?

We don't have definite confirmation from, say, the Guardian, because it's clueless about that kind of thing.
