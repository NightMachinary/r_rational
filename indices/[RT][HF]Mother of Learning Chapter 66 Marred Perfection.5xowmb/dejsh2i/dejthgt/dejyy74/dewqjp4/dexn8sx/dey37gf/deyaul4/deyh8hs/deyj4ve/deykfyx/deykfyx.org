Good point about what is needed to mark a person.

#+begin_quote
  "The Controller is marked by the Key, by the Maker, or by its agents," the Guardian said. "I am not aware of what criteria were used in choosing any particular Controller. It is ultimately irrelevant to my purpose to know such things."
#+end_quote

The Controller cannot mark someone without access to either the Key or an agent. This means that adding anyone to the loop means either unconventional means were used or there's an agent who helped the original looper. I wonder who that agent might have been . . . ?

  But we know the loop activation was rushed - a month early - so maybe he was supposed to take time for that during the loop, as he is in fact doing?
#+end_quote

I would have expected him to already have learned how to sense his marker fairly early on in the loops, /unless/ Zach was highjacked soon after the looping process began. That's one possibility. In my mind, the other possibility is Zach never learned to control the loop because be wasn't the original looper in the first place. Or, as we said, they successfully brainwashed him of loop control.

What are some other options?
