I'm pretty sure that you have to assemble the whole Key to mark someone, and we know it's /not/ assembled. So presumably it wasn't used to mark the original Controller.

I assumed that the Maker's agents would oppose the cult, because the Maker is probably a god, and they didn't like primordials at all.

On a related note, Zach's family actually had the Sovereign Gate in their vault until recently. Which tends to strengthen the "someone chose Zach as the Ikosian heir" theory.
