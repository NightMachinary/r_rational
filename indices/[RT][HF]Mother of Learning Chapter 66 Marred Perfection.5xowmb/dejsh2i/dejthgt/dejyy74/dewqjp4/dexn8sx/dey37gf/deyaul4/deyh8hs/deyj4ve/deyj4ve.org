The Guardian explained this in chapter 55. The Maker's agents can mark the Controller.

I'd agree that either skills must be subject to memory wipe, or else Zach was poorly prepared. After all, marker interaction is necessary even to access the control room. But we /know/ the loop activation was rushed - a month early - so maybe he was supposed to take time for that during the loop, as he is in fact doing?
