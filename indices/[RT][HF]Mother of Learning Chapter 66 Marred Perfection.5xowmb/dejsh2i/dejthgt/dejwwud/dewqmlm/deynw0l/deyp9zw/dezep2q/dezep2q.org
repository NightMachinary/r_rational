I'd say he can probably /read/ Zach's mind with structured magic, but not edit anything.

As for why he used unstructured mind magic on Zorian...well, probably he was in a hurry, didn't have his hands free, and didn't expect resistance. Had he anticipated that Zorian would be able to counterattack, he probably would have knocked him out and used structured mind magic on him.
