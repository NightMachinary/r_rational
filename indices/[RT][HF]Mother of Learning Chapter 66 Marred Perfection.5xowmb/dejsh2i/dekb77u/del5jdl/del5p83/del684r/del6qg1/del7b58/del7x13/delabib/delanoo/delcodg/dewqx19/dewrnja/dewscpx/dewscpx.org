I didn't have the impression that the level of voice distortion was that significant, and RR has been referred to as male, but that is a good point: RR could be female and that might explain the build.

Also, I would expect the cult structure to be more cohesive at the higher level where the monied politicians and red robes are operating. If they know Veyers and they know Zach is set to be the looper, they'd just have to ask Veyers to do the job and he'd jump at it.

With inclusion into a time loop as the prize, I'm pretty sure the cult would be able to get Veyers to play ball.
