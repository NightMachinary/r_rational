We have learned that Zack has also forgotten a lot of functions of the loop. One of the powers is to bring people into the loop for a limited number of loops. There is no telling what other powers there was. If Veyers was working with Zack for a while until he was able to betray him it fits. Who knows what other details about the loop was erased from Zack's mind that could help him get into the loop. Veyers was mentioned way back in chapter 2 and unless RR is someone who has not been mentioned at all in the story it is him.
