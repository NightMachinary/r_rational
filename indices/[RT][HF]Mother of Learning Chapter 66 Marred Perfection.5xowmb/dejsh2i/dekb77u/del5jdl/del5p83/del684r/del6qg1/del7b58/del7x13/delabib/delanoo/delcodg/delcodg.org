Yes, but Veyers was basically at the bottom of the list of people Zach would've sought out and told. Which means that if it ever happened, Zach had a year of extra experience at the very least. Realistically Zach would never bothered with this asshole.

Speaking of more likely candidates to tell, how about the actual robe (item) owners, that is the Cult leadership. The theory that the Red Robe is one a high ranking cultist is simple and elegant /(and yeah, a bit boring. Hello, this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]] speaking, sir, we have a bit of situation, we can't have a theory that is crazy interesting and plausible at the same time)/. They have infiltrated the local government, which is exactly whom Zach would've tried to persuade. They are adults and thus proficient mages. They have serious expertise in soul magic (case in point: Sudomir) and mind magic to the point of harboring the plan to /mind control a primordial(!!!)/. They are naturally in possession of red robes. They are motivated to help the invasion... they /are/ the invasion.
