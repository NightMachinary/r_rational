Yes, that's a good point about the disciplinary expulsion. Say the expulsion happened and then he was contacted by the cultists. Problem solved. I don't find these solutions are particularly complex.

  The whole being a dick for 2 years type of behaviour just does not fit the 'secret agent' MO. It just doesn't without a HUUUGE complexity penalty.

As for fitting the MO, I don't think it's that complicated for the Boronova family to have ties with the politicians who belong to the cultists. They hear of Veyers getting expelled, know they need to target Zach, and that they could make good use of the Boronova house's resources.

What's more, Veyers doesn't need to be their only attempted vector to Zach. They could have given a few people with tenuous connections to Zach this type of mission---and maybe Veyers was among the first to get close enough to be included into the loop.

Of Zach's classmates, who would you expect to join your terrorist group? One of the kids still in good standing? Or a disenfranchised student who was just expelled and probably has a chip on his shoulder? Case in point.

And we're not talking high-level James Bond stuff. I'm convinced if he just approached Zach to apologize and reach out at the beginning of ten restarts or something, Zach would have forgiven him. I mean, Zach /did/ punch Zorian in the face, but otherwise was happy to join up with Zorian. Zach is a forgiving and easy going person.

While I admit that a feigned apology pales next to a positive first impression, you have to understand that, from the cultists' point of view, their avenues to Zach are limited. If I were them, I would plant several people. And I don't know Zach or his classmates well enough, but the only one I know of who seems likely to join a terrorist group and betray Zach is Veyers.

Okay, so say Zach lets Boranova in and talks with him. The cultists coaching him for two or three days would be enough for the following:

Veyers "opens up", discussing his frustration with his House caretakers and how they try to control him, how he realized after leaving school that he's pushed everyone away in his life and he has no one. He decided to start with apologizing to the people he was especially shitty to---Zach being a good first candidate.

After some more discussion, Veyers asks Zach what he's up to. Zach, having lived through the month several times, decides---what the hell, I'll tell him about the loop. Veyers is one of the few people that believes him.

It's not that hard. And what makes it more credible is that Veyers doesn't have to be the only person they tried to recruit.

Yes, get someone, /anyone/, and so maybe they put out feelers and, surprise, none of Zach's teachers or other classmates don't seem terribly interested in seeing the world burn. And a random perosn Zach doesn't know shows up to the Noveda Estate asking to hang out with Zach and . . . of course is dismissed as a nutter. But a former classmate from the Academy and son of a Noble House ? Okay, the gatekeepers are willing to bother the Noveda heir with that request.
