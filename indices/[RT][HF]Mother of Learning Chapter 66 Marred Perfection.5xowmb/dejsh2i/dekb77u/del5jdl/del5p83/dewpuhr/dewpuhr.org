Agreed, it is unlikely that Boranova is Red Robe, if only because he is currently the most likely candidate, which means it's probably a red herring.

In a rational story, Red Robe is unlikely to be someone we know, so it depends if the author is going for narrative effect or realism.

All that being said, if RR is someone we know, I feel the most likely candidate is Boranova.
