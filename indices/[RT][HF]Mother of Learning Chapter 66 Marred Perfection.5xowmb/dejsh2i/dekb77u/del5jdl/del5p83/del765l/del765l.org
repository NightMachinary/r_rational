RR used *unstructured* mind magic, and isn't a psychic, that's actually a pretty high bar. Simply reading minds and erasing memories doesn't seem like much compared to what Zorian can do, but in Xvim's estimation, for a non-natural mind mage to do that would require at least several years of dedicated study.

Chapter 42:

  "Can you also use telepathy and mind reading in unstructured manner, too?" he asked Xvim, acting on a hunch.

  "Me, personally? No. I've never had an interest in anything other than defending myself," Xvim said. "But if you're asking whether it's possible, the answer is yes...with caveats. It requires great dedication for rudimentary results -- such an aspirant would never be able to duplicate the attack you just casually did, for instance, even after a lifetime of honing their skills."

At this point, I'm thinking the ritual to awaken Veyer's bloodline opened him up to some influence/being who actually had the knowledge of the Sovereign's Gate, like a soul bond with an ancient Fire Elemental or something.

  The main issue was that one of the participants usually started to mentally and spiritually dominate the other, making them more like themselves in mind and soul, not to mention disturbingly obedient and deferential. This was a good thing when binding animals as familiars, since it was almost always the animal that got dominated by the human, and animals actually tended to benefit from such domination by developing higher intelligence and better control over their magical abilities (if they had any). Sentient beings usually had issues with someone magically subverting their entire personality and worldview, however. At least until the soul bond finished, turning them into a servile clone, that is.

Chapter 61

  Unfortunately, it soon became clear that either the new ignition ritual was faulty or that some kind of specialized training regimen was required to stabilize the ignited state, because Veyers started losing control over his emotions and magic. He became prone to rapid mood swings, laughing uproariously in one second, only to be reduced to near-suicidal depression in the next, and then erupting into murderous rage when confronted. His non-structured fire magic started manifesting itself based on his subconscious desires, frequently spinning out of his control entirely, almost as if *it had a mind of its own.*

Emphasis mine.

In which case, Veyers/RR probably both planned the early activation of the time loop and his own expulsion to capitalize on that. I'm still not sure how Veyers/RR would have made their way into the loop though, short of getting a temporary marker. So it's still not a great theory, but I haven't seen any great RR theories.
