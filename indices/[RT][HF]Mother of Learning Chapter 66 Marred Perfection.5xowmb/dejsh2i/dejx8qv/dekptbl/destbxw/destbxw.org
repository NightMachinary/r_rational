I haven't ever seen it used as a promotion, either (also USA native speaker). Maybe it's a British thing?

Although, I'm pretty sure I've seen it used to mean "traveled forward at great speed," usually with a collision of some sort. Like "She torpedoed into his side and wrapped her arms around him" or "He torpedoed through the door and looked around..." Maybe that's what [[/u/sambelulek]] was getting at? It seems quite reasonable to speak of a theory "torpedoing" upward in probability. Reasonable, but I've never heard it. It would be rare enough that I'd be confused to see just "the theory torpedoed" and not the full "the theory torpedoed to the top of the list".

And of course, there's a direct object involved in SpeculativeFiction's use. When "X torpedoes Y", Y is always destroyed, and without connotation of X rushing forward.
