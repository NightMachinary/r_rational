Zorian's simulacra are coordinating with each other...this could become a whole new kind of hazardous. What happens when they start ganging up on him?

And although Simulacrum 2 didn't mind having a one-day stint at school, isn't there a new risk, now that there's a precedent for long-lived simulacra, that others might complain about having only 24 hours?
