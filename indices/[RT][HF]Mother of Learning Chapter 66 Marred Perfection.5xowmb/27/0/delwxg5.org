that's probably a non-issue. they're still copies of Zorian so unless base Zorian changes and/or simulacrum experiences a HUGE change to affect him, the simulacrum wouldn't have mind to betray (for what benefit even?). and we've seen at least one (if not most of them) dispelling themselves so there's no continuity crisis with them at this time

also, unless they expect to be able to do something /not/ boring, there's no reason for the simulacra to want to do boring crap for /more/ hours ^{^}
