However, Zach already explained that he couldn't access the large majority of it, and especially that he needed Tesen's approval for using any large amount of funds. So no, this couldn't come from Zach. These were Zorian's and Zach's own personal funds.

They did mention in a previous chapter that after visiting the dungeon together for the first time, they left it with 3 large crates full of crystals. Considering that it's been about 8 months since, it's quite likely that they mapped the depths of the place much better than before, and Zach also knows the location of many rare magical creatures. So I'm pretty sure that this is where the large majority of their funds came from.
