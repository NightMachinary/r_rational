The challenge with cyberpunk Batman is surveillance and communication. In the 60s, it is easy to be an urban legend. With modern tech, you have someone posting a picture on a reddit equivalent. Even if he has censorship software, then people post about not being able to post about it. You need an AI to do a coverup, and batman + an AI is a whole different other story.
