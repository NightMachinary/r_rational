Whatever you do needs to be filtered through the lens of Bruce Wayne's insanity. Childhood trauma leading to aberrant adult behavior -- Batman is nuts, he's just channelled it in a useful way.

Becoming Batman isn't an optimal way to reduce crime -- better would be for him to spend the time he would be Batmaning in setting up new police forces, creating jobs, and doing other social- and infrastructure-related work. So, you're going to need a Batman who is obsessive, has a hero / martyr complex, and is maybe a little bit of a psychopath, albeit with a self-chosen moral code. (That's pretty much his canon personality, actually.) Note that Batman canonically thinks of himself as the real person and Bruce Wayne as the mask.

In canon, the Thomas and Martha Wayne Foundation does a lot of economic / political work, although it isn't shown much because job initiatives are less fun than ninja face punching. You might on-screen that more.

It would also be interesting to cover Batman's logistics. How did he get all that stuff into the Batcave without the location getting out? Where does he get those wonderful toys, and how does he hide the money trail? If someone starts getting close to / actually finds out the truth, how does he deal with it?

Postscript: Now that I think about it, if you grant the mental illness complex described above, Batman is a remarkably rational character.
