If you're straying from DC canon, as you almost certainly are, then you may want to consider basing your Batman on the version of the Wold-Newton universe, which can be read at [[http://www.pjfarmer.com/secret/marvelous/batman.htm]] . It's based more on an action-hero level of super-poweredness, which would set your Batman's opportunities for Munchkinry to be somewhat closer to those available to people in the real world, which may be useful from several perspectives.
