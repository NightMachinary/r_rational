As others have said, rational Batman would become an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism][effective altruist]] instead of beating people up. A more interesting challenge is to invent a universe where Batman's modus operandi makes sense. What kind of situation would require a billionaire to become a high tech ninja, of all things? Even if the city has problems that can only be solved by beating people up, what stops Bruce Wayne from hiring a hundred trained fighters, giving them wearable cameras, and setting them loose?

One possible solution is that Batman's persona is meant to be a lightning rod. Given a large enough population of villains who will terrorize everyone until they find a worthy "hero" to oppose, it might make sense to become that hero yourself. The nightly outings aren't actually intended to stop crime, but to piss off the major villains by randomly attacking their underlings. The anonymity makes sense for obvious reasons, the no-killing gimmick is just another way to reinforce the heroic image, and the high tech gadgets are mostly used to evade capture and call in the cavalry. In the end Batman serves as a kind of high profile honeypot, a role which the police tacitly recognize.

As to your question, I think the original setting of mid-20th century New York should work fine for a fanfic. If you just intend to use the Cold War or cyberpunk as generic decorations, I advise against it. I strongly believe that a work of art must be /enriching/ to the viewer, giving them something awesome that their mind doesn't already contain. Adding more stuff that already feels "cool" to the viewer is missing the point. If your main innovation is going to be about rationality, then just focus on that.

Does that make sense?
