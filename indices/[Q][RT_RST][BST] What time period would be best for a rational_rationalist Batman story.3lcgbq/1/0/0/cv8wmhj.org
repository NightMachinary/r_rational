Fair enough, but I'm not a big fan of Batman saving the universe. All the grand comic book plots have been very silly so far, I think of them as "using galaxies as throwing stars". IMO it's better to keep the scope small, especially in a fanfic. Or you could attempt a non-silly plot on a grand scale, but that's a huge artistic task in its own right, and AFAIK no one's attempted it yet.
