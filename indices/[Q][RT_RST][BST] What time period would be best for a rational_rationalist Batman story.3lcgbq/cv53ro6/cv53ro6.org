I have always liked Batman better as a thinking man - an actual detective. Part of the problem with that is that much of detective work involves talking to people, which Batman (who almost exclusively works at night) can't really do too much of. If you set it during the internet era, Batman-as-detective is really more of a hacker than anything else, which I think is a less compelling fit for the character.

As for rational Batman ... I would just give him pathologies, rather than making him a /true/ philanthropist. For example, Batman knows that the only way to cope with the trauma he suffered is to go out and fight crime, so he channels his energy into doing the most good while fulfilling that psychological need (having already had some bad experiences with medication, psychiatrists, etc.). He /knows/ that there are more effective ways to fight crime, but if he did it in more effective, less personal ways, it would destroy him, because it wouldn't feel like he was doing anything and eventually he would stop doing good because there was no psychological reward. There's a fair amount of effective altruist reading to be done on the subject.

I think that's the best way of reconciling the character with rationality, or at least the best I've been able to come up with. Otherwise you risk Batman turning into something that's not at all Batman, it's just a rich guy solving social problems with his money. Batman needs to be a little bit brooding and tortured anyway.
