I'm pretty sure they've done that story. The Mafia had a big presence in Gotham for a while -- Carmine "The Roman" Falcone was the head of the local branch. IIRC Batman chased both of the organized crime out of the city. As screwed up as Gotham is, the only criminals you actually find there are stupid street-level thugs who are too arrogant to think they'll be caught, and psycho-villains who are too crazy to care.
