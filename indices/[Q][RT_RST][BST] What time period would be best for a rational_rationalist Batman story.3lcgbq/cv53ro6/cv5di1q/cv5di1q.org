  I have always liked Batman better as a thinking man - an actual detective. Part of the problem with that is that much of detective work involves talking to people, which Batman (who almost exclusively works at night) can't really do too much of.

This. Batman as a hardboiled detective would be pretty interesting. Give him some problems to chew on more complex then stopping muggers. I think a lot of the problem with batman is the characters and problems he's tossed up against are just...weird. Its like, either muggings and petty street crime, or insane pyschopaths. I want to see Batman take on a powerful drug cartel trying to put a bullet in his head with a sniper the entire time. Or batman trying to shut down a massive human trafficking complex. Problems that are still huge even with massive resources and a bat costume.
