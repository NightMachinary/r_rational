This is an incoherent background. Someone with that level of social phobia would have found acquiring that breath of education very difficult. What you do instead is simply state that the character became a hermit because he or she discovered vampires, and reacted with an appropriate level of paranoia. Because the existence of vampires without that being common knowledge implies an insane level of control over society or information. So the formerly brilliant academic now avoids all contact with everyone lest they get dealt with by the time-traveling death squad or wandering band of mind-controllers.
