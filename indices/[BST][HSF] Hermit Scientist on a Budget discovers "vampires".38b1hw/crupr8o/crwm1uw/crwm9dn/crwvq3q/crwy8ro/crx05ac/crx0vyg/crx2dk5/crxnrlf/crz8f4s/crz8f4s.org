Ironically, the direction of the story has the main character defending vampires from humans more often than being in danger from them. Once you get a handle on their culture it's pretty easy to talk them into a corner. They're too damn honorable for their own good. Also most of the story will see the main character pair bonded to the main vampire-character. (the social obligations run such that he is responsible for keeping her fed and she's responsible for keeping him alive.)
