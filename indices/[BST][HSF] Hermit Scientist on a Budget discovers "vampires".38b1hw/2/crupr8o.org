I mean... Does he have their cooperation? Does have them captive? Or does he have nothing but the experience that some kind of vampire like creatures are out there? /The Rhesus Chart/ by Charles Stross features a group of newly minted vampires who do a decent job of researching their own abilities and weaknesses, and that might give you a few ideas.
