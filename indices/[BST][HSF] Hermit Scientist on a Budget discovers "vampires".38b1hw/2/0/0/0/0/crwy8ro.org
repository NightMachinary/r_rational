It's probably because I'm the leader of a pretend-fascist button faction, and I have been getting stalked all over reddit every now and then. No worries.

No need to answer these, but I would try to see: What exactly can they eat? Will any blood do? Does the creature have to be alive at the time of feeding? Does blood taken while the victim lived work after they are dead (probably easier to test if they can feed off of non-human blood). Do victims suffer worse effects than mere blood loss? Can vamps survive without blood? What about raw meat? Cooked meat? Vegetables? Do their powers vary in strength depending on how much they eat? What does their blood look like under a microscope? What happens if they get a blood transfusion? Do blood types matter? What exactly can their powers do? Can they overcome the frailty of their bones? Punch through metal? Heal wounds well? Do they get scars? Can they be in the sun? How quickly do sun-burn-wounds accrue and heal? Do they have any mental powers? Can they use those on each other? On a prepared and resisting target? Can they make me into a vampire? (Not gonna say no, unless there is some reason to think souls are real and somehow affected by the change) Do they remember their previous lives? Did their personalities change when they turned? Are they more charismatic now? Do they appear in mirrors? Can they go outside during the day if they are not struck by sunlight? Do UV lamps hurt them? How do they look on an X-ray? Can they reproduce sexually? (Might not be testable at this point, and they might not volunteer even if they are different sexes) Do they have power over any spawns they create? Is there a limit on how many new vampires they can make (There are reasons not to test this, since I can't trust them. Which is why they should turn /me/ and let /me/ conquer the world)? Do Vampires age (Ask and also examine their cells in culture)? Have they heard of other vampires aging? Or growing more powerful in terms of vampire power with time? Can they make Renfields (thralls)? Can Renfields be restored to freedom and sanity? Do they then remember everything that happened? Are vampires hurt by crosses, holy water, garlic, etc? Do objects of faith from other religions work? Do you have to believe in it for the objects to work? Would ideology work as a substitute for religion? What about new religions like Wicca or Scientology?
