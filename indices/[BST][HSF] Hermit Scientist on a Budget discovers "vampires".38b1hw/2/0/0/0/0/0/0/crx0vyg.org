  I'm not even sure what that means.

It's not important, just the [[/r/thebutton]] Aprils Fool thing. I decided to do some trolling for once, and some people disliked it rather a lot.

  What sort of things might you be looking for in an X-ray?
#+end_quote

Nothing in particular, although if their bones are harder then that would probably show up. That's probably the only thing that would show, unless they have organs we don't have, or some of their organs are changed in some way. Which reminds me: How do they get energy from blood? Is there something magical involved? Because in real life, blood is not that great of a food source (albeit an excellent source of iron). There might be something weird with their organs to accommodate the magical feeding or something.

  silver affects them all. Any sort of cut or stab with a silver edge is highly incapacitating to them and extremely painful.

Gotcha. Is there a mechanism here, or is it left vague? Could you poison someone by putting silver in their tea? With humans, you can poison someone over time by putting lead or gold in their water, although it'll take a while. Would vampires realize something was wrong immediately, or would it be harmless unless the silver was applied directly to the blood by a blade or something? What about a syringe with some silver in a solution? That'd be extremely bad for a human. Or what about a silver tipped club? Or running into them and hugging them while wearing an armor coated with silver? The silver weakness could potentially be very exploitable, although the main character might be hesitant to ask the vamps to let him study how he can hurt them.

And unrelated, can vamps get hooked on normal human drugs?

  I'm realizing partially to my relief partially to my frustration that I pretty well covered all the basics. Being an author and knowing all the answers makes investigating hard.

Yep. I love this sub. It's helped me a few times as well. Keep talking if it helps, I like your world building so far.
