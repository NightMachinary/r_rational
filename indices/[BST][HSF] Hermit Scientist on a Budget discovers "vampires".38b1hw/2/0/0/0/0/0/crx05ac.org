  It's probably because I'm the leader of a pretend-fascist button faction

I'm not even sure what that means.

But I will anyway. I'm realizing partially to my relief partially to my frustration that I pretty well covered all the basics. I'm giving out the answers to see if there's anything else that I might have missed. Being an author and knowing all the answers makes investigating hard.

Vampires can eat anything a human can eat and quite a bit more. Going without human blood generally turns them into jittery, ravenous fiends who will do anything to feed. A few vampires will have been known to feed on the dead, but they are social outcasts and most find it repulsive. Feeding on nonhuman sources is generally taboo but a few vampires pair bond with and feed on each other (and tend to hide that fact). I'm not sure what their blood looks like under a microscope though I do know what's going on there. They /can/ do things like overcome the frailty of their bones (or rather, their bones are much stronger than a humans). They heal perfectly unless they have a vampiric disease, only get scars in odd circumstances. They tend to avoid the sun, though some do so more than others. One of the interviewees notably experiences extreme pain when exposed to sunlight but only if she /knows/ she's experiencing it. (This is a known mental disorder common among vampires).

Most importantly, vampires are born vampires and they cannot turn humans. Thank you for the X-Ray idea, I'll have to figure that one out. What sort of things might you be looking for in an X-ray?

They don't have direct power over their children, but their society is still pretty feudal. Vampires seem to age but very slowly and there's anecdotal evidence that suggests they can reverse their age. Vampires do seem to grow more powerful over time, but some grow more powerful faster than others. Being older than someone else is no guarantee you will remain superior forever.

The creation of Renfields/ghouls is a sticky issue. Vampires /do/ seem to have some mental abilities, but there are hard limits on what a human can be made to do. Memories can be tweaked. They can be put to sleep or in a "trance" but they can't be made to kill themselves. Often a human might claim that they were subjected to The Gaze to avoid responsibility for something they did (in a vampiric court) which often works. Other times vampires will attribute a humans devotion to vampire they don't approve of as a use of the Gaze, but this is mere gossip. Both of the vampires the main character has access to are from the most powerful bloodline on earth and they are incapable of such things.

Vampires are also deeply religious and deeply conflicted about their place in their own belief systems. Most in the West are Christians, and don't know whether or not they can be redeemed. Thus when you shove a cross in their face as a means of defending yourself, they tend to panic and run away, afraid they might have offended God by doing whatever it was that they did to upset you.

Vampires have pretty good memories, though only a few have hyperthymesiatic level memories. Holy water and crosses only affect vampires (and western vampires at that) psychologically, but silver affects them all. Any sort of cut or stab with a silver edge is highly incapacitating to them and extremely painful.
