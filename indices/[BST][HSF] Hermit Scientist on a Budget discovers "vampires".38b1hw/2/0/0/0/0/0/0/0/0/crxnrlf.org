  Relevant entries suggest that vampire muscles are not made out of meat but are made of some black substance that shines like metal.

That could possibly show up on an x-ray, at least if it' more dense than normal muscle (or less dense).

  Vampires rarely stoop to using silver against each other, but there are accounts of humans using powdered silver against vampires as a poison. Almost any amount is debilitating (also the effect seems to be all or nothing), and the only cure is human blood (legend has it, the blood of the poisoner). How would you investigate further?

Not sure, but if I was intending to put myself in harm's way I'd give myself a slight case of silver poisoning to fuck with anyone who tried to drink my blood. Also silver tipped armor spikes. And silver bullets. And silver+glue bombs. And then I'd save up money until I could afford a thick enough layer of silver dust all over my fall back lair so vampires can't go there without a hazmat suit. That last one is obviously very expensive and long term, if he even anticipates vamps going after him.

  I've been fleshing this setting out for years, but after reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, it inspired me to up my game.

Same here with my own world. Although admittedly I was very pretentious even to start with, so I'm just moving further in that direction now.
