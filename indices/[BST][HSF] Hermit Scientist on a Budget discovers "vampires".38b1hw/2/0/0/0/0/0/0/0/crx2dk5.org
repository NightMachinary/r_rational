  unless they have organs we don't have
#+end_quote

To make stilted an analogy, I have the atomic layer of this setting fleshed out as well as the galactic layer. The middle layers are harder because I only know so much science. I imagine some of their organs would be quite different. For instance I /do/ know that their heart is dramatically different producing a constant flow of blood instead of a beat and leaving the systolic and diastolic bloodpressure always equal to each other. Beyond that, Their stomachs are probably larger. Their liver is probably tiny (but vastly more efficient). There's at least one entirely new organ, but while the main character could probably convince his new associates to take an X-ray rather easily, getting access to dead vampires for autopsy would be harder. Eventually he will think to see if anyone had done these kinds of investigations in the past and discover some Renaissance era journals. Relevant entries suggest that vampire muscles are not made out of meat but are made of some black substance that shines like metal.

  How do they get energy from blood?
#+end_quote

I'm not quite sure how to investigate this. Infrared cameras can confirm that, at rest, a vampire is radiating about 1/2 of what a human would. (Meaning their rest metabolism is probably around 40 watts, about half of which is used by their brains. And while vampires can eat human food, they don't need it. They seem to be subsisting on a few hundred calories a day, even when their peak power output can be hundreds of watts, even into the kilowatt range for short bursts. When feeding on only blood they produce almost no waste. (even less than what would be expected based on the small quantity).

#+begin_quote
  Is there a mechanism here, or is it left vague?
#+end_quote

There's an explicit mechanism. The only easy investigations here are historical documents. Vampires rarely stoop to using silver against each other, but there are accounts of humans using powdered silver against vampires as a poison. Almost any amount is debilitating (also the effect seems to be all or nothing), and the only cure is human blood (legend has it, the blood of the poisoner). How would you investigate further?

#+begin_quote
  Or what about a silver tipped club?
#+end_quote

I'm trying to imagine if there's any historical precedence for this. I can certainly imagine a human in the 1800s hitting a vampire over the head with a silver candlestick. In the short term, at least, the effects would be worse for a vampire than a human. A human in silver chainmail hugging a shirtless vampire would probably burn him a little, but nothing worse than a sunburn on a human and it wouldn't last particularly long.

  And unrelated, can vamps get hooked on normal human drugs?
#+end_quote

This is another one that I'm not sure if his two interviewees would know for certain. They would say they've never heard of such a thing though.

#+begin_quote
  Yep. I love this sub. It's helped me a few times as well. Keep talking if it helps, I like your world building so far.
#+end_quote

I appreciate it. I've been fleshing this setting out for years, but after reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, it inspired me to up my game. I know precisely the why and how behind vampirism and a great deal about their society and culture. I'm a little uncertain about the direction a professional scientist would take and if there's any obvious questions I haven't thought of. Another issue is that while sticking a blood slide under a typical optical microscope is an obvious go-to, I'm not sure what you would see even though I know what you'd be looking at. I suppose I should go to another sub and ask, (just don't stalk me. I mean, I could just tell you, but I think that would ruin the process for both of us.)
