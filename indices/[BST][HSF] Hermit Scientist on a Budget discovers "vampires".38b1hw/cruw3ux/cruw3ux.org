Off topic but I want to rant.

Vampires, seem to be the antithesis to virtue/disgust ethics (much the same way zombies are the antithesis to individuality); and quite frankly virtue ethics are not popular at the moment, they've been declining for a while now; this isn't india where its rude to eat with your left hand or the middle east where its rude to point your feet at someone(or throw a shoe at say an idiot president), or the bible and shellfish, etc; arguments form disgust are rapidly falling out of favor(gay marriage and abortion for example) for this story to ring true, the main character is going to display virtue ethics "virtues" much the same way someone in a zombie apocalypse /MUST/ show the main virtues of individuality: intellect, carefully judging who to associate with, functioning without order(and the zombies failing with the opposite of course), etc.; and I'm not actually sure what those are.

You're going to need to make the vampire origin story show why , virtue ethics is important; and short of a vengeful god, I'm at a lost what that actually could be.
