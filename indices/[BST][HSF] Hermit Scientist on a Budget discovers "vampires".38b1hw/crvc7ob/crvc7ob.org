A few more tests:

- What is the mechanism for vampire reproduction? (In many cases it's "vampire bites you, then makes you drink its blood, then kills you.") Does the method give the vampire control of you? Does it freeze you at your current age / condition, or restore you to youth / health?
- What effect does vampire blood have on living humans? Does it heal?
- If vampire blood heals humans -- or at least doesn't hurt them -- do their organs have rejection factors?
- Are all vampires in perfect health? Are there vampires with allergies, or bad eyesight?
- How do vampires heal? Like normal humans, or are they on the "drink blood, maybe sleep, poof all damage repaired" model?
- Can vampires regenerate missing body parts? (e.g. Knocked-out teeth, shaved hair.)
- Do these vampires have the supernatural abilities -- turn to bat/mist/wolf, hypnotize people, summon animals, fly....
- What are the limits of the above abilities? Transform how quickly? Can they learn new forms? Summon how many how quickly? Remain transformed for how long?
