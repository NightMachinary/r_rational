So I managed to get really sick immediately after making my post so I'm just going down the list of comments in the order they now appear.

I can imagine most of these tests can be done with a simple interview. Are there tests you would do that would that would require say, blood samples or any kind of lab equipment?

Edit: I'll go ahead an answer those since I answered someone else

Vampires reproduce sexually with humans. Vampires cannot turn a human into a vampire.\\
Vampire blood grants humans a small measure of the power of the donating vampire, including healing. According to the interview, there's at least one legend of a vampire who regenerated from just a skeleton. Vampires are immune to human diseases but have maladies of their own.\\
Vampires heal at a steady rate, as humans do, only much faster.\\
Vampires can regenerate bone, though it takes some time an a great deal of feeding (most go on a diet of animal organs to speed up the process) Vampires cannot turn into other forms quickly, though some vampires have the ability to do "fleshsculpting" which I am /totally/ not ripping off from Tzimisce Vicissitude. All vampires can feed their blood to an animal and gain the permanent obedience of that animal (they seem more intelligent afterwards as well). Vampires cannot fly, but the 85 year old can run at 60mph over open terrain and stick to walls like spiderman. She also has some mind control-like abilities. They seem to operate a bit like stage-hypnosis with the exception of being effective on almost anyone. Most interesting is the apparent clairvoyance the younger one has.

Virtually all of this information is relayed through a simple interview with no tests necessary aside from actually clocking the older one's running speed.
