  Vampires need blood. What does that mean?
#+end_quote

I would suggest a type of bacteria/parasite that coexists with humanity creating a complex "vitamin" thats not known to other apes(assuming that vampires were "intelligently designed"/breed, I can't think of a an example of a subspecies being so radically different, besides dogs) this vitamin "v"(?) could be used to explain the super strength, and other abilities.

This vitamin could be tied into explaining human domination over nature(humans being having only a tiny amount of this vitamin v, could have evolved to use it in brain function?) but also why vampires gain power over time (it builds up in their system)
