Some people on tumblr found out that coconut water has been injected into people's veins as a substitute for blood plasma in extreme circumstances. This naturally sparked a discussion of tropical coconut vampires.

Naturally, coconut water is a terrible substitute for whole blood, and any vampire that could live on coconut water could probably live on plain water, bananas, and a salt lick. But it's still amusing to think about.
