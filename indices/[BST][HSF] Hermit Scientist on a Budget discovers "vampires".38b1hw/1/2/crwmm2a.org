Yes he has a pair of cooperative vampires. An apparently 16, 16 year old and an apparently 24, 85 year old. The older one sometimes provides murky information but the young one will better explain that a very large majority of vampire weaknesses are psychological. For instance while most vampires find sunlight unnerving, the 85 year old seems to experience severe pain - but only if she knows she's been exposed to it. Similarly she seems to have a unique form of claustrophobia related to being in a home uninvited. It's easy to see with a back of the envelope calculation that their power output vastly outstrips their caloric intake. The minimum amount of blood it takes to sustain a vampire actually varies wildly. Some occasionally resort to feeding on themselves though they experience a dramatically reduced satiation. The younger one will admit that there is a small group of vampires that feed on each other.

Vampirism cannot be induced. They reproduce sexually with humans. A child is either born a vampire or a human. (Standard lore is that their must be a human involved since vampires are technically dead). Misunderstandings about turning come from the fact that if a human drinks vampire blood, they gain vampire-like abilities but only temporarily.

Most of this information could be gained through a simple interview (the energy-in vs energy-out could be done by having them lift weights or run around a track).

I'd already thought of most of these, but I already knew the answers so I figured I should give them to you to see if you see an obvious next step where I don't.

Edit: I missed the part about red-cells vs white-cells, etc. That isn't something that could be done from a simple interview, even harder since they probably wouldn't accept samples that you gave them. Drinking stored blood is generally looked down on, and drinking blood without the consent of the donor is a high crime in their society. The minimum penalty varies, but the maximum penalty for a repeat offender is death. Even if the offender didn't kill or otherwise harm the human(s) involved. Providing a processed sample of your own blood is also problematic for social reasons as well. Apparently to be socially acceptable, humans and vampires enter into life-long pair-bonded units. (Minor spoiler: this will become less of an issue after the main character saves the older vampire from social censure by pair-bonding with her, but that doesn't happen right away)
