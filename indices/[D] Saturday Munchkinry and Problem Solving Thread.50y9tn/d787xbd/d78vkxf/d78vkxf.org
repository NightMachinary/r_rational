One's best start here would be becoming a language instructor at ISIS. Since people who learn foreign language tend to have this problems more often.

From there, you try to get miraclous reputation as a telepath.

Another good idea would be finding an old billionaire suffering of Alzheimers.

Or finding a country with the oldest Defence minister and becoming a secretary/aide.

Anyway, your best bet would be your target growing on to trust you, and conditionnally operating to always repeat your suggestion, only to give them the wrong word in the heat of the moment, where live communication matters
