Munchkinry challenge!

Powerset: Roughly [[http://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/chandra-nalaar][Chandra Nalaar]]'s powers, minus planeswalking. In other words,

- Lots of fire and explosions, limited by mana availability. Also, feeling some sort of strong passion at the time of casting is required to use the biggest spells. Feeling apathy or despair reduces your spells' effectiveness, and sufficient hopelessness can prevent casting anything at all.
- Ability to show off with fire on your hair and hands, along with correspondingly glowing eyes. (This automatically triggers upon extreme passions or when casting large spells, and may be manually used separately. Technically a spell in its own right, but draws only a tiny amount of mana to sustain.)
- Unusually high body temperature (always-on), but not so high as to be uncomfortable to other people's touch. Raising it further (over part or all of your body) is a simple spell, but takes more mana the more you raise it.
- Immunity to heat and your own fire (also always-on, draws no mana).
- Ability to draw mana and hold onto it for as long as desired. Mana pool size is limited only by how much you can find.

The setting:

- Easy mode: Earth as we know it, except that places generate mana as would be expected in /Magic: the Gathering/. You mostly need [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=289321][Mountains]], which can be locations like large foundries or boilerworks. No one else can access mana. You can also bond to a location, allowing you to draw on its mana when not physically there, by spending 8 hours there studying the location.
- Hard mode: Earth as we know it, but land does /not/ generate mana.

In either case, you start with a small pool of manabonds, which supply enough mana for you to throw a fist-sized fireball every minute or hold your body temperature at up to 110 degrees Celsius continuously.

The challenge: Take over the world.
