Now I have had time to form a proper opinion on the Aetherborn. (Setting aside the nonbinary representation issue, on which I'll defer to nonbinary people.)

On the one hand, I like that Wizards has introduced a Black characteristic race that isn't commonly associated with evil and has clearly sympathetic motives as a group. I am of the firm opinion that declaring Black to be amoral is a flavor error and that the correct flavor for Black regarding morality is that a Black character's moral code, if any, comes from what satisfies them personally rather than from society (White) or nature (Green) imposing one. (The latter flavor choice does include lots of people who care only about themselves (e.g. HPMOR!Voldemort), but it also includes people who base their moral code on personally caring about others and will stand in defiance of society and nature to follow it (e.g. HJPEV).) Having the Aetherborn helps balance out Black's representatives.

On the other hand, I am displeased that so far the Aetherborn's short lifespans do not appear to be seen as a /problem/ in-Multiverse, despite the very glaring length difference between their lifespans and those of other sapient races and the fact that they are /produced by an artificial, controlled thing/. People are dying who don't want to die! Kaladeshi Consulate, have the ethical debate and fix your aether grid!

Then again, M:tG doesn't generally portray transhumanism in a positive light. Note the "death and decay are necessary" theme inherent in combining Black's mechanical and flavor elements with the problems which befall planes that don't have a balance of all five colors of mana. Also, observe that the most prominent self-improving character is Tezzeret, the most prominent immortality-/seeking/ character is Liliana, they are both the most prominent in those areas by a long shot, and they are both /terrible, terrible people/. In addition to working with Nicol Bolas for their own gain, thereby making his well-deserved "evil, power-hungry tyrant" image rub off on them, they are both conspicuously shown heaping abuse upon Jace. And Jace is the poster boy and /intended audience surrogate/ for the /entire game/ - who also conspicuously /fails to think of/ using his own powers for self-improvement, despite having the single best powerset for doing so (with the arguable exception of Bolas, depending on whether you look at power focus or power level). Admittedly, if he was allowed to think of that he would run away with the plot, but still.

I have feelings about the portrayal of transhumanism in media. Can you tell? :)

Also:

Is this shown to affect their learning and memory? (I am aware that at least some demons in M:tG also don't sleep. I have the same question about them.)
