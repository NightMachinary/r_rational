For hard mode, the obvious answer is to hold mana for twenty years. At that point, you should be able to get your body up to 4400 C constantly for six months, or sacrifice larger chunks of mana for a couple minutes at a million C, which should be enough to just...walk into any world capital and melt it. Topple governments at will, gain cult following, etc etc.
