  Of course, the Consuls are supposed to be the bad guys of this arc, having hired the guy who killed Chandra's dad and also made Tezzeret a judge for some reason, so them allowing their energy grid to continue making existential nightmares seems entirely in-character.
#+end_quote

I was trying to give them a more charitable fair shake than "bad guys of this arc". You know, treating the Consulate as an organization of and created by /people/ with varied but understandable motives and backgrounds. Some are just doing their job, some really believe that they're making Kaladesh a better place by suppressing mages and limiting aether supplies, some have personal vendettas, some are secretly mages themselves, some are corrupt and using their positions for personal gain...

So yes, maybe it currently makes sense for them to continue allowing their aether grid to make existential nightmares. But it makes sense with explanations like "they didn't realize that the Aetherborn are existential nightmares" or "some of the corrupt / oppressive elements profit from the continued generation of Aetherborn" or "no one can agree on /how/ to fix the aether grid" rather than "for the evulz".

(I try to treat stories as rational until that falls apart. Admittedly, there are some aspects of M:tG where that falls apart /very thoroughly/.)

  But I've never read of anything like the Aetherborn before. ...

  Wizards actually thought about these things and created something totally unique that I didn't expect. And that's awesome!
#+end_quote

This is a thing I like about the Aetherborn, both for the uniqueness and for creating a characteristic race that doesn't already have piles of tropes and associations surrounding it. (See also: earlier commentary on Black =/= evil)

  The whole nonbinary thing makes complete and total sense because the Aetherborn aren't evolved beings and can't reproduce normally!
#+end_quote

Makes sense? Yes, agreed. Representation? Again, deferring to nonbinary people. (From whom I have heard at least one nuanced argument that boils down to "that's better than 'everyone must have a gender of either male or female', but let's please have nonbinary people that /look like and have backgrounds like people/ rather than seeming either ominous or robotic".)

  They can't sleep because sleeping is a function of meatbrains needing downtime, and beings made of Aether don't have meatbrains!
#+end_quote

My inner Jace insists upon taking this one, so I'm going to let him type his response.

Sure, sleep in humans does perform meatbrain-downtime functions like replenishing ATP reserves in the brain and possibly helping remove waste products generated by brain activity, but that's not all it does. Sleep also has a large role in memory processing and consolidation, and that shows up quite nicely on the substrate-independent interface provided by mind magic.

So if the Aetherborn can't sleep, how does that affect their minds? Clearly at least some of them can perform complex long-term tasks that require lots of memory processing (see example: Gonti), so do they have some other means by which that processing occurs? If so, what tradeoffs does it have, and can meatbrains use it? If not, does that mean that most Aetherborn are even more of existential nightmares because they're good at sensation-gathering but have trouble learning from their experiences?

For a mind mage, this raises all sorts of questions. Can I tell if a mind is an Aetherborn simply by looking at its memory structure without reading any of the contents? If I see piles of under-consolidated memories in an Aetherborn mind, is that normal for them or a sign of pathology or interference? Are well-consolidated memories in an Aetherborn mind an indication that those memories were placed there by mind magic? How do the Aetherborn, both individually and as a society, adapt to any tradeoffs or difficulties in memory processing?

(No, I can't answer all those questions from my encounter with Ob Nixilis. He doesn't sleep either, but I didn't spend long enough in his head to really investigate that sort of thing, and it's quite possible that the answers are different for demons.)

  I totally get your feelings about the portrayal of transhumanism, but let's take a look at this in context. In the Magic universe, the only known methods of immortality were developed by the Phyrexians (Squee), or require selling your soul to four different demons. Whereas in our universe it is entirely reasonable to expect that becoming immortal is entirely possible, it may well be harder in the Multiverse because reasons, and it may well be that the only methods of becoming immortal require questionable moral choices. If that is the case, the fact that nobody seems to be searching for immortality rituals might well be justified if we assume that all of them are evil or require too many resources a-la the white reanimation spells anyway.
#+end_quote

My gripe here is not that we don't have large numbers of prominent characters voluntarily joining the Phyrexians or making deals with demons for immortality. That part is fine. And sure, it's /possible/ that the only methods of becoming immortal that are available in the Multiverse require questionable moral choices.

But we don't /know/ that that's the case, and we don't know that because apparently no one did the very Blue thing and proved the general case either way. And as long as the people of the Multiverse also don't know that, it would be nice to see at least some of them searching for morally acceptable and not-resource-hogging means of immortality. Or trying to prove whether or not such means can exist in the Multiverse.

And even if the Multiverse does turn out to be a No Ethical Immortality Allowed zone, surely there are other acts of transhumanist self-improvement that lack that problem. We've already covered why /recursive/ and /mental/ self-improvement are quietly prohibited, but there's no reason for modifying one's own body to necessarily be an immoral act or one only appealing to immoral people. Yet if we look at individuals who have visible, functional body mods (you know, the sort of thing that /turns up on card art/ and the like), we get Tezzeret (who is a terrible person, as previously discussed) and the less well-known Daretti (who indulges in things like [[http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/bloody-instructions-2016-08-17][premeditated murder and burning people's houses down]]) and effectively no one else that's not better covered by considering them as part of a group.

If we look at groups with that visible, physical self-improvement focus, they all have some sort of terrible fate and assimilation plot involvement. Esper has its etherium crisis and the Ethersworn. The Simic Combine went around sticking cytoplasts to people without their consent, and then proceeded to maim or kill them with Project Kraj. Phyrexians are, well, Phyrexians, and they consumed Mirrodin.

Why can't we have Kaladeshi inventors that wear their own work as augmentation, rather than decoration, while still being morally upstanding people? Or sane, stable Esperites that take up a White code of "everyone should have the choice to improve themselves" and express Black self-interest and sacrifice through making personal sacrifices (time and effort, functionality tradeoffs, other resources), making something of themselves in the purest sense without imposing their views on others? Or Simic biomancers selling cytoplasts from well-tested lines to the willing, provoking discussions about the stratification of society? (Phyrexians would lose much of their identity without their assimilation plot, so I'll leave them alone.)

In short, why no nice transhumanists anywhere?
