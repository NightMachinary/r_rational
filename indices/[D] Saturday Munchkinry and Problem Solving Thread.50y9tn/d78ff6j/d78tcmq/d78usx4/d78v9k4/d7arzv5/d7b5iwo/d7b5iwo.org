My first reaction to them was transhumanist indignation as well. Of course, the Consuls are supposed to be the bad guys of this arc, having hired the guy who killed Chandra's dad and also made Tezzeret a judge for some reason, so them allowing their energy grid to continue making existential nightmares seems entirely in-character.

Then I realized that the fact that I'm thinking about the Aetherborn so much makes them the most fascinating setpiece Wizards has penned in recent memory. The whole Eldrich horror beyond mortal ken thing we've had for the past two blocks is cool, but most of the ideas in that sphere have already been written by someone or another. Before that, we had a pretty normal time travel plot (with none of the rational trappings that might have come from that), before that we had random Greco-Roman gods being jackasses, etc etc. Nothing really exciting or unique.

But I've never read of anything like the Aetherborn before. Nothing I've ever seen before combines pretty much every fridge horror trope possible, from accidental creation of sapient life to randomly short lifespans. And it gets even better! The whole nonbinary thing makes complete and total sense because the Aetherborn aren't evolved beings and can't reproduce normally! They can't sleep because sleeping is a function of meatbrains needing downtime, and beings made of Aether don't have meatbrains!

Wizards actually thought about these things and created something totally unique that I didn't expect. And that's awesome!

I totally get your feelings about the portrayal of transhumanism, but let's take a look at this in context. In the Magic universe, the only known methods of immortality were developed by the Phyrexians (Squee), or require selling your soul to four different demons. Whereas in our universe it is entirely reasonable to expect that becoming immortal is entirely possible, it may well be harder in the Multiverse because reasons, and it may well be that the only methods of becoming immortal require questionable moral choices. If that is the case, the fact that nobody seems to be searching for immortality rituals might well be justified if we assume that all of them are evil or require too many resources a-la the white reanimation spells anyway.
