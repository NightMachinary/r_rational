You know that feeling when you have a word on the tip of your toungue, but can't remember it?

You have the ability to tell when people in a fifty meter radius are suffering from it, and can provide exactly the word they want.

Your goal is to directly cause* the deaths of between ten thousand and a hundred thousand people within the next six months. No more, no less.

*For the purposes of "directly cause" I mean that you take an action that someone else couldn't have taken, that leads, with your knowledge, to someone's death. So ordering a soldier to kill someone works.
