Dehydration, asphyxiation and starvation aren't generally considered injuries, so lock the man inside something air tight and wait for him to die. If you consider them injuries then it's time to drive someone to suicide, depending on his personality there are a few ways to do that, capture his closest friends and family, strap a bomb to them, tell him if he commits suicide you will release them and if he doesn't you will blow them up, if this doesn't work then blow them up, he might become suicidal, though that's not likely. If that doesn't work then torture him and provide the means to commit suicide, the torture should be pretty easy and horrific seeing as you don't need to worry about accidentally killing him.
