So, if you had The Magic Pudding, it would of course be easy to destabilise economies and so forth. But how far could you take it?

It apparently violates conservation of energy and momentum, but is there a way to turn it into an interstellar stardrive, for example?

Could you colonise Mars, or better yet, Venus? Or Pluto?

Note that the pudding's regeneration is not instantaneous, since it is possible to cut a slice of it; but it can be assumed to grow back essentially immediately once that slice is removed. Also, its composition can apparently be changed, although the limitations of this transformation are not made clear, since the only example was converting it from a steak-and-kidney pudding to a plum duff and back again.
