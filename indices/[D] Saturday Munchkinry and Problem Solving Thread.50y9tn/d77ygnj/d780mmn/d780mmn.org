I suggest hiring a plane and then teleporting clouds of water into a highly compressed sphere. Make the plane fly at a uniform speed so that your range changes every second, drag on the sphere by teleporting every millisecond.

It will take some time, therefore revert the sphere back into a cloud whenever you need to rest/refuel. Revert for the last time over some region with a drought. Let it rain.

You can make a profit by charging money, but that depends on your moral scale.

Edit: Compress many clouds in that sphere, it must be better than spraying water from airplanes.
