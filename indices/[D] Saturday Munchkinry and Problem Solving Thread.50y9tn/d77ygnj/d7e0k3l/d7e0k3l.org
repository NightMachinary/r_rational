Water molecules only? So, instant water purification is probably the best use.

By teleporting all the water molecules out of the bottom half of a glass of water, you could cause [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/6/][a small explosion]]. And I'm not quite sure what happens to a glass of sugar water if you just teleport out all the water, but I imagine you'll end up with either some sort of finely-ground, almost gaseous sugar, or a very flimsy, very fine sugar sculpture. (If you just teleport out the bottom half, the sugar presumable gets lost in the explosion).
