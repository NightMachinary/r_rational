Selectively killing cancer cells is really difficult because you can't see them and don't necessarily know where they are. Sure, you can see all the water molecules, but the hydration profiles of basically all living cells are more-or-less identical. You won't be able to tell one from another.

If you know exactly where a tumor is, you can teleport out the water...but then you have to deal with the fallout of mass cell apoptosis. Turns out, cell death releases toxic chemicals into the surrounding tissue which can cascade into more cell death. This is why surgeons actually remove tumors instead of, for instance, injecting them with localized poison.

Killing surface cysts should be doable, or at least draining them of excess fluid and allowing healing to begin, but I'm not sure about cysts deeper in the body. You will never have acne because you could safely exterminate bacteria on your skin, but depending upon how the power works this might require too much concentration.
