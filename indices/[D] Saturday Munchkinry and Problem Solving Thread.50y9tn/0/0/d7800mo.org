I could see this being used to cure cancer by selectively killing cancer cells. Not confident because that might require super multitasking. At the very least, you could use it to detect and kill cancerous looking clumps as soon as they start to form.

You could also dissolve atherosclerotic plagues, kill infectious cysts, etc. And your skin could always be hydrated, helping you maintain a youthful appearance / be comfortable. Maybe use skin conditioning tricks to make people feel suddenly comfortable whenever they enter your radius -- a nice thing to do, with possible operant conditioning implications. (Making them uncomfortable every time they do something you don't like would be the evil option.)

It should also be possible to use the teleportation as a cutting tool, since you can increase and decrease the size of a fine point. Creating a vibration at any frequency in just about any object would also possible, since everything has some water in it.
