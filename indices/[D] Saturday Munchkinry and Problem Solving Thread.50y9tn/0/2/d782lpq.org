  You can also teleport any water molecule to the general location of any other water molecule

Are there limits on the rate you can teleport at, or else the pressure you can teleport the water into? I'd look into buying a nozzle of some kind, and using it to power a long-range (>15 feet) cutting stream.

If you have good enough aiming, you can also create water explosions next to any object, and use that force to move it like normal telekinesis.

You may not have good cancer detection abilities (what does the water-profile of a tumor look like?) but you do have a good non-invasive surgery option in dehydrating and rehydrating selected tissues.

EDIT: I assume the teleportation is reactionless. Teleport the stream coming out of the cutting nozzle (or a different nozzle) back into the reservoir, and make a jetpack/rocket that you can refuel yourself.
