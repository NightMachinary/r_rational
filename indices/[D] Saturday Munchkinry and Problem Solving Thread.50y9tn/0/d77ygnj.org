- You have the power to detect every water molecule within about fifteen feet. You don't have Taylor's power of super-multitasking, so you're not really processing every detail you have access to; you can focus on something to get more detail on it (and less detail on other things), but if you don't, you'll only get as much detail as you can handle.
- You can also teleport any water molecule to the general location of any other water molecule, and, for the sake of actual usefulness, may do this en masse for large groupings of water molecules. For example, if there are two glasses of water in front of you, each half full, you can drain one and fill the other through teleportation. (I'll give you a freebie here and point out that you can kill people within your range by draining the water from their bodies into the surrounding moisture.)
- How to best make use of this power?
