If the energy of me enacting this power is less then the energy it can produce I'll use it to make a perpetual motion machine.

If I can make choices about the motion or of relative acceleration/momentum of the water molecules is preserved I can use this to maximize the power available. At minimum I might just get a job shunting steam back into a nuclear reactor so we get more turbine output for our water or something.
