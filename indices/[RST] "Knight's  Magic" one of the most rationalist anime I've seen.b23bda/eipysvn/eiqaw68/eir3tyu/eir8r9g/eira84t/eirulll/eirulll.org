Incidental semi-review (of the anime, having greatly enjoyed the manga): the (animation-and-otherwise) quality of each chapter-section is good, regarding which I have no complaints. Each episode has three chapter-sections, and Wikipedia suggests that there are 12 episodes total; I feel as though this unduly limits the total animated chapters (compared to if there were more episodes), but this could easily be the nocebo effect if considering the possibility of a further season or two in future.

Or, to change the phrasing: "Question: Is the anime closer to a collection of 'highlights' than to its ideal form?" "Answer: Even if it were, isn't a(n excellent quality!) selection of the chosen-as-best chapters an amazing thing in itself?"
