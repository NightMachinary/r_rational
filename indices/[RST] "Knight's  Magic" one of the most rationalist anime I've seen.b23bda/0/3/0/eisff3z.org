I haven't watched the anime, but read enough of the manga and novel to get the picture and have been informed that the anime is the same, so with that in mind;\\
If K&M is the most rational/rationalist anime you have ever seen, then you've practically not seen any anime.\\
To just list of a bunch of good shows that are without a doubt leagues ahead in rationality:\\
- Cowboy bebop\\
- Suisei no Gargantua\\
- The melancholy of Haruhi suzumia\\
- One punch man\\
- Stien's gate\\
- Mob Psyco 100\\
- the monogatari series\\
- Made in Abyss\\
- FLCL\\
- Code Geas\\
- No game no life\\
While shows that are arguably more rational would be pages long. But those I would strongly recommend watching if you haven't, and if you have curious to what you liked about K&M?
