You are right I screwed up the tags.

I had just read HPMOR again and this one reminded me of that very strongly. I agree that it is pretty anemic on the rational side, but the fact that it is there /at all/ rates it pretty highly. Maybe I just don't watch enough anime.

Honestly my goal was to start a conversation on it. I also added the condition "one of the most rationalist" on purpose, and I'm glad many people caught it. I was hoping people would try to one up me with better counter examples (so I could watch them).

And so far [[/u/Noumero]] has been the only one to have a potential better counter example.
