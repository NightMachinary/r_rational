Why not?

Anime is produced in Japan, by Japanese people, and their main audience are Japanese people too. Most of them know English well enough to recognize and read most common words, but not well enough to spot obvious grammatical or syntactical errors. Therefore, anime producers have a market incentive to include gratuitous English in titles/names/places where it would look cool, whereas the incentive to ensure that it's grammatically correct --- or, indeed, meaningful --- is comparatively weaker.

That given, there is absolutely no reason to expect anime creators to sanity-check their use of a foreign language with someone who actually speaks it before including it in their work.
