Ah, i meant (and assumed (wrongly i suppose) that you meant) rational, not rationalist. I agree with your statements, the characters and tropes are not one of rationalist shows. But I strongly disagree that they are not rational.

Those that i mentioned have some of the most internally consistent worlds, character and motivations out of most anime i have seen, -and personally i find this to be a bare minimum to be able to enjoy a rationalist show. (geas though i agree is at the bottom of the list by far, but is technically rationalist)
