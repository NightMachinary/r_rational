I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b23bda/rst_knights_magic_one_of_the_most_rationalist/eir96ty/][another post]] about what I found rational-esque-tropes about K&M. (I've only watched the anime).

Of the ones you've listed, that I've seen, I'll tell you why I disagree (all of this is spoilers for anyone else probably):

  Cowboy bebop

Maybe I am totally misunderstanding here, but this is a classic noir / detective / mystery-story at best. I don't see whats rational about this besides the characters not being total idiots.

  Suisei no Gargantua
#+end_quote

The main character doesn't really do anything to improve the situation of the people. Yes he uses his advanced technology to help them /directly/. But it's not like he is taking his other world knowledge to teach them how to build lasers or reactors or robots.

  The melancholy of Haruhi suzumia
#+end_quote

No clue how this has any rational tropes.

#+begin_quote
  Code Geas
#+end_quote

This one I would agree with as rational to an extent, especially because the main character is said to be smarter than the other people. But there isn't really any fair-play who-done-its, or like an ability to predict how he is going to munchkin things. The main character does smart stuff, but we can't really follow along with where things are going, or predict what he's going to do. There also isn't any genre awareness (like in K&M).

Like they tell us he's smart, but they don't show us how he solves impossible problems by letting us know why they should be impossible in the first place. They basically just make him smarter by fiat.

As a direct counter example, in K&M they figure out to use a key after someone steals a mech /once/. And the rationalist character sort of kicks himself for not thinking of it earlier. The entire multiple seasons of Code Geass involve people stealing mechs *multiple times* from the *same people*. Yes that one time he mind controls the person. But they do it multiple other times when it would be impossible for him to mind control people for the codes. Stealing mechs is a trope of mech anime (like every gundam origin story involves it) and one of the reasons K&M appears so rationalist to me is that they are very trope aware here.

As a broad counter example, Death Note does this /much/ better. It shows the situation and lets the main character think through his logic and solution. I would rank it as better than K&M, but I still feel like Death Note and K&M outclass everything on your list that I have I seen.
