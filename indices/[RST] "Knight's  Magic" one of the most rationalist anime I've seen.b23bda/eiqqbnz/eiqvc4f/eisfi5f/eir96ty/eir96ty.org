Deconstructing some of the rational(ist) things I enjoyed (that was a lot of show not tell):

- The gun type rod. Yes he has prior knowledge, but it's the obviously superior way to build something which must be aimed.
- Using rods to fly. He would have to think this one out, his prior knowledge is simply "flying is a useful tactical advantage". Figuring out how to do that within the magic system would be more interesting with more details, but we can see how he evolved the spell from the wind blast on the roof tops, and for propelling the dwarf.
- When the demons attack he isn't conflicted with bystander bias - this is also demonstrated earlier somewhat at his job - and while he has ulterior motives, it is borderline rational*ist*.
- When he points out that just because robots were designed after people to begin with they are just machines, tools, and we should add the functionality we need. Changing that kind of thinking in the people around him.

  - For example a couple episodes later, one of the people he is working with repeats his own wisdom back to him and finds the solution to a problem.

- (Elves Spoiler) When he learns the magic of creating the reactors, he works around the problems that limit it to elves only using the tools available to him. This is as close to a fair play munchkin puzzle as it gets from my memory, but it's at least there for like 5 minutes.
- (Edit) The first real villain and counter play with the villain is straight forward. She acts rationally, and he acts rationally in return.

  - Also the trope awareness of adding keys to the machines. Basically every mech anime involves people stealing other mechs multiple times over, and they only do it the once here.

Probably more that I forget, I only just re-watched the first two episodes the other night. It was only with the context of having re-read HPMOR recently that I even saw it as rational+ist+ at all. (Edit on re-watching more of it, I added some more thoughts).
