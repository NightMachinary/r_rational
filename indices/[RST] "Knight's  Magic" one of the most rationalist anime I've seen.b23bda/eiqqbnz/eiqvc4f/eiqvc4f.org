  Could be interesting to see which anime are considered rational by the community.

It's been a while since I watched [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest][/Zetsuen no Tempest/]], but if I recall correctly, it's the most rational one of those I've seen. Suffice to say that characters behave sensibly enough, not bound by their assigned story roles. Another interesting trope is a Good vs. Good conflict.

The highlight for me was (mild spoiler for Season 1) the final battle of Season 1, which consisted of four people standing on a hill and intensely arguing with each other about idiosyncratic magic mechanics.

Season 2 drops the ball a bit, though, but doesn't disappoint outright.
