  Could be interesting to see which anime are considered rational by the community.
#+end_quote

Some actually rational ones:

- Cowboy bebop\\
- Suisei no Gargantua\\
- The melancholy of Haruhi suzumia\\
- One punch man\\
- Mob Psyco 100

​

Not so strictly rational as the above but still close:\\
- the monogatari series\\
- Made in Abyss\\
- FLCL\\
- Code Geas\\
- No game no life\\
- Stien's gate

​

And most likely tones more I have just forgotten about since I watched them 4+ years ago or didn't personally enjoy enough to put on the list.
