Hum, rather than a succession of "it's rationalist", "it's not really", "maybe it's rational", "the original isn't"... maybe actual arguments for why it is or isn't this or that would be more constructive ?

I guess I'll try, since I'm currently watching it (ep9)

One thing is certain : it's not "rationalist".

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Characters from this story don't care much about being rational or not.

Now are they and the story rational ?\\
I suppose I can see how the main character could be seen as such : there is an apparent focus on him learning how things work and trying to deconstruct those to build new things never seen before. Though that attempt is very shallow and no amount of "how" is actually explained... especially how main character's original programming skills play any role in all this, aside from "magic is like programming, I'm a super programmer, therefore, I'm a super magician, poof" => well, thanks, I'm a programmer too, I would have liked to be able to relate to that part...

The story seems to be trying not to be too linear either, but again... shallow attempt, I'd say.

I personally find this anime quite nice and refreshing, but not very high on a rational-meter. (though probably higher than many others)

Could be interesting to see which anime are considered rational by the community.\\
Log Horizon is the first one that comes to my mind.
