You were right the first time. Rational/ist/ fiction sucks. I don't think the problem is intrinsic to the definition, just that the people producing it don't really know how at this point in time. As the amount of such fiction increases, we'll have larger sample sizes demonstrating what does and doesn't work, and the quality should rise naturally.
