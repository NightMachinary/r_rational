  I don't know what you are reading, but rationalism is not all about the scientific method, it is about overcoming the cognitive frailties inherent to human thought that lead to making mistakes.

I'll agree with you if you can explain how to define and find mistakes without references to scientific method.

  Furthermore, negative results in science are not a failure of the scientific method, they are valid outcomes of its successful application.
#+end_quote

I am pragmatic, so I have used words "success" and "failure" as substitutes for "made some progress to choosen objective" and "have to start from scratch" respectively.

  Just about all rationalist fiction requires that you buy into this premise, as much as fantasy requires you accept magic or science fiction demands you to accept FTL travel. Even if you don't agree, you can chalk that part up to the "fiction" side of things.

There is one significant difference between rationalist fiction and fanfasy - as postulated on sidebar of this sub "The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers".

Fanfasy don't tell me that I can shoot a bow as Legolas if I emulate him, while rational fiction does tell me that I can be as good as HPJEV if I study hard enough.
