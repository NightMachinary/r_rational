  No amount of studying can make me as good as HPJEV.

Harry lives in an easily exploitable world. Pull him out of it and into ours, and he doesn't perform as well. There aren't any fruit in our world hanging quite so low as partial transfiguration and puzzling out magical inheritance. We stand on the shoulders of giants, who took all the easy problems for themselves. Harry doesn't. Harry's insurmountable advantage is the world he lives in, not the skills he uses. But those skills, pulled out of that universe and into our own, still work. How do I know that? I know that because I use them myself. I know that because when Philip Tetlock checked to see what his superforcasters were doing right that everyone else was doing wrong, he found that they were using those skills. I know, in short, because I checked.

If you don't actually know what the skills I'm talking about are (or think I'm just talking about the scientific method, or something like that) read at least the first few essays of the Sequences, a series of essays by Yudkowsky, the guy who wrote HPMOR. You can find them [[https://www.readthesequences.com/][here.]] The preface, Biases: an Introduction, and maybe Feeling Rational would be especially useful and clarifying, I think.
