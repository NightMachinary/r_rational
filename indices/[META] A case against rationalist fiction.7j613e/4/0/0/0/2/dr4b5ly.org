You are kind of ignoring his arguments. You've repeated yourself a lot on this thread, so I'm not sure you're being entirely clear, as people keep saying the main things. HPJEV is a main character, of a story. Nobody can ever be as good as him, as we don't live in stories. We're meant to learn logical lessons from rational stories, yes, in the same way we're meant to learn emotional lessons from real stories. But in the same way no real person could be as perfectly good as Superman, or as incredibly determined as Naruto, no one can be as successful a rationalist as HPJEV; we don't live in a story. But that does not make the intended lessons about bravery, or goodness, or rational thinking any less valuable.

What you are asking for, essentially, is for rationalist fiction to be simulations, not stories, and I'm sure you can see how that isn't fair.
