I don't want to say that stories here don't have the aforementioned pitfalls. The authors aren't perfect, as you would expect from a community built on fanfiction and a web serials. However, based on your post, how deeply did you actually read anything recommended here?

HPMOR is an example of rational fiction. It's not the best, not in my personal top 5, but I'll try to reference it here.

  it shows only examples of successful applications of scientific method

We remember successes more clearly as failures. Of course creation of True Patronus and Partial Transfiguration was ridiculous. But HJPEV did fail in Comed-Tea, determining actual source of magic, understanding Philosopher's Stone, etc.

Lex Luthor from the Metropolitan Man did not completely succeed with understanding cryptonite and Superman.

#+begin_quote
  Portraying use of scientific method as rational course of actions. In reality for *almost* every goal there is more optimal course of actions - that's why we learn scientific method at the graduate level instead of kindergarten level.
#+end_quote

The scientific method is only intended to close gaps in your heuristics. How do you discover whether this is *almost* every goal?

#+begin_quote
  Treating results produced by application of scientific method as capable of changing persons mind. Global warming - enough said.
#+end_quote

Amelia Bones would be the best example here.

#+begin_quote
  emotions often treated as sideshow because they are perceived as not rational in rationalist fiction.
#+end_quote

Crowning moments of awesome of HPMOR - True Patronus, the final stand with something to protect - were completely emotion-based.
