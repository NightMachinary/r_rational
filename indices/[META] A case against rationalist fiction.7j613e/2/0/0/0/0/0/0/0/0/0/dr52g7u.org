  And if you don't like Harry Potter, Eragon, Sherlock and stories like them, then that is the main problem. You are holding rational fiction to standards better than that of popular fiction;

Rationalist fiction is a subset of rational fiction and rational fiction is all about avioding common pitfalls. So yes I expect stories which try to avoid common pitfalls be on average better then stories which don't.

  In rational fiction, we're not reading about normal people; we know we're reading about Alexander the Great/ Einstein analogues.

The difference is before Einstein invented his relativity, nobody including himself knew how great he is. So writing Einstein PoV as him working on relativity because he is a great Einstein and therefore he can do it, is a mistake because it leaks our a posteriori knowledge in Einstein a priori assumptions.

  So that, combined with the the fact that you didn't address what I actually said stories don't feature into actually solving the plot relevant problems enough for me to think the main criticism to be valid.

From HPMOR analysis "Mental-Social-Action are 80-56-29 vs 97-57-25." which give us total "Mental-Social-Action 177-113-54". I spent most of my life learning instead of fighting Dark Lord, and I don't have as high rate Mental/(Social+Action) as HPJEV.

  rational stories are often about the people who are going to make investigations that the rest of humanity wouldn't have been in right time and place, and the story is just showing how they got there

I don't mind reading stories about Einstein, what I do mind is reading biography of Einstein in which in every paragraph he asserts that he is Einstein and ergo destined to invent something.

There were a lot of scientist who became great not as scientist but as politician or as mentors or as whoever. So until the very end of Einstein biography I don't want to be sure that he will invent relativity or will mentor some 'Gauss' who would invent it or make a breakthrough in game theory and use it to win election in UN and bring about world peace.

That's actually the reason why I created this thread - I have run out of stories which meet my standards, while everybody here is gushing about how great these stories are.
