But in the fiction you named (barring the Wave's Arisen, which I don't like), barely any of the big moments come about via the scientific method. (HPMOR spoilers incoming: I don't how to do the black bar thing) Harry doesn't discover the True Patronus via the scientific method; it's an epiphany. He doesn't get through the entire Azkaban sequence by doing research, but by using stuff he already knows to solve a problem (the one guess he does take pays off, but even that was a pretty good point of tension because we knew he was guessing and even we weren't sure it would work). He doesn't kill the troll using science, but a rock, and he doesn't solve the Final Exam using science but rather, again, quick thinking using something he worked out how to do ages ago in the beginning of the story.

And in the Origin of Species, Red's trick for catching Abra comes after the complete failure of his seeming genius idea to try and find a way to measure the psychic potential of a certain pokemon-species-I'm-forgetting fails, so you can't really hold that against the author.

Sure, rational fiction talks a lot about using science to solve world problems, but that, as you said somewhere earlier, is how science works best. As a tool for solving world problems. I can't really think of very many big story moments where the main chacacter's of either of these fics (Origin of Species and HPMOR) where the main character actually solves a plot relevant issue through science.

Sure HPJEV argues using science, but he rarely actually decisively wins those arguments. He often fails to get through to Hermione using them (she tells him that he just doesn't understand, which he doesn't), Dumbledore usually just overrides him with wisdom, age, and experience, and the one time he manages to get through to Draco, Draco curses him and then later plots to overthrow him.

So I don't really understand why you feel the way you do, because the stories you've referenced (I'm ignoring the Waves Arisen cuz I don't like it) don't actually solve the actual story problems with science. They talk about trying to help the story's world with science, and maybe make a few inventions/make a few tricks (because that is what rational protagonists do), and then tend to solve problems via quick thinking or logic, not the scientific method.

And technically even then they use a variety of approaces. HPJEV defeats the troll via brute force, figures out a way to 'charm' the dementors, and invents his way out of Azkaban; none of that was research, but rather just one trick, and then a lot of quick thinking (and even the use of the trick was decently foreshadowed, and therefore in my eyes didn't feel like cheap storytelling). And Hermione winning her first battle by delegating and listening to her peers is another example of characters using different methods to win. It's just that making HPJEV a super clever, super charming, super strong guy would have made him a Mary Sue, so the author wen with super smart and made his lack of charm an actual character flaw examined in the fic.

And finally, to sum up, stories that have a lot more failures than success either use excessive use of montage like scenes, or aren't very fun to read. In Harry Potter, Harry faces one trial every year, and always wins. He only starts losing at the end of the series, and that is so he can win later. Eragon only loses one important fight, and then goes on to gloriously win all the others. Sherlock Holmes solves almost every mystery, etc... Nobody wants to slog through pages of failure, especially in a rational fic. Once the author introduces an interesting mystery, the audience doesn't want to have to go through chapter after chapter of failure; we want the character to come up with a plausible, nice souding theory as soon as possible, that can be revised as the story goes on. We want the character to win, so we can get our resolution.

Losing just isn't as fun to read.

Though if you want to read a very well written rational story about how being a gungho, strictly independent HPJEV style rationalist can go wrong, try reading Cordyceps: Too Clever For Their Own Good. I think it might be exactly what you're looking for :)
