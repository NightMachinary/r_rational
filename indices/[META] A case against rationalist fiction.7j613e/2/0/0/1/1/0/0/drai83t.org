You assume, I have intentions to convince somebody. That assumption is wrong. The only reasons I am here is to test my beliefs and possibly to hear some new ideas.

Unfortunately throwing at me examples of rationalist fiction which may contradict my points don't bring me closer to my objectives - because my points about rationalist fiction as a whole. So I have found an easy way to shut out discussion about isolated occurrences - quote at people numbers which seem objective. If people have something to say except citing counterexamples then they would get to the point, and if not then their opinion don't matter.
