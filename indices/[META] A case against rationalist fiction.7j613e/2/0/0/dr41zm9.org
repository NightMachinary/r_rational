*Obvious HPMOR Spoilers*

I have my own criticisms of HPMOR, but I do have to disagree with you here.

  Number of failures doesn't matter if it's dwarfed by number of successes.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/]["The final tally of Successes to Failures is 165-172."]]

You can take what you want from that analysis, or criticize it.

But Harry's mistakes in the scientific method aren't even /less spectacular/ than his successes in the scientific method. He discovered partial transfiguration, but he was standing on the shoulders of giants, the muggle scientists who gave him knowledge. He discovered an alternate version of the Patronus charm, but that relied on his values and his philosophy, not his mastery of science.

Harry's science skills -- as demonstrated in the story -- actually kind of suck. He knows a lot, but he's bad at discovering new knowledge via the experimental method, because he's not conscientious enough; he puts off scientific study into magic less than twenty or thirty chapters into the story, as soon as he realizes that figuring out the underlying mechanisms of magic is a Hard Problem.

"I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms! Clever shortcuts, that's all I'm about!"

Harry is picking low-hanging fruit, not solving hard problems of science.

  Again, emotions are the reason we do anything, not some fuel for you spells.

And Harry is one of the most emotional figures in the entire story, for all that he kind of pretends to be a straw Vulcan. On the interpersonal ground level, sure, he might be a robot. But he feels human emotions and acts on human motivations, including emotional motivations.

He doesn't fuel his Patronus with his emotions, like a character in a video game casting with an MP bar; he is only able to cast the Patronus and vanquish Dementors because that's the kind of thing he wants to begin with. His abilities are built on top of his motivations, rather than his motivations being incidental to his abilities.

He finds himself willing to tear apart the system of magic and/or the laws of physics as soon as Hermione is dead; not as a matter of status or of fulfilling any abstract ideas of his "potential" as a child prodigy, or because of belief in belief, but because he /genuinely grieves for her loss/ and because of his deep compassion for her. He finds himself able to face Voldemort because he has something he /wants/, not just something he /fears/; he has something to protect, and the narrative goes out of its way to explain that.
