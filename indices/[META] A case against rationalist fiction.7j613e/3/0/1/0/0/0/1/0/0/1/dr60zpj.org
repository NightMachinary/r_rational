  That's what rational protagonists do, they just start out with science if they don't already know how to solve the problem, which they often don't;

But in your described example real rational protagonists would start with asking experts on topic instead of trying to do science. And that's the problem - to make "doing science" viable strategy you have to make (effectively) impossible all more effective strategies.

Just like Rowling had to make adults incompetent to make canon!Harry Potter seem logical, ratinalist writers have to make a world that has a lot of problems which admit a solution by scientific method, lateral thinking or what have you. Which is bad because in real world we are unlikely to have either a lot of this incompetent adults or a lot of easily solved scientific problems that nobody solved before.

  I actually sat here for 5 minutes thinking of how to respond, because I know this point is wrong (not trying multiple strategies but that rational protagonists don't do so) but it's just so strange it veered into "not even wrong" territory.

There is nothing strange about it. What we are optimizing for in the story is the amount of suspence of disbelief needed. We can informally measure it by comparing samplings from probability distributions of some type of event in real world and in our story. So my complaints aren't about "you have done something wrong in your story" because there is always small chance that we just got very unlucky with samplings, instead my complaints are about "the way you are building worlds heavily biases probability distributions. Maybe we should find another way to build worlds which biases distribution less?"
