  Every genre has issues, and while I'd admit that, of course, rationalist fiction has some, saying that it should be abandoned in favor or a new, hybrid genre is a bit much.

The difference between rationalist fiction and any other genre is the audience consisting of rationalists (to one degree or another). If rationalists maintain their commitments to constant improvement then they should abandon rationalist fiction, and if they don't then they will not like rationalist fiction anyway.
