You're pointing out a trend and I'm giving evidence against that: my examples were to say that the probability of the scientific method being used is actually rather small, I just didn't want to say that without something backing it up. Otherwise we'd be in a "nu-uh" "uh-hu" argument.

 

If you want to make a statistical argument you need actual statistics; it's fine if they're qualitative...but it's hard to come up with something to compare a ratfic to in real life since people don't come across something that's entirely new like what happens in such fiction. So what region of science use is genre-breaking? Something like a 50% use of the scientific method would be weird, but what about 10% when you just found out that magic is real? Dungeon Keeper Ami doesn't break suspension of disbelief, and the use of science is way over that of a(n explicit) ratfic: that's because figuring out how magic works and exploiting it is literally how she survives in that world. It depends on context a lot, and comparing it to other fiction runs into the problem that writers rarely know game theory and optimal problem solving heuristics. I don't think a statistical argument can even be well-defined, unless you get really ridiculous results like an average of 50% science use for solving problems...and I find it very unlikely you would going by my memories of these stories ( I would be willing to bet on a poll of readers producing those results).

 

One experiment I could think of would be to get a sample of real people in the same demographic as a ratfic protagonist, play a role-playing game based on a ratfic to see how they solve the problem, then compare the probability of using given strategies in the ratfic to the probability of a real person using them. Of course I don't expect you to do that, it's way more effort than something like this deserves, but you see my point...since the probability distributions are so fuzzy you can say anything about them without evidence and no one can argue it without doing an experiment like that. You see the problem. The best we can do is measure how likely a protagonist is to use the scientific method to solve a problem (your original complaint, which I responded to) and see if that is "weird". I'm saying it's unlikely, which answers the original complaint of "it is too likely".
