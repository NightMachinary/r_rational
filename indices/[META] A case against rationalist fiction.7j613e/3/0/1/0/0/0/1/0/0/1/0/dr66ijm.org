Rational fiction has the protagonist using the best strategy they have available to solve a problem, that is what applied rationality /is/. A lot of the time ratfics are written about someone rational encountering the supernatural, since the scientific method is the best tool for investigating new things they use it a lot. But not always.

  But in your described example real rational protagonists would start with asking experts on topic instead of trying to do science.

That is often what happens. In Luminosity (the original, I haven't read the sequel) IIRC Bella never performs an experiment, the entire work is her finding out things from people who already know them and making plans [[#s][]]. In Moon's Apprentice the protagonist is acting on orders of someone else (spoilers, it's Luna), who gives them most of the information they make use of.

  my complaints are about "the way you are building worlds heavily biases probability distributions. Maybe we should find another way to build worlds which biases distribution less?"

That's not what I mean. People have given counterexamples to your points, they just aren't /true/. Ratfic protagonists /do/ use real-world methods of problem solving besides science, and favor them when applicable. That's the point: to solve problems better. HPJEV, which is the genre defining protagonist, used very little of the scientific method and only where applicable. I can count on one hand the amount of times he did hypothesis testing (wizard genetics, transfiguration, potions). You seem to be saying that ratfics are biased towards science working, and working well, but they really aren't- not to the degree where it is a valid complaint about a work of fiction. The science tends to (but not always) succeed when they /do/ use it, yes, but that's because no one wants to sit through a "science montage", and even then the rate of success is less than things protagonists try to do in other fiction. If you give any protagonist of a compelling story a realistic failure rate they would be dead a quarter of the way through the book. How would you "fix" it while still telling a good story and teaching rationality? I don't think there's any systemic fix you could ask for that would give you what you want without making the story suffer. The bias you complain about is smaller than the bias for the protagonist winning in other stories and the scientific method shows up rarely (outside of OoS anyway). Can you actually sit down and write out what you want to see? How would you change a popular rational story? What gave you the feeling science works too much and that people use it too much?
