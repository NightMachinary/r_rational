My point is that problems we face are highly heterogeneous. Some of them are best solved by face punching (school bullies), some of them more susceptible to charm (having a good date with partner of your choice), some make you use politics (earning a promotion in big corporation), etc...

Furthermore you don't know beforehand which type of the solution is the best. Which is why the rational course of actions is to try solve the problem by using several method one by one, gathering info with each attempt and constantly refining your approach.

In which case face punching becomes perfectly rational part of bigger rational strategy.
