1. It's the same as defending massively overpowered protagonists by saying that is not protagonist who overpowered it's just the whole world around protagonist which is underpowered. Replace "overpowered" by "rational" and "underpowered" by "irrational" and you get exactly your argument.

2. Okay, let me rephrase what I was trying to say:

(here and below "research" = "coming up with significantly more effective than previously known scientific solution to your problem", notice distinction between "research" and making some progress and publishing papers)

Doing research is hard. Doing research is freaking hard. Doing research is so hard that doing almost anything is easier. That's why any rational human being should try doing research only as the last resort solution to any given problem.

3.That's exactly why I don't like it - it's not analogous to real life in most circumstances.

4.No, you can't limit bias, all you can is to swap one bias for another and pray that new bias would affect your results less. For example for somebody believing in numerology double blind experiments may be more biased - because test and control group are numbered.
