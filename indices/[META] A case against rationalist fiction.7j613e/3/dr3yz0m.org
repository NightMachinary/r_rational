I will go down the criticism in order.

1. The scientific method is hardly omnipotent in these stories. In fact, the success rate of the characters in rationalist fiction is pretty reasonable relative to the average, largely because of the power of their adversaries. For example, HPMOR!Voldemort is several times more powerful than Canon!Voldemort, and many many times as dangerous. HPMOR!Harry might be more powerful as well, but Canon!Voldemort is incapable of arranging for the death of a single teenager, even when no one in canon takes even nominal precautions against the thousands of possible modes of attack.

2. Characters in rationalist fiction typically use the informal, generalized scientific method, essentially relying on two principles: test your ideas, and base your plans on what you expect reality to look like when you check. This is too generalized to be specifically optimal, but it is almost never net-negative. If you don't know the particular optimal strategy, it can stand in.

3. Actually, the lack of general acceptance and use of science and rationality is frequently used as comparative advantage. To use HPMOR again, (because it is the quintessential example) Harry frequently wins because his opponents fail to think for even a moment or two.

4. This one is just plain false. Under the HPMOR understanding of rationality, it is merely a set of tools. You use it if you have an interest in winning. The nature of that interest is orthogonal to the use of rationality. Lex Luthor in the Metropolitan Man seeks to kill an omnipotent superbeing, Bella in Luminosity/Radiance seeks to become one.

5. That is totally separate from my experience. I have found that seeing beliefs as models of expectation that respond to evidence has let me avoid many mistakes, and also to deduce what I actually think is true.
