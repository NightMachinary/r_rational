*WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU REALLY ON, YOU RAT?*

Yeah, but both are pretty terrible at convincing people anyway. You convince people to change their minds through empathy and rhetoric (aka pressing the hidden levels of their soul), not by going "THESE ARE THE 46 REASONS I'M RIGHT".

In the end, the best way to convince someone of X is to go "/ingroup thing ingroup thing/ by the way I think that X /ingroup thing ingroup thing/". (And then you go muahahah, I've infiltrated your ingroup! Now you're treating me with respect like I'm a human being with actual opinions! You fools!)

The problem with these numbers is that they're meant to be taken seriously; they're not really meant to be part of a dialog, they're meant to act as undeniable evidence to people who will never accept it.
