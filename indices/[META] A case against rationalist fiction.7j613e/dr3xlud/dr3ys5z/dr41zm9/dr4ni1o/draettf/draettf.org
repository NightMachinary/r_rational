I do agree that treating these numbers seriously is wrong, but in absence of more thorough analysis (possibly of more than one work of rationalist fiction) the only alternative is cherry picking counterexamples. And cherry picking counterexamples is even worse at convincing anybody because everyone and their dog has favorite counterexample.
