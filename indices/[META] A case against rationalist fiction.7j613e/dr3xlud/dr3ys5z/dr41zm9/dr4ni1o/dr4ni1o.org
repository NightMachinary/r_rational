  "The final tally of Successes to Failures is 165-172."

All the other criticisms I've raised against this analysis aside (and oh boy was that a fun evening), it's kind of ridiculous to just whip out figures like that like they mean anything to the people reading them. They're only good for convincing somebody already convinced.

Saying "this character isn't overly successful, he has more failure than successes!" is like saying "this character isn't overpowered, if you count the number of shots she fires and the number of shots she lands, she only has a 38% accuracy rate! Here's a link to a spreadsheet of every time she shoots at something and hits/misses." These numbers don't mean anything without the context.
