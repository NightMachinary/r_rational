if anybody had this kind of success rate in research, they would be living the kind of life that would actually be interesting to read about; in the essence they would be a rational protagonist in real life. It's like how action heroes tend to win almost every fight they're in, while in real life most people only win about half or less, and the ones who win more end up getting audiences paying tons of money to watch them fight.

Of course Harry in HPMOR has such a high success; he's the main character. I respect all of your other points, but this is the one I must singularily disagree with; main characters win. They win often. In almost every story main characters win more than they lose, whether they're fighting with swords or bows or, in rational stories, their wit; and this is because rationalist stories are still stories, and winning is a lot more entertaining to read about than losing. Rational stories aren't about realistic depictions of success rates, but rather realistic depictions of logic. How likely it is for a person to actually be so successful so often is irrelevant; all that matters is that the thinking that leads to that success isn't magical, but proper.

Personally I would like a shonen character's success rates in fights, or a classic con-man/charming dude movie characters success rate in conversations. But I'm not the main character of a story, so I don't have it, and attacking rational fiction for that kind of thing feels less like an attack on rational fiction, and more like an attack on main characters in general.
