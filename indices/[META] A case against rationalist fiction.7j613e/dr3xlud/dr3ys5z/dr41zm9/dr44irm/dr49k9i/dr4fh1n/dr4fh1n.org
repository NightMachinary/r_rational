  I respect all of your other points, but this is the one I must singularily disagree with; main characters win.

I am not against winning per se, I am against solving all problems by successful dice roll on "invent something to solve the problem".

It would be a lot better if for each goal protagonists have made multiple attempts - some using brute strenght, some on charming your way in, some trying to invent something to solve the problem. Then despite overall success there would be a lot more failures than successes, and nobody would feel like all world problem are solvable using science.
