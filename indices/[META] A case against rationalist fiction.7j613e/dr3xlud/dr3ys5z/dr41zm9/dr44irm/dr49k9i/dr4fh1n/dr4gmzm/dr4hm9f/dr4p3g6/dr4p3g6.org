But a lot of rational characters (like HPJEV, who I keep coming back to) do spend a whole lot of time thinking about how to influence people, and when they do try and to do proper research they often fail.

And if you don't like Harry Potter, Eragon, Sherlock and stories like them, then that is the main problem. You are holding rational fiction to standards better than that of popular fiction; and that is a very high bar for most web-serial/fanfic authors to clear.

And about the science thing; rational stories are usually about the people who are destined to be in the right place and the right time for their research to be better than the rest of humanity. In rational fiction, we're not reading about normal people; we know we're reading about Alexander the Great/ Einstein analogues. For example, in Origin of Species, we know that Red, eventually, is going to be in right place and the right time to make a groundbreaking discovery about Pokemon; it is literally his intended goal from the beginning of the story. And he is also training to be a Professor, so him using the scientific makes perfect sense; he gets valuable work experience out of it, even if he fails (which he does), and we had to have enough prior proof of his skill in the area for the main payoff of his plot-line (the big discovery he'll eventually make) doesn't feel like a cop-out. Both from the perspective of the narrative, and for characterization, showing Red using the scientific method/studying it makes sense.

So that, combined with the the fact that you didn't address what I actually said about how rational protagonists often solve problems in my earlier post, means I still don't quite understand the science complaint. Yes, all rationalist protagonists love science, and their monologues on the topic can be a bit grating; your criticism there is valid. But it doesn't feature into actually solving the plot relevant problems enough for me to think the main criticism to be valid.

TLDR: Rational protagonists don't just use science to solve problems; rational stories are often about the people who are going to make investigations that the rest of humanity wouldn't have been in right time and place, and the story is just showing how they got there; and if you try to holder rational fiction (which is mostly written by fanfic authors and web serialists) to a higher standard than popular fiction writers, then I don't think you are ever going to find more than one or two stories you actually like on the internet.

And as for Mother of Learning... the slow pace is actually one of the reasons I stopped reading. It's a pretty big story, and after all of this I can see why you would like it, but it does have it's own flaws that it gathers from it's approach to revealing the story; mainly that a lot of the chapters are 'training-montage' style that, after a while, I stopped wanting to read.
