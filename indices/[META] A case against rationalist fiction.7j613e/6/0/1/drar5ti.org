[[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/][Need to Become Stronger]] has useful advice for planning, like "keep it simple" and "plan for the worst". Not too complex, but that sort of thing is the closest to universally applicable advice there is. The point of HPMoR seemed to be rationality techniques based around getting a more accurate view of the world, not problem solving, since it's aimed towards a more general audience who aren't familiar with rationality (or empiricism, technically). If you want a manual it's probably best to buy a book on problem solving instead of reading fan-fiction.

Maybe you've just reached the limit of what heuristics can do for you and all that's left is to get experience in planning? The sorts of questions you asked have no general answer that applies to every situation, besides "what you expect to be most useful". You are asking for a miracle, basically.
