No. My objection is that in rationalist stories protagonist /just happens/ to have such convenient objectives which allow for use of "rational course of actions".

In other words, It's okay, that I don't have magic like HPJEV has. But it's not okay that life of HPJEV mostly consists of of logical riddles, and mine life doesn't.
