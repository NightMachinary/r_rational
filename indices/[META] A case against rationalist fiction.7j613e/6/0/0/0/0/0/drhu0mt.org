  Saying that the protagonist "just happens to have such convenient objectives which allow for use of 'rational course of actions'" is missing the point -- whatever your objective is, there is an optimal set of actions to achieve that objective.

No. Even in the simple cases there may be no such thing. To give concrete example - we never know the right proportion of resources which should go to research new ways of doing things as opposed to funneling resources toward the best currently known way to do things. Which is also known as exploration/exploitation trade-off.

The more relevant to genre example is sampling bias. Suppose you are HPJEV, who have just met Draco. Confronted with his dubious ideas of pureblood superiority you now face a choice - either try to make him see things your way(1), or write him off as unredeemable(2).

1. In one timeline you try to persuade him, and in the end you succeed, you feel vindicated in your decision.

2. In other timeline you, instead of investing your time in self important snobs, you prepare to fight Voldemort, and after finding out that Draco have sided with him, you feel vindicated in your decision.

So which decision was more optimal, and how can you know it beforehand if you are not in timeloop?
