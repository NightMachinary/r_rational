  EDIT2 Okay guys, you win. eddyekko has made a good enough point in defense of "science works!" fiat that I'll have to reconsider some of my views on rationalist fiction. Kudos to him.

Wow. That is fantastic -- very few people are willing to be convinced of anything, so kudos.

I'm obviously late to the party, but I would like to add a couple of points to the debate for potential future readers:

First, I think it's important to define 'science' and 'scientific method' up front. Rationalist stories generally use an informal definition of the 'scientific method' that is simply "Make a hypothesis about how the world works, then test it." (Note that "testing your hypothesis" might mean asking an expert instead of doing an experiment.) That's a thing that works for everyone, reader and character alike. I don't remember ever seeing a rational/ist work that showed the more formal process of science that involves double-blind randomized studies and statistical analysis. If you're using the formal definition then I absolutely agree with your point that "In reality for almost every goal there is a more optimal course of actions [than using the formal scientific method that involves double-blind randomized studies and statistical analysis]." I don't see how you can debate that the /informal/ definition is non-optimal since the only alternatives are magical thinking and purely random behavior.

Second, anthropic principle applies to essentially every story, rational/ist or not. Biographies aren't written about Joe Sixpack, they're written about Albert Einstein and Muhammed Ali; likewise, fiction isn't written about TvWatcherGuy, it's written about someone who has an interesting idea and runs with it, or an unusual ability and uses it, or an unusual and funny set of circumstances, etc. If you ding rationalist stories because the hero is above average then you would need to ding every story in every genre. The way I think of it is that that every story gets one Suspension of Disbelief token to spend on its premise and must be judged by what comes after that. The token might be spent on "there is a galactic civilization linked by FTL drives that violate our current understanding of physics" and then you would judge the story on how well it worked within that frame.
