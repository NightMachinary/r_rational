I am not talking about going after heroes specifically. I am talking about some drunks who thought that molesting woman are good idea and one of whose had gun when they were interrupted by hero. I am talking about gangs scuffles when some gang member just firing in general direction when one of the bullets by chance hit one of the capes.

Fight and violence in general is kind of random, and you are not much safer if opposing side doesn't actively try to kill you.
