Number of guns in 2009 was around 300 millions [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country][link]], population of USA is about 325 millions.

Considering that number of high profile dangerous psychos is a lot higher in Earth Bet I expect number of guns per capita to raise compared to our world.
