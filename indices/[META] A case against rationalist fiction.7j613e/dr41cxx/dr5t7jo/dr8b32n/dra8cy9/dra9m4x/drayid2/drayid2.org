The same is true of mundane police in our world, and their life span is considerably longer than five years. Yes, mundane police usually wear body armor, but that can't save them from head shots or arterial wounds. Most capes, on the other hand, are even less likely to be hit by bullets both because of their abilities and because, much like in the real world, everyone knows what happens to you when you kill an officer of the law. It's fast, it's brutal, and for better or worse it's usually extrajudicial.

I don't know how far you got, but there's also the factor of the Unwritten Rules, which more or less dicatate what capes as a whole will tolerate. If your organization starts going around killing cops and capes, you will get jumped on by /everyone,/ including other villains. Mundane folks in gangs who kill heroic capes are often killed by their own gangs because their leaders know what will happen to them if they tolerate that behavior. This also happens in real life: there's a basic agreement among the gangs in Chicago that anyone who fires upon ambulances or fire gets hunted down, and anyone who starts deliberately gunning for cops (as opposed to shooting to escape from them) also gets taken out. In the real world, every cop killing becomes big news. How often do you actually hear about it happening?

Anyway, cape attrition is quite high, mostly because capes are usually fighting other capes who often want to kill them. The average lifespan of a villain is said to be around 2 years I believe. Heroes last a good while longer due to more support, but their average is 5-10 years IIRC.
