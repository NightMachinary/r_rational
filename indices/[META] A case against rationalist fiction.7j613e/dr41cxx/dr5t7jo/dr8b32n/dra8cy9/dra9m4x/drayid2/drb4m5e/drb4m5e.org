I am not talking about intentionally go out and killing heroes. But every time hero interrupt robbery he runs a risk of perpetrator having a gun and willing to use it. Every time any of capes get involved in gang scuffle, he runs risk of getting shot dead - because in confusion of conflict everybody just firing in general direction.

My point is that nobody would specifically hunt heroes - but for heroes any fight involving normals with guns is dangerous. And considering that we are talking about America a lot of people has guns.
