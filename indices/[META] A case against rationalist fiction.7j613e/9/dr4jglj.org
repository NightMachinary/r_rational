Her my take on it:

#+begin_quote
  Abuse of author fiat. As rationalist fiction promotes scientific method, it shows only examples of successul applications of scientific method.
#+end_quote

That is quality of bad fiction, no correlation with "rational" here. Put any plot device instead of "rationality" here, like "all conquerig love" or faith, or patriotism, the effect is the same. Is average quality of "rational" fiction is below average? Depend on sampling. If you compare to greatest masterworks of literature then yes. If you compare to average web/fan fiction then no.

#+begin_quote
  Portraying use of scientific method as rational course of actions. In reality for almost every goal there is more optimal course of actions
#+end_quote

Rational is /definition/ of optimal course of action. This statement is oximoron. Of cause optimal course of action is probailistic, not deterministic, so it often fail due to pure chance. PS Assuming other people are rational is /not/ rational.

#+begin_quote
  Treating results produced by application of scientific method as capable of changing persons mind. Global warming - enogh said.
#+end_quote

I don't quite understand what OP want to say here. Anything capable of changing persons mind, scientific method including. Is explanation or promotion of scientific method efficient for propaganda porpose? No. But any truth/sincerity is not efficient for propaganda. Is /appication/ of scientific method efficient for propaganda? Yes. Rational propaganda against global warming would be something like "God Hate Global Warming and all who deny it go to Hell". But that would create a host of other problems.

#+begin_quote
  Downplaying role of emotions.
#+end_quote

Again quality of bad fiction. Not related specifically to rationality
