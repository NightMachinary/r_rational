That since Naruto's chakra construct for /his/ version of the Rasengan happens to be a cyclone (which is homeomorphic to a Torus) that one can fit all 7 chakra natures into his Rasengan due to the 7 color theorem (the version of the 4 color theorem on a donut). Something which he is able to even attempt do via a deus ex machina at that point in the climax.

It is obviously clear that a large portion of the mechanics up until this point fell into place simply so that this little fact can be applied in a meaningful way. This feels extremely forced and relies on too many implausible coincidences piling up.
