It's a bit more nuanced than that. The United States has a culture of unwritten rules that prevents both villains and heroes from causing too much collateral damage, both to conserve their numbers to deal with S-class threats like Endbringers, and to limit collateral damage. This doesn't completely work, as both groups tend to escalate when one side wins too many times, leading to a chain reaction of chaos. It's not explicitly mentioned, but a couple of years before the beginning of Worm, there were instances of people using guns on capes. But those ended up going poorly for the gunmen, with many groups using lethal force to take them out. The result is that both Villains and Heroes attempt to preserve the status quo, until something major happens that sets off a chain reaction (like a prominent member of the ABB getting arrested, for example). It is also worth pointing out that public sentiment regarding capes is discussed and dealt with. The PRT director in charge of brockton bay discussed at length about how her priority is to limit collateral damage and to prevent the teenage superheroes from turning the public against them.
