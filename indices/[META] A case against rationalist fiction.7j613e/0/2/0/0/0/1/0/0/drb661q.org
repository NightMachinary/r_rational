Theres a bit of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/31q3ht/worm_whats_the_unwritten_rules_say_about_packing/cq4dmnw/][WoG]] that expands on guns specifically. Although that was mostly towards *capes* packing heat, this also presumably applies to most gangs. With regards to firearms held by normals, I feel like it isn't too much of a stretch to presume that most people who aren't part of the government, or villains in their own right (gangs/capes) won't really have access to them. It is true that capes tend to live violent lives, although their careers are extended somewhat by both the support they get from joining the PRT, and the existence of superpowered healers.
