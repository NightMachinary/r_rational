It's not about statistics which unreliable narrator can distort. It's about systemic wrongness of picture WoG draws.

Every time some hero go out to make arrest he runs small but real chance that he would be just shot dead. Considering that heroes go out a lot, I guesstimate life expectancy of any non-brute non-precog is about 5 years. Which mean that most capes have to treat normal as legitimate danger i.e. by killing those who try to kill them. Which would cause public sentiment to turn strongly against all capes - because they are butchering population (any normal sympathies with another normal - even criminal - more than with cape)
