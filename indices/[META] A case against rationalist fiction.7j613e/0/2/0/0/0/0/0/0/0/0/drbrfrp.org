They aren't going to send capes who are vulnerable to bullets into situations where there are going to be bullets. They'll send Armsmaster, who has armor, or Aegis, whose body is infinitely redundant, or Velocity, who can dodge them, instead.

In the bank robbery, they sent the Wards because the PRT already knew the Undersiders' MO. People who only do larceny and don't do drugs or take territory have no reason to branch out into murder because that would make them a target. While the Empire and ABB existed and were recruiting from their high schools, going after some glorified thieves was not a smart allocation of resources, they knew this, and they knew Tattletale knew this. Whether they won or lost, they knew the Wards were coming back only with injuries they could survive.

Similarly, if we know there are going to be armed people willing to kill at a location, we send in SWAT in the real world. We don't deliberately send normal beat cops into situations which will be dangerous unless there is no other choice. In the Wormverse, they only send parahumans in when there are parahumans on scene. We never see them, because it's a story about capes, but normal police do exist and do all their normal stuff. Capes largely aren't used for crowd control both because of the dangers you describe and because using capes as riot police would quickly sour public perception of capes. This directly counters the mission of the Protectorate.

So I'm still not sure what the problem is here. A significant fraction of capes are more or less immune to bullets. Brute powers are the most common. When there are going to be bullets, they send in the bulletproof people. When they need battlefield control, they have the squishy Vistas stand behind the bulletproof people. They have Thinkers and tactitcians stand far away from the action watching through screens. Tinkers either support their teams or make themselves bulletproof and wade into the action.

Capes do still die to random normals. It's mostly off screen because that's not what the story is about, but it absolutely happens. However, the biggest threat to any cape is other capes because the Protectorate sets things up so that capes are usually on both sides of any cape fight and because they use their resources intelligently. Protectorate heroes don't usually get shot by normals because the Protectorate sets things up to minimize that. No Path to Victory necessary.
