The same is true of cops in the real world, who are statistically far more vulnerable and don't have access to superpowered healing abilities. Police attrition varies by location, but there is nowhere in this country where the average lifespan of a cop is five years. Add in the fact that some large percentage of handgun shots are survivable in the real world, ignoring the various regeneration and healing abilities of the Wormverse, and I'm not sure why you think parahuman attrition to baseline humans in particular should be so high.
