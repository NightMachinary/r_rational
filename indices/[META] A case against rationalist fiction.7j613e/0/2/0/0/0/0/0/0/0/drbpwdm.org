The difference between heroes and police is that most capes are glass canons. It doesn't make sense to send several heroes to apprehend couple of robbers with guns because heroes already streatched thin, while police tends to show up in force in bad neighbourhoods.

Another difference is that the most effective tactic to not get arrested by police is to run away because most cops aren't all that fit. But normals almost never can outrun capes, so the only option against capes is to make them cautious to slow them down. Guns is the only way to credibly threaten capes and most people aren't good enough shooters to make shots threatening and miss at the same time, so the conclusion seems obvious - a lot of accidently dead capes.
