In Worm, you're following the story of someone who is Required. That is, the only way for things to turn out the way they do in the end is for Taylor, at the very least, to still exist. As a result, she does have some degree of plot armor.

However, she also has literal, real armor, which is shown to be bulletproof. So that helps. Since she outfits her friends with it, that explains how none of them get shot.

However, in the wider world it is very clear that parahumans dying to baseline humans absolutely does happen. I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to tell you that the very first parahuman to die was brained by a normal wielding a baseball bat. It mostly happens off screen, for sure, but that's part of why Worm is awesome. The entire world is fully fleshed out behind the scenes, and you see that with all the things just barely hinted at by our unreliable narrator.

Badass normals have a big role to play in the story at various points. If that was your big sticking point, then I would encourage you to keep reading.
