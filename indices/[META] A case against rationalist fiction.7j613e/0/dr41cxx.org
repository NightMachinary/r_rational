I'd just like to start by saying that, even though I like rational fiction, I too find Waves Arisen a bit... much; so I accept your criticisms of that one. Waves Arisen is a fic that makes rationality look a bit too overpowered.

As for the others... in HPMOR emotions do get to be very important at the latter end of the story. In fact the main difference between HPMOR!Harry and HPMOR!Voldie is emotions, and empathy and that is shown and talked about. Even Voldie (the most stereotypically rational! character in the fic) admits that his actions, which drove the whole plot, don't really stem from any rational kind of reasoning, but were entirely emotional; he was just bored. And Harry spends a lot of time in emotional distress and thinking about why people feel the way they do.

And in Origin of Species, Red's psychic powers are literally semi-crippled because of his emotions; it is one of the first stories I've seen that show grief as something you can't just magically 'get over', but rather something that has to be processed. So though it is a bit light on the emotional side, it does still do them justice.

And in most rational fiction, the scientific method is usually summarized as: Test your ideas, and make plans based on what you actually think reality looks like. And while there are usually better ways of conducting business in real life (such as just asking experts), in rational fiction these experts don't really exist or there are other reasons for not doing that.

In HPMOR magic is full of blindspots, of which nobody Harry can access has knowledge of. In that scenario testing his own ideas actually is pretty optimal; and yet even so one of the early scenes people tend to forget about is Hermione berating Harry for thinking that he could make an original discovery so fast/for ignoring books and thinking he was smarter than the entire Wizarding World. In The Origin of Species Red is training to be a Professor; for him applying the scientific method is optimally rational, as it also provides him valuable experience. And even then Red does call Professor Oak for help fairly often.

And furthermore, HPMOR is full of Harry failing to persuade people using results gained via the Scientific Method. His inability to understand why people don't just change their minds when he presents evidence is one of his most grating character flaws (and one of most cited reasons I've seen for why people hate the fic). Some of Harry's best, most emotional moments in HPMOR is when the scientific arguments aren't working and he just doesn't get why.

And as for the reason that the magnitude of successes outweigh the many failures... it's simple. Rational fiction is fiction. It's not about realistic-abled people trying to solve things rationally. It's about geniuses trying to change the world with nothing but their wits and whatever advantages the setting gives them. In rational fiction we are never reading about some random dude; we're always reading about the equivalents of Alexander the Great and Einstein. And in the same way Einstein failing an university exam and then going on to invent General Relativity isn't bad, Harry messing up in early trials and then inventing his own spells isn't bad either. Rational fiction has to be entertaining, it needs Crowning Moments of Awesome; no one reads fics titled Rational! to not see rationality work.

So yes, rational fiction can be boring in the same any other genre can be boring. The moment the detective gets that 'Look in his Eye'; bam! I know that there's about to be a case solving montage. The moment the shonen anime character struggles to their feet for one final attack; boom! I know they're about to win. And so when a rational character starts trying to learn something new about the world, I know that it's most likely going to work. The fun is supposed to be in seeing where this new world-building info takes us, and trying to predict how it might affect the plot going on.

In my opinion, the best rational stories should be mysteries/conspiracy stories; half the fun of HPMOR is trying to figure out the stuff Harry doesn't know and doesn't really learn until he's told (like the Weasley Twin's Prank). A good conspiracy/mystery could actually justify all the conceits of rational fiction (a lack of abliity to ask for help/the need to collect and analyze information personally, the need for tendecy for rationality to work being made enjoyable by the unraveling of mysteries, the importance of emotions being shown via motives, etc...) and personally I find it a shame that there aren't more rational mystery stories.

But there is one; try reading Cordiceps. It doesn't ignore the importance of emotions, in it the scientific/rational method isn't always the best way, AND the mystery is interesting. It's a rationalist!story which shows how being a hardcore gungho rationalist! isn't always the best course of action, and I think it's exactly what you're looking for.

TLDR: Try reading Cordiceps, it's a good rationalist story that tends to avoid most of the pitfalls you've outlined here.
