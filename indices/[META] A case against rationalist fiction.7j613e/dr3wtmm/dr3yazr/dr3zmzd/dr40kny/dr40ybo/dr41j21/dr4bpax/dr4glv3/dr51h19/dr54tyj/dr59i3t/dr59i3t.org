HPMOR /is/ set a few centuries ago, that's the point! Not chronologically, but culturally and technologically. The reason we don't tend to like overpowered protagonists is because they are narratively unsatisfying; any conflicts with them are boring and one-sided. This is not the case with HPMOR or with most rationalist fiction in my experience.

I think the core of your argument is that rationalist fiction claims to demonstrate techniques which can be applied to real life and you don't believe this claim is true.

If that's your belief, then you are wrong. The techniques Harry uses are applicable in real life, which I know because I myself have had great success in applying them! Knowing not to reject uncomfortable truths, not to throw up mental stop signs when a line of inquiry looks worrying, to make your beliefs pay rent, to investigate confusing phenomena with a scientific approach, /these/ techniques HPMOR demonstrates quite well and they have proven to be exceedingly valuable to me.

If that isn't enough for you, then what are you expecting? Our world doesn't contain magic to exploit and if it did it would probably already be well exploited.

This brings me to what I think is the very center of the debate: rationalist fiction often contains settings with large amounts of free energy which the protagonists exploit. What is unrealistic about rationalist works is that the free energy exists in the first place (which is why most rationalist works are fanfics to provide a measure of credibility).

The appeal of rationalist works is watching that free energy be exploited by a reasonably intelligent protagonist and usually antagonist as well. It's fun to see lots of free energy get gobbled up in one go and if it is written well it will demonstrate how /we/ might best find and consume the much smaller specks of free energy in the real world.

It does not literally promise that we will find huge troves of free energy any more than canon Harry Potter promises that if we're lucky our 11th birthday will be interrupted by a letter from Hogwarts.
