I agree with [[/u/Subrosian_Smithy][u/Subrosian_Smithy]]. Techniques are valid, it's correct to use them in contexts similar to those in rationalist stories to be more effective, but it doesn't mean you would come across situations where their use is /as/ effective as in rationalist stories. You can become as good at using rationality as HJPEV, but you won't magically come across an exploitable magical system because of it, just as you're unlikely to encounter your Moriarty if you become as good as Sherlock Holmes.

Rationalist stories optimize for showing off rationality, real life doesn't.
