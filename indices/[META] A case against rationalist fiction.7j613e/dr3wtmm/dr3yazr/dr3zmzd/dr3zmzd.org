I think you need to make that more explicit, then. There has been some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5jvd89/d_outsider_viewpoint_why_rational_fiction_is/][unpleasant incidents]] with people picking a strawman's definition of "rational fiction", then accusing all works in the genre of being inherently bad because of it. Ironically, your post as it is now may receive an irrational kneejerk-negative reaction because of it. I advice putting it in bold,

...letters at the beginning.

That said, your complaints are sort-of circular then. Rationalist fiction shows successful use of scientific method? /Of course/, it's the entire point: rationalist fiction is fiction /about/ successful use of scientific method/explicit rationality techniques, just as detective novels are about successfully solving mysteries, or superhero stories about successful superheroing.

The rest follows: rationalist fiction is likely to have a protagonist who would (even if it's cost-ineffective from some "objective" perspective) strive to use scientific method personally, and likely to have characters who would believe the results acquired this way.

Emotions... I don't think /Origin of Species/ or /HPMoR/ downplay them that much. Even if it seems this way, see previous point: from rationalist fiction's definition follows that it's likely to have protagonists who would suppress or put aside their emotions.
