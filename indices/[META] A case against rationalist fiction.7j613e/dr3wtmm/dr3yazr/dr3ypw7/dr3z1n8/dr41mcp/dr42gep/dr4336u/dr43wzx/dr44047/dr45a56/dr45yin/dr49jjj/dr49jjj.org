(*) "The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers"

If you interpret (*) as "you can replicate techniques but not results" then this should not be definition of rationalist fiction - because I can replicate techniques from Sherlock Holmes without results too. And nobody think that Sherlock Holmes is rationalist.

If you interpret (*) as "you can replicate techniques and slightly degraded results" then it's just not true - because no amount of studying would allow me to replicate successes of HPJEV.
