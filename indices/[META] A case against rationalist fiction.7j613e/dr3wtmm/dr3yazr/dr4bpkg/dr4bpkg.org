  origin of species
#+end_quote

i'll defend rationalist fiction with this one as my example then. certainly it's gonna be more specific than your complaints, but i dont think any of your complaints /really/ apply to it. you can argue about whether it's the exception or the rule, but...if only 2 out of 3 are subject to your complaints, that'd be a crappy rule

  scientific method overused and treated as an automatic win
#+end_quote

a huge sub-plot of origin of species is that not only is red trying to be a scientist, thus explaining why he uses the scientific method, but also that the results of him using the scientific method were not quite what he wanted. with charmander at the start, it was successful but not new information that he discovered, and with his actual research project the results were super underwhelming and forced him to reconsider how he was approaching the question in the first place.

i would certainly call them both successful uses of the scientific method, but they hardly solved any problems.

and throughout the story, other uses of rational tools are quite prevalent as well (goal factoring, bayesian probabilities, pre-mortems all come to mind), showing that the scientific method doesn't apply to every problem

  scientific method isnt a tool of persuasion
#+end_quote

that's another subplot of the story as told from leaf's perspective, in terms of how entrenched people are in their ideals, and the best ways to persuade people coming from laura. the arc where she's writing about the pewter city exhibit is a great example of this point, and the continued arguments in comment sections (woah so meta) are other portrayals of how unpersuasive the scientific method can be

#+begin_quote
  downplaying role of emotions
#+end_quote

this one sort of bothers me, because i feel like the default criticism of rationality in general is that striving to be rational is striving to have no emotions. becoming vulcans is not the goal.

but emotion is HUGE in pokemon origin of species. sometimes in terms of psychological disorders (and disorder-like things), like with red's partition or aiko's dad, but also in terms of just motivations for current activities, like blue's arrogance or impulsive decisions.

it is true that characters (red in particular) are sometimes forced to act against where their emotions would guide them, but that's also kind of the point, and not unrealistic. if im mad at someone and want to punch them in the face, i generally fight that impulse and, well, dont punch them in the face. emotions are great informers, but not great deciders, if that makes any sense. sometimes we can't help but be driven by our emotions, and that sort of thing certainly happens in rationalist fiction, but it isn't virtuous in its own right and doesn't need to be portrayed that way.
