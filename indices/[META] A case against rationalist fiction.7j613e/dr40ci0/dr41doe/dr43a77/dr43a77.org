I'd have thought you'd aspire to be better than HPJEV, since he makes a lot of mistakes that could have been avoided if he'd been a better and more consistent rationalist. That is also part of rational fiction, because those mistakes made sense for him to make in his situation at his skill level and with the standard of opposition he faced. As opposed to suddenly being handed the idiot ball when the plot required it.

Although he also has a magical mysterious dark side that can enhance his thinking, which you aren't expected to have. The techniques he uses are supposed to be learnable, but you're supposed to learn them from Less Wrong and other books after seeing them depicted. HPMOR is not the course, it's the prospectus. It's not the car, it's the showroom model.

As for rationalist techniques beyond the scientific method, that may well depend on how broad your definition of scientific method. If it's "do whatever it takes to not fool yourself in seeking the right answer" then you've more or less defined them together, while specifically defining very little. If it's closer to formalised rigor and experimental methodology then there is much less overlap.

A lot of it just involves tricks to organise your thoughts so that common errors are either more obvious or less influential, such as goal-factoring, noticing confusion, spotting optimism bias, pre-mortems, or just stopping to think about the problem for five minutes before proposing solutions. Many of these can be summed up as practical applications of logic, cognitive science, or even remedial and preventative mental health techniques.

Then there's mathematics, such as the ever-popular Bayes Theorem, both in the form of actual calculations and the way familiarity with the technique trains your thoughts so that you can estimate in advance how strong particular claims may be.

There's also the common sense (ha!) aspect of never letting yourself believe that you have become so rational that you won't make these sorts of mistakes any more. The general theme of rationality is that you're a natural idiot and that you should keep that fact in mind at all times.
