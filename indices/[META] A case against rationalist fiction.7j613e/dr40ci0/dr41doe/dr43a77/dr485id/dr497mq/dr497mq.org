I know that one! How do you prove that logic is useful without using logic?

You don't know that you're not making a mistake in advance. The goal is always to incrementally improve, to be wrong less often than you were. If you're gunning for perfection I've got bad news for you. The stories don't even feature perfect rational agents. Even a story in which the protagonist is actively benefiting from author knowledge can only be at most as rational as the author is.
