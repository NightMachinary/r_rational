  You don't know that you're not making a mistake in advance. The goal is always to incrementally improve, to be wrong less often than you were.

It's even worse than that - because our methods of mesuring error rate of heuristics are heuristics too, we are not just unable to gurantee convergence, we can't even be sure that our heuristics become better and not worse with time.

  If you're gunning for perfection I've got bad news for you

I am not gunning for perfection, I am gunning for the same amount of uncertainty as in real world. In real world the best thing I can say about scientific method is "it empirically works". So it rankles me when some character acts as if scientific method is God-Given-Truth and people on this reddit pretend that this character is absolutely right.
