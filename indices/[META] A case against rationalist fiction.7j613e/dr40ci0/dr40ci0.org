I don't know what you are reading, but rationalism is not all about the scientific method, it is about overcoming the cognitive frailties inherent to human thought that lead to making mistakes. That should include sloppy thinking like the straw Vulcan type you reference in which emotions are ignored despite being a part of our reality that needs to be taken into account (which is usually the first thing I run into when talking to someone who styles themselves as an intellectual without doing the necessary groundwork). /Pokemon The Origin of Species/ has played particular attention in the story to the consequences and management of powerful emotions, with extremely varying degrees of success on the part of the characters, and yet, progress.

Furthermore, negative results in science are not a failure of the scientific method, they are valid outcomes of its successful application. It only fails to produce valid results if it is not used properly, or with incorrect assumptions (and exposing those is a part of both science and rationality). If the stories you are reading all depict characters who are somehow always able to devise correct hypotheses in advance of doing any actual investigations, then yes, that is poor rationalist fiction. That's not been my experience, however. Off the top of my head, of the rationalist stories I've read that feature application of scientific methodology (which they don't always do):

[[#s][HPMOR]]

[[#s][Pokemon OoS]]

In these stories and others the main characters use other rationalist techniques that do not involve scientific research, and characters untrained in science are often depicted using such techniques or knowledge for non science applications [[#s][such as]] that serve their own goals. None of them are perfect rational actors either, which means they do make mistakes, especially outside of their own particular expertise, and are not always amenable to rational arguments or scientific evidence.

Ultimately, though, depicting characters being successfully persuaded by rational argument or scientific evidence isn't for the purpose of celebrating rationality and science, it is for the purpose of establishing those particular characters as rational actors in their own right who can contribute rational actions (or at least understandably flawed attempts at rational actions) to the story.

I should also think that reserving understanding of applied scientific methodology for graduate level education is wholly irrational, responsible all by istelf for a wealth of the world's ills and displaying an abject contempt for human ability. Overcoming our biases and cognitive frailties is a difficult and life-long effort, but learning how to do proper science could easily be taught in the early teens, or even before ten. The statistics is harder, but the practice and habits of thought could easily be drilled much earlier. Just about all rationalist fiction requires that you buy into this premise, as much as fantasy requires you accept magic or science fiction demands you to accept FTL travel. Even if you don't agree, you can chalk that part up to the "fiction" side of things.
