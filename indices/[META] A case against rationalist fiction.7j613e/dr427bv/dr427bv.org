I feel that everyone who answers this is going to / did put a list of nitpicks /a la/ "rationalist fiction definitely can't have the problems you mention (or if it has them they're not that bad) because [nitpick] and [other nitpick] and this one time in HP:MoR Harry /failed/ at something" (I'm caricaturing, I love you guys), but I definitely think you've hit part of a larger problem.

I'm a little put off by the Science chapters in HP:MoR for the reasons you mention, and I didn't really like the way Origin of Species handled it either. (I don't remember what was the science-related thing I read in Origin of Species, and I'm not going to dig for quotes, btw).

On the other hand, you could maybe have picked a less click-bait-y title to make your point :P
