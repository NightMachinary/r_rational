I think you're using the word 'rational' differently than I am. It sounds like you're using it to mean things like Bayesian probability, graph theory, advanced psychology, etc -- subjects that you typically learn in higher education. I (and I think most [[/r/rational]] readers) are using "rational action" more broadly, to mean "whatever action is most likely to achieve your goal". In HPMOR it's rational to use Muggle knowledge of science to do magical research, because that knowledge isn't available to wizards and is therefore a comparative advantage. In "A Practical Guide to Evil" it's rational to understand how tropes work and choose your course in accord with that knowledge, because the gods have decreed that tropes are going to actually work in that world.

Saying that the protagonist "just happens to have such convenient objectives which allow for use of 'rational course of actions'" is missing the point -- /whatever/ your objective is, there is an optimal set of actions to achieve that objective. What those actions are depends on your resources and the truth of the world you live in. In the real world if your objective is "deal with the fact that my kidney is failing" then for most people the answer is probably "start dialysis immediately and get yourself on the transplant list". For the incredibly rich the answer might be "post a public bounty of $100mm to anyone who will donate a kidney to me." If Greek mythology were true then "pray to Asclepius and make a huge donation to his template so that he will regenerate my kidney" would be rational. Etc.

Side comment: I don't know what you mean that "[the] life of HPJEV mostly consists of of logical riddles", because that is definitely not how I remember that book.
