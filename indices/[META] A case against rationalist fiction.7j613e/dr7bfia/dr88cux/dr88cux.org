You are not late to the party: while I was indeed mistaken regarding one of the points I brought up, in general my complaints still stand.

  First, I think it's important to define 'science' and 'scientific method' up front.

Okay, I'll try to explain my complaint in more or less formal terms.

Suppose person has some model of the world in his head, and some heartfelt wish (objective). Then let's call procedure of formally solving model for argmax of probability of achieving objective "rational course of action".

The issue is that even simply stated optimization problems can be really hard to solve (i.e. integer programming), and the model of world is not simple at all. So humans use "rational course of action" if they can or rely on some heuristic if they can't.

The thing about heuristics is you can't prove that using one is optimal (or else it would be part of "rational course of action"). Furthermore usage of heuristic is easy to detect (in story) - if protagonist hasn't produced unbroken chain of logical inference which proves that his actions are optimal, he is using heuristic.

Now complaint: in (most) rationalist stories I don't see protagonists use methods of optimizations much better than one which I use in real life, but at the same time they use heuristics a lot less. So I conclude that we leave in fundamentally different worlds, and therefore it's doubtful that I can learn from them anything applicable in reality.

EDIT: "using heuristics a lot less" implies that protagonist is much better than me at solving optimization problem. On the other hand protagonist usually don't demonstrate any spectacular optimizational techniques. Which leaves the only possible conclusion - the fictional world is designed in such way to allow for easy solutions.

As an example if I were HPJEV, I would have a lot more problems like "whom should I befriend?" and "what should I study first?". Such problems not allow for "rational course of actions" because to solve them I would have to know the future.
