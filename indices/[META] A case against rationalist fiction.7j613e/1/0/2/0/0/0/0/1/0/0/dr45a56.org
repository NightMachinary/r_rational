The definition of rationalist fiction in this sub sidebar:"The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers".

You may say that I can replicate techniques but not spectacular results. But I can replicate ridiculous things Sherlock did without results too, and detectives don't claim to "shows techniques, which can be applied by readers".
