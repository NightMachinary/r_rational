pokemon origin of species has an original research subplot

it's shown to be very frustrating at every step and the protagonist is forced to revise his hypothesis multiple times. and after 50 chapters he still hasn't discovered what he wants to discover, all he's done is published an article that says "yeah this might sort of be the way this works, but i have no idea why or how and the correlation is super weak and there are a bunch of confounding factors and jeeze i need to do some more experiments"
