You can apply a lot of the rationalist techniques discussed in the fic itself to different parts of your life but nowhere in the definition does it promise you success for doing it. There are tons of people on this sub that have applied rational techniques to different aspects of their life (with mixed results, obviously) so your complaint isn't really making sense to me.
