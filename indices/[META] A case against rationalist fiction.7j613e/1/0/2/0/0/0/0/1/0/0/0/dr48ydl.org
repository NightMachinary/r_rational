No. What the sub sidebar means is that when a rational main character points out how a particular cognitive bias prevents proper logic, or how to properly, truly test an idea, the reasoning behind their words is true. When, in HPMOR, Harry and Draco investigate the inheritance of magic, the logic behind Harry's deductions (given the evidence he had and the amount of biological education he had) is sound, and applying that sort of logic in a similar situation would get you pretty good results.

But take detective stories for example; let's use the example of Sherlock Holmes. There are rarely moments in the new Sherlock Holmes movie where the viewer can actually mimic what's going on in Sherlock's head. Sherlock doesn't truly show you his process; sure he talks out his deductions, but he doesn't illustrate a method that will help you get there on your own. That's how it's different. No amount of reading/watching Sherlock will make you better at solving mysteries; no amount of watching/reading about Sherlock having epiphanies will help you any of your own.

But personally I found that after reading a lot of rational stories, I actually started noticing when I was confused more often. I began to realize, more often, when I didn't really understand something. I began to actually think about my thinking in a more proactive way, and I actually sat down, decided what my goals where, and decided to put in a halfway decent effort into optimizing towards them.

That's how the techniques of rational fictions, at least for this reader, were applied. Not by magically turning me into some kind of god-like world optimizing super smart machine; but by making me aware that my life is something I should be trying to optimize. And yes, with this new mode of thinking (spurred on by reading good rational fiction), I have seen results.

EDIT: And also, just to make clear; the 'tricks' you're talking about (the ones that apparently 'replace' research) in your post are not the techniques that the reddit sub bar is talking about. The reasoning that gets a person to decide to use that sort of trick is.
