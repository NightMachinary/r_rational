Your logic is supremely flawed here.

You can get results; that's without question. As I said, there are definitely people on this very sub that have applied rationalist techniques in life and found both success and failure.

Comparing yourself to HJPEV isn't a fair comparison because he has a narrative structure and a setting in which he can mercilessly exploit his "Muggle" techniques to his heart's content, so he consistently yields dividends (sometimes but not always)

You can apply rationalist techniques and find both success and failure in your own life. But that doesn't mean you're going to discover partial transfiguration or a true patronus (or whatever the equivalents in real life would be)
