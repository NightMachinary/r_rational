  overpowered protagonists doesn't feel satisfying, while HPMOR does

Your feelings are subjective and as such don't make good argument in discussion.

  I think the core of your argument is that rationalist fiction claims to demonstrate techniques which can be applied to real life and you don't believe this claim is true.
#+end_quote

I have this exact argument about ten time in this thread. The general conclusion in this line of discussion as I see it is that depending on your exact definition of a word 'techniques' you can be right (and I have even admitted it in EDIT2 in the details of the thread) or you can be wrong (as evidenced by several others failing to make a convincing argument with their definition of 'techniques')

  rationalist fiction often contains settings with large amounts of free energy
#+end_quote

I don't have a problem with amount of energy, I have a problem with form the large amount of free energy takes - namely it all takes such convinient form that can be exploited by scientific method, quick thinking or what have you.

In reality free of energy takes a lot of different forms: social unoptimality, psychological unoptimality, philosophical unoptimality, etc... So it makes me suspicious to the distribution of free energy in rationalist fiction
