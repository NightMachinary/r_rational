That's not what that tally is measuring, though. If you knew you had a coin-flip chance of succeeding at anything then you would be incentivized to attempt especially difficult tasks with low probabilities of succeeding.

HJPEV, and other rationalist protagonists, pick their battles carefully. The munchkining he does is primarily based on exploiting the fact that the insular Magical Britain has not yet incorporated several key muggle discoveries. While this specifically is not a situation you are likely to encounter, the general practice of understanding where your comparative advantage lies and capitalizing on it is /very/ useful in real life.

The reason modern research is so hard is because we have so much knowledge that incredibly fine statistical tools are required to meaningfully add to it. Just a few centuries ago, though, a well-educated and well-funded polymath could make valuable original contributions to mathematics, physical science, naturalism, and philosophy in their lifetime.

So what successes, specifically, do you argue we are unable to replicate?
