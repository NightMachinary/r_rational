I think you actually /can/ be as good as HPJEV.

The problem is that HPJEV (like many other rationalist protagonists) lives in a highly exploitable universe, and most of his interactions are with people who are not as smart as he is.

The real world is much less exploitable (or at least, it has fewer easy-to-reach low-hanging fruits) and it's generally better at keeping up with you.
