Let me extend your analogy. Ordinary fiction use author fiat to tell only about instances in which bot "got lucky" and won, rationalist fiction use author fiat to tell only about instances in which player plays only against advanced AI and lose. And that's the problem - both types of fiction give me distorted image of the world.

What's worse because of distorted image of the world, I can't apply lessons learned in HPMOR because I can never be sure how much real world is similar to it's distorted image.
