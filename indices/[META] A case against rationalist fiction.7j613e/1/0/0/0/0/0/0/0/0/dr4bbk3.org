How do you mean?

If you mean that you can't be sure what /lessons/ match up with the real world, that's not really a problem: rationality is rationality; it works wherever minds are trying to do logic. Unlike in detective stories, where there might be some type of evidence-gathering technique that doesn't exist in reality, there's no "fake rationality" that these stories invent, that only works in the story. The lessons of a rationalist story are applicable as long as your situation is truly congruous to the ones faced in the story.

If you mean that you can't tell whether your situation is truly congruous... I'm not sure how to help you here. Maybe I can point out that most of the tools of rationality are context-free, and just work to solve a /local/ problem as long as they match the /local/ context of that problem, without requiring any larger global pattern match up? (I.e. anchoring and framing effects still exist whether or not your setting contains magic or God or whatever else.)

I should mention that the /concrete/ lesson probably /isn't/ applicable, any more than a magical detective skill learned in a fantasy world would be, but the concrete lesson is rarely the point, and is rarely emphasized as the point in comparison to the more abstract rationality-technique that was employed to derive the concrete tactic.

So, for example: HPJEV notices an arbitrage opportunity between gold and Galleons. The real world does not have any similar longstanding arbitrage opportunity, because Galleons /are a made-up exploitable part of this setting/. But the lesson wasn't about Galleons; the lesson was about exploiting arbitrage opportunities, and that lesson /is true/ even though its concrete referent in the story is made up, and in fact made to be /especially easy/ to demonstrate the particular applicability of this technique to it.

Mind you, the situations in a rationalist story aren't strawmen; they don't sport exploitable flaws that have no real-world equivalent. Teaching the skill of exploiting arbitrage opportunities would be pointless if there were no real arbitrage opportunities. The ones that exist in reality (between different stock exchanges, as exploited by High-Frequency Trading, for example) are just much harder to talk about, and also much less exciting to learn about or to watch a character attempt to exploit. The examples in a rationalist story are chosen in order to make the lesson of the advantage a particular tool of rationality gives you more /salient/---*not* in order to give a character with that rationalist tool an "easy time."
