  That said, your complaints are sort-of circular then. Rationalist fiction shows successful use of scientific method? Of course, it's the entire point

Yes, but there is one significant difference between rationalist fiction and detectives - as postulated on sidebar of this sub "The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers".

Detectives don't tell me that I can be as discerning as Sherlock Holmes if I emulate him, while rational fiction does tell me that I can be as good as HPJEV if I study hard enough.
