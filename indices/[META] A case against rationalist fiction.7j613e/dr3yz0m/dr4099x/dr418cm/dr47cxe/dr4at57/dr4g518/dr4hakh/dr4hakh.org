wait, but you could you can't talk about how rational writers don't write about solving everyday problems, and then also expect to throw some face-punching problem solving in there as well.

I think the problem here, and the reason I feel compelled to keep arguing, is that there doesn't seem to be a way to resolve all of your critiques, and keep the work rational, and keep it entertaining.

It would be a bit like saying that mixing the comedy with some hardcore tragedy would give more depth to romcom characters; yes, it would, but it would also stretch the genre intensely, and not be something every kind of comedic story could pull off.
