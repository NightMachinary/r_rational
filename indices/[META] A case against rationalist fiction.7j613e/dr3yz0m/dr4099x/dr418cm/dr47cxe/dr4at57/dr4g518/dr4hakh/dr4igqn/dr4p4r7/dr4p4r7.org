But here's the thing. There are plenty of good comedic stories that don't focus on those things, and they don't deserve to be abandoned. Maybe not everybody likes the Hangover, but I loved it when I watched it and it was successful; and just because it chose to be a straight-up comedy of errors instead of trying to use tragedy to build characterization does not make it a bad story. The same goes for other comedy films; they're not bad just because they're trying to appeal to the core of the genre, rather than pushing the boundaries. Stories don't have to be groundbreaking, to be good.

Every genre has issues, and while I'd admit that, of course, rationalist fiction has some, saying that it should be abandoned in favor or a new, hybrid genre is a bit much.
