  wait, but you could you can't talk about how rational writers don't write about solving everyday problems
#+end_quote

The only place I have talked about everyday problems is the branch of discussion about "science works!" genre fiat. And I have admitted defeat regarding it which I have also mentioned in redacted thread details. So I don't consider my complaints from that line of discussion relevant anymore.

  there doesn't seem to be a way to resolve all of your critiques, and keep the work rational, and keep it entertaining.
#+end_quote

Exactly my point - if to resolve some of the issues of genre we have to push the limits of the genre, then as rational human beings we have to start pushing the boundaries.

  it would also stretch the genre intensely, and not be something every kind of comedic story could pull off.
#+end_quote

Then we should abandon the stories which could not and focus on stories which could.
