That's what rational protagonists do, they just start out with science if they don't already know how to solve the problem, which they often don't; the point of rational fiction is to see how someone responds to the fantastic rationally to learn how to apply those methods IRL. Do you...want them to /start/ with the power of friendship? Are you asking for the character to try the regular problem solving strategies only to find out the only thing that works is the power of friendship or righteous face punching? That seems like the opposite of what rational fiction is based on (aka what works IRL), the Doctor Strange movie was sort of like that and it was pretty annoying. In fact I would say that's irrational fiction, since it shows something that wouldn't work most of the time IRL as the best way to go.

Rational protagonists are often in situations where they don't have enough info to know the best strategy. This happens a lot in fiction, and while a shonen protagonist will hit the problem with the determination stick, a rational protagonist will start with science to figure out enough to know how to solve the problem.

Anyway, rational fiction is about characters responding intelligently to strange situations. They don't always use the scientific method, in Luminosity there is very little to no science (I've only read the first story, it may happen later), for example. They /do/ use other strategies, and use them often. Rational fiction is about applied rationality, which is more ad-hoc things to get around biases that the scientific method. Origin of Species is a bit different in that it follows a scientist, you get exactly what is on the tin there.

In real life, at what point would you resort to punching people or the power of friendship to solve a problem? That's why it doesn't happen often in rational fiction. I've read your posts, and I don't really know what you /want/. It's like you've decided rational fiction is divorced from actual problem solving, and when we say it isn't and give examples you just keep making confusing points which don't seem to relate. I actually sat here for 5 minutes thinking of how to respond, because I know this point is wrong (not trying multiple strategies but that rational protagonists don't do so) but it's just so strange it veered into "not even wrong" territory.
