I really don't understand your points. Yes doing proper formal research is hard, but in a lot of good rational stories doing research is actually the optimal approach. And, most importantly, doing informal 'research' is really, really easy. Coming up with basic tricks, as well, even in real life is pretty easy; it just will be that, rather than you being the first person that ever thought of that trick, there's just some reason it isn't the default way of doing it.

For example, in basketball, there are tons of 'tricks' a player can do to destabilize the defense, all of which are derived from informal research (experimentation on the court, testing to see what works, etc...), even if most players don't think of it that way. One of the reasons basketball is such a high scoring game is because of those tricks; they give the offense a decisive advantage. Basketball is a really simple example of how rational, informal research can improve performance, and I see it almost every training, whenever one of my friends calls me over to 'try out a new move'. The logic they go through as they explain it to me (spacing, getting the defender to step back so there's now way they can get forward in time, fakes) all seem pretty rational; the same logic can be applied, by me, to developing my own tricks (even if I'm not the first person to ever come up with them). So the kind of informal research I see in most rational fics seems realistic to me, because I see analogues of it all the time, and most of the other hard research is justified by the plot

For example in HPMOR, when Harry is trying to convince Draco that muggleborns aren't weakening magic; He can't ask somebody else, because most people are either people Draco wouldn't believe, or people who already share Draco's politics; and the kind of gradual wearing down and exposure that changes most people's point of view is too slow for Harry. He has to find a way to suddenly shake Draco's beliefs, and he does; by making Draco do the research himself; and even they don't come to a point where Draco truly admits that Harry has convinced him; Draco is just shaken in his beliefs, not fully turned in one go. Harry even tells Dumbledore that he is trying to turn Draco to the light, not that he has already succeeded.

And of course such trickery isn't analogous to real life; how often in real life do we actually trick people into doing stuff (excluding small children?). We aren't rational protagonists; we aren't often put in situations that would warrant that much effort. But Harry wanted to convince Draco quickly, and he managed to come up with a way that would both showcase his rational methods and make Draco do the same thinking himself; in this case a trick. Harry put in all that effort to get around the real life problem (that people aren't usually convinced by being shown scientific evidence), and you have to admit that, after pointing out that problem, also criticizing a main character for finding a way to solve it isn't fair.

This feels like you have rational writers backed up in a box. If they show people being convinced by scientific evidence, they're not being realistic. But if they try to show a way in which one could use the scientific method in order to convince somebody, then they're also being bad because it's no longer analogous to most real life circumstances. That just isn't fair; no one reads fiction for real life circumstances, that would be unbearably boring. Rational fiction is about the logic, not the circumstances.

TLDR: Criticizing that the logical lessons shown in rational fiction aren't good or rational because we don't often experience analogous situations in real life, feels a bit like criticizing the emotional lessons taught by normal fiction (such as canon Harry Potter) as not real/bad because we aren't often called upon to defeat Dark Lords in real life. It's not a fair argument, that ignores the fact that rational fiction is rational fiction, not a textbook on applied rationality.
