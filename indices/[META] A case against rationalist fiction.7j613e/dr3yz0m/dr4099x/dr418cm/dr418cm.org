1. The power of the villains is always the outside explanation - the main characters in /Dracula/ are exactly as strong, collectively, as they need to be to eke out a win against the vampire. If you put them against the vampires in Hellsing they would be ground up in seconds (see edit). If you want an inside explanation, one is provided - the characters are rationalist in an irrational world, and have the advantage that entails. The characters are always usually creative and intelligent, much more so than in standard fiction. This, incidentally is another advantage of the genre; the target market allows someone to write a character that is really smart without alienating people or relying on fake intelligence.

2. That analogy would imply that personal finance is less important than finger-painting. And again, there is a distinction between the formal method that involves peer reviewed papers and grants and what-not, and the informal method.

3. This is one example, and one that is not analogous to real life in most circumstances. In the global warming debate, the correct side engages with the deniers, but they don't trick the deniers into deriving the results themselves. Harry can hardly be said to easily convince Malfoy. After all, Malfoy tortures him, and Draco's position at the end of the story is rather ambiguous.

4. Exactly! The point of rationality is to limit bias. It is a set of tools designed to grind your implicit probabilistic model of the world down to the correct one. To give an example, once again, Harry selects against emotionally appealing explanations (Hermione is in a better place) in favor of harsh realities (It will take powers far beyond his to have a chance of reconstructing her).

EDIT: Before anyone says that Abraham van Helsing /does/ beat Dracula in the lore of Hellsing, you know what I meant.
