- Power of adversaries should play no role into determining success rate of the scientific method - if you are significantly more successful than you should be than there should be explanation (i.e. some precog messing with you) instead of metaexplanation (i.e. if you are not successful then you will be crushed by Voldemort)

- It can stand in, but empirically there is almost always obvious better way as evidenced by proportion of scientists in our population and by teaching scientific method at graduate level instead of kidergarten or school level.

- My point still stands. I.e. Harry easily convinces Malfoy while any real person would have whipped ten reasonable arguments against Harry results

- That's exactly my point - rationalist fiction pretends that rationality is orthogonal to everything else while in reality there are a ton of biases which influence what you research, how you research, etc
