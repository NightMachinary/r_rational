  How could a modern society put an upper limit on accumulated wealth, while still incentivizing innovation?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure that wealth actually incentivizes innovation, beyond a point it just becomes a game token. Maybe explicitly gamifying control of corporations, maybe creating some kind of stock that's the opposite of non-voting stock, stock that has a controlling interest in the company but can't be sold except through some ludicrous tax process?
