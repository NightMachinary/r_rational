A wealth tax?

On the one hand, I've never heard of one so I assume that there's something horribly wrong with them. On the other hand, a progressive tax makes a lot more sense to me than a flat cap. If the top wealth-tax bracket was 10%/year on any assets above $100m then it would act quite similar to a cap, but avoid some of the dangers of a rigid system.
