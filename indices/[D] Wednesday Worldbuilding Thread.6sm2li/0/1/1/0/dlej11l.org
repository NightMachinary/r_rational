Money is currently power. Nobles would, instead of accumulating wealth, acquire black market money, connections, and favors, being the nearest unblocked neighbor to wealth as an approximation of power. If you start taxing contracts by how much leverage they give each party on society, more mafia-like structures will have to form instead.
