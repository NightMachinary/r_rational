Just have a progressive wealth tax that approaches 100% a $x->infinity in such a way that you can approach the money cap and get endlessly close, but can't actually reach it. Then you'll have people able to compete over how much money they have for prestige, but still not go over the cap. Now, this would still be a pretty terrible system, but technically works.
