  Would there be a benefit in establishing a class of nobility that gains power by achieving the cap? Ex: Once you make more then $15 million, everything you make above that level is taken by the government.

Something my late father told me:

The Queen of England has kind of a deal like that. As I understand it the state gets all the income from her personal estates, and she gets all her expenses handled by the state. When Victoria set it up, she got the best side of the deal by far, but since then the value and income from the royal estates has increased immensely.
