Whats stopping those people from investing all their money back into their business? Or is the government going to force them from making their business better?

Say I make 15mil. That's the cap. So from no on instead of keeping the money with me, anything I earn over the 15 mil cap I just put it back into the business. Buying more factories and equipment and such even though I no longer really need it but I can still justify it as a business expenditure.

Personally, I still earn only 15mil. Can the enforcing agency prevent me from growing my business?
