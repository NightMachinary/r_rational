But then there's not much difference than what is the current capitalist system... Most rich people don't really have billions of dollars laying around in their bank. It's mostly tied up into their business assets or stocks.

So if you do make a tax, even a 100% taxation on anything more than 15 mil than you get the same system we have now just even more tied down to physical assets. For example a CEO will only get 15mil a year but every year he also buys two or three factories(can be anything really) which he says they are part of the business. Thus avoiding the 100% tax. But they will never be used, although they'll have all the paperwork to show they are active. And then if he needs to "change someones mind" he just gifts them a factory stating it as a business merger or something like that. This way he keeps getting richer and more powerful/influential while staying under the 15mil limit.

Honestly, there's a good reason such a thing doesn't exist already in our world. It simply can never work. The only way to make something like that even remotely possible is to give enough power to the government to control everything. And such governments very quickly turn into either communism or fascism.

Also... to make anything remotely like you suggest work, the whole world needs to work under the same system. It's enough that there's one country that refuses to implement the tax and any business that can will move itself into that country.(Kind of like what happened with China once they started transitioning from communism to capitalism.) Also, I vaguely remember an economy book that explained how increasing taxes over a certain level actually results in less tax being collected. The reason? Until a certain taxation level people rather pay the tax than risk the consequences. However, after a certain level it becomes worth it to avoid paying taxes and more and more people risk the consequences. No matter how horrible the consequences may be. And if you make them too high businesses simply move to other countries and then you lose all income from said business. As such, governments can't make taxes to high or people will simply find ways to avoid paying them... which is why taxing the rich is a pointless endeavour.

Sorry for the rant :) I'm just having a similar argument with a left leaning friend.
