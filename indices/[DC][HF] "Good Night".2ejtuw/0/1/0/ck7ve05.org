Well, let's examine the options:

- Twilight: decides that her life is boring and / or pointless. Prefers dying to trying anything that might change that fact.
- Cadence: decides that wireheading is the best possible use of an immortal's existence.
- Celestia: keeps doing the same thing (re-creating Equestria and its ponies over and over) instead of trying anything new.
- Luna: Transcends. Granted, this appears to be a positive outcome, or at least might be. We simply have no data -- the only thing we know is that all prior interests and attachments cease to matter.

Also, the protagonist's decision should legitimately receive a greater weighting than the other characters'.
