I think that's slightly mean-spirited towards the story: Twilight's is one perspective. Luna's was another, Cadence's a yet third. Celestia is left undecided as to how to proceed.

Neither Luna nor Cadence found immortality to suck, but Twilight finds a simple end to her existence to be more tasteful than what the paths these two took -- or at least what said paths looks like from Twilight's external point of view.

This was basically a story discussing transhumanist ideas, not really a "rationalist" story.
