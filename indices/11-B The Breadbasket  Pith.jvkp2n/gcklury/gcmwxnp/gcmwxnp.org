She's been indoctronaited for years (since birth?) that Paragon = good, that if she wants to be an Exemplar she needs to be one of them. I don't think she's capable of honestly assessing the system she's supporting, because it means admitting a large part of her life choices were just wrong.

Anyways, I always thought the endgame would begin with Ana realizing that she was caught between peace & order through oppression, or liberty and equality through revolution. But at this point I think she might very well die believing in the former.
