  I had a duty to this nation, to the people here, to keep them safe from the monsters within. Even if I was a nobody. Even if I was an insignificant mercenary, pointless next to the almighty Guardians around me. Even if some parts of the Principality didn't deserve to be saved.

Then why are you fighting on behalf of the people that you /know/ don't care about their citizens? Fighting for the country and fighting for the government are not the same thing.
