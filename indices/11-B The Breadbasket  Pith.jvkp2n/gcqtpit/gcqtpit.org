I like how Ana just blindly jumps to the conclusion that this fleet is coming to destroy the Islands. It'd be just as smart a move to just blockade the islands, to siege out a surrender and strategic territory concessions from the government. And it'd be just as much as a big threat justifying continuing to work with the Guardians. But she has to go harder.

It shows that it's not just Ana being biased towards her country and her favoured institutions. No, her response to learning about a threat is to jump to the most catastrophized, existential conclusion possible and she forgets about her doubts and circles the wagons in response. This is the difference between just beng indoctrinated and someone beng outright reactionary.

It easily lead to a massive own-goal too. Because imagine if this wasn't actually an attack, but just saber-rattling on part of the Shenti. But the Guardians /think/ it's an attack, so they strike first without even bothering with diplomacy. Boom, suddenly they've escalated the situation to outright war.
