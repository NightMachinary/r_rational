[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]] does a /really/ good job on the romance between Kirito and Asuna.

It's cute and really sweet and there's this one scene between them that was just so /eeeee/ that I literally, physically squeed because it was /just that cute and sweet oh my gosh/.

Also the rest of the story is seriously well done too. In particular, it scratched the itch for me that the end of the Log Horizon anime left.
