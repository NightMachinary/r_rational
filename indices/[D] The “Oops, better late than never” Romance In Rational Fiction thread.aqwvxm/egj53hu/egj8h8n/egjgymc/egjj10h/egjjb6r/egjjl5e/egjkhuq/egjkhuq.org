#+begin_quote
  My last (three/five/ten) attempts at (item) ended in abject disaster and were a total waste of my time, even after I invested large amounts of effort into them and even though they seemed at first glance to be going well. Therefore, I resolve to stop wasting time on (item).
#+end_quote

It's one-hundred-percent realistic and reasonable to put "romance", "friendship", "MMOs", "blogging", etc. as the "(item)" in that quote.
