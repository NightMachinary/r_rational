Definitely. Though, I still like the society changing ones, because there's a dearth of (good) ones in general. They're very satisfying, but it's hard to write a global plot while focusing on characters (the interesting part) at the same time.

There should 100% be more rational fics about love. Maybe a fanfic of Kaguya-sama? As far as I know, that more deconstructs/parodies anime tropes rather than remaining rational.
