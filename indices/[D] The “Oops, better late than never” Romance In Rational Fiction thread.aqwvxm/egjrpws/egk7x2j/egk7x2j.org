bit of an aside, but I watch a show called the Magicians (currently in its fourth, excellent season) that recently introduced a situation where romance (or at least a love life) did have significant stakes.

One of the characters gets infected with sexually transmitted lycanthropy. As a consequence of that, during an event called the Quickening, he must have traditional sex with a currently uninfected partner, or he will 'wolf-out' and rape/murder the first person he finds. Furthermore, if he does something like lock himself in a cage, he will 'wolf-out' and murder himself. The Quickening also causes him to have increasingly violent/sexual thoughts as he gets closer to wolfing out.

As he was currently single, didn't want to coerce or infect anyone, and had several other very important (as in 'the lives of him and his friends hang in the balance' important) things going on at the same time, this was a significant problem. I think the situation would actually be ripe for a rational exploration in securing romantic success that would have actual stakes, since one of the better ways for him to solve the problem permanently would be to secure a nice, stable, long-term relationship. Extremely contrived, true, but also one of the more interesting takes on werewolves I've seen in a while.
