Oh yeah, there's been quite a number of departures from the source material. The books are amazing, but if the show followed them exactly it would have been cancelled after one season. The books work because we get an inside look into Quentin's head, and Quentin is very introspective. He works as a character precisely because we get to see his inner thoughts and feelings; trying to get the same depth from the outside (as they would have to on a medium like TV) just wouldn't work. So instead the show chose to expand the rest of the cast to 'match' the depth with which they would portray TV Quentin, and all the other changes kind of spiraled from there, in my opinion.

Also a bit off topic, but how do you feel about book Quentin? A lot of other fans I've met seem to hate him, especially in the first few books, but I while I kind of get that, on a very real level I don't. A lot of people cite the way he thinks about women as why they hate him, but I feel like those people simply don't understand that Quentin in book 1 is essentially a repressed teenage boy, and a big chunk of what they hate reading is simply a natural consequence of how deeply the author choose to portray him. If, in the Harry Potter books, Rowling decided to really go into depth on what Harry was thinking whenever he was really feeling his crush for Ginny (or Cho Chang before her), then I don't think many people would like the character of Harry Potter either.

In fact, I think that if you changed the point of view to any other character in the Magicians series, and kept the writing style the same, that character would instantly become 'the worst character in the books', just like people think Book 1 Quentin is.
