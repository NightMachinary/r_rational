I read the trilogy that this show was based on and, even just based on this short description, it seems like there've already been quite a fair number of departures from the source material. Lycans don't even exist there.

That being said, this may be one of the few times I'm in support of departures. The Magicians was overall a rather depressing series for much of its run and I can't imagine that translates well to TV.

/Thinks about Game of Thrones' many, many depressing moments/

Then again, I could be wrong.
