Oh I understand your point of view perfectly. I just feel like that is as much a part of the writing style, as it is the characterization. Almost all of the characters in book 1, judging from some of their actions and dialogue alone, don't come off nicely, to the point where I think, if they were the point of view character, they also would have come off as a snobby, arrogant, entitled prick. Essentially I don't really think Book 1 Quentin is actually a bad person, relative to the other book 1 characters. I think he just gets a bad rap because he's the point of view character, so he's the focus of the narrative. Basically, I think that if Alice or Margo or Julia or Eliot had been the protagonist in Book 1, people would say the exact same things about them, as they do Quentin now. That's one of the reasons I think the show is so much more liked (by the 'mainstream', and even by a lot of book fans) than the books. Season 1 (or at least, early season 1) plays out pretty similarly to the novel, but nobody is the main character. Nobody is subject to the ultra close, super personal examination that made Quentin such a good character but also so hard to root for. And Quentin's actions, divorced from the ugliness of his inner monologue, are a lot more bearable. With that degree of separation he just becomes one character among many, with problems just like anyone else's.

To give a clear example, in the books Quentin cheating on Alice seems a lot worse than Alice cheating on Quentin, because we got to see Quentin's internal monologue during the act, and after. We don't get to see any of that for Alice; we don't get to see any of the jealousy or anger, or resentment, so her 'transgression' seems a lot more 'innocent', if that makes sense. In the show the whole thing plays out similarly (with important differences, but similarly), but with both characters being seen from the same 'distance', there's a lot less perceived imbalance (at least to me) in how they behave. The good guy and bad guy in the situation is a lot less clear cut; they just both look like two young, socially awkward fools trying to handle their first relationship.
