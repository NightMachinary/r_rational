For me, the Magicians overall was just a bit too depressing and angsty. The author himself said he was in a pretty bad place when he wrote the first book (and maybe the 2nd?) and that's clearly reflected in the series. I still read it and am happy I did almost purely because book 3 really brought it home. The Quentin from book 3 is such an amazing character and book 1/2 Quentin is responsible for that, as part of what makes him amazing is his growth.

It's been a while so I can't give the fairest opinion but book 1 Quentin, from what I recall, was a snobby, arrogant, entitled prick. He had that sort of issue that I personally don't respect (but can understand) of having too much and thus being unsatisfied. He also cheated on his girlfriend. Alcohol/drugs was involved but still; his reasons were cheating were pretty basic and self centered and shitty and don't get me wrong; that's good character design in a sense. Quentin definitely felt like a real character; a real person. He was just a person I didn't like. I wouldn't call him a bad/boring/flat character; I'd call him a bad person though.
