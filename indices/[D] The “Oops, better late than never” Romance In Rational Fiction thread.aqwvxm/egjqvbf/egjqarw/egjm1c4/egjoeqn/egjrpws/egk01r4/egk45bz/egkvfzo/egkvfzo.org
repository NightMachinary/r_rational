The True Love's Kiss idea was mentioned, but there is another potential option.

The Harem Anime, the rational protagonist somehow becomes aware that if they don't get all their paramours to cooperate bad stuff will happen, so you've got a story where navigating relationships is the means to success. Any hook works, gotta get the kids working together to stop the capitalist business owner demolishing a park, party of fantasy heroes who will need to cooperate to have a chance to defeat the dungeons, crew of a sci fi ship you've got to stop breaking in chaos. There's lots of ways to require people working together to get a goal, while having the goal such most of them aren't motivated enough to put aside their disputes. The protagonist has to figure out how how to develop both romantic and non romantic relationships with a group who all want something to keep it going.

The real issue with any premise is that romance just isn't that rational friendly, you can't so easily optimize others emotions so it'll be less friendly to the kind of stories more popular here.
