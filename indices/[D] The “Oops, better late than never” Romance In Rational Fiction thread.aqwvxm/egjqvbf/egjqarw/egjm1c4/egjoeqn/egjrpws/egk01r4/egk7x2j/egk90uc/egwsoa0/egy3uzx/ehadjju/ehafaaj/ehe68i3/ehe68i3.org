Oh I should've mentioned; most of the characters had that sort of same air to me. The snobby, entitled type thing. Alice seemed to be one of the few exceptions.

And you're right; the POV thing does make a big difference. I remember when I read the chapter where Alice cheated, I felt a lot more emotionally impacted. With Quentin, I was like "well this is consistent with the sort of shitty entitled person he is" and also there's probably some bias as I'm a male so I more easily relate to Quentin by default. When Alice cheated, I found it "hurt" a lot more despite the fact that I could objectively say she had more valid reasons for infidelity, though I still wouldn't call it right.

Like I had the same issue with most of the magicians characters, esp. most of the students from brake bills, that I had with Quentin at least initially; they were all spoiled brats. They had all of this magical prowess and education and they figured the best thing to do after graduation was....go to a fancy apartment and mindlessly party? Seriously guys?

I think the metaphor the author was going for was clear; it was meant to directly mimic the all too common story of rich kids becoming adults and having too much and so having difficulty finding fulfilment. But I guess I just don't empathize with that sort of thing and as a result, I ended up hating a lot of the cast.
