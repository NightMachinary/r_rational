I think there is another reason why rationality features little in romance, beyond the lack of stakes; while a smart approach does increase the odds of success in reality, the success or failure of a romantic move in a story often has very little to do with prior odds of success, and much more with the requirements of the story - while we on this subreddit share a dislike for unlikely, against-the-odds successes and approve of our protagonists using their intellect to achieve their goals, common romance tropes are basically the inverse of that. Applying rational thinking to romance is probably rather difficult to write if the romance is supposed to have tension and be narratively satisfying. That is not to say it isn't possible, as others have noted, WTC and other works have done it, but it seems pretty difficult to me.
