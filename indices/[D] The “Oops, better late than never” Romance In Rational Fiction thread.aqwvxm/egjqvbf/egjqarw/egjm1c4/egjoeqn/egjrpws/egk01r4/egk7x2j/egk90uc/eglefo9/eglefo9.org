It seems like doing something as simple as using a condom is enough to prevent transmission in this setting, so werewolves aren't all ruthlessly killed (especially since magic can probably make 'protection' even more air tight). Plus the whole thing was presented as an allegory for aids/other STDs when it was first introduced, so there are now limits on how 'rational' the show can get on the issue.

And while letting yourself die would be 'reasonable' in the bigger picture, I don't think it would really be rational for most characters. Rationality is all about pursuing your goals in the best possible way, and 'staying alive' is a pretty important goal for most people. Still, that would add a bit more depth and moral nuance to the plot of this hypothetical story.

It is kind of addressed in the story however. In the setting, magic is a secret kept by magicians (who are implied to be the top 1% of the population, brains wise, because magic is absurdly difficult to use/understand properly). Most magician werewolves we see manage the condition with relative ease, because of how magic can alleviate most problems. It is the non-magicians who get infected, and so don't know about magic/the wider magical world/what the fuck is going on during their Quickening, who are presented as a major problem, and I wouldn't be surprised if the setting introduces a squad of magicians who roam the world killing/capturing those poor suckers, despite how whimsical the show can be. As whimsical as the setting is, it is also one the spent a good deal of time presenting fairies as the classic, human-hating, ethereal beings we're all used to seeing... and then later revealed that faires only hate humans because, since fairies are literally made of magic, magicians used to hunt them down, kill them, and grind their bones into a magic enhancing powder (fairy dust). It's one of those weird shows that tends to have its irrational elements actually have been vaguely rational all along; the world is just so secretive/layered that the protagonists were operating with incomplete information the whole time.
