I'm not saying it's /usual/ to give up after several tries---I'm saying it's /realistic/ and /reasonable/. I fail to see how you can say otherwise when /r9k/, [[/r/mgtow][r/mgtow]], and other such communities exist. In less-political territory, I personally gave up on MMOs and multiplayer-focused games after several tries.
