That is a good point, though, as I framed it, those would be competing values outweighing the value placed on romantic success. Addressing the issue, however, would be important, and I don't see that often outside of, again, Worth the Candle.

EDIT: On second thought, Practical Guide to Evil addresses this a little. Cat is often too busy to truly pursue romance, and justifiably paranoid at times about what the story-rules of her universe may do to non-Named love interests. She still finds value in those relationships, and has on a few occasions gone for them anyway.
