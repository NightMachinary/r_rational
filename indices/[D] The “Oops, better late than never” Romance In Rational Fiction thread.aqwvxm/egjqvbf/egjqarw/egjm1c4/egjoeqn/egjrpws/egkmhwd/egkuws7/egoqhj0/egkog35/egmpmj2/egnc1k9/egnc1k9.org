Speaking from experience, it's a challenge to blend rational fic tropes with romantic ones. Rational fic is usually focused on a character's ambitions, intellectual gains, and social machinations. The type of style that favors that tends to be more detached and focused on the plot, rather than the emotional arc of the characters. The tension comes from the characters solving complicated problems while the odds are stacked against them, and seeing them pull it off in a clever way is usually how the story resolves.

Romance as a genre has a different conflict/resolution scheme. The characters are usually struggling with something (loneliness, ugliness, fear of intimacy) and they have to find healing/happiness through the romantic relationship. A romance will also have an immediate, close writing style, because that helps us relate to the characters and build tension.

To somehow blend rational characters with romantic storylines, you really need to develop skill in building romantic tension and making the reader want the characters to be together, because they need each other. The romantic conflict should dovetail with the rational fic conflict, so that one affects the other. For example, the character winning an intellectual challenge will either lead to progress or regression in their romantic goals, in a way that fits naturally into the storyline.

In all likelihood, you'd have to choose whether or not you want the rational or romantic plot arc to take take center stage in a particular scene or chapter. Not just because the writing style will be different, but also because sometimes you have to switch mental gears to go from reading one or the other.
