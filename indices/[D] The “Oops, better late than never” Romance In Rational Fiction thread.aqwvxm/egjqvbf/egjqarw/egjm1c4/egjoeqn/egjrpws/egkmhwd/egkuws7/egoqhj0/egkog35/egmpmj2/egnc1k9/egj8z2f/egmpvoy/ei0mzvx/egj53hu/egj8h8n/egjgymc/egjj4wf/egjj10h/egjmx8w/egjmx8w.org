I would argue fearing enemies targeting partners is usually unrealistic. The prevalence of family killing in fiction is more evil for evils sake than realistic. Enemies that don't have an issue with the partner alone = killing them gains nothing besides hardening your real enemy. If the partner is fighting the enemy they'd be trying to kill them regardless of the relationship. Exceptions to this would be things like bloodline or emotion based magic.

Betrayal is also very paranoid barring certain settings, if the enemy can turn your partner against you who can't they turn?
