I wrote a romantic rational fiction. Not a story that incidentally has romance--a story whose central theme /is/ romance. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHqSoi4t_92nfRnslILIh03XgtJrIPWKEhuwIICwako/edit?usp=sharing][Here it is.]] Feedback of any type is welcome.

I wouldn't expect this community to be all that interested in romance. The reward for being rational in romantic situations... is better odds of romantic success. While that is very nice, and of great importance to those directly involved, romantic success seldom has world-altering implications. There are reasons it usually goes on in the background of the story.
