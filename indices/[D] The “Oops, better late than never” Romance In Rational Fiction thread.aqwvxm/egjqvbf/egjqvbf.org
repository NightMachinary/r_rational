I think rational fiction has a more general problem with (or at least a tendency toward) characters with inhuman motivation. Most are community/society/world-optimizers rather than satisfaction-pursuers - they're bent on changing the world and institutions around them (and willing to make heroic sacrifices to do it) rather than evaluating the options for how to live within their current society most enjoyably.

The biggest departure from that I can think of is Pokemon: Origin of Species - Red and Leaf want (relatively) mundane lives as a researcher and journalist, Blue is admittedly more ambitious, but level-sets his ambition against the achievements of his grandfather and other Champions. None of them, say, thinks that the whole League system is a corrupt pile of bad incentives that needs to be swept away and replaced with a new paradigm for how humans interact with Pokemon in the way that Harry did with Wizarding Britain in HPMOR. Compare/contrast the Practical Guide to Evil where Catherine seems to continually seek out new and better ways to give up her humanity in order to keep her ambitions alive. In Mother of Learning where Zorian uses a variety of methods to allow his friends to transmit research data and memories through instances of the Loop, but uses the Loop more to avoid emotional engagement with potential romantic partners at least in part because it would distract from optimal use of the loop.

It'd be interesting to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are selfish and amoral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources,
