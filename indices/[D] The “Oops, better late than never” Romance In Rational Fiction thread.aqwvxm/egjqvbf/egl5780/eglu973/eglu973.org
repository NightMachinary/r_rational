I got up-to-date on the (translated) magna a week ago. It does a fair bit of deconstruction, but the characterization /mostly/ remains solid, and pretty firmly centered around the core concept of "two people want the other to confess". I'm not quite sure what rational fanfic would look like, except perhaps one or both of them understanding that they're in a deadlock (which also kind of happens in the manga?). The biggest sin the manga commits is hitting the reset button a few too many times, or having interruptions that stall out plot development, but they're not that egregious about it.
