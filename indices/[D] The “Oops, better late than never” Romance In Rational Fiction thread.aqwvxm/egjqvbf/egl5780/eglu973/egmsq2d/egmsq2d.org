I actually think kaguya-sama did a fairly decent job at avoiding the romcom reset button trope. I was originally planning on writing a quick blurb about it but it turned into a character analysis through the entire series, so I'll put it at:

While the reset button is hit situationally to keep their relationship from changing too quickly, their characterization and dynamic does not stop evolving and makes what look initially look like a typical reset actually have significant differences in their attitudes towards each other and the "goal" of their mind games.

The pace being slowed by the other StuCo members having their own chapters and arcs is a valid complaint, but it helps keep the story well rounded and the rest of the cast from being a plot device to help/hinder their plans.
