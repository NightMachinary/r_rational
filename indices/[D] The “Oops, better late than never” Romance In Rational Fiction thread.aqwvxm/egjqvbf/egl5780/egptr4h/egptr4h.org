I'd actually like to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are only partially selfish and also remain moral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources, but only to use them for good, without totally sacrificing anything enjoyment wise.

Or someone who goes for total life optimisation, that is to say that the protagonist thinks "How can I gain utmost power and utmost enjoyment, AND do it morally? Surely if I am creative enough, the solution exists!"
