  rationality applied to an every day situation

I really like rational fiction as a vehicle for teaching people how to be more rational in their daily lives. I think the genre started primarily as an attempt to teach people how to reason more effectively. The exotic situations make the story entertaining, and the lessons are therefor better received. But then, there is a bit of a paradox--if people are to use what they've learned, they've got to see how it can apply in the everyday. An extraordinary setting puts extra distance between the reader and what they are supposed to take away from the story.

A story with an everyday setting makes the lessons more immediate. I'm glad you still found it entertaining.
