No, not really. Actual feedback, making a list as I go:

- When I read the first line, I was confused because I imagined Sarah as the speaker. I recommend moving the second sentence to the beginning of the next paragraph.

- “Uh huh.” should be “Uh-/huh/.”

- "I felt my teeth clench." is super relatable.

It's good. 👍
