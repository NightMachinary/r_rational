What are the chances that the new person becomes infected? If it is at all likely that he will spread the illness further, it would be reasonable to let himself perish instead. Even delaying past one Quickening event to pursue other goals seems unwise, since the newly infected will face the same issue and might choose to spread the illness further.

Werewolves are probably ruthlessly killed in that setting.
