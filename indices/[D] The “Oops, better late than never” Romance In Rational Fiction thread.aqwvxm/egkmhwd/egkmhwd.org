After a couple of successful months of publishing [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/31496223][Vampire Flower Language]] on schedule a year ago, shit hit the fan in my coauthor's personal life that culminating in her quitting the project, I went on holiday, and it all kind of went by the wayside. I'm hoping to revive it - it /is/ in my google docs almost complete bar some infill that needs to be done - but I need it to be edited properly, and have my coauthor run her eyes across each chapter and give me her blessing (I feel like the writing quality will be irreparably harmed by not having her write it "properly", but the perfect is the enemy of the good, so here we are).

That said, I'm going to be moving to Paris for 6 months this year, so realistically expect one or two chapters total. Maybe 2020 will be the year for it to work out :|

(If anyone wants to beta read, let me know and I'll invite you to the google doc)
