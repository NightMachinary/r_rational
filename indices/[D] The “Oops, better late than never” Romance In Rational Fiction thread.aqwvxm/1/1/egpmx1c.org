Hey, man. Just binged your story over the last day and have to say well done. Romances are often badly implemented but I'd say you did a pretty good job. I have slight complaints about it seeming to happen a little too quick but overall, pretty top tier. I definitely have to praise the usage of point of view you've done. In a bunch of web fictions, there is the issue where POV changes result in the same voice being expressed in different characters but the thinking style and personality that you expressed in each POV worked well to fit with each individual character.
