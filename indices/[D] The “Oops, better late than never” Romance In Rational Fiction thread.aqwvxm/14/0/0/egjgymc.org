#+begin_quote
  With the exception of explicitly a[sexual]/aromantic characters, realistically written characters will have at least a moderate value on romantic success.
#+end_quote

I'm sure there are more exceptions than /that/ to this so-called rule.

#+begin_quote
  A paranoid (or selfless) character who expects his enemies to target his romantic partners

  An even /more/ paranoid character who expects his romantic partners to betray him sooner or later
#+end_quote

Such characters are /not/ unrealistically written.
