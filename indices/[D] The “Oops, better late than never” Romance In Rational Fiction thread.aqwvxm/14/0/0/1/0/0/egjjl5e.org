People who were betrayed by romantic partners very rarely eschew romantic connections for the rest of their lives to the point where romantic connections are no longer one of their values at all.

A story doesn't have to have romance, obviously, but a character who completely drops romantic connections as a value feels like a bad excuse for not including romance in a story at all.
