Aren't romantic relationships built on the premise that said relationships will progress in a positive direction? The healthy, long-terms ones should be, at least.

Anticipating a downturn in the relationship is, in itself, a part of the downturn. It's more or less, "All romances work until the moment they don't." I doubt serious relationships are formed when someone involved thinks, "Wow, this will go down in flames!"

I think, in the context of fiction, a character who eschews romance after betrayal will be interpreted as an expression of the writer's political ideas, because the notion of such beliefs are so radical compared to social values that the model of a normal, ordinary person wouldn't do such a thing unless it's on purpose. And, well, I anticipate a reader dropping a book the moment its protagonist leans in the direction of that thinking, even if that thinking is completely reasonable, as the thought may not sit comfortably with readers without some extraneous rationale involved (sexism, racism, etc.).
