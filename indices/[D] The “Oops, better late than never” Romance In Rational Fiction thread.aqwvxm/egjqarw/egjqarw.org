It's less on the "rational" side of things, but /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ at least partly centers around a romance; it's one of the things that people tell me I did well on. Only read if you can handle finished but unpolished and unedited things, [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][here]]. (I wrote it, so take a rec here with a grain of salt.)
