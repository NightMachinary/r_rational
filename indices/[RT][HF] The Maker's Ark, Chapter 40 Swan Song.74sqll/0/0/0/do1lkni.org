Thanks. And let's see. I have the rough ideas of the Corporate War, the Externality War (probably more than one), the Great Dislocation (otherwise known as "Shit, the icecap melted and two billion people gotta move"), the Hatchling War (Over child care. Very bitter.) and the Air Conditioner War (that one was stupid, but no more stupid than a lot of Earth wars, and is the reason that Grs'thn doesn't have even more carbon tetraflouride in its atmosphere than it does now.)

Elder Trig fought in two of the wars, ran a refugee camp in the third, saw the rest, and has Opinions. You'll be hearing a few of them either in this book or in separate stories.
