Oh boy. Thank you. I stuffed too many ideas into The Maker's Ark, so I had to push the resolution of some of them into future stories to keep it from growing to A Storm of Swords level in length. Theoretically, I am 5-6 chapters from the end, and it could be done in 3 months. But it might be 8 chapters and 6 months.
