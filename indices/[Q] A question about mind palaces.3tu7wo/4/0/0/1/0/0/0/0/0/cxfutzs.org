It might be useful to look into the Image Occlusion addon for Anki. Basically, you take an image or graphic and cover up the bits you want to memorize, instead of writing cards or generating them.

The author has an example of using it to memorize every step in a graphic of a metabolic process, and I've successfully used it to learn some basic anatomy (major bones and muscles, I'm an engineering student not a med student).

That all more-or-less depends on the slides having some useful structure, instead of being blocks of text, tho. I'd still recommend spaced repitition for any of the things I've used it for, but that's foreign-language vocab and seldom-used formulae.
