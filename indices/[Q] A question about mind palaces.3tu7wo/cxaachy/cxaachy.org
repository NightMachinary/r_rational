Memory palaces are a real and effective way to memorize arbitrary information, though they fall down for some tasks, such as memorizing poetry. They take advantage of a quirk of the human mind--that we are better at quickly assimilating information about three dimensional layouts and spacial locations than we are at recaling arbitrary lists of disconnected infromation. This makes sense...knowing your way around a potentially dangerous location that you may have only visited once was selected in the ancestral environemnt, whereas memorizing digits of pi or state capitals was not.

Don't worry about filling your memory palaces too early. Competitors who use the technique can go through and "clear" their palaces (supposedly), though I've never gotten that to work for me. Your palaces will also clear themselves over time, though you might have some artifacts left over from before. You can also get creative with your locations, using places from games or movies or walking around your neighborhood while memorizing the information you want.
