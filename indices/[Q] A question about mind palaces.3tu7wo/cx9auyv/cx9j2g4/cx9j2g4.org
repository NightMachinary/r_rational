Second on that book rec, good stuff.

One of the competitors used to watch Grand Designs a lot to get more and more mind palaces, which I always thought was neat.

Edit: Within 20 minutes of reading a description of how to make a mind palace I'd remembered something like 20 pieces of bizzare and useless data, on the order of smoked salmon, director's chair, venison sausage, skintight, catsuit ect. A month later I could remember 19 of them. It is now 4 years later and I can still remember half of these things, and my memory for details is shit. Seriously, it's awful.
