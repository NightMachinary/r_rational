(My organogenesis course has fourteen sets of lecture slides, each on a topic which has nothing to do with any of the others, each one loaded with details--details which, like the stages of heart development or {which collagen types contribute to cartilage and bone and mopping up bone morphogenic protein past one cell layer in the parts of fruit fly ovaries that I've forgotten the name for already}, swiftly blur and fade from my mind a few slide sets after I've put one set down. This makes exam revision /concerning/. I haven't started on the attempt yet, but if I could acquire fourteen mental rooms (presumably copied from rooms I was familiar with), each filled with objects that I could go through one by one and be vividly reminded of one important forgettable detail from a slide--being able to tell when I was leaving something out, too--that would be invaluable to me. I have no idea whether it's feasible, though. (Perhaps linking each detail with each room-object in a memorable mental image..? I need to read more in preparation before starting, in any case, as long as I don't start too late.))
