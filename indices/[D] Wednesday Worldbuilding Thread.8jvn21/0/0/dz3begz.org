I'm interpreting what you've said to mean you are planning on having a globe about 100 km in diameter with an atmosphere extending 50-100 km away from it, with gravity likely being produced by an ultra-dense core. You would have a (magically?) contained fusion reaction at the edge of the atmosphere which rotates around the globe to simulate a sun, providing day/night cycles and seasons. Correct me if any of that is wrong.

Regarding radiation and UV exposure, I doubt there would be a significant increase. Remember that none of the sun's UV light is absorbed until it reaches our atmosphere. As long as it's still passing through 100 km of atmosphere before it gets to you, it's still going to be filtered in exactly the same ways. Solar flares would also be unlikely provided you have some means of inertial confinement to make the fusion reaction possible in the first place.

You're probably not going to need lenses to make tropical zones. The fact that your light source is so close will mean that things closer to it get more light and heat, while things further away from it get less. Seasons can be done easily if you have your light source gradually changing its path throughout the year.

Regarding gravity, a core of gold and platinum (approx. density of 20 grams/mL) would give you a surface gravity of about 2.8% of Earth's surface gravity. If you want Earth-like gravity, you'd need to use your inertial confinement magic/technology to build a small neutron star at the core of the planet to get enough mass for earth-like surface gravity. Alternatively, you can use a ringworld approach with surface gravity simulated through centripetal forces.

As long as you have gravity (or simulated gravity), an atmosphere, and heat, you'll have evapotranspiration cycles. An atmosphere of 50-100 km will work just like our atmosphere does.

  How would these things change in an expanding pocket world?

Depends on how it's expanding. Are we basically just injecting magma into the core and letting the surface slowly crack apart and fill with new land?

  How would surface level temperatures respond to increased distance from the "sun"? How much distance would it take to effect ambient temperatures, or create "Arctic" zones?
#+end_quote

This would be tricky. When you have huge temperature differences and only a short distance between them with no insulation, the temperature will rapidly equalize. Without barriers to block heat transfer, your best bet would be to make the 'arctic' areas a higher elevation above sea level than the other regions, and obviously not in an area where the 'sun' passes directly overhead. With increased elevation, warm air would have to rise to reach them, which would cause it to cool. With Earth-like gravity and atmospheric density, a rise of 4-5 km should be sufficient to get generally freezing temperatures.
