  What would be the results of having a pocket world (dimension) that used a small contained fusion reaction used as a light source (miniature sun)?
#+end_quote

The big problem would be overheating. In fact, that would be a problem without there being a sun. You either need a heatsink or to keep expanding it.

  How would life be effected by radiation and solar flares at a relatively close distance (50km? 100km?), inside the atmosphere and being a closed system? Would everyone have to live underground, or develop extreme UV exposure issues? Skin cancer epidemic?
#+end_quote

If you scaled down your star, then the radiation would get scaled down as well, so it would be no different than it is in real life. I'd be more worried about general energy levels than radiation. The atmosphere is equivalent to ten meters of water, which from what I understand is enough to filter out massive amounts of dangerous radiation.

  Could magnifying lenses be placed "in the sky" to increase ambient temperature in certain "planetary" areas?
#+end_quote

You could, but it seems like it would be easier just to move the sun. Also, you could consider bending the fabric of spacetime to create a lens (you can't really make a pocket dimension without bending spacetime) though I'm not sure that's any different than just moving the sun with an Alcubierre drive.

How exactly is this world shaped? I'm imagining a pocket dimension shaped like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere][3-sphere]] with a sphere that splits it in half and the sun in the middle of one of the hemispheres. Or a better but much harder to explain way: split the 3-sphere into two toruses and have the sun move through one. That sort of gets you a day/night cycle, though it never goes fully dark. It might be better to use that for seasons if you don't mind not having nights. The topology of that is pretty confusing. I'll try to find something that can explain it better if you want.

  Would evapotranspiration cycles still be able to work?
#+end_quote

I think so, as long as you have gravity. If you can emit time as well as space that's as simple as making time pass a tiny bit faster the higher up you go. Otherwise it gets more complicated. Maybe if you go with the torus method, but don't split the universe evenly and spin it properly.

  I imagine a world of semi - perminant "edge towns" or a migrating workforce that would follow the edge, exploring and finding new resources as they "came into being"?
#+end_quote

You want a pocket universe with a boundary? We have no physics for how that could work.

#+begin_quote
  How would surface level temperatures respond to increased distance from the "sun"? How much distance would it take to effect ambient temperatures, or create "Arctic" zones?
#+end_quote

Twice the distance cuts the incoming light down by a factor of four. Exactly how much that cools it depends on what you're using for a heat sink. On Earth we radiate light into space. Since the light radiated goes with the fourth power of temperature, four times the distance would mean sixteen times less light which means it would have half the temperature. But if energy is escaping through conduction then the temperature would be proportional to incoming light. And if it's not escaping then your world will overheat.

#+begin_quote
  Similarly, what effects would there be of having an Earth's "core" 50km below the surface?
#+end_quote

A hot one? You'll have more incoming heat to get rid of. Also, it will cool down relatively fast, though I'm not sure how fast. Maybe it will only take a million years instead of billions.
