What would be the results of having a pocket world (dimension) that used a small contained fusion reaction used as a light source (miniature sun)? How would life be effected by radiation and solar flares at a relatively close distance (50km? 100km?), inside the atmosphere and being a closed system? Would everyone have to live underground, or develop extreme UV exposure issues? Skin cancer epidemic?

Temperature at land level is temperate. Could magnifying lenses be placed "in the sky" to increase ambient temperature in certain "planetary" areas? Create tropical biomes?

How would one simulate seasons? Would fluctuations in the intensity of the "sun" be sufficient?

Would evapotranspiration cycles still be able to work? How else could one simulate a climate?

How would these things change in an expanding pocket world?

I imagine a world of semi - perminant "edge towns" or a migrating workforce that would follow the edge, exploring and finding new resources as they "came into being"?

How would surface level temperatures respond to increased distance from the "sun"? How much distance would it take to effect ambient temperatures, or create "Arctic" zones?

Similarly, what effects would there be of having an Earth's "core" 50km below the surface?
