Ooh, interesting. Why do you think this is a stretch for a rational fic? According to the characteristics of rational fiction listed to the right, my story emphatically qualifies. (Note: it's not a /rationalist/ fic, as there is the inclusion of a supernatural element. Although the supernatural element rarely, if ever, has a material effect on the plot; it's not a deus ex machina device. It's just another input in the characterization.) I know my fic is primarily family drama / romance / historical, but I would think the qualities that make a story rational could apply to any genre.

Just a note: no one is fucking in the very first chapter. They're just kissing.

Yes, the average, obvious play in the romance genre is to waste oodles of time on a will-they-or-won't-they scenario, with a final proposal or marriage at the end. So overdone. In my own experience of dating and marriage, dating is the shallowest part of the relationship. The real interesting stuff happens when you're in a committed relationship for the long haul and you have to deal with life, with each other (warts and all), with things like illness and raising a family and navigating the in-laws, etc.

Since this is a /Downton Abbey/ fic that covers 1914-1971 (the first three novels are complete, and the fourth and final novel will be starting up soon), the story is about a fascinating and turbulent period of history, as refracted through the marriage of two particular characters, one of whom is a pragmatist and the other of whom is a moral idealist (which is true to their canon portrayals). Their philosophical conflicts drive much of their interactions. I take a much more rational approach to the plotting, characterization, and historical accuracy of the story than the equivalent portion of the TV show does.

There are multiple crotch-rendezvous happening, given that they're married for decades, but all of the sex scenes have a purpose that goes beyond mere sex. I don't waste anybody's time just writing hot sex scenes for no reason.

I also don't waste time separating them with contrived and unbelievable plot devices, and there are no human villains in this story. The antagonistic forces all arise from the characters' personalities and from the medical, political, and economic forces of the historical period.
