Thanks for making me consider the group's aims, though, and ask questions about whether this story is a good fit. This has been an interesting discussion for me, helping me to better understand how the rational-fiction community defines itself. I only discovered you all a week or so ago, although everything that the community seems to advocate are things that I have long loved in a good story. My degrees are in computer science, and I can't bear dumb fiction with obvious plot holes and a general lack of deep examination. The movies Inception (omg, recursion!) and Interstellar (omg, circular logic and a totally implausible abuse of information theory!---although the robot designs were awesome) drove me a bit mad. And don't even get me started on Independence Day. :)

Unfortunately, period melodrama (particularly fanfic period melodrama) is rife with irrationality and cheap devices. Writing something that the reader can logically follow from A to B without contrivances is unusual in this domain.

Note: I don't consider T&P to be melodrama (i.e., over-the-top drama, with exaggerated emotions and unbelievable plot developments or characterizations), but I have instead gone out of my way to make it as realistic and truly dramatic as possible, demystifying much of the melodrama in canon and replacing it with something that has more true resonance. Maybe that's the key difference between drama and melodrama: drama is rational, melodrama is just ridiculous, heightened contrivances to milk readers' / viewers' emotions.
