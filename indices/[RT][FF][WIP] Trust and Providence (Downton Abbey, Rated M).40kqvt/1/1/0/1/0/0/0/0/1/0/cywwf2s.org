As [[/u/Charlie___]] has pointed out, Jane Austen (particularly her /Pride and Prejudice/) is a great example of rational thought applied to sociology and psychology. And it's a very tight, relatively brief novel. Definitely worth your time!

My favorite Jane Austen quote is: "Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition." â€• from /Sense and Sensibility/
