Hey, this is quite well written.

Don't trust the sidebar or the vote count too much :) What gets the most upvotes are are things that are good stories in a certain sort of "hard sf/f" genre, often by authors familiar to and/or with this online community. It does help if your protagonist ignores story conventions, or is a munchkin, or models thinking skills for the audience, but these are hardly mandatory.

So in some sense, this is obviously not a "[[/r/rational]] fic," because it isn't the right genre. I bet most people on here haven't even read a single Jane Austen novel.

The thing it really has going for it is the whole "characters ignoring genre conventions" part - starting a story with characters being honest with each other is, ceteris paribus, rationalist catnip. Sometimes you also do a good job showing us characters using sensible thinking processes, which is my main internal criterion for actually thinking of something as "rational fic." I don't think you quite make it all the way to that bar in the couple of chapters I've read, but neither do most stories on here, so whatever.
