Good point. But emotions often war with rational thinking, don't they? Unless someone is very self-aware and exercises a great deal more self-control than the average sort of person.

My aim was "to show actual believable humans getting to something like a right answer, via something like a good process," so I'm intrigued by the fact that you don't think I really achieved that. Looks like I have a lot more room to grow, then. :)
