Oh yeah, I know. :) Part of my goal in posting it was to ask the question of whether a fic like this really would be considered rational by the community, and to engage in exactly these kinds of interesting discussions. I like pushing boundaries in intelligent ways, which is what you guys seem to like doing, too. Felt like my tribe, even if I'm not playing with scifi and fantasy systems in this particular fic. (Although I have played with them in plenty of my other fics... :)
