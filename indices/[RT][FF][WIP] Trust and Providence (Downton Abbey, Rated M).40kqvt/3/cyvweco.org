I find it relatively easy to believe that it technically fulfills all the characteristics of Rational Fiction (see sidebar). That said, [[/u/rcobleigh]], this probably isn't the right place to post your story, simply because the audience here doesn't want to hear this type of story

EDIT: This isn't to say that you /shouldn't/ post here, but that it would probably get downvoted - as it did. I'm glad to see the post is not in the negatives anymore.
