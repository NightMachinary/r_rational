Great points! Yes, I think Jane Austen basically invented the "rational romance" genre, since her work was largely in the context of / in response to the Sir Walter Scott style melodramatic Gothic romances that were very popular in that era.

The topic of "sensible thinking processes", when discussing human psychology and sociology, is a rather complex (and yes, fuzzy) topic. I'd agree with your assessment that I haven't made either of my main characters the epitome of emotionless, purely logical thought. Like any strong characters, they've got backstories, contradictory drives (i.e., physical, emotional), and inherited belief systems that make for an interesting mix of external behaviors. One of them is a lawyer, so he's a bit more internally consistent, trained in logic, and self-aware in his thinking, but he's also a human being, not a robot, and he's a person of strong faith in a Christian worldview, so that adds layers, some of which might not be perceived as "sensible", depending on the reader. :)
