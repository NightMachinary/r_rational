Basically, the rationalists have already optimized our set of physical laws. We have pushed raw physics to the limit and developed amazing technologies. There aren't a bunch of low-hanging fruit in modern society for a rationalist main character to pick up / use / do. That being said, you can still write suck a work set in our reality, it's just not obviously easy.

A rational version of Naruto is easy because you just say "well, let's really think about this set of rules" which nobody ever did when writing Naruto. You find exploits and patch them or abuse them and it comes out looking sharp.

In our reality, though, people spend TONS of time thinking "let's really think about this set of rules" and then they develop MIMO communication or make transistors a bit better or decide to codify a set of laws that allows for trials of a certain kind or something. This has already been done a lot, see?

So Rational fics set in our reality need to be more clever and subtle to get the same thing across. They still exist and they're great, but for a beginning writer (like me) it's easier to have a supernatural element and say "well, what would people rationally do here" since I can pick low-hanging fruit.

E: all that being said, I'm a downton abbey fan, and I'll check this fic out despite the intimidating word count
