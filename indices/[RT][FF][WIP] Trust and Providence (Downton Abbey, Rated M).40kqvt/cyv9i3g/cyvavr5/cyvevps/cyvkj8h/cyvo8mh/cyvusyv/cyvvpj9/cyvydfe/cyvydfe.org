Ah, I see what you mean. Yeah, my fic isn't a thought experiment that explores the natural laws of our reality. It's a thought experiment that explores human psychology, both individual and in group dynamics, set in a specifically-identifiable period of human history. I have a lot of fun exploiting the spaces that Julian Fellowes left in /Downton Abbey/ (and there are many). Logic applied in a different dimension of existence.

So you guys normally like discussing the rules of science fiction and fantasy systems, not the humanities?

If you want me to delete this post, I will. I also recommend that the mods consider tightening up the definition of "rational fiction" for the purposes of this subreddit, so people like me don't stumble in. :)
