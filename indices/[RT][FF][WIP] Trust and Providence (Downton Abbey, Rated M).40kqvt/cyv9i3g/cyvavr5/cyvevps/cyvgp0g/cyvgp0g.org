True, you can be rational in a universe with supernatural elements, but I don't consider my story a rationalist fic because I don't try to demystify those elements in my fic using rationalist or scientific methods, and it's not an exemplar of rationalist techniques. Those elements are just assumed to be there, and they function in a way that illuminates the characters' psychology. There is a certain degree of puzzle-solving, in the sense that if you're familiar with the show and you think for a bit about my AU premise, you'll probably see where the fic is headed. Of course, the question then becomes: is the trip still worth it? I don't generally write with the intention of dropping bombshells on my readers, but rather with the intention of provoking clear thought about the psychology and dynamics of the situations that the characters find themselves in. And, if I get it right, with emotional resonance as well.

You don't need to have seen /Downton Abbey/, or be familiar with the characters, situation, or genre of historical romance to be able to follow this fic (although of course knowledge of all those things adds a dimension to the experience). It probably helps to have a rough familiarity with that period of Western history (i.e., when WWI and WWII happened). One of my beta readers, who has been with me since the beginning, has never seen the TV show and doesn't intend to, as far as I know. She's helped me make sure this story can stand on its own two legs.
