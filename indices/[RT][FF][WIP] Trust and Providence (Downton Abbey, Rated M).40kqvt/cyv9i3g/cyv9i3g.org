Hmm. I skimmed the first chapter, I think it's a bit of a stretch for [[/r/rational]].

I did find it interesting that people are fucking and proposing on the very first chapter, especially considering the 400k words that follow. I don't read the genre at all, but my impression is that the smart play in romance is to tease things out over a suitable period of time, with the inevitable and much anticipated crotch-rendezvous providing something of a catharsis for the reader. Is that not the case?
