  The quest to become a lich is a lengthy one. While construction of the magical phylactery to contain the spellcaster's soul is a critical component, a prospective lich must also learn the secrets of transferring his soul into the receptacle and of preparing his body for the transformation into undeath, neither of which are simple tasks. Further complicating the ritual is the fact that no two bodies or souls are exactly alike---a ritual that works for one spellcaster might simply kill another or drive him insane. *The exact methods for each spellcaster's transformation are left to the GM's discretion*, but should involve expenditures of hundreds of thousands of gold pieces, numerous deadly adventures, and a large number of difficult skill checks over the course of months, years, or decades.

Plus some additional rules on creating the phylacteries, but that only takes some gold and "Craft Wonderous Item".
