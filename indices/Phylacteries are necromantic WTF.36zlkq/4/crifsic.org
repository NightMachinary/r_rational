Phylacteries keep you animated and thinking. They don't keep your heart beating or your lungs breathing. They let you ignore clinical death; they don't prevent it or heal you afterwards.

If the world you're thinking of has a different type of phylactery, then maybe it would be appropriate for a cleric to use them.
