I recall reading about 'good' liches.

I can't remember if it was faerun or one of the other settings but it boiled down to a procedure performed by elves where by their elders could volunteer to be a kind of gaurdian ancestor for the family lineage.

There is also in the libris mortis a few less then evil ways of becoming sentient undead that are no where near as evil.

Cities where its considered a civil right of passage after you've reached an age past child bearing to just 'become a sentient zombie' and several other things.

Hell even in Pathfinder the psudo egypt like undead necro-civilization with the 'evil wizard' is actually a pretty chill place and not exactly all that bad. Everyone who does not become an intelligent undead is considered a conscript on death to the government (either for unskilled labor or a soldier) so really the biggest problem in that setting is that class defines whether you live forever and in what form (vampires, wraiths, ghouls, shadows and lots of the 'spawning' undead are fun).

Also there is a fun prestige class in savage species based on the premise of "emancipated spawn" who are people that can be restored after being turned into things like shadows via str damage.
