  Well, it's not known that there's an afterlife in HPMoR.

HPMoR also doesn't have liches, phylacteries, necromancers, or clerics. So I don't think it's really applicable. It does have horcruxes, but those aren't really the same as phylacteries, and if there was necromancy, they would definitely be necromantic because they're fueled by a death.

But yeah, there are a ton of settings where the rules are different, even if I can't think of one off the top of my head that has liches and clerical magics but doesn't have a heaven. It probably exists though.
