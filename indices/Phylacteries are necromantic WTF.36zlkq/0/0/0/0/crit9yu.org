Terminology. Horcruxes are basically phylacteries, and Voldemort is basically a lich. Abracadabra is kind of necromancy as well.

And by now pretty much all the settings with liches and clerical magics are derived from D&D, which is a really low grade source of mythology. Not that Harry Potter is much better, but at least it's not Yet Another D&D Campaign Writeup.
