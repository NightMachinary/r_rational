Eh, it depends what you wanted to do with your necromancy. If you wanted the 'necromancy' style of setting all your feats on fire to be the master of save-or-dies, Wizards could be quite effective.

My favorite primer for necromancy in 3.5 is the [[http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1049211][revised necromancer's handbook]] (strong, amusing writing).
