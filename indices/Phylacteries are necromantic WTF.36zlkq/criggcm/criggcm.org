Originally, in D&D, all life-related magic was necromantic. That included healing spells as well, meaning that phylacteries being necromantic didn't have a negative connotation. Not just because of the spell school name, that is.

Also, in D&D (or at least 3.5 and below D&D), clerics made the best necromancers, with wizards being relatively crappy ones in comparison.
