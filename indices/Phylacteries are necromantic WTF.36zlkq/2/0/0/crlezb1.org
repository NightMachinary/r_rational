Don't be disappointed! Dread Necromancer's /Lich Transformation/ is way better.

Under normal circumstances, it costs a hefty stack of gold, XP, and time (both in crafting the phylactery, and in the quest that the text suggests the DM ought to throw at you) to become a lich, and then once you do become a lich, you pick up a +4 LA template.

The Dread Necromancer turns you into a lich COMPLETELY FOR FREE. No gold. No time. No XP. And most importantly, it doesn't apply the lich template to your character, so no +4 level adjustment -- you still count as level 20 instead of level 24.
