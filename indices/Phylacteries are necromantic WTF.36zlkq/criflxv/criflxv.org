So almost all phylactery creation in fiction that I have seen involves doing unspeakable evil - killing people, shearing away parts of your own soul, etc in order to make your soul into a nice small tidy package that can be preserved. It is more of a making a deal with the God of Death by sacrificing others to him and becoming someone or proving yourself to be someone that is in line with that God's will.

For example the Pathfinder method of becoming a lich involves:

  Once the phylactery is completed, it must be placed on an altar to a death god which you must construct from black onyx (500 gp) in a process that takes 8 days. With all the etchings and enchantments done, requiring you to expend 6 hours and two whole levels of spell slots each day, you are ready to transfer your soul to the phylactery. With an evil outsider watching over (it is impossible for them to interfere, via the power of the ritual), you must sacrifice one of your race who is twice as young as you and another who is twice as old (to a max age of the maximum age for your race), as per the ritual. Their souls are consumed by the black onyx altar where you will slay yourself using your most potent necromancy spell. Your soul will travel through the black onyx into the phylactery where it will be activated, coming your passage into lichdom. The evil outsider is automatically dismissed to wherever they came from and the black onyx altar dissipates from the site. The altar becomes a tribute to the death god you dedicated it to, your name being engraved throughout it as your soul was channeled through it.

Pretty obviously necromantic.
