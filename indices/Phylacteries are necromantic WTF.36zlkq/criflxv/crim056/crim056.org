I think they generally just imply that it's unspeakably evil. When they actually list requirements, munchkins find non-evil ways to do it. If you just need to destroy someone's soul, use the soul of someone that's evil. Save them from a fate far worse.

I've heard of other methods that are even easier, like the heart of a baby (anesthetize and cast regenerate after).

And even if you find something that's necessarily evil, no matter how evil it is, it's still worth it if it lets you prevent two necromancers.
