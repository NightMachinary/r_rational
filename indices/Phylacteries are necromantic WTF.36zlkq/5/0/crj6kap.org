I read a pretty cool book, I forget the name(If anyone cares enough, I'll find it in my library of books on my PC at home), where the main character is a Lich, and a good guy.

He was a wizard of a battle-mage circle from a lost ancient civilization where any student that reached mastery status(approximately half of whom were expected to, in general) was taught the spell to create a phylactery and become a lich to keep their knowledge around for the younger generations (and coincidentally live forever, as this version had the whole body-stealing from anyone who got too close to their phylactery if their old body was obliterated - The ancient civilization had laws where people who were to be sentenced to death could have their body granted to a lich instead - The soul of the person whose body was possessed explicitly passed on to the afterlife, etc.).

It was a very mechanically interesting setting, and pretty rational about how it handled magic. No spell was explicitly evil, even if it could be viewed as evil.

Edit:

Author Jim Farris.

Book 1 - Mage

Book 2 - Ravin of Yorindar

Book 3 - Arc of Time

Book 4 - The Wench of Woe

Book 5 - The Mountain, The Raven and the Sea

Book 6 - The Game of the Gods

I found books 1-3 the most entertaining. Books 4-6 felt kind of... tacked on.
