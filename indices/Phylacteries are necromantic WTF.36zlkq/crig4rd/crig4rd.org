In pretty much any setting that allows for a lich, there is also an afterlife. The lich is /not/ preserving life, he's forestalling death, and not even doing it that well given that his body is still dead. If there were literally heaven and hell, what would you think about the man who went to great lengths and severe disfigurement in order to avoid the afterlife altogether? You certainly wouldn't think he expected to go to heaven, would you?
