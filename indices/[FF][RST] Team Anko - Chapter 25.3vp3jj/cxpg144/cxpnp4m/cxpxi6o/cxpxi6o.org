I might have lost track a bit here, but AFAICS knowledge granting ought to be doable.. but obviously modifying the brain creates such huge trust issues that yeah, it would be pretty irrational for Kurama to do so, even if it hugely increases Naruto's survivability.

Of course, there's no guarantee he hasn't already done so (eg. preprogrammed parts of Naruto's brain so that he will 'pick up' the needed skills with unusual aptitude). The problem is more of saying things that invoke distrust.
