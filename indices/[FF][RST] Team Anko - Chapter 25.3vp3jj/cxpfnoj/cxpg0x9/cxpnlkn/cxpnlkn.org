  Well of course he's nice! I mean, yes, he's a city-destroying elder demon, but look at how polite he's being, and how he just rebuilt Naruto into a massive inhuman combat monster. I mean, sure, the fact that Naruto can't even stand up right now might be considered a drawback, but it's still awesome, right? Right?!

Of course! I mean, he only destroys /evil/ cities anyways, so that's perfectly fine!

How do we know he only destroys evil cities? Well, Kurama told us of course, silly, and why would he lie?
