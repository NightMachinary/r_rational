Notice that bit at the end where Kurama convinces Naruto that all this could have been avoided if he just got permission to mess with Naruto's brain? He may be a lot nicer here but he's gone from "imprisoned and assumed evil" to "napping on a mountain with near unrestricted access on the horizon."

He's probably not evil but that doesn't mean he isn't planning on restricting Naruto to weekend custody of his body.
