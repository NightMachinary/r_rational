  The basis of the Lorite order is Saunt Lora's Proposition which states that all possible ideas have already been found, in other words, there is nothing new to discover. The Proposition itself is considered to be the Last Idea, although after the death of Saunt Lora, one of her fids showed that her proposition had itself been expressed 4000 years earlier.
