Yea, that's fair. I started getting really annoyed with canon's treatment of the Sharingan. I mean, from inception, it seemed really OP already. Copying any ninjutsu, reading body movements at superhuman speed, casting genjutsu with a glance. But then they kept adding on more shit. Oh hey, I can trap anyone I want in a 3 day long torture fest, and I can shoot black flames that take 7 days to go away. Oh, and I can make a big ass, practically impenetrable suit of armor that also has weapons that are equally as good. Oh, I can sacrifice sight in a single eye. *And reverse my death, after it's already happened.*

EDIT: Oh. And I can control any of the nine walking natural disasters of our world at any time.

Get fucked canon Sharingan.
