  Yes, but the Fox didn't attack Konoha due to those things, is what I'm saying. It attacked because Madara Uchiha hijacked it.

Fair point. I'm going off book on that one though, because I think it's utter baloney that a human with spinny eyeballs could control the Fox. I'm also off book on how long he's been captured -- in my version, the Sage put the Beasts into jinchuuriki from the get-go.
