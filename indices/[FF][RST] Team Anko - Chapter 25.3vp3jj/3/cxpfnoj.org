Also.....Kurama seems way too fucking nice, and it's honestly concerning me. I want to believe him when he says he only attacks places with build ups of malice (which is kind of canon, only for you to realize Konoha wasn't such a place, as it was Tobi that made him attack it anyway) but I'm kinda concerned. What with the whole eldritch abomination thing he's got going. Is he nice now [[/u/eaglejarl]]? Is he??? T_T
