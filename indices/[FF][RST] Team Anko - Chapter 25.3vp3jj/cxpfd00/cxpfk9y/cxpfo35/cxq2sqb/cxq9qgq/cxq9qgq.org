Nah, Afi was completely straightforward about the fact that he was evil. He just didn't feel like going out world conquering and such, but when he did he had no problem creating living people ex nihilo just so that he could immediately destroy their souls and turn them into undead monsters.

In contrast, Kurama is a nice guy. Really. He said so, even!
