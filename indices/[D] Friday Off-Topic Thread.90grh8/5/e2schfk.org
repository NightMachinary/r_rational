I stopped reading To The Stars a few days ago, and I regret needing to. It has some fun military science fiction, good world building, and I think is decently well written. I don't have any real problems with the execution. But I just cannot get over the premise of magical girls. Hundreds of years in the future, with space ships and FTL and AI, humanity's most elite warriors are prepubescent teenage girls wearing frilly dresses shouting named attacks. Not only that, but the older ones often choose to look extremely young, often around 14, with one character who heads an intelligence agency choosing to look 9. I just can't take it seriously. It's like watching a court drama where one of the lawyers is dressed up in full clown makeup and dress, and everyone else is treating it as completely normal, or explaining the psychological effect that the squeaky red nose has on the jury.

If you are able to get past that, then I would recommend it. It's fun sci-fi. But I just can't get into it. I read about 20 chapters in, so I gave it a fair shot.
