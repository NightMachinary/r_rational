  It's like watching a court drama where one of the lawyers is dressed up in full clown makeup and dress, and everyone else is treating it as completely normal, or explaining the psychological effect that the squeaky red nose has on the jury.

Ah, "Ultimate Attorney Pagliacci"! That was a good show.

No, jokes aside, I think what you're describing is a significant part of just what makes anime anime. Dissonant or out-of-place concepts are a weird taste - sometimes an acquired one - but I think most anime fans end up actually enjoying it. Madoka Magica is actually a pretty straightforward Magical Girl setting with a dark twist, but there's weirder stuff. Heck, I think Strike Witches is pretty much what you're describing, except with WW2 instead of an interstellar conflict.
