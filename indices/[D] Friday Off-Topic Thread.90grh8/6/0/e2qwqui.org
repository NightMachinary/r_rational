I think the weird existential philosophical horror is an interesting part of WtC but also... of course the characters would prefer that horror to not exist. 'Interesting' doesn't necessarily mean 'good', and rebelling against something can be interesting, too.

Your criticism, as a general criticism, doesn't make much sense to me.
