I recently got around to reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][/Worth the Candle/]] after seeing it posted here a zillion times, and this passage at the end of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27497037][Chapter 36]] really made me roll my eyes.

  "I don't want Fenn to change because her loyalty metric increased. I want her loyalty metric, if she's going to have one, to just be a reflection of how loyal she is, not an invisible lever controlling her. I want her to be a real person, or at least as real as I am. And... I'm hesitant to want that for everyone else in Aerb, because sometimes existence is pain, but... if they're not going to be real, or at least as real as I am, then I want them to be real enough that I can't tell the difference. I want that for the whole of Aerb, alright? I want to poke at the seams and find out that you thought of everything. And at the end of it, I want Arthur back. That's the only way that this game is ever going to be worth the candle."*

This passage reminds me very strongly of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200][/The Unincorporated Man/]], which was extremely disappointing because the protagonist's goal was /literally/** the destruction of what made the setting interesting (the division of every human into shares that could be traded freely on the stock market) and all his actions were directed toward that goal. /Worth the Candle/ seems to be pursuing a similar path, in the long run...

*Insert obvious CinemaSins joke here. (Actually, I unsubscribed from him quite a while ago, after his /Mad Max: Fury Road/ video included a diatribe against the fat-shaming of Immortan Joe's milk slaves, so I don't know whether he's still making that joke.)\\
**IIRC---I read it only once, quite a few years ago.
