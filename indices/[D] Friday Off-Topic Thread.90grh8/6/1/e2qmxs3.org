What exactly do you find interesting about WtC's setting, and in what way does Joon wanting to change it make the story less enjoyable to you?

(Personally, what make WtC's setting interesting to me isn't any one thing, but the sheer amount of novel, unique ideas, many of which could carry an entire setting by themselves, yet all somehow manage to feel like part of a coherent whole.)
