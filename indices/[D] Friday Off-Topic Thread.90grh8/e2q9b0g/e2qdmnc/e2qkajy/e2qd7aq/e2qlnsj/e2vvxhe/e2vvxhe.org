I think that learned reflex will slowly fade away if you aren't careful enough to maintain the consistent rewards to your brain for clicking on that tab. Though one problem with artificially maintaining such a reward system is that I'm not sure what could work as the reward itself. Some people recommend giving yourself something tasty (small snacks, a fruit, etc) but what if food itself doesn't do much for someone?

In either case would be interesting to hear an update on this in 1-2 weeks or so.
