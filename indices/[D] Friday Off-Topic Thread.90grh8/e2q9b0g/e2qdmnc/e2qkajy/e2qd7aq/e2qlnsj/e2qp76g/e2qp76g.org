I used to use Scrivener, which seems very similar, and wrote ~4 novels and two novellas using it, totaling ~500K words. I think there are definitely some benefits, but those benefits are geared more toward professional publication or intensive, small scale editing. If all I want to do is put words on paper, then it's better to have something lightweight, and while I wouldn't consider Google Docs to be lightweight, it does its job well enough so long as you don't go over a certain word limit, which I avoid by splitting the project up into chapters. My current project is at ~600K words and working well within that framework, though I would probably convert it into a different form if I intended to do intensive editing rather than preparing chapters for immediate release as a web serial.

(I /am/ curious whether yWriter runs into performance problems once past 200K words, because Scrivener definitely did, though that might be because the developers put their priorities toward the Mac version and I was using the PC version.)
