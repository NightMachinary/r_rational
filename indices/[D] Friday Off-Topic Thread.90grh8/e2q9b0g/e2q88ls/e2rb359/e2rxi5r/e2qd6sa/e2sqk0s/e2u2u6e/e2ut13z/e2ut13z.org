I think this is a good point, but the same challenge is more or less faced by sharing posterior probabilities. And the way you get around it is by fitting some continuous function to explain the probability, or just using graphs, or reporting particularly important models. And I think the same sorts of strategies can help when reporting probability updates rather than final probabilities, with bonus points for reporting your data in an easy-to-use way.
