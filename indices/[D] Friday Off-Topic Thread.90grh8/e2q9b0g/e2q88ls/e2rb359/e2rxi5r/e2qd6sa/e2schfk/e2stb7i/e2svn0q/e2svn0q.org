Yeah, the characters were somewhat bland. I don't think it's really bad enough to knock points off for it though.

What really gets me is that it would be so easy to fix. Mandate that they have to be at least 18 or so before going out to fight. Old enough that I don't get the constant feeling of "these are prettily dressed child soldiers", old enough to actually make somewhat adult decisions. Make their magical uniform thing changeable, and then have them wear something that isn't a frilly dress. Something that doesn't make me think of that Family Guy skit where Peter is dressed as a clown in Vietnam saying "see, they're *looking* for guys in army uniforms." STOP CALLING THEM MAGICAL GIRLS. And finally have them maybe choose cherubic or very youthful faces, but not make them look like actual children. It's copying that fucking weird anime trope of "it's not creepy because I'm not a child, I'm actually hundreds of years old!". Just burn that trope with fire.

None of these would seriously impact the plot if a few minor changes were made and some numbers shuffled around. I can stomach some minor stuff like the advanced alien race that is trying to reverse entropy apparently doesn't notice the male gender, or super powers, magic, whatever. That's all stuff I've gotten accustomed to mostly. And then I could actually enjoy the story.
