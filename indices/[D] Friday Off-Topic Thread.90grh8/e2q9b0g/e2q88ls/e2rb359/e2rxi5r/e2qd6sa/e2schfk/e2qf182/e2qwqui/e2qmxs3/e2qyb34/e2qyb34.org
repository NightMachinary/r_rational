Oops. My previous comment originally was going to be a complaint against how selfless, goody-two-shoes protagonists are boring in comparison to such selfish, edgy protagonists as [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/25076][Paul/Grayven]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][Howard Roark]]. However, I failed to invest enough effort into that version of the comment to complete it. Still wanting to get some (You)s from this week's thread rather than waiting for next week's, I hastily tried to rework the comment into a complaint about protagonists who seek to destroy the interesting parts of their respective settings. However, on further reflection it turns out that the second complaint is very weak with respect to /Worth the Candle/ (which wouldn't be much worse if the protagonist lacked the game layer but still had his prodigious learning abilities), and I don't have any other examples of this phenomenon (other than /The Unincorporated Man/), so I'll just switch to the first complaint instead. Feel free to downvote me for accidentally getting (You)s under false pretenses due to laziness.

  What exactly do you find interesting about WtC's setting?
#+end_quote

The game layer and the protagonist's ability to gain power much more quickly than other characters, both of which open up many interesting paths for the protagonist's progression through the world. (My previous comment is based on the incorrect assumption that it's only the game layer that I like.)

  In what way does Joon wanting to change it make the story less enjoyable to you?

In fairness, Juniper hasn't /taken action/ (or even /been able/ to take action) to destroy the game layer, in contrast to Justin Cord, who (again, IIRC) /did/ take action to destroy the institution of incorporation in /The Unincorporated Man/. However, the quote presented in my previous comment illustrates how Juniper's mindset closes off options, and even the /contemplation/ of options, that might make the story more interesting.

Let's look at the quote presented above. Should Juniper discover that he could increase Fenn's loyalty level by spending experience points (or just generic magical power, if the game layer doesn't exist), he would refuse to do it, without engaging in any significant amount of internal debate. That's closing off an entire fascinating avenue of the game layer (or of soul magic), for no reason other than a moral quibble. Similarly, would Lantern Paul assimilate Superman with the orange light if Paul knew that he (Paul) could do a better job of protecting Earth if he did so? No, because he doesn't want to take agency away from other people---and that closes off an entire fascinating avenue of growth for Lantern Paul's abilities.

In-story, Juniper /literally complains/ when a character intentionally increases her loyalty level toward him, because he value's that character's agency over her usefulness to him. What a boring little goody two-shoes.
