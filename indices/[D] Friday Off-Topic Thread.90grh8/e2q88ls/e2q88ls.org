I've started a civilization Quest on Sufficient Velocity: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/something-new-under-the-sun-rats-who-are-also-farmers-civ-quest.49105/][Something New Under the Sun; Or, Rats Who Are Also Farmers Quest]]. You are a colony of rats who have suddenly and inexplicably been enlightened with the knowledge of agriculture and the potential to learn much, much more. But you are still small and very delicious in a world that is full of large and very hungry predators.

It's not explicitly rational, which is why I'm posting it here, but I think it may be of interest to a few of you. Right now we're still in colony generation.

It was inspired by [[/u/xamueljones]]' description of a quest about a "street rat with above average cultivation talent," which I and another person initially misunderstood as being about, well, Rats Who Are Also Farmers.
