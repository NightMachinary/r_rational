MagicWeasel's personal life overshare, go!

Just got back from a great fun holiday, and had my first day back at work yesterday (people thought I was crazy having my first day on a Friday, but it was great: I was at work and suddenly aware of how much being at work sucks, but I now have two days to recover before I have to face the reality of my job requiring me to work 5 days a week).

Anyway, it turns out that my application for an EOI in another department got accepted while I was away, so on Thursday I will stop being a project manager and start working in the road safety department! An EOI is a "temporary transfer/promotion" where you fill in for someone in another department who has left, and then go back to your original job at the end. Mine is unfortunately not a temporary promotion, it's just a sideways move, but I think those of you who read my offtopic threads about my dissatisfaction with my current job (specifically the management) will know how excited I am to both learn new skills and have a change of management. So yeah, that's gonna happen! I'm excited.

In terms of writing I have missed so many self-imposed deadlines for VFL and I don't like to blame other people but seriously it's all my coauthor's fault - but she's going to be in a much better position soon and I might give her my PC since I'm planning on upgrading so she'll actually have her own computer, maybe, instead of having to borrow a laptop from her work.
