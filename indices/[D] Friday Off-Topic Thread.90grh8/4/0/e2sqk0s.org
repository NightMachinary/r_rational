I think there's a distunction between updating on data and making predictions. When publishing analyses of data the prior doesn't matter too much - you just build models and find their [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/share-likelihood-ratios-not-posterior-beliefs.html][likelihood ratio]]. But when you make a prediction, you need a prior and you need to review the other evidence available to you.
