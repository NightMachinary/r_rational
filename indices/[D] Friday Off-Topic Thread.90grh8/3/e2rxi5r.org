Just thought I'd share a few life details: I quit my job at the end of June (after giving proper notice), and left the state of Oregon entirely. I am now living a quasi-nomadic lifestyle, staying with family and friends. (I haven't yet verified whether I can collect unemployment, but I have been filling out the paperwork just in case. It kind of looks like I will be getting a check.)

At my job I was doing computer software support with a small amount of programming, whereas I mainly wanted to be doing programming. My former employer only hires programmers who have a degree, and I had only completed about a year's worth of college. So I was gradually getting bored and discontent, and was confronted about the fact that I apparently wasn't giving it my all any more. They moved me to a position with an MySQL coding emphasis about 3 months before I quit, but by then I had the bug to move, so I did.

Now I'm in Georgia, staying with a retired space engineer and contributing to the Seed Factory project, which is adjacent to self replicating robotics. The project's work is mainly not physical at this point, so much as gathering information and planning. However, physical proximity will make it possible to stay involved, and Dani has offered me a place to stay while I attend a local school a few miles away.
