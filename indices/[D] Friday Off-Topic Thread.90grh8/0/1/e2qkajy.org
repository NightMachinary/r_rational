Regarding self-improvement via muscle memory, I had a bad habit I'd been trying to break for years, then one day I decided to try this technique where I would snap my fingers every time I did it. This didn't really do anything other than draw my attention to the fact that I was doing it; eventually I would snap my fingers before doing the thing, and then finally I would snap my fingers and not do the thing at all. It helped way more than anything I had tried before. Unfortunately, I seem to have regressed recently, after about a year of enjoying being free. RIP :(

Regarding writing, I found that I can be way more productive if I write in a notebook (far away from my computer, I mean, like, a mile away from my apartment, for example) and copy into the computer later. Doesn't help with editing though.
