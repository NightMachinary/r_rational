I've noticed recently that I have a muscle-memory habit of clicking on my right-most tab when I have a moment of distraction, and apparently I can make drastic increases to my productivity solely by positioning my active writing project as the [right]-most tab. This works better for me than productivity "rewards" seem to, and I'm trying to think about the pitfalls and possibilities for other things.

I think the biggest problem long-term is going to be the wearing down of muscle memory, since the muscle memory seems to be keyed to "need a distraction". Any advice for building muscle memory back up, or self-improvement that uses it? It's surprisingly effective for me, in a way that things like blocking specific sites is (somewhat) ineffective.
