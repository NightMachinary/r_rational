  Any advice for building muscle memory back up, or self-improvement that uses it? It's surprisingly effective for me, in a way that things like blocking specific sites is (somewhat) ineffective.

My personal workflow is to always have two accounts on every computer: a games account and a work account.

The games account has steam and battlenet shortcuts with auto-login, bookmarks to Youtube and Inoreader (my RSS feed aggregator), stuff like that. It helps me avoid distraction, by explicitly switching between a "work" mode and a "browse reddit and play overwatch" mode. These days, my workflow is even more segregated, because I use a desktop PC with windows for games, and a laptop in a different room with linux installed for work.
