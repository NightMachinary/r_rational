Man i wasn't even thinking about the potential theological issues of heresy in a world that has explicitly God given powers, man how bad would it be for them all if suddenly they had no priestly healing? And in the same view of the Gods Below taking back the Name of Black Knight previously?

I do really like Arnauld even if he's definitely not the most charismatic there's something to be said to his loyalty to Procer over any single person, I really want to see his response to The First Prince's decision to drudge up an Angel corpse. Also that Cordelia's been pushed to the point of survival over anything else rather than keeping her previous prejudices against Cat.

Also that while many a Prince lost their title and metaphorical crown that we might not have seen the so called Princes Graveyard yet. emphasis on the yet.
