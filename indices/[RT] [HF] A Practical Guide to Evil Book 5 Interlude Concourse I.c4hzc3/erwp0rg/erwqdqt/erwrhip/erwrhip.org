I actually cackled at that. Just like, "holy shit, they can learn!" I can just imagine Cordelia's though process as she tries to explain it to everyone:

"Sorry, but that person we pissed away 30,000 men trying to slaughter, and then beat up all our heroes, and then we denounced as the anti-christ over the actual demon summoner who allied with the Dead King, and then counter-invaded us, and then countered our counter attack with Evil elves and an actual god sworn to Below literally following her around and declaring her their high priest, and then fought off the entire grand alliance including our battalion of heroes a second time, both times trying to minimize /our/ casualties, and then dethroned a third of Procer?

We should probably stop fucking with her."
