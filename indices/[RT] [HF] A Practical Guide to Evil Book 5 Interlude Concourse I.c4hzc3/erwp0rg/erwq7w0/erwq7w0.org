I wonder if she had already planned for this before she knew about the seven Princes that had lost their Princehood? I mean Cat was aware of the need to keep Cordelia's enemies in the Highest assembly alive and hampering her, but was Cordelia planning on this from the start or was she driven to this extreme by the loss of her home Province?

In all fairness what she was doing was more or less within the written rules while violating the spirit of them, or more bluntly before if she got a number of Prince's killed/removed whoever followed them would have been aware that she got their relatives killed for power, and might have made her support less confident in her.

Man it would be pretty funny if at some point the land that Cordelia is Prince of was invalidated by oh i dunno it's complete destruction and that that invalidates her claim to the title of Prince which then invalidates her ability to be the First Prince?
