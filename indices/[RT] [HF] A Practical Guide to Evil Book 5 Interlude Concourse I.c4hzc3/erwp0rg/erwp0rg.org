Remember how Cat and Cordelia were discussing the drawbacks of having to answer to the Highest Assembly, and why she didn't take the opportunity to become an absolute ruler after the Proceran civil war? And Cat pointed out that most of her opposition was in the army passing through the Stairway? Looks like Cordelia finally gave in to the temptation, in light of the Dead King invading.
