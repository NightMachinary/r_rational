I think I see a parallel in the arc of Cat's story and of Black's.

Black avoided many of the potential pitfalls of Evil by siding with Malicia; advising her and letting her climb the Tower was not what even some of the other Calamities expected or wanted from him.

Cat's story replaces the Tower with Apotheosis. She took many of the steps along that road, and handed it off to another, who she remains an advisor to. The power that the other wields can still advance her goals, if imperfectly.
