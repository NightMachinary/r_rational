Not as slow as this one. The prologue was awesome. Chapter 1 was boring with the ruling stuff. Chapter two was also boring initially (banter notwithstanding) then BOOM "Cat you're being invaded. And those jacked up Scripture slinging choir-kissing assholes be brandishing a giant, throbbing, spinning pillar of mountainfucking holy fya. What we gone do?"

But let's hope shit hits the fan tomorrow.
