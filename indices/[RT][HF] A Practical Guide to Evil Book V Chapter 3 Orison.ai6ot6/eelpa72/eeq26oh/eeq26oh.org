Unless something changed from chapter 66 onwards (when Cat commands her to reveal her plans), I am of the opinion she is still the same prideful monster. Being pleasant, flirting with and growing on Catherine, being helpful and working towards her goals are all stated parts of her plan to survive. She almost screwed Catherine over when she tried advocating for her against the sisters to the point that Cat had to maneuver both.

A few times now she has mentioned stories of her past. On one she mentions she should have killed her mother herself, "mother to daughter". And now she tells the tale of her grand uncle being tortured and killed by blood /sweating/ for a year by his brother in an effort to prove Praes/Sahelians are not beyond kindness and can be redeemed. I have no words.

I don't get why she is still here. Time and time again it was mentioned how you shouldn't rely on a trick or tool, least it fails you when you need the most, like Cat is relying on Akua. She is a bloody nuclear disaster waiting to happen /again/. A smart political advisor is not worth this much risk.
