I'm talking less about what her apparent objective is and more about attitudes and worldview that would accompany that change. She's still behaving pretty much the same until the assassination attempt in Keter - pet names, milti-layered deception in the dialogues she has time to think through, perceiving achieving "greatness" as the measure of success.

Somewhere in the middle of the "plan" sequence Catherine begins to notice how Akua starts picking up their habits, and after that fiasco she finally manages to get a good enough read on Cat's priorities that [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/chapter-55-outskirts/][chapter 55]] is more or less a close retelling of a less patient reader's arguments, just one more step of escalation offered instead of "do not think, ascend" of [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/07/25/chapter-35-stroll/][chapter 35]].

From my point of view, neither the idea nor the form it takes by the time of trip to Everdark doesn't originate from the Grey Pilgrim: Akua's been thinking about wiggling her way into a "redemption" since her [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/30/interlude-kaleidoscope-iv/][plan of escape failed]], and ironed the kinks out at some point before [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/10/22/chapter-66-tremors/][chapter 66]]. By then it was clear that Cat wasn't going to fight the crusaders head on and would rather coopt the Grand Alliance for the puropses of enforcing the Liesse Agreements, in which Akua's usual modus operandi wouldn't fit.
