I kinda hoped by the middle of the third book that she'd get killed by the fae and the series would outgrow her, but now I only wish for her to at least get a last moment like William's, where she /almost/ understands what the world looks like beyond her blinders, and dies pitifully. I know her banter is funny, but it's more because she's had more time with the Woe and learned to mimic them, since there's no solid reason for her to have a change of heart at the point she did.
