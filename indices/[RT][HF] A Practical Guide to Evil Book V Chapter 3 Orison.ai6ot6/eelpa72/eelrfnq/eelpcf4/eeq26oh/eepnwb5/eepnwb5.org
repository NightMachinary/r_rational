She's not the same monster, but she is still a monster. Her choice to not turn on Cat last book was real. At the very least, she's decided to hitch her wagon to Cat's unambiguously.

However, given that she's capable of change, she also capable of backsliding. She's a snake and, given enough opportunity, would eventually bite. There's an interesting discussion to whether Akua is (trying to be) Cat's friend or whether she's using it just for story potential. Her ultimate goal is survival and their's setup for both. There's also the fact that she chose the friendship story path over others, arguably. I wouldn't trust a wholly resurrected Akua though.
