You may be more suited for short stories. An outline may be helpful if you don't already use one. The book Make Time may be helpful, the key concept for it is that you need to schedule time in advance for doing this type of thing otherwise it doesn't get done, you'll keep pushing it back to tomorrow indefinitely.
