One of the things I really like about this story is that the skills aren't tedious nonsense like [Stealth] where the more [Stealth] you have the sneakier you are, or [Swords] where the more [Swords] you have the more likely you are to win a sword fight. That sort of thing turns every conflict into a question of who has more numbers or whose numbers run out first. It takes all of the joy out of things, both for the character and for the reader. Instead, we get stuff like a Rogue getting [Distract], where the skill is a tool in the toolkit, one that's very good for sneaking around, but which can be applied however the user likes, whenever they think it would be useful. It's deeply refreshing.
