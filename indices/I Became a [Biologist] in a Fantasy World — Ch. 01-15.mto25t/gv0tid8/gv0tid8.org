The story is out of hiatus and the subreddit loved it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/hpgbzp/wiprt_i_became_a_biologist_in_a_fantasy_world/][last time it was posted]], so I figured I'd repost it here. The schedule seems pretty arbitrary, so idk how people would like future chapters posted. Maybe as a weekly batch?
