Using the word apples would be making it more confusing if you were an alien who didn't understand that there are different types of fruit, like you seem to be with precommitment and the general concept of a plan.

​

I really think you're overestimating how niche the concept of precommitment is. I think every american high schooler learns about the mutually assured destruction strategy for the cold war.

​

Why would the fact that the meme is making a joke mean that the concept couldn't be used in a story?
