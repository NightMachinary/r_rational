Well, the first result for "timeless decision theory" is a LW post... when EY says "precommitment" he means TDT, where to solve problems like Newcomb's problem and a prisoners dilemma you can precommit to one choice. If the other player knows this, they know what you will do. This lets you cooperate in situations two rational players normally wouldn't risk cooperation in (ie prisoners dilemma), since knowing the other's state ahead of time would let you "cheat" on the problem. That is the niche I mean- even if the concept is more well know the vocab isn't which is one of man problems LW has. It's also a losing move on some other problems.

The idea is specifically for a way for two people to cooperate across time, without having to communicate. This also works between you and your future self, since obviously you can't communicate with your future self. It's not useful, and is in fact a hindrance, when it comes to two players in conflict. Which is why I think you may as well just say it's someone foiling a plan, since if you /are/ using precommitment here you're not acting very rationally- you've told your competition what you're going to do.
