The "apple" thing here is just a subset of fruits, where you are trying to eat something that grew on a tree. I don't see how that's different from eating an arbitrary fruit, and I don't see why you need to describe it with "apple". You /can/, but it is unnecessary and looks like unnecessarily complicated intellectual naval gazing.
