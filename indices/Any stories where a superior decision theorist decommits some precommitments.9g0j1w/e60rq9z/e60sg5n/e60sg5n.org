I do think decommiting is generally harder than precommiting, such that a C rank precommiter would need an S rank decommiter to defeat them. (Gwern only has to hash his precommitment, EY would need to come up with some kind of novel backdoor in the hash function to win)

​

In the classic example, imagine a game of chicken. Players speed towards each other in cars, and the first one to swerve loses. Obviously, if no one swerves, you both lose really hard.

​

You can win by being the first one to throw your steering wheel out the window, credibly precommiting to not swerving, forcing your opponent to do so or die.

​

Your opponent, the superior decision theorist, might predict this and reinforce your steering wheel somehow to make it so you don't have that option available to you.

As far as I can tell the general cases of decommiting someone's precommitment are

1. Take away their ability to signal precommitment (reinforce their steering wheel)
2. Make it too expensive for them to uphold their precommitment (place their favorite person in the way of the car before they have a chance to throw away their steering wheel)
3. Make it very cheap for them to defect from their commitment (fill their car with free steering wheels that snap right on and work perfectly)

​

But I'm no decision theorist and I haven't spent that much time on this.
