  since if you are using precommitment here you're not acting very rationally- you've told your competition what you're going to do.

I think you're missing what precommittment is in this context. We're talking about plans where committing to something and telling your opponent you've committed to it /is essential to the plan./ Here, committing does not just mean you've made a pinky promise, it means you've set things up so that you have no other choice but to do the thing you promised to do, so you couldn't not do it even if you wanted to. So foiling your plan specifically involves then "decommitting" you by giving you another option. So it is more specific than just foiling a generic plan.

There's a good example about the game of chicken elsewhere in this thread.
