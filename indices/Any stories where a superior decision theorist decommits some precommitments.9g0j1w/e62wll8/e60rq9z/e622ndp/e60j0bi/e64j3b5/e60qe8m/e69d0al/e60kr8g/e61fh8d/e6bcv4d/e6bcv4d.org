'Until proven otherwise': in the sense of exhaustively shown that >50% of all similar predictions made by the same person before the time of that prediction were true? (Rather than prediction-by-prediction, because before revelation a prediction isn't known to be falsified, and afterwards there's the problem mentioned.)

Hmm. I should learn more about how encryption functions work in practice. ...Perhaps if there were 50 characters each time, location of a message randomised (with other parts staying noise), and so having potentially multiple messages in the same thing--but that then immediately throws up a red flag of 'why do that if not to hide multiple messages'. ...and now I find myself thinking about Asimov's Foundation series, except with Seldon spending hours and hours recording all sorts of silly messages about all sorts of situations that could develop (to be picked between... though direct fabrication by the Second Foundation when wanting to give a nudge would be even more plausible, if less appealing...)...
