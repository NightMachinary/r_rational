The "precommitment" thing here is just a subset of plans being foiled, where you are trying to do something and someone stops you. I don't see how that's different from preventing a really determined person from doing something, and I don't see why you need to describe it with "precommitment" or TDT (which is a solution to certain game theory problems, and fairly niche). You /can/, but it is unnecessary and looks like unnecessarily complicated intellectual naval gazing.
