The concept of apples wasn't invented to solve a very specific problem in game theory, and using the word apple doesn't make what you're saying more confusing. Words have context. The thing that started all this was EY making a joke, and you've interpreted it as something serious. To use your metaphor it's like if instead of apple I used "Falus pulima offpsring vector". "Foiling a precommitment to do X" is the same as "preventing someone from doing X".
