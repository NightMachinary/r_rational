/Dr. Strangelove/ is a good example about a group of people trying to decommit a precommitment, and more generally, of precommitments gone awry.

Ripper precommits to bombing the Soviet Union, in an attempt to force the US to declare war on the Soviet Union. The government attempts to decommit this.

The Soviet Union has precommitted to destroying the entire world in event of attack.

Ripper commits to not giving up the radio code under torture by killing himself.
