The main problem with obfuscated precommitments is that the predictor can simply reveal correct predictions and pretend incorrect ones haven't come to pass yet. Unless the predictor provides a concrete deadline for their prediction to come true, I think the best policy is to simply treat obfuscated predictions as falsified until proven otherwise.

Hash/encryption functions are designed to make finding collisions effectively impossible. If you were able to find a collision like you describe, that would be proof that the function in question was insecure.
