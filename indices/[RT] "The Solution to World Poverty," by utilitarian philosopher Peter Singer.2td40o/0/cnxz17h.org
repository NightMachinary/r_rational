I liked Scott Alexander's writing on this same issue, [[http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html][the Dead Child as a Unit of Currency]] a little better. It made broadly the same point but in a more interesting to read fashion. His other [[http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/charity/][writings on charity]] are also quite good.
