If a person accepts charity as assistance to get over a problem or two in life, that's usually OK. Most people can accept that, and deal with it, even if they aren't downright thrilled and happy to get short term help. It's the long term effect of charity that is poisonous.

When you start simply giving people what they need to survive for years, you harm them. People need a purpose. People need goals. People need pride and self-worth.

Its your prerogative to be skeptical about what I say. In fact, skepticism is a good thing. When you are skeptical about what I say, it means that you have a sense of self-worth. You feel like your opinion, your knowledge, your ability to reason things out has as much validity as my own. You're competing with me for social standing on some level. The inner monkey waves a banana in your direction. Ook. Good.
