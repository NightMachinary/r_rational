This whole charity-has-long-term-harm-in-such-and-such-situation needs to be clarified.

Why do you think charity does long term harm to people?

Who's even proposing this straw man perpetual charity argument?

Do you think charity giving can never learn from past success? Do you think non profits don't measure their own effectiveness? Do you think there isn't a market that values more effective charities a lot more? Then why the need to invoke some artificial harms involving self worth etc?

There's an element to making charities effective. How can charities be more effective?
