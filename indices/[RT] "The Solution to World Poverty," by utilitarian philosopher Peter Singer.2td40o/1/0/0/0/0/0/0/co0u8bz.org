I don't see how the harmfulness of long term charity isn't perfectly clear. Humans have needs and desires. Gaining these needs and desires gives us pleasure. The more pleasure, the more strongly related to survival the pleasurable activity is. That's why sex feels so damn good, and why children are so damn adorable. It's also why we laugh at practical jokes that reduce the potential social standing of others. On topic, it's why charity feels good, because charity is perceived as establishing dominance, social standing, or self-worth.

If you feel pleasure from something, it's your inner primate cheering you on. If what you are doing isn't something useful that improves your position in life, you've fooled the inner primate into thinking it is. Please forgive the inner primate for that. The most complex tool he understands is a stick to eat termites with.

As an example of fooling the inner primate. You might say that basement-dwellers in developed countries violate this. I say no, because in developed countries, basement dwellers frequently try to become expert video game players and skilled forum trolls. They frequently seek out meaningless ways to improve themselves. The inner primate doesn't understand computer, but it does understand winning.

All this talk about pleasure and charity. Let's look at the other side. The person who receives the charity. They have an inner primate too, and that inner primate will equate receiving gifts as being dependent. To some degree this is acceptable. Not every ape can be a silverback, after all.

You might say, "I feel pleasure when I receive a gift!" Indeed. By being given a gift, you have been given a token that you matter. Another primate, frequently related to you, has noticed you and accepted you as a responsibility of theirs. If the giver is the more powerful, the givee understands they are offered some degree of safety and acceptance. If the giver is the weaker, the givee understands the gifting to be homage or thanks.

There are very few of us that ever lose appreciation for gifts from family. However, if some random individual on the street walks up to you and offers you a gift, what's the first response? For adults, it's "Who are you. What is this? Why are you giving me this?" Suspicion, distrust, maybe even fear. If someone you do not like offers you a gift, what's your reaction?

As the inner primate receives more and more gifts from strange people, more charity, dependence is hammered in. In some, the person becomes apathetic and depressed. In others, the inner primate seeks ways to create some sort of way to reduce its dependence and establish dominance for itself. Think about gang activity rates and the prevalence of rape and other violent crime in poverty stricken places, even in first world countries! Think about drug use. Think about oppressive depression. Think about terrorist recruitment. Think about unrest and riots.

People need purpose. If all you give them is charity, they will either lose purpose, or they will create their own purposes that are almost certain to be closer to primate behavior than civilized human behavior.

So, what can charity do to improve? Design their activities to lead to a solution as opposed to treating symptoms.

It's not that easy though. In almost every place in the world where there are destitute humans, there are already persons in power over them. The ones in power are typically quite happy with their own position and are not interested in allowing the lives of the people under them to be dramatically improved, because if the people under them get improved circumstances, well, the current top primate might be challenged.

As painful as it might be to say it, I suspect that as technology improves and populations get larger, the permanent solution to the harm created by charity is going to allow people to pursue meaningless activities that stimulate the inner primate.

Yes, I said it. The permanent solution to a lot of apathy and crime issues caused by long term charity might end up being a basement-dweller society. Internet trolls have the potential to derail apathy and save the world from charity.
