Why is accepting charity poisonous to self worth? Let's put it in other terms. If someone donates some time to help you learn something or fix a problem you're having, do you necessarily have to feel lower self-worth because of it? Seems quite strange to me.

Also, we're killing self worth? What?

Ok, it could be true for certain people that they feel shitty when someone does something nice for them, but this specific comment is deriving some kind of grand sociological/biological conclusion from a few kludgy mental heuristics. I'm inclined to take the whole thing with a grain of salt.
