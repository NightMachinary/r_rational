The claim is that the optimal amount of charity directed money is greater than it currently is. You, personally, are supposed to donate because others are not doing so.

If everyone was donating, then not everyone would have to donate everything. It's only because the majority of people don't contribute to reaching the optimal donation amount that any given individual is supposed to donate large amounts.
