I do not think it stands up to scrutiny. Because it ignores the opportunity cost: that money wasn't just buried in the ground before it was given to charity. It was invested. If everyone were to sell of their investments, as he implies is a moral imperative, stock markets would plummet. Companies would go out of business. People would lose jobs. Their ability to give anything at all would disappear and they would start needing money themselves.

Imagining invested money isn't doing anything and can be just redirected toward ending poverty at not cost is a fallacy. Now, you could definitely make an argument that you should very carefully invest in companies that are doing good in the world in different ways... but I think the world needs advanced engineering perhaps as much as it needs food for the poor, as hard as a choice as that is to make.

That's not all there is to say, and yes there are a lot of creature comforts we should give up to live perfectly moral lives.
