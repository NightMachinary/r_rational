  When you start simply giving people what they need to survive for years, you harm them. People need a purpose. People need goals. People need pride and self-worth.

How do you know that they are harmed? That's a big claim about long term effects of charity.

A lot of us want to optimize for everyone's living standards to be improved. Contributing to charities is one of the most widely available tools to reach this goal. You just research good charities (Effective Altruism has a bunch of resources to figure this out) and give what you can, and you start effecting real change. Every life you unshackle from disease and hunger can grow communities, create business value, produce art, live.

Let's worry about self sufficiency and worth after people stop dying of hunger and treatable illnesses? And the myriad other bullshit things that cut down life.
