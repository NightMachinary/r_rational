There are a great many people out there in the world that will not freely accept any sort of gifts from strangers. I'm one of them. I do not like receiving gifts from people I do not know. I can prove that to some degree by providing links to three serial fiction webpages that generate 1000+ hits per day between them. I have never implemented a donation option on any of those three pages. I'm not a special snowflake in this regard.

Even amongst those who would accept gifts from strangers, there are very few people in the world that wouldn't ask a lot of questions before accepting a gift from a stranger.

The concept of pure altruism exists, but very few people practice it, and even fewer will believe they are experiencing it without at least asking several pointed questions.
