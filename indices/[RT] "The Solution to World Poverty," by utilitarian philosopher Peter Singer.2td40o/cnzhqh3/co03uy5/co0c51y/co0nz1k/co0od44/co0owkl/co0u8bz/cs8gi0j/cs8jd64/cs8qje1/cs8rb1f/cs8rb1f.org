I don't use Reddit gold, and have never looked into how it works. I probably wouldn't even know if someone used it on one of my posts, or however that works. Since I have zero interest in the program, I can't comment on it.

I will say that I do not use adblock when I am here, and assume that if Reddit needs funds, there will be commercial ads. If the ads do not generate enough funds, then I expect PM's with donation requests, or some such.
