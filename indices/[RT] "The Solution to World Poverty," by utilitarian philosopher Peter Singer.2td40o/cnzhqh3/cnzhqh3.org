I'm going to say some things here that are probably going to get me lots of negative karma, but I'm going to say it anyway.

We're primates. Like it or not, we all have that inner primate within us that drives us to measure ourselves against others. That vestige of our ancestry insidiously worms its way into our interactions with others, on almost every level.

A very large part of why charity works is that it creates or preserves real or perceived power. If you give X to Y, then Y is indebted to you. That indebtedness is a power of sorts. Even if it's not a real power, it massages that inner primate. You just gave something to someone that was in need of something you could afford to discard. Giving is a prerogative of dominance. Ook. Good.

A lot of people might be thinking, "Oh, I never feel that way." Really? Let's explore the possibility that this is true. Even of one were to completely write off the perception of hand-me-down power, there's still the matter of personal confidence and the perception of self-worth. Even if no power calculations come into play at all. No tax deductions, no favors owed, no residual good will, why might one give? To feel good about oneself and feed one's perception of self-worth and confidence. Doing good for others means that one must be a good person, right? Self-confidence and self-worth are critical to us. They are extremely potent drivers for our survival and prosperity. Ook. Good.

That's not all though! Someone with no needs unfulfilled might choose to give things away simply because they have more than they need. Perhaps they are even irritated by their own excess. This introspection, this giving, is performed because the giver has been successful or lucky. In the Western world, it is expected of the powerful to give away some of their power. It marks them as being 'normal' and part of the community of those with power. Once you get to a certain income or level of measured worth, society pressures one to give to charity. If one does not give like others in the same fiscal standing, there is a perceived lack. That perception may be internal, what one thinks about oneself, or perhaps external, what others think and say about the skinflint. In the Western world, living amongst many others with the ability to give, being charitable is expected. Peer pressure! Ook. Good.

I will not say that there aren't people who transcend the rest of us, who give, and get no real or perceived benefit of any type from the behavior of giving and charity, but those people are rare. If you feel 'good' because you give to charity, then you are not one of those people. The very fact that you feel 'good' means that some vestige of inner primate inside you is proudly waving a banana and cheering you on. Ook. Good.

Let me be clear. Without any reservations, I support charity as a temporary way to help others, especially for basic needs like food or medicine. I have absolutely zero confidence that any sort of charity-based economy can be good. Everyone's inner primate craves self-worth, and accepting charity is poisonous to self-worth. Self-worth is the most important human infrastructure of all - we need to stop killing it. Ook.
