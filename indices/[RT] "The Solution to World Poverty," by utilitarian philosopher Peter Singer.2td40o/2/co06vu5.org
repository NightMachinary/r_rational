once upon a time, there was a remote village deep in the forest. this village was filthy rich. it was the vacation home of every self-respecting rich person in their society. it had little to no agriculture, producing far less food than it consumed. as a result, everything was imported. the farmers who traveled to the village did so because they knew the inhabitants were rich, and could charge far more for their goods there than anyone else. so, all the people who weren't rich who lived there had to raise their prices too, or else not be able to afford the farmer's prices. the cost of living was high, the production of critical goods low, and the production of luxury goods high.

now imagine Singer is a wizard, and he found himself sickened by this village's decadence. "we could feed an entire village for a month with the money they spend on luxury items in a week!" he exclaims. so, good-intentioned, he lays a geas on the village to donate 90% of what they would have spent on luxuries to charity instead, and he goes on his merry way.

everything works fine for a while, but soon the village starts noticing a decrease in the money it makes. for you see- most of the people in the village sell luxuries for a living. by cutting all luxury expenditures, singer hamstrung their income. soon, they can't afford the farmer's prices, the farmers don't find it worth the trip and the residents are forced to move or starve.

the point is- that village, much like us, was living in an economic bubble that absolutely depended on everyone buying things they don't need. all its riches were illusory- none of the goods were actually worth what they cost, but the inflated price made it seem like they were. make no mistake, all bubbles pop eventually, but let's wait to deliberately pop this one until we're better prepared.

...you know, unless you like global recessions.
