let me try my hand at a better solution:

most sources of poverty stems from high-level problems, that is, problems that require large amounts of coordination to solve (like the prisoner's dilemma- the best solution is the mob boss coordinating his men. if you are caught in one, and you know your partner is likely to defect, there's not much you personally can do) I propose a non-profit organization dedicated to gaining the influence required to achieve that level of coordination and using it for the best interests of the people as advised by relevant experts.

I would propose their tactics to be that of local prohibition-era mob boss Tom Pendergast- that is, to give the short version, bribe the people for votes. this gives the charity an efficient, two-pronged attack- each dollar spent not only improves the life of the person it's given to, but also grows the charity's influence, allowing it to tackle bigger problems.

one of the largest problems I have with singer's plan is sustainability- to use his example of the man having to choose between his beloved car or a child's life, the man would be faced with the same choice every year. I would therefore suggest, rather than asking us to give infinite amounts of money on the grounds that it would save significant numbers of lives, ask for a specific amount to gain a specific goal. that is, estimate the cost of gaining significant influence in a problem area, divide by estimated number of donators, and ask each donator for roughly that much. this way your "share" is well-defined.

once influence is gained, I would suggest it hires professional consultants qualified to solve the problems necessary for improvement.
