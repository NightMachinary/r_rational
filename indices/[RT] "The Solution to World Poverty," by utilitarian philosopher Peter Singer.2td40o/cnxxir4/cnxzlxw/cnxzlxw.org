The thought that immediately comes to mind is this: [[http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/spiegel-interview-with-african-economics-expert-for-god-s-sake-please-stop-the-aid-a-363663.html]] (an interview with an African economist, who presents a good argument against aid money).

The idea of spending 'just pennies a day' or whatever to save a starving African child is emotionally appealing, but as a widespread policy, it seems to result in corruption and stagnation. Accordingly, I'm rather skeptical of the utilitarian argument presented in your link. Vast sums of money continue to be funnelled to these nations on behalf of various charities. Some are, admittedly, better than others, and will have better results than others in terms of lives saved (or whatever other metric you want to use), but the end result seems to be ongoing poverty and dependence, and a permanent need for ever-increasing amounts of foreign aid money.
