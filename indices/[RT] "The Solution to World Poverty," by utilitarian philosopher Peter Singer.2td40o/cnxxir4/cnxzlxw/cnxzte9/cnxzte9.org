That link is very interesting; thank you for sharing. I agree the article has lots of appeal-to-emotion and very little in regards to logical or factual substance. In the class I'm taking, the OP piece was presented alongside [[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_lifeboat_ethics_case_against_helping_poor.html][this one]], which is almost excessively pessimistic and goes far beyond "charities tend to corrupt" to imply "famine is good because it lessens overpopulation". I disagree with that thinking -- especially since it was written 3 billion people ago, and we still have food -- but respect the article more just because it has a somewhat logical argument. Now I think of it, it's curious that my professor has presented these side-by-side ... I wonder why.

Anyway.
