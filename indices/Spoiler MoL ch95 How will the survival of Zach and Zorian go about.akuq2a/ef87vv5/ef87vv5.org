Removed because there's a spoiler in the title, /and/ if you wanted to talk about the current chapter, it's still on the front page of this subreddit and not terribly old, and if you'd like more people to talk about this, you can go post this at [[/r/motheroflearning]] (which you already have).

Generally speaking, we'd like for discussion of current chapters of serial works to go within the comments for that chapter, unless there's a particular amount of effort put into the post, or it's been a long time since a chapter was posted.
