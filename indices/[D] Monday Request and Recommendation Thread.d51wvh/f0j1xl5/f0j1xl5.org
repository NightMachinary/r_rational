Two related requests:

- Are there any Portal Fantasy works focused on the exploitation of advanced social, political, or economic knowledge to enact a one-man industrial/social revolution, as opposed to the usual technology/science/convenient magic systems? Whether it be done by stirring up rebellions, leading political campaigns, or playing intrigue among the upper classes. Ideally with the protagonist having no other tools at his disposal --- no magic, no technological know-how, only this relatively "soft" power.

  - /Worth the Candle/: Uther obviously did that to an extent, but a) the story is not focused on Uther, b) he had a lot of other advantages.
  - /A Hero's War/: I recall both protagonists employed this to an extent, but neither was focused on it: Cato enacted a technological revolution, Morey had military power.

- More broadly: Any works heavily focused on the manipulation of social systems?
