Very mild spoilers going forward.

I thought this world was grimdark in all the ways the real world is, what with corporate dominance of politics and the like. Perhaps it was exaggerated, but we don't know how deep that rabbit hole goes in our own world either. I will agree the worldbuilding was shallow by comparison to Worm, but again, that's a high bar.

The speedster does technically win every fight or get taken out before he realizes it's started. The last one wasn't the fault of his power, after all. His power appears to just be going fast with the bare minimum of required secondary powers to not instantly splat against the sound barrier, and those required secondaries appear to only be active while he's going fast. Again, though, power conceptualization is definitely a weakness of the series, and I don't recommend it to munchkins.
