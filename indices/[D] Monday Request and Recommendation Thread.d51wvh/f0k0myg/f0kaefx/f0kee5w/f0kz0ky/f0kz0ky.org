I think it was mainly the personal character flaws that I found rough, no the corporate or political grimdark-ness. In Worm you have the reason for powers happening to people tied directly to their trigger, meaning that for every hero or villain you can understand why they might be so flawed. But it feels like every hero in America is not only flawed but morally abhorrent. Which is pretty weird, most people aren't just casually morally abhorrent.

In terms of the speedster, he shouldn't be able to lose a fight. If you are a speedster then you operate your powers you have to be nearly invulnerable (super strength and incredible resilience to deal with the amount of stress going those speeds cause), and you have to be able to perceive the world at nanoseconds or attoseconds. Or, something like the speedforce. But we know its not the speedforce due to some of the training he does. Which kinda makes the inciting action in the plot not work at all.

The other thing to keep in mind is that unlike the real world that we live in, this world was created by people. All decisions were made consciously. And so the random chance of everyone sucking isn't there, and character triumphs and disasters should feel earned.

I don't know. The world rang very hollow for me, overall.
