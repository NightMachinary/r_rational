tangential to triggers, I thought it was a little odd how in The Boys, Nobody (on-screen) really questions where the powers come from. Eventually, of course, we get the big reveal that they come from this drug injected into people as babies, but the reveal fell a bit short because we, the audience, had no idea what the state of knowledge was before that point. Eventually we learn that only americans have supes, and it seems like most people believe the powers are god-given to americans because 'murica, and it while I buy that a lot of idiots believe this, it doesn't make /any/ sense for this to have been the scientific consensus

Anyway, I enjoyed the show a lot (despite its edginess), it was just this one plot point didn't feel quite right.
