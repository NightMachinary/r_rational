A brief review of The Boys, the new superhero drama from Amazon.

Worm did it better. Of course, that's a very high bar to set, and overall I found the first (and so far only) season to be quite enjoyable and at least somewhat intellectually stimulating. The story is somewhat predictable, but still manages to be engaging. Mysteries and backstories are explained, rather than handwaved. Injuries are permanent unless there's a good explanation for them not to be. The obvious power differential between supes (the world's linguistic equivalent for capes) and normals is explored in detail. Politics and social issues surrounding supes are explored in a cynical, but realistic way.

What the series does really well, though, is character work. It shares with Worm the characteristic of characters feeling like people who do things which make sense given their characterization. I can't think of a single instance of anyone breaking character, actually. Everyone feels like someone who could actually exist, given the world depicted were real. While there are no truly rationalist characters, people use the intellectual and other resources they have to achieve their goals in ways which make sense. The primary villain reminds me a little of Quirrelmort. I repeat, /the primary villain reminds me a little of Quirrelmort./ They aren't as intelligent, nobody in the series is, but they are also a person of iterated masks. I was honestly surprised by the reveal, even after seeing everything else they'd done, of exactly how deep their rabbit hole went.

The series' primary weakness is power conceptualization. Unlike in Worm, where Legend does everything Superman can through a single, well-defined mechanism, /The Boys'/ Homelander is just as poorly-explained as canon Superman. It is unclear what, if any limitations supes in this universe have. The only supes known to be bulletproof are the ones we see actually get shot, everyone else is up in the air. Their Invisible Man variant is the most well-concieved of the bunch, but he still handwaves the problem of being blind while invisible. The origin of supes is explained, but the full capabilities of this origin are unknown. Power munchkining is nonexistent. If that was your primary interest in Worm, you might not like The Boys.

The Boys functions mostly as a social commentary on modern social issues and politics which happens to be set in a universe where superpowers exist. It teaches no rationalist lessons, the worldbuilding isn't terribly deep, and it doesn't feel at all like a history of a world told from human perspectives, the way Worm did. The characters, however, save it for me. You want to find out what happens to them next, and so you keep watching. That's enough for me to give it a positive grade.

Trigger warnings: offscreen sexual assault, homophobia (presented in a negative light), drug abuse.

Representation of cultural backgrounds. Zero GSM characters that we know of, though the overall character base is still relatively small, and there is an in-story reason for none of the supes to be gay.
