If you're looking for stories with dragons as a main character, there's [[https://endless-stars.com][Endless Stars]]. It gets pretty good reviews, and there's nothing else quite like it.

Debatable whether it's rational, but there's depth to the worldbuilding, and it's at least among the better webfictions.
