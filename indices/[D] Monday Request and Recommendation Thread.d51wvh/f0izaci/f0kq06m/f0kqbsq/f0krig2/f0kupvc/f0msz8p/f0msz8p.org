I would personally argue it depends on exactly why you didn't like it. If it's because the main character comes across as an idiot, then while his /personality/ doesn't change, his apparent competence does, at least from my perspective. Everything else is more or less as the beginning implies, though.

We've already established that we have different tolerances for some things, though :P
