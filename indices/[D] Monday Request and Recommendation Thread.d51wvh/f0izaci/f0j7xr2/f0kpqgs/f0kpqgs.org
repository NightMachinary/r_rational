There's actually quite a few dropped plot threads, like the kid Ian who disappears for a couple hundred chapters and then reappears with little fanfare only to exit stage right yet again.

Also, I like how the metaphorical GM keeps on dangling plot threads in front of the MC, and he resolutely refuses to investigate them until something happens and the situation somehow blows up in his face.

Like the subplot with Talim the equestrian teacher's love life(?), where Talim keeps on dropping hints and going nudge nudge wink wink there's something to investigate here, and the whole time Klein just says "nope not gonna do anything about that" until he gets railroaded in to it.
