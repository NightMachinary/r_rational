I can't really think of any. Maybe [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/219164-the-wraith-s-haunt][Dungeon Lord]] but the MC mostly powers up in terms of building his armies and resource base rather than personal power; in fact I'd say the personal power scaling is relatively shallow: There's a scene in the 4th book where the MC fights someone with dacdes of experience and Experience over him and while there's never any doubt that he'll loose it's not a question of 0-damage vs instant win.
