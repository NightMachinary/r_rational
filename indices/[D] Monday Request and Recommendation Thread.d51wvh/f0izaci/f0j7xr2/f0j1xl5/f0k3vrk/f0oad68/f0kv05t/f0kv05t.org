Huh. Now that I think of it, I know the author said that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] is in its later stages, but I can't think of any good LitRPG stories that are finished. There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]], also in the later stages, also really good, but also incomplete.
