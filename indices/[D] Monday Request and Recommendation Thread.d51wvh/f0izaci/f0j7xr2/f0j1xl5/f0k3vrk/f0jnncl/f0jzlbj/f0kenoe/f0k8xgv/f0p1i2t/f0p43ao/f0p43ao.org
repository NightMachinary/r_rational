It's the ultimate in deconstructive fiction. It starts off that way, but reveals depth to each character along the way. It's meta at times, but the thing that makes it so good is the quality of the writing combined with fleshed-out worldbuilding and magic systems, and it's very character based. Be warned that anyone can die.
