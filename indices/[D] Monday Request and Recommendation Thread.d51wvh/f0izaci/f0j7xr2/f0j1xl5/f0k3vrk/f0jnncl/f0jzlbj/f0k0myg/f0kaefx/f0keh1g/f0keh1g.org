Hmm, I think the boys has done far more social and political commentary than worm did, and I don't think either is a fair criticism to make. The powers and world are secondary to commentary and i wouldn't judge the show based on the fact it's superpowers is more a setting than an actual plot point.

I will agree that if you liked worm for the world building and the powers, you won't love the boys, but if you enjoyed character dramas, you will enjoy the boys.
