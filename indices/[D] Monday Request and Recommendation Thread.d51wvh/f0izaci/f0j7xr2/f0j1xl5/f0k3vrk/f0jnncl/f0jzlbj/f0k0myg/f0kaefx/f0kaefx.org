I watched The Boys, and I am not sure I can really recommend it like you did. I think it might be one of the better superhero stories out there, but for me, at least, it still really falls short of the mark.

One thing you didn't mention, that I think is a huge difference is that The Boys doesn't have anything like the "Triggers" of Worm. So, when you see some villains or not very nice super heroes it doesn't make any sense. To me it really, really felt like it was grimdark, but the kind of grimdark where things are really, really shitty for no reason.

Also there are speedsters in the show, and they don't just win everything, despite that being exactly how that would have to work. I think there is a very good reason that there is no "Flash" in Worm.

I am trying to not post any spoilers, please let me know if you think anything crossed the mark or if you want to know more about why I didn't like it.
