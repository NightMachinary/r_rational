I recently finished reading [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/368986/message-in-a-bottle][Message in a bottle]], and until now I didn't know that "Slice of life of a small pony being taught a language by a caring mentor" was a thing I desperately wanted to read more of. Can anyone recommend another story that hits any or all of these notes?

I don't know if this is technically a request for a rational story, but I trust this subreddit's judgement!
