Any recommendations for LitRPG stories that are complete, or at least relatively late game? I've really gotten into the genre, but it seems all the stories get a few tiers into the tech tree and either give up or get totally bogged down in plot and the leveling slows way way down until the author stops writing.

I'd love a bunch of actual well written late game fights where the protagonist has had plenty of time to build up their power and has an even fight with an opponent that is roughly on their level. It seems like it's always either them being drastically underleveled and somehow winning based on their "special" power, or just being totally overpowered.
