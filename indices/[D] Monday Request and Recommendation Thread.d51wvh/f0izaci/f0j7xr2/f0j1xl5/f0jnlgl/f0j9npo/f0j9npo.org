[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][The Traitor Baru Cormorant]] by Seth Dickinson

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/589979.Daughter_of_the_Empire][Daughter of the Empire]] by Raymond E. Feist

First 3 books of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40910][Mistborn Series]] by Brandon Sanderson

More of a guilty pleasure, but also the first 3 books of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/117100][Red Rising Saga]] by Pierce Brown builds up to it.

I like to think that Asimov's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series][Foundation series]] does this on a larger scale.
