Recommendation: [[http://novelfull.com/lord-of-the-mysteries.html][Lord of the Mysteries]]. I'm sure many of the regulars here know of it (and even more saw it when it was recommended out of this thread a few weeks back). Well, I saw it for the first time then and decided to pick it up... and I am hooked. I've binged, uh... 308 chapters in the past week. So there's that. Pros:

- World-building is fantastic. Good supernatural power system structure that is unveiled over time; this goes hand-in-hand with the geopolitical setting that gets fleshed out as the story goes on, and the world history that keeps coming into play.
- Rules are fairly well-set, though they do change a bit as more information is revealed in the form of artefacts and journal entries.
- The writing (or translation, at least) is just... SO much better than what I've been slogging through in LNs. I was rereading Mushoku Tensei recently for a nostalgia trip, and going from that to this is like going from a middle-school book report to a university freshman's pretentious debut. That is to say, it's definitely not perfect, and the ideas behind it may not be any better either... but reading it is just so much more enjoyable than a lot of translations I've slogged through.

Negatives?

- Might be a personal quirk, but I'm not used to Chinese translations overall. The chapters often seem to abruptly end without any sort of anticipation or build-up. There is also a lot of (seemingly) unnecessary word space "wasted" on flowery descriptions of food, fashion, etc. This isn't really "bad," but it makes the chapters a bit wordy at times. I've heard it's because Chinese web novelists are paid by the word... but I have no idea if that's true. But hey, I've suffered through worse, and it DOES help build the world quite well.
- The protagonist seems to abandon his original quest - "Get back to my actual home world!" - really quickly. Which I kinda understand, because living in a fantasy world with superpowers, special abilities, and extraplanar knowledge that you can exploit is AWESOME. But his thoughts never progress in that direction. He just kinda... forgets about his original goal? One could argue that his pursuit of knowledge and power is all to allow him to get back, but there's been almost nothing in 300 chapters about him missing his previous life, or family, or friends, or suffering from the repercussions of suddenly being ripped away from them and thrust into an entirely different universe. It seems like a glaring oversight for something that should have been (and continues to be) extremely traumatic.
- At times, new abilities and information are "shown" and not "told." That's actually ok - it's boring to be told "I can do this" and then the next chapter is "So I did this." But one of the things I really like about rational(ist) fiction is that you get told info up front, then get to theorize how it will be used to solve problems as they crop up. Here, several times, it's been more like "OH! A problem! Good thing I prepared this ritual/artefact/weapon in advance. Here's why it worked!" So it's more about enjoying the journey than putting yourself in the protagonist's shoes and thinking about how he's solve his problems.

Quibbles aside, it's really good so far!
