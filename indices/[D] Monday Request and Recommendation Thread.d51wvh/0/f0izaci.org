[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/8075/darkest-before-dawn][Darkest Before Dawn]] feels kind of like pony HPMOR except the students are younger, the teachers aren't idiots, or treated as idiots, and the tone is slice of life.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] was recommended to me and I second it. The opening to the story is cliche and bad but after that it gets better. I'm not sure that this is really rational---it seems more munchkin-y than anything. Good quality LitRPG though, without any stupid unique skills, god-given powers, or insane luck.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5301182/chapters/12238256][The Scientist]] was recommended in the past, and I heartily second both the fic and the entire series. It's Undertale and manages to incorporate the random mishmash of things shown in the game without coming off as contrived or stupid or annoying. The later works in the series also portray depression well.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/368986/message-in-a-bottle][Message in a Bottle]] is still a really good science fiction first contact story that realistically explores an AI that's gradually downloading updates in the background. The writing itself is professsional, the plot is interesting, the characters intelligent. If you dislike the ponies, just treat them as aliens that happen to have equine bodies. It's basically the truth anyway.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur the Dragon]] is a rare story with a dragon as a main character. It's fun, but it isn't rational and it isn't supposed to be.
