Eh, I disagree. For example, I think a lot of the reason that readers enjoy Worth the Candle is because the protagonist keeps flashing back to his old life and the issues he had. Granted it's a different sort of plot (WtC is likely about the protagonist's attempts to deal with his previous mental health and relationship issues, so it makes sense to keep going back to it), but it still feels like an oversight that the protagonist has so little concern over his previous life despite his stated goal of returning to it.

It very much feels like the protagonist in LotM only thinks back to his old life for random knowledge or cultural references, not to how he lived his life or to his loved ones. He early on completely adopts the persona of Klein, and doesn't even think of himself internally as Zhou Mingrui any more. To me it makes the protagonist come across more as a vehicle for moving the plot forward than an actual person.
