The manga [[https://kissmanga.com/Manga/Heterogenia-Linguistico-Ishuzoku-Gengogaku-Nyuumon][Heterogenia Linguistica]] is pretty much exactly the same sort of thing (slice of life, learning fantasy language, fantasy elements).

I also have a few pony first contact fics of various stripes: [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/244611/an-academic-visit][An Academic Visit]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/159150/the-eagle-has-landed][The Eagle Has Landed]]/[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/164531/the-eagle-is-sealed][The Eagle is Sealed]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in][Celestia Sleeps In]] and its sequel [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/132779/onto-the-pony-planet][Onto the Pony Planet]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/13616/arrow-18-mission-logs-lone-ranger][Arrow 18 Mission Logs: Lone Ranger]]

And then I have a list of pony isekai of the more garden variety sort:

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/27429/quantum-castaways][Quantum Castaways]] (It's probably never going to be finished, but I'm putting it first because it's so good anyways.)

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/55531/school-of-hard-knocks][School of Hard Knocks]] [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/65678/not-another-human-in-equestria][Not Another Human In Equestria]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95461/a-voice-among-the-strangers][A Voice Among the Strangers]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/73404/through-the-well-of-pirene][Through the Well of Pirene]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/128268/solitary-pinion][Solitary Pinion]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/115322/xenophilia-advanced][Xenophilia: Advanced]] (Fair warning, this story is safe for work, but the story it's a recursive fanfiction of is an NSFW unapologetic wish-fulfilment-fest, even if the worldbuilding is still really excellent.)

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/23103/the-roommate][The Roomate]] (the rare reverse-isekai.)

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/23095/you-do-not-belong][You do not belong]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/61995/miller][Miller]] and its sequel [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/92472/millie][Millie]]
