Can someone recommend me a readable and interestingly written book on the neuroscience and psychology of memory? I would be particularly interested in such topics as how working memory works and how it creates the sensation of the "now," the present moment in which a certain amount of sensory inputs, thoughts, and memories combine and seem (but are not really) to be taking place at the same time; how much data is really stored in long term memory vs how much of long term memory retrieval is the brain using intelligence and imagination to "unzip" compressed memories from relatively sparse descriptive data; and various other topics that I am unaware of.
