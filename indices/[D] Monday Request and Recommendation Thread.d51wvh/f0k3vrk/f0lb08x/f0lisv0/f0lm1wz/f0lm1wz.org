One of the best litRPGs IMO. It's fairly "soft" in that reality works like reality rather than like a video game. Characters have traits like strength but they're just an objective measurement of your physical fitness.

The RPG part comes from the fact you earn EXP and can buy various powers with them; those powers work on RPG like logic.

Sorry, I should have put the a link in. I'll edit my post.
