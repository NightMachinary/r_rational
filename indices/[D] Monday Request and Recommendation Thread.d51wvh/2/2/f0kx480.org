You might be interested in [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14278/the-red-lands][The Red Lands]]. The main character - a fairly apt businessman - isekais into the body of a dying fourteen year old boy in a low fantasy slum (as one does). He starts out with no resources in the middle of a harsh winter, and claws and scrabbles his way up from there.

His success generally comes through manipulating the town's social systems, whether by building other slum kids into a cohort of followers with useful skills, or leveraging his previous life's business acumen to negotiate deals with the local trader.

He himself doesn't get any magical powers up to the point I've read, though magic powers are available (if difficult and risky to acquire).

The prose is a bit awkward, but I read up to chapter 87 and intend to continue at some point.
