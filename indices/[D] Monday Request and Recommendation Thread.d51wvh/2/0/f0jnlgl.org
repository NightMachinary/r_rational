Hrm, /The Merchant Princes/ series by Charles Stross mostly fits, but there's a fair bit of travel between Gruinmarket (pseudo-medieval) and Earth. Here's a TL:DR from the author:

#+begin_quote
  TL:DR; it starts out looking like "modern person ends up in mediaeval society", but its mission is to systematically trash every cliche of that sub-genre that I could get my hands on. With a side-order of development economics and cultural commentary (the moderns don't come off particularly well, but neither do the quasi-mediaevals).

Get the omnibus version if you can, it reads a lot better and cuts out a bunch of fat. The later books deal with the social systems aspects a lot more than the earlier ones, though that's always a central focus of the series.
