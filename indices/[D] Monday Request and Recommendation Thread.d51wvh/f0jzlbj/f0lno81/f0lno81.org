Night Angel series by Brent Weeks has that in spades, as well as his more recent one (and better in most every way), the Lightbringer series.

Night Angel is just taking the rule of cool to the extreme end, basically a boy gets trained as a magical ninja and fights other magic ninjas and an evil empire of warlocks. Very fast paced, brutal, awesome fights, and high stakes. Common criticisms are that it's a bit of a cliched/juvenile power fantasy and that all the female characters are one dimensional.

Lightbringer is basically about about a young man who finds out that he has magic, and that the most powerful man in the world is his father.

It shows a remarkable improvement by the author, in pretty much every aspect. The pacing is still amazing and the action is intense, but this time ALL the POV characters are diverse and well written and the magic system is very original, interesting and actually pretty rational. Also the author put a lot of effort into making compelling character arcs /in every book/, and the plots are actually very intricate and full of twists and turns and subtle foreshadowing. The subreddit is wild and very with checking out, with all the theories and discoveries and rereadings. Probably my favorite series in progress.
