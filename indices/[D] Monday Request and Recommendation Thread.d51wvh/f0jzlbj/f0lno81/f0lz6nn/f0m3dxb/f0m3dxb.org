New series is great about that, I think he took the criticism constructively. There are several good female POV characters, one of them (Teia) is actually my favorite.

Also, if you liked Durzo you'll love Gavin, the other MC. He's also a bad ass with a 'magnificent bastard' complex, a great character.
