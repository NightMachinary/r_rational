Night angel was one of my favorite series as a kid, but it's ruined by a ridiculously inane ending, and the fact that the author can't write a gay or female character with a trait outside of “prostitute” or “innocent”. Basically every character outside of the main character and Durzo(best boi) have like 2 traits. Either way, I love the first book. I've considered trying the other series, I'm just leery of the same thing happening
