I like the idea of disguising the skeletons as robots or golems or something. It sounds a bit precarious though. A single dissected specimen would reveal the skeleton inside.

And I think once the evil skeleton nation becomes enough of a power that they don't need to worry about secrecy, there's a more straightforward way of licensing skeletons. Have the necromancers compel the skeleton to follow work orders given by the client for a fixed period of time, and then stop listening to orders and return back to the island.
