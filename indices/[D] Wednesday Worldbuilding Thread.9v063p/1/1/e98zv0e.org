Not to lean into the cliche too much, but what about exporting war?

Have a group of people spend their lives training to become the best possible warriors, then after they die use their bodies to assemble a skilled skeleton fighting force. Then you /don't/ go conquering the world (that never works), instead mix the skeleton warriors with some human overseers and necromancers and sell their services to the highest bidder. Don't allow anyone to bid on the entire force either, instead make them bid for each battalion individually and make sure contract end dates are staggered. That way once one side of a conflict deploys your troops, the other side can place a bid for a battalion of its own once one becomes available. Ideally you get a bidding war going between the two sides.

Skeletons are (at least stereotypically) perfectly loyal and don't need to eat, which (besides being a massive advantage in mediaeval warfare on its own) also allows your troops to conquer regions without having to rely on plundering the countryside and/or committing war crimes against the local population. Your forces are the ideal troops for any would-be conqueror that wants to win the hearts and minds of his soon to be subjects.

Instruct your skeletons to always be orderly and polite (if they can speak), put clauses in your contracts that your troops won't be used against civilians, minimize damage to the towns and cities you conquer and allow enemy combatants (especially generals and nobility) to surrender peacefully. The more civilized war becomes the more profitable it becomes for you, both because it will set standards that your competition (ie. human soldiers) cannot meet and because if war causes less collateral damage, the people in power are more likely to resort to it.
