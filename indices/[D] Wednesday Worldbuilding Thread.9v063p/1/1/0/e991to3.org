Ah. That's a pretty good idea. I had the notion that some of the population would be trained as warriors and then kept in some sort of strategic defensive skeleton reserve. But your plan is more profitable.

The only issue is if the Island wants to keep the existence of the skeletons secret. The undead warriors could always wear full body armor. (Strength of a grown man with 15% of the bodymass and unlimited endurance means they can load up on metal and padding.) But as soon as a skeleton is captured and dissected, the gig is up.

Maybe load incendiary devices into the skeleton's armor, and spread the knowledge that these noble mercenaries refuse to be taken alive?
