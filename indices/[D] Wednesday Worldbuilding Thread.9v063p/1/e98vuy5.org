What kinds of goods would a skeleton-based economy import and export?

The rulers of Skeleton Island have knowledge of a ritual which reanimates a skeleton with the strength and skills of the deceased. The skeletons can react to stimuli, don't need to eat or breathe, and can perform any physical task which they learned before their death, but cannot learn new complex skills. The skeletons can also be 'programmed' to perform repetitive motions by a necromancer.

If Skeleton Island doesn't export the skeletons themselves (because they want to keep the ritual secret), what would the economy of the island look like?

Some ideas:

- Much of the living population should be paid to study skilled trades for their entire life, in exchange for pledging their skeletons to the service of the crown. Like life-long college with the loans due after death. (Depending on skeleton depreciation rate, it might not be optimal for the peasant to spend their /entire/ life learning.)

- The island could have a special secluded academy on a remote hilltop. They could pay huge sums for top artisans and sages to come teach at the academy, providing them plenty of luxuries but not allowing them to leave the campus grounds.

- The island also needs a group of living merchants, dignitaries, and maybe dockworkers to facilitate trade.

- I reread Alexander Wales' "A Bluer Shade of White", which features giant ice golems turning cranks to power textile and flour mills. Skeleton Island can probably do something similar, except skeletons are more dextrous than ice golems, and more difficult to replenish. So the island could export lots of hand-woven textiles, glassware, and other high quality mass-produced artisan goods. But turning a millstone might wear down the bones too quickly to be a good use of skeletons.

- A large number of skeletons could each provide a small amount of cranking power without wearing them down too much, but the opportunity cost of using that many valuable skeletons for energy generation makes me think importing coal would be a more efficient way to produce energy

- On that note, the island should import lots and lots of food. More food -> higher living population -> higher skeleton population growth rate.
