The island should import skeletons, mages, resources needed for reanimation, and raw materials.

The island should export manufactured/crafted goods, crops, etc.

​

For the native population, I'd expect it to be small, and almost entirely composed of mages and apprentice craftsmen as skeletons of master craftsmen should be able to teach their craft to students. However demand for the later would be limited by the supply of already trained skeletons for import. There's also be merchants and an administrator/aristocratic class directing the undead industrial machine.
