If you want "cover" for moving in corpses, you can have religious doctrine as part of it. That religious doctrine might even have a grain of truth to it:

#+begin_quote
  "Unless they are brought to the sacred island, people who die elsewhere will find no purpose in their afterlife."
#+end_quote

Or:

#+begin_quote
  "People brought to the island will become eligible for servitude in their afterlife."
#+end_quote

These are a tiny bit true, and would likely be seen as religious non-sense by non-locals, who are happy enough to save money on crypts and make some money from sending over the bodies of indigents, slaves, and the lower classes. Merchant-priests from the Skeleton Island can go to other places to preach this truth and buy up corpses to send back as part of their "belief system".
