  If Skeleton Island doesn't export the skeletons themselves (because they want to keep the ritual secret), what would the economy of the island look like?
#+end_quote

1. Make an inferior version of the ritual which requires renewal (if the original doesn't).
2. Dress your skeletons up a little. (This serves two purposes - you don't want them to experience too much wear and tear, and maybe it can also be used to hide that they're skeletons.)
3. Now you can /license/ skeletons.
