Depending on local economics, taboos, and belief about the afterlife, shouldn't the island be importing skeletons/corpses rather than food to feed people that will eventually become corpses? There's a huge supply of corpses in other countries, and Skeleton Island has the vast bulk of the demand.

If they want to keep the /existence of the ritual/ secret rather than the /specifics of how to perform it/ then trying to buy up corpse supply from other countries might be a little suspicious, but nothing that couldn't be worked around. (I'm a little skeptical of the idea of keeping the existence of the ritual secret. Keeping the specific knowledge of how to perform it is more plausible, though both could be justified with sufficient effort.)

Skeleton wear rates probably need to be pinned down to make useful predictions about economic incentives for the necromancers. In either case, there are limits to how profitable a skeleton can be, given that a real person has to be trained in the skeleton skill and then die. In a sense, skeletons are just an economic multiplier on productivity, when considered over time; a worker has ~40 productive working years, then another ~X productive skeleton years after that.

I would think there would be some incentive to kill people before decrepitude, given that real life skeletons start to become weak in old age. Whether that would be acceptable to the population is a different question, but it's what a pure production-focused command economy would do.
