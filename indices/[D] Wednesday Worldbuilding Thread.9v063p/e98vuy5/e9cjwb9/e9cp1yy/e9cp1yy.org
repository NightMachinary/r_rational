I wanted to verify that it is actually reasonable to hire so many sailors to transport water for the dyeing process. So, more math: medium-weight linen would be about half a pound per square yard, so 150 tons of textiles would be about 600,000 square yards of medium-weight linen. With a traditional free-standing loom, you could expect a single weaver to make half a square yard in eight hours. With a somewhat more advanced hand-loom using heddles (developed in the 13th century), expect it to be more like 3-4 square yards in eight hours. With a flying shuttle (patented in 1733), it might be closer to 6-8 square yards in eight hours.

Skeletons will work about 3 times faster than humans per day since they can work 24 hours. So, you'd need about 400,000 skeletons on hand looms to produce 150 tons of cloth in a day. With medieval hand looms, it would be more like 50-66 thousand skeletons. With flying shuttles, you'd need somewhere around 25-33 thousand skeletons.

Additionally, for spinning the flax into thread, you could expect about four times as many spinners as weavers prior to the flying shuttle, so maybe 200-260 thousand skeletons as spinners if you're using 13th-century tech.

All told, when you're benefiting from the free labor of probably ~300 thousand skeletons in the textile industry alone (factoring in dyers, weavers, spinners, and clothiers), and who end up doing the work of over a million people (factoring in 24/7 work without sick days or vacations), a meager 3,000 extra sailors to provide the required water seems like a drop in the bucket. Skeleton Island should be exceedingly profitable.
