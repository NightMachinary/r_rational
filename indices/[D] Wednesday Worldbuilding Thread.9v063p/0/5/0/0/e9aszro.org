  Breaking your phone results in a visit from someone on the magical inquisition who politely asks you to write the word cat on a piece of paper.

Option (a): Take pen. Take paper. Nod, smile. Stab him in the neck with the pen.

Option (b): By the time he finds me, I'm already in (apparently) deadly danger - a gunfight or hanging off a cliff by my fingertips or similar. It's clear I can't stop to write down a word until I'm out of danger. I plead with him to help and/or complain that he chose the /worst possible time/ for the test. If possible, of course, the situation is designed to ensure that he dies before we're out of danger (perhaps I'm in a gunfight with some people I just randomly shot at - and as soon as he turns his back to me he gets a bullet into the back of his skull).
