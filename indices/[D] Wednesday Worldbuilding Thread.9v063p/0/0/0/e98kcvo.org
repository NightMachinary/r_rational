If you wanted a workaround for that, you would set up the system such that a random bystander wouldn't be able to read or write. If you went /really/ hardcore, you would have all your members learn how to read and write (but not /speak/) a language constructed by the organization, however you would go about doing that.

How effective this is would depend upon exactly what it means for the demons to be unable to read or write, which isn't trivial to define. (Character agnosia, maybe?)

It would also be a fairly interesting problem to see a demon crack on short notice, but depends a lot on specifics.
