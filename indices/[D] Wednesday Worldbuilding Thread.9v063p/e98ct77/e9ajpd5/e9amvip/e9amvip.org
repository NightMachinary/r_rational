Breaking your phone results in a visit from someone on the magical inquisition who politely asks you to write the word cat on a piece of paper.

Faking your own death is interesting. The organization can track its members physical location at all times so you can't just pretend to jump of a bridge , but if you can convincingly fake a drug overdose or something that /could/ buy you a bit of time. That might work as a plot point, thanks!
