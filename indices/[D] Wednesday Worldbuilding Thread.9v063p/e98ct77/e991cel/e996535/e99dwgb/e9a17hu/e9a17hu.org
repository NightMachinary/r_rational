That delves into the settings background lore a bit more, but basically, each member of the organisation already has a minor (non sentient) demon inside of them.

Every human has a natural resistance to possession. The minor Demon is constantly chipping away at that resistance until it can take over control of the body. When that happens it also gains access to its hosts mental capacity and becomes sentient.
