Oh, this is an interesting one!

Suggestion: the message to them is displayed in a fixed manner, center-of-screen, one word at a time, and they must read the word out loud within a time limit before it moves on to the next word. The voice recording is transmitted back and processed to confirm that it matches the message sent to them, and the voice fingerprint matches. If they take too long to read a given word, red flag. If the voice print doesn't match theirs, red flag. If it detects multiple people speaking the word in sequence, red flag. If the face recorded by the device camera doesn't match, red flag.

You can follow up (or even alternate, with a text describing which test this will be presented before each interaction) with making them write out their answer with a stylus - if the handwriting, or the biometrics of the way they are moving the stylus, don't match the profile, red flag.

The demons can't read OR write. As long as you're checking one of those things, you can free up the task bandwidth of checking the second for forgery checks.

Edit: Oh, the idea to use a conlang with no spoken form is a good one as well. It wouldn't even be that hard to implement - you could just create a new set of glyphs to directly substitute in character for character. If it's international enough, maybe use a language like esperanto that is designed specifically to be easy to learn. Questions could be sent out as pictures over standard MMS channels, with responses being texted back in whatever language is convenient. You could keep the "written with stylus and handwriting analyzed" element to keep them from being able to say, coerce another agent to answer for them.
