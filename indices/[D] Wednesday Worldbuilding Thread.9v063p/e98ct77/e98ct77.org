I have a security protocol from my NaNoWriMo story that I want to run by you guys.

This is aboout an organisation that needs to deal with demonic possession amongs its members. Possession can happen any time while someone is awake. Demons nor hosts have no control over this process and are not able to prepare for it (the demons only become sentient in the moment of possession), but the process is instantaneous and the demon is in full control of the host as soon as it happens. Demons have access to the all the skills, knowledge and abilities of their hosts with one notable exception: they cannot read or write, nor can they learn how to do so.

The organization in the story uses the following protocol to detect possession:

- Right after they wake up and then once every three waking hours each member of the organisation needs to contact a central location and answer a set of trivial questions through a text chat.

- The questions are stuff that everyone can reasonably be expected to know ("What colour is the sky?", "How many eyes does a cat have?") and each member gets send a different message.

- The other side of the chat is manned at all time by three people that check each others work.

- If any member fails to report in, someone from the magical inquisition immediately teleports in to check, in person, whether this member is still OK and take appropriate action if this turns out not to be the case (the organization has ways to know where each of its members are at all times).

This protocol has a serious weakness and I'd like to know if it is as glaringly obvious as I think it is. If you figure it out, please also indicate whether you saw it instantly or had to think about it. Also, if you have an idea for a fix I'd be very interested to hear that as well.
