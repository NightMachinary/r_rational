I do want the existence of the ritual to be a secret, at least for a while. I'm designing the setting for tabletop roleplaying, and envision the PCs being tasked by their noble benefactor with infiltrating the island nation to discover the secrets of the island's productivity.

In the long run, the secret will definitely get out. The ruling class of the island is gearing up for the conquest of a neighboring land to grab control of some scarce resource which allows them to prolong the functional lifespan of a skeleton. (There is a much more costly version of the ritual which fully preserves the person's mind. The queen has ruled for over a century.) I'm calling this resource 'calcium jelly' until I think of something better.

  shouldn't the island be importing skeletons/corpses rather than food to feed people that will eventually become corpses?

I suppose I could tweak the ritual to be performed on a living person instead of on a corpse. But on the other hand, entire graveyards being dug up and snuck onto boats sounds like a great plot hook, even if it does give away the secret.

Also, foreign corpses won't be quite as high quality. Without documentation from their lives, it will take some experimenting to discover what skills they were adept at. Imported warrior skeletons would be trained in traditional combat instead of martial arts designed for use by lightweight combatants with near-infinite endurance.

And culturally, the people of the island may just want lots of kids.

Even so, I think you're right that the relatively low cost of importing a corpse means that foreign skeletons would make up a large chunk of the 'programmed' skeleton workforce.

  I would think there would be some incentive to kill people before decrepitude, given that real life skeletons start to become weak in old age.

That is absolutely a part of the island's religious customs. People are given some say into how their ancestors' skeletons are used. And particularly wealthy families may have honored ancestors who tend to the house, cook family recipes, take care of children, etc. It's like gramma's immortal, but less talkative.

But if someone tries to be 'miserly' with their skeleton, then they forfeit this familial privilege, and their bones are sent to anonymously work in a sewer or something.
