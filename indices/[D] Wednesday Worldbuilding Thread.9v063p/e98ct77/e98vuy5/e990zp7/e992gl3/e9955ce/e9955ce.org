The skeletons can vocalize, but aren't creative enough to generate original research.

Practiced speeches are within their skillset, and so the island could have an archive of skilled lecturers.

There's also a much more costly version of the ritual that preserves the person's capacity to learn. The queen and some of the other members of the court are the beneficiaries of such, and so they are very interested in research into extending the longevity of skeletons.
