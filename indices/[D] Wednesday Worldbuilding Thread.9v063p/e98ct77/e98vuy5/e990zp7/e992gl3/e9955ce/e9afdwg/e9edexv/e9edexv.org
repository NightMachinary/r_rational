Yes, but a different kind of skeleton.

The cheap mass-performed ritual binds the corporeal soul to the bones. The flesh is removed, fed to animals, and replaced with sterile wrappings. Or maybe the flesh is magically consumed in the ritual as the soul is condensed and fixated.

The more costly ritual is performed only on a select few and binds both the corporeal and ethereal soul to the bones. Like a lich whose phylactery is their own skull. Aesthetic-wise, picture a mummy with a toga and a painted mask.
