Presumably there will be no lack of bodies. In 3ish generations you have as many skeletons as people and in 3 more that number have doubled. If there's a culture they should have no lack of skelies.

Skelie farmers could provide the food for everyone given the lack. Skelie hunters could get pelt. Skelie seemstres can make cloth. Skelie miners can dig gold and minerals.

I suppose that a skeleton country quickly would drain easily assecible natural resources, so perhaps an older of these communities would be in constant search for rare natural resources, especially if those are needed for making or repairing skeletons. I would also expect that the comparative lack of manual activities would mean a lot of thinkers and people who enjoy fine exotic goods.

That is of course assuming that they aren't going to war against each other for skeletons since a skeleton based army gain much more for each victory than their opponents.
