Relying on trade for food could be tricky depending on weather and how far you are from your various trade centers, and depending on the stability of your relations with your suppliers. Famine is no joke, especially not in a setting without refrigeration and where agriculture is so inefficient that 8/10 people have to be farmers. You'll be the last to get food if other countries need to implement rations due to a bad harvest. Drought or crop blight 500 miles away from you could result in the starvation of your entire island if you're populated far beyond locally-sustainable levels. Alternatively, you might get price-gouged with food being offered only in tiny quantities at enormous prices.

To avoid that, you'll want to make sure to stockpile plenty of food that takes a while to go bad, like hardtack, dried fruit, dry-roasted and salted nuts and seeds, smoked and salted or brined meats, etc. Also, keeping plenty of livestock living off of imported hay would buy you some time, as the hay itself will take a while to go bad, and the livestock can be culled early to help get you through a famine. You'll also want to operate plenty of fishing or whaling ships to provide a decent local supply of food. You could also consider keeping pigs and feeding them food scraps on a large scale to reduce food waste. The pigs could also be fed the meat from your corpses as you process them into skeletons.

Additionally, you'll need to have a plan in place to prepare for if/when your trade partner(s) decide to start jacking up the prices on your imports in order to get a bigger share of your profits for themselves. Your best bet is to ensure that you trade very broadly so that you're working with at least 10 or more countries and at least a few dozen ports, making it difficult for all of them to agree on a plan to jack up prices for you, and easy for you to trade elsewhere if prices go up in a few places. You'll probably also want to operate your own trade ships and have your own established merchants in each of the ports you trade with so they can see local prices and get you the best deals.

With that said, one of your best industries might be shipbuilding. You're an island nation with huge needs for trade goods and seafood, so why not produce the ships locally? It would also put you in a good spot for mass-producing warships if/when your neighbors get jealous of your wealth and the secret of skeleton-making. Of course, with so many trade ships and fishing ships, you'll probably have substantial problems with pirates anyway, so having plenty of warships on patrol and performing occasional undercover operations (warship posing as a merchant freighter until the pirates come within striking distance) will help keep your losses to a minimum while also giving you considerable deterrence against aggressors.

Water supply could be another concern if you're populated far beyond locally-sustainable levels, especially if you're using freshwater in large-scale industrial processes like dyeing cloth for your textile industry. For example, suppose you're importing an average of 150 tons of flax every day to be spun into thread, woven into linen cloth, dyed, and then cut and stitched into all types of clothing, sheets, sails, etc. Suppose 50 of those tons are used in natural color for sails and ropes, etc. For the remaining 100 tons, suppose you alternate colors just once per day. On each blue-day you'd need to use about 3 tons of indigo, about 3 tons of potash or salt, about 200-250 tons of coal to boil the water needed during the dyeing step, and about 40,000 tons of water overall (for the dye bath as well for washing afterward). Average annual rainfall for Earth is about 990 mm. If you're using 40,000 tons of fresh water per day and you get average amounts of rainfall, you'd need to be capturing the entire rainfall from an area of 13,400 square kilometers (5,170 square miles), or about 80% of the land area of the state of Hawaii just for the dyeing, let alone drinking and washing water for the population. On an island smaller than that, you'd either need to import freshwater, develop some kind of water reclamation process, or simply scale back your production with 'wet' processes and switch to industrial processes which can largely be done 'dry', like carpentry, gem cutting, glass-making, or clothing production with already dyed cloth.

That said, if you're only perhaps 25 miles away from a country with a large river, it might not be unreasonable to buy rights to set up a watermill-powered pumping station to fill up a reservoir with 40,000 tons of water per day (not even 1/10,000th of the Mississippi river's outflow during the dry season). A sailing ship could likely make that round trip within four hours on average, and might be able to hold anywhere between 100-500 tons. If they're 200-ton capacity ships manned by 20 crew members and they can operate 90% of the time (the other 10% being used for maintenance and repairs), you could get the required water with about 37 ships and about 2,000 sailors working eight hours per day each on various shifts, or about 2,960 sailors if you pay them a weekly salary and give each of them two days off per week, two weeks of vacation per year, and five sick days per year. You could offload the ships with skeleton-powered pumps operated by old or mostly useless skeletons which aren't good for much more than walking.

As a note, 100 tons of dyed textiles per day would be about 0.04% of the Earth's global net textile production in 2017. Essentially, it would be about enough continuous clothing supply to meet the needs of roughly 3 million people. You can use that to gauge how much you should scale things based upon the population of your setting, and based on how many of those people would ultimately be buying cheap linen or cotton clothing from Skeleton Island.
