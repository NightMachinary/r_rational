specialist skeletons: Scribes who deal with secrets. documents come in, results go out. this could include cursed books that will blind or kill the reader- skeleton scribes create non-cursed copies.

mostly, you import raw materials, and have your labor refine and manufacture. you can work non-stop around the clock, so each skeleton is on par with 2 or 3 workers (12 or 8 hour shifts).

skeletons can work without regard to toxins, be they gas or otherwise. this can result in safer handling of some materials, as the skeletons cannot die of exposure to poison (but you still need to worry about corrosives, as well as very hot fire).

skeletons will need some protective garments. this will reduce wear and prevent damage to the skeleton, thus protecting the investment.

big money imports: corpses of skilled workers. some of this is from graverobbers, which could bypass guild or family secrets.

wheel-turning is best done by water or wind, as a low-cost solution.

if you want growth, immigration is your best bet. welcome the poor and offer them food, shelter, and a new profession. you get their corpse eventually, and they train their own children.
