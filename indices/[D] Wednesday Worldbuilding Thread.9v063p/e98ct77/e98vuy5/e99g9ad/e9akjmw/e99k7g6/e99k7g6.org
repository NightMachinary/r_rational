I dont think starting from the assumption of a law degree is the best approach. but if you do, them aim for becoming a judge or politician, instead of just a lawyer.

a lot depends on the specifics of the world in question. WoD works with the 'kill anyone who finds out' premise most of the time, so if you arnt a part of that society, then any action you take will end up getting you killed.
