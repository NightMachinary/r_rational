Let's say you are a law student who lives in an Urban Fantasy world (think Buffy, World of Darkness, or Twilight); you find out about the Horrible Secrets of the World, and want to help the supernatural creatures integrate into and become productive members of society.

How do you do that?

Do you specialise in, say, immigration law to help people get "papers" to live in your country? (I feel like this would inevitably involve forgery, which maybe a lawyer doesn't want to get involved in?)

Do you specialise in criminal law so you can negotiate to get vampires vampire-friendly accomodations (think: windowless cells with somewhat less concern in sentence length)?

Do you get a law degree, work in a generic firm, and then start "consulting" around the country / world, helping be a liaison between supernatural creatures and their lawyers?

Is law a really crappy career to pursue and you should pack it in and start over with something that actually helps?
