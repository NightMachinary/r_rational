The Optimised Wish Project is finally back after the Christmas pause - with the start of the new Tenkaichi Tournament arc! This chapter throws around a lot of details and new characters, so hopefully it'll get hyped for the follow up.

One small thing: I remark in the chapter that Baba the Sybil is 'almost four hundred years old'. This is actually inconsistent with the official Dragon Ball timeline, in which she's more than five hundred. The reason for this change is that it allows me to adjust a bit the matter of her being Muten Roshi's sister without completely messing up the timeline or having to allow for their parents to be immortal. I'll go into stuff that ties a bit more into this next chapter, so I thought I'd just lay it down.
