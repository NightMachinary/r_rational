We know Muten /isn't/ mortal, as he says he's drank the Elixir of Immortality in canon, and the same should go for Baba. Also for the Crane Hermit (who was around at the same time when they fought Piccolo) and Tao Pai Pai (who was his brother). Since we're talking about two who studied under the same master, Mutaito, and their closest relatives, my interpretation of it is that they all got it from the same source, but that requires me to put Baba and Muten's ages closer.
