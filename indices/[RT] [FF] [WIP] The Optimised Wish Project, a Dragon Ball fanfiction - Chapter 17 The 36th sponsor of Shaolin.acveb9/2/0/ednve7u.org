Something like 12 years ago, the two primary online references for power balance and feats and such were the Gamefaqs forums (lots of power level debates, or that was the reputation at least), and the Daizex (now Kanzenshuu) forums (mostly took the "power levels are bullshit" position, but people still wound up debating these things anyway). The Death Battle episodes on Goku vs Superman try to quantify some of these, and used a lot of the same references.

Some of the general points and recurring disagreements, as I recall:

- Daizex users strongly opposed the idea that any of the characters moved faster than light, other than via shunkan'iido (Goku's teleportation) or Kai-kai (Kibitto / Kaioshin (I forget which) teleportation). The comment about Raditz moving ftl was dub/anime only, iirc. The only points of obvious contention were in the Buu arc (I have not looked at post-BoG feat discussions, so this might have changed), particularly the bit where Gotenks flies around the Earth several times and the amount of time that passes is unclear.
- Big point of disagreement, power level-wise, goes a couple different directions. Neither community was united on any of these points, but fwicr, Daizex favored less power inflation, while everywhere else favored more (particularly for the humans post-Freeza). There was a period where there were two different families of power level lists, due to a translation error in Greg Warner's ... dayaizenshuu 4 or 7, I think? In which Hreeza and Goku had their powers off by a factor of 10 (12m / 15m, when the actual value was 120m / 150m). I think recent guidebooks and statements have made the post-Freeza transformations more confusing, whereas previously, there were apparently statements somewhere to the effect of ssj levels going 50-2-4-500, presumably cumulative, although ssj4 was confusing and GT is a consistency nightmare anyway, especially with Super in the mix.
- Discrepencies between Anime and Manga caused weird results, such as Kid Buu being the most powerful Majin in the Anime, whereas the evidence in the Manga favors Super Buu + absorbtions. I don't remember it ever being resolved whether or not Gohan was SSJ2 during his fight with Dabra, and Manga vs Anime made this more confusing. Then there's the Anime filler in which Yamcha is holding his own against characters who could one-shot superperfect Cell, which Daizex users generally rejected altogether.
- One area frequently debated was scale-of-destruction feats. As I said, Daizex tended to err on the side of the lesser interpretations, so claims such as Cell's solar system busting were treated with skepticism, and it was pointed out that there was nothing saying that Buu or Broli destroyed galaxies in single attacks, rather than over time (I don't remember anyone explaining how they traveled from planet to planet, though).
- A guy by the handle of Herms translated lots and lots of reference material over the past decade. I recall a sticky in the Kanzenshuu In-Universe forum that organized these, including which were relevant for strength/feat debaters. When this was originally going on, the DB Wiki was pretty terrible, but seems to have improved greatly since, and occasionally cites Herms's translations. So unless I missed something in the past 5 years, Herms's translations are probably the most reliable.
- And the gag parts of early DB throw a wrench into everything, never mind the destructions of the moon (Kami fixed it the first time, but why there was no apocalypse after he died, I do not know. Maybe Popo couldn't take Goku to the Saiyan fight because Kami had him making sure the destruction of the moon wouldn't break things five minutes later?).

The one thing that I occasionally saw floated around, but was never really elaborated on, is the question of what kind of scale Battle Powers really are. Are they linear? Logarithmic? What about Babidi's Kiri/Kili system? There's a bossfight for Goku around each order of magnitude: The Muten Roshi was in the 100s, iirc, Raditz 12-1500 (it's confusing depending on the source), Vegeta at 18000, then 180000 as Great Ape, Ginyu at 150k, Freeza at somewhere above 1.5m and below 60m during most of his fight with bass Goku, then 120m at 100%. And some people looked at these matchups and concluded that a difference of something like 1.3x is enough to one-shot someone, but that was never really confirmed, afaik. So is a single point worth much, or do they have diminishing value the higher you go?

As you may have guessed, the subject is extremely confusing and of dubious consistency, and many have made a hobby of trying to make sense of it. Just about everyone has to have their own Power Level list, filling in blanks or uncertainties left by the official lists. It's going to be quite the adventure to untangle it all.
