I got the weird urge to make a rational DBZ/DBS fighting game. Years and years ago I worked on a DBZ mod for LieroX with a group of friends, which became strangely popular.

My thinking is: what if I compile a database of all moves and transformations, and map the abilities to a table of every documented feat and all claims of absolute and relative strengths, power levels, speeds, etc.?

If I start with Mike Tyson as a human of high ability, and find that Goku's base strength is 1000 stronger, SS1 is 50 times that, SS2 is 50 times that, then how hard could he hit?

Same thing with speed. I'd adjust the game speed so the character's reaction time matches the player - between 0.25 and 0.3 seconds. At high power levels, thrown objects would seemingly travel in straight lines, etc. I'd probably have to implement Special Relativity to avoid attacks going faster than the speed of light.

Of course, there are some characters that are unphysical - I think that rabbit from DBS went FTL, in fact. And there are lots of conflicting data points about power levels. But a data-driven Dragon Ball simulation sounds like a lot of fun, both to develop and dick around in.

I just need to find that mod so I don't have to redo all the artwork, because /damn/!

Anyway, since you are into rational fiction and dragon ball, what do you suggest is the best way to go about compiling this database I need? Is the Dragonball Wiki the authoritative source? Is there a site with transcriptions from the show that I could datamine?
