"Balance" is going to be interesting and dynamic, I think.

I'm still very early in figuring out a concept here, so I don't have a clear idea of how power progression will work - either within a fight or between encounters - but I aim to let players decide whether to have a low-power (e.g. first season of Dragonball) game or a high-power game (e.g. Dragon Ball Super). I also want to let players build their own character - choose a race, spend XP on attributes like strength and speed, unlock moves and transformations with XP, that sort of thing. For a fight to be balanced, both characters would have to have the same amount of XP, probably. In tournaments, a system of XP bonus or XP penalties could work well as a handicap, so skilled players and newbies can plan in the same competition. Of course, if I support multiplayer it completely defeats the idea of rescaling the timescale based on character speed, but that could be a single-player-only feature. Or I might make the fighters just AI's, so players build their characters and then spectate for the fight. Maybe that's boring - one way to spice it up could be that the player can choose when the character uses special moves, or eats a magic bean, or something like that.

First things first - data collection and analysis, a 2D engine with people jumping/flying around destructible (procedural?) terrain, some semblance of rigid-body physics, and an opening to implement Special Relativity in case speeds start getting close to /c/. We'll see when (or if) I even have time to start on this, but I hope to have something posted to [[/r/gamedev]] or some dragonball subreddit by this summer.
