This story is getting consistently better and better. You're really good at hyping us up for future arcs without giving us terrible cliffhangers. I think it's cause you give us a bunch of things happening currently while also doing foreshadowing. It's fast paced without being too crazy.

I honestly forgot all about the red ribbon army arc so most of this is reading like new to me and I love it.
