I'm not really sure, but I would play the hell out of this. My first gut feeling is to go with Abridged!Vegeta's assessment: "POWER LEVELS ARE BULLSHIT!". But I'm also fascinated by the possibility, and the idea of designing a system of exponentially growing strength levels that somehow are still balanced enough to be fun! I can't help much now (work stuff) but this makes me think of an old and ugly-looking SNES game, [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Super_Saiya_Densetsu]["Legend of Super Saiyan"]], which may still be /the best/ DBZ RPG as far as encompassing these things went. Power level was the only stat, the numbers went up consistently with the show's values, and the thing /worked/. Somehow. I have no idea about the underlying math though.
