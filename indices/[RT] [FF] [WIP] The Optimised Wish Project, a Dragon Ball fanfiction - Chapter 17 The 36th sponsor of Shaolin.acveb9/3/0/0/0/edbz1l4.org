Tao makes a fuckton of money with his assassination job (it's him that Brother Wei mentions after all), and Shen is easily way too snobbish to care about the Tournament. In Dragon Ball, when he shows up with Tien and Chaotzu, he says he did so only because he heard Muten's pupils had competed in the previous edition. Before that, he didn't care - he just thought the level of the Tournament had sunk too low to be worth his while.
