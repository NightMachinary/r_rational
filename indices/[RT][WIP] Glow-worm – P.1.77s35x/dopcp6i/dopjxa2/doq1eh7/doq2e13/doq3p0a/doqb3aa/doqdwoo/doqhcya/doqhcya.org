Be warned, the overarching theme of this story is about overcoming abuse, including sexual. It's a lot like Jessica Jones, except that stuff also happens to /children/. This book pushes me right up the edge of what I can tolerate reading and knows *exactly* how to much to show vs tell, but it is intentionally difficult to stomach.

The author's wife is a counselor for victims of human trafficking, which is the only source I can imagine would be able to present these horrors the right way. The brutal honesty about abuse and exploitation forces you to confront the fact that this actually happens and must be fought at every turn.

The /one and only/ complaint I have about The Way of Shadows is that there's one reveal in the climax has no build up at all, and it is /literally/ the only plot point with no foreshadowing. Everything else is perfectly rational and ties together brilliantly, but the author apparently forgot to drop a hint about that mystery after carefully planning out *everything else*.

Also, the book stands on its own perfectly well, but it is the first in a trilogy and the best entry in it. The sequels are still great, I just consider the first book to be the only masterpiece among them. They get less dark and more melodramatic as they go on, but after the ringer you will have gone through you'll /want/ to see that happen to the characters.
