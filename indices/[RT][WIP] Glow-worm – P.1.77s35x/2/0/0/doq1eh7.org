I got to the same point as you did it seems, once the S9 showed up in just kinda lost interest. Seeing the super-hyped serial killers losing repeatedly in their early appearances with the knowledge that the S9 arc is insanely long killed my motivation to read any further.

Which sucks, cos I loved the Leviathan arc.
