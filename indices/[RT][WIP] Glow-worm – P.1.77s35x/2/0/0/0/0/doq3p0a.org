Post-Leviathan was when it went downhill for me too. I thought undercover-hero Taylor was much more interesting and sympathetic than brutal-warlord Taylor, and once she lost my support I just stopped.

To be honest I'm fine with characters I like suffering if something comes out of it in the end. But if it's pain for the sake of pain, then I'm going to become detached because what's the point?
