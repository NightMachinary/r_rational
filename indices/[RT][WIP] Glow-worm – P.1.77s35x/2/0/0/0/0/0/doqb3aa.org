I 100% agree. The Way of Shadows is one of my favorite books of all time because it takes me down a dark, disturbing, and disgusting road to the deepest pit of despair only to pull me back up into the light of hope. I can't recommend it enough.

Kylar endures far more abuse than Taylor and does far worse things, but the fact that he ultimately develop even more determination to do good and stronger moral clarity makes me idolize him as much as sympathize. The book is even darker than Worm, but uses it to tell a more satisfying story.
