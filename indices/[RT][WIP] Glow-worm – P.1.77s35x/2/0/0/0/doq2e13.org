I liked Leviathan at the time, it arrived rather abruptly but it was an fitting way to upend the status quo. The problem I have with it is that it utterly derailed the direction the story was heading in by killing so many people and reducing half the city to rubble.

That's when the story stopped being a drama about a angsty teenager struggling to do good in her situation in order to escape her abusive school life, and instead is just about surviving each day in a nearly destroyed city filled with terrifying monsters.

Seeing characters I like get tormented at every turn for arbitrary reasons is painful to read. Breaking Bad had characters who did objectively despicable things so I was okay with seeing them get screwed over, but Taylor is so sympathetic that I need to see her succeed to feel satisfaction.
