I'm in the same position as you. After the Slaughterhouse 9 showed up, the story just became too harrowing for me to find continue. I like superhero fantasies and the pre-Leviathan arcs appealed to me in that way, similar to season 1 of Daredevil, but after that it seemed to transition into the genre of survival horror and I don't find that enjoyable to read.
