Nah, Europe is pretty big, and England is pretty small. There may have been some tidal waves when Scion blew England up, but unless he specifically targeted European cities, I'd expect them to be in better-ish shape.

(of course we don't know exactly what the state of Europe was pre-Golden Morning, except for the list of Enbringer'ed cities)
