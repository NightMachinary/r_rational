Something I figured I'd ask about here and which is at least tangentially related to this sub's purpose. What are good works of fiction where you were able to figure out fundamental aspects of the setting long before they were revealed? I'm thinking of stuff like /Last Exile/ where you can figure out that everybody is living on a generation ship half way through or /Unicorn Jelly/ where what's happening with the catastrophe has had to have happened many times before.
