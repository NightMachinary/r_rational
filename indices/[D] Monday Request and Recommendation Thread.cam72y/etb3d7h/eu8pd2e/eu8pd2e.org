The best moment I think I had was with [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43723-the-steerswoman][The Steerswoman Series]] where at first I was like "here we go, another author doesn't understand basic [name of science possible spoiler]", but then I was like "oooh". I don't know if it's what you had in mind, actually, the whole series is built on this dramatic irony of sorts where the focus of the story is the characters trying to figure out what's going on with their world, but the reader's understanding is far ahead of the characters thanks to getting various references, knowing modern science, and such. The premise is neat, but I found the actual books a bit meh, by the way, so this is not necessarily an endorsement.
