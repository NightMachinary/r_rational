I'd like to thank [[/u/Sophronius]] and [[/u/Robert_Barlow]] for some /fantastic/ recommendations over the past few weeks:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/][Deep Red]] (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nemesis-worm-au.747148/][Nemesis]] (Worm)

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/btahxu/rec_let_me_in_2_a_rational_vampire_fanfic/][Let Me In 2]] (Let the Right One In / Let Me In)

Of the three, I'd say Deep Red and LMI2 scratch the rational fiction itch at just the right spot. Or maybe I have a thing for characters aspiring to be rational despite deep flaws in their thinking or struggling to balance rationality with emotion.
