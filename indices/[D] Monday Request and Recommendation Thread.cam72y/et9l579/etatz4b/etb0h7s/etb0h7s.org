At the least I'd like to see reasons why Heretics aren't being made for maximum power and efficiency and the human world isn't being given (even disguised) magic. Preferably though the story would go into full HPMOR territory, where either the school /wants/ to uplift the regular world but can't for some reason, or the school is a relic of the past that doesn't even exist anymore because the Strangers won and the main character stumbles across the ruins and accidentally uses the Heretical Edge, becoming an instant target from every Stranger out there.
