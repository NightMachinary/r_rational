One of the better CYOAs I have seen in some time. I just loved it.. From the worldbuilding behind the dragons, to each hand painted scene. Playing as a genuinely nonhuman character.. The mystery of human tribes emerging from the departed advanced civilization and their tech.. And well, being a /dragon/. I wish the death mechanics were less punishing and hunting can get tedious in the beginning.. But other than that I'm in my first playthrough and there is still much to explore. I went the compassion route, and in the next one I'm going full wisdom and focus on the mystery of the tech of the others.
