Yes you are current. We will reach a finite maximum as long as the rate is less than 1 child per person, that maxmimum is just going to be higher at a 0.95 an 0.9 rate than a 0.8 rate.

Did you see my first point? The fertility rate have halved in 50 years and is still going down, especially in high technology countries. That leads me to believe that the fertility rate is going to drop further once technology improves in low technology countries. What exactly is your evidence that the rate will increase? Claiming that people will do as their parents isn't a strong argument when people in fact haven't been doing as their parents for these last 50+ years, at least in relation to number of chilren.
