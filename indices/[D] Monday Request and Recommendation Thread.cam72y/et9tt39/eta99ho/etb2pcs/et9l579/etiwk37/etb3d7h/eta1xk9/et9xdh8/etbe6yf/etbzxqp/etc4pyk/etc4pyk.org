Or it's just helping with the 1950s vocabulary? My version is bilingual (French/English pages facing one another, with english vocab notes in the footer) and there were some English words in the notes that I didn't understand without reading the footnote!

What I found unsettling is I was empathising with the "weird future" characters a lot - like the wife who panicked if her husband didn't tell her he was on the way home, that's the sort of thing that I do sometimes, but I think at the time the wife would be considered to be going way too far. Looks like we definitely do live in weirdtopia! ðŸ˜‚
