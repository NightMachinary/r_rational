Not for older posts before the threadmark system, since TQ is locked it'll never get updated to use the system either.

If you're not on mobile I've found then least intrusive way to read things without threadmarks is to open a new browser window and then open each chapter in it's own tab. You can then swap between chapters by using ctrl+page-up and ctl+page-down (assuming you're on Windows with Chrome).
