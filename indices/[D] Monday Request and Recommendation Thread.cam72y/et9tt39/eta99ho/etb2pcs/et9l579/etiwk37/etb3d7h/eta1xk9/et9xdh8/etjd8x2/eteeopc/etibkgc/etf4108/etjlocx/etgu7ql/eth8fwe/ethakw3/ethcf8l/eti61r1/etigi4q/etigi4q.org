I'll concede that it might not in a fantasy world where mass immortality is feasible, though I expect immortality would introduce its own liabilities--if it's been forty-two years and your baby is all grown up and out of the house, but your body is in most respects physiologically capable of having another, the wistful urge to snuggle again is going to be pretty powerful. If you're basically twenty-one, physically, but have years of experience raising kids, you're in great shape to have another.

I say this as someone who has never been to Europe and knows little of its contemporary culture, but does have a new baby around and thus has a perfect opportunity to watch its melting effect on the female brain. People have strong biological impulses to have kids, and today's culture is weird, still fresh from the shakeup of modern birth control and the attendant sexual revolution. I'm skeptical of the idea that it's going to last, but admittedly that's because in our world it's long-term dysfunctional and will have to change one way or another. 1.8 TFR is usually touted as the replacement figure, but your figure is per person, not per woman. Would .8 be more like a 1.6 TFR? I'm sure the math doesn't translate exactly because not everyone's monogamous, etc.
