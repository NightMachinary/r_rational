I want to recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/magna-graecia-titanomachia-a-city-state-quest.55040/][Magna Graecia: Titanomachia (A City State Quest)]].

It's about an alternative history where the citizens of the greek [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis][polis]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eretria][Eretria]] fled to southern Italy when their city is sacked by Persia. There they found a new city where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari][Bari]] is today. We're currently around 420 BC (so 70 years later).

The audience in the thread play the citizens of the polis who vote on the policies that should be pursued. This means there is a much better connection between what is happening inside and outside the story than in other quests.

This quest is not in any way specifically rational, but it is very well researched and very well run. Highly recommended, especially if you've never participated in a quest before. There is a hotly debated issue in almost every vote. (It's still extremely civil /for a quest/.)
