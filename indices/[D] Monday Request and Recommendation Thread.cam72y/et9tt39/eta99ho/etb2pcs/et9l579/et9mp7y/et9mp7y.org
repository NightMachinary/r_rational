I dropped it as well, but more because of the way the writing style was going. too many secrets that the reader is aware of, that dont get explained. too much forced combat-to-the-death too quickly. the pacing was wrong in a lot of ways.

why is it so many stories are about teenagers in life-or-death fights that are mandated by the school? "oh, you have powers? great, your conscripted to a military academy fight club!" and then of course they make the adults idiots who no kid is going to talk to. there is an entire genere of this.
