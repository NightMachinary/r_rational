I agree with basically all of your criticism. The premise and setup for the world was really promising but it falls short on most rationality criteria. I agree that the lack of providing students carefully chosen monster powers on a regular basis is outright offensive, but the lack of kids from rich/powerful family who were fed choice powers from childhood makes me want to pull my hair out.

I also remain unconvinced about the motivation to hide the mother research/Fossor/Ammon from the relevant authorities, as well as the weird denial of human/stranger children and their ability to go underneath the radar.

How would you like to have the story go?
