I haven't read much manga the last few years, but I need a change of pace. If anyone has any suggestions for manga that started or became popular after 2010 or so, let me know!

Rational works not required (though always appreciated, of course). I'm posting here 'cause most of y'all seem to appreciate good story telling. Any genre's fine, previous favorites, if it helps, include: HxH, One Piece, Yatsubato!, Bakuman, Oishii Kankei, Holyland, Katsu!, Black Cat, Aishita no Ousama, etc.
