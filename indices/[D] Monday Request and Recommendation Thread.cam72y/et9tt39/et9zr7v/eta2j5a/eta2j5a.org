Disclaimer: I just started to read manga this year and use it to learn languages. I haven't read the ones you've listed. I was stuck in bed at the beginning of the year and was forced-read (that should be a word!) by my girlfriend. I now know what isekai or otaku means. A part of me died for this ;)

Rationalist manga recommended on the sub many times:

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/100128/Yakusoku_no_Neverland][The Promised Neverland]]

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/102690/Deatte_5-byou_de_Battle][Battle in 5 seconds after meeting]]

Manga I haven't seen recommended here with rationalist elements (all rather slow paced):

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/107562/Kusuriya_no_Hitorigoto][Drugstore Soliloquy]] - a young woman with knowledge of pharmacy is sold as a servant to the imperial court. She applies her expertise to much more than curing diseases. It's more interesting than I make it sound.

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/97579/Koushaku_Reijou_no_Tashinami][Accomplishments of the Duke's Daughter]] - an otome game devotee is reincarnated (overused trope alert) in a game as the antagonist. Yet, the manga doesn't become a trope avoidance type. Instead, the main heroin introduces concepts from her world to improve the lives of the citizens.

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/1067/Cesare__Hakai_no_Souzousha][Cesare: Hakai no Souzousha]] - best described as: if Mario Puzo wrote manga. It's worth checking out for the art itself. Sometimes I just stare at the [[https://i.imgur.com/cbW5F0l.jpg][Renaissance scenery]] and marvel. It follows a naive student who befriends Cesare Borgia and learns how the world really works.
