Low hanging fruit: [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist][Full Metal Alchemist]]?

I haven't read much manga after 2010 so I don't know the popularity timeline, but I've recently thought about finishing some manga that I enjoyed a lot:

[[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=209][Dorohedoro]] - Very flavorful and memorable dungeon-punk worldbuilding and characters, though not rational. I need to actually finish it, but it was a quirky blend of grimdark comedy and lighthearted gore.

Pretty much anything by [[https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=115][Naoki Urasawa]]. Mostly thinking of [[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=226][Pluto]], but Monster and 20th Century Boys were pretty great as well. Based off of Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy universe, Pluto's a murder mystery from the perspective of robot detective Gesicht. Humanizing AI.
