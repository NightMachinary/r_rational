My manga reading list is outsourced, but I'll try to sneak in a few of yours ;) I'm yet to dip my toes into light novels apart from Eliezer Yudkowsky's "A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero" and "Dark Lord's Answer". If you could recommend some that would fit this sub, I'd be grateful!
