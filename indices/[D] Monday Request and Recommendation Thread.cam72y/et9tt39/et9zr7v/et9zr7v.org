Here's a personal top-tier list, things I would absolutely recommend to anyone (can elaborate if needed):

/Maoyuu Maou Yuusha - Kono Watashi no Mono Tonare, Yuusha yo Kotowaru!/

- Realistic exploration of what kind of realistic sociopolitical landscape would arise from a typical "humanity versus demons" JRPG plot, and what both the Hero and Villain try to do to resolve it.

/Witch Hat Atelier/

- Renaissance-era Swords n Sorcery semi-apocalyptic world where witches are a secretive tribe, the only known wielders of magic. Follows a young girl who gets mixed up in a plot far beyond her abilities, but very fluffy on the whole.

/Mahoutsukai no Yome/

- Urban fantasy involving a young girl with a ~mysterious power~ who gets bought in the underworld slave trade by a demon who isn't all he appears to be. Lots of variety in the mythos inspiring the world.

/Dungeon Meshi/

- D&D-inspired world with a bunch of races, magic, and dungeons! When things go terribly wrong for an adventuring party, they must delve deeper than they ever have, and understand the truth behind what dungeons are to rescue their friend.

/Made in Abyss/

- In a world not dissimilar from our own, there remains one wonder of the world untouched by man: The Abyss. There, things lurk beyond man's wildest imagination, and the treasures pulled at great cost from it are peerless in value. And for one young girl, the Abyss is where her mother lies, waiting for her. /(Warning: lots of loli/shotabait.)/

/Helck/

- The comedic story of a human hero who journeys to the demon world to... destroy all the humans? Experiences extreme genre shift into thriller-tragedy, and worth a read up to that point if the first part isn't so interesting..
