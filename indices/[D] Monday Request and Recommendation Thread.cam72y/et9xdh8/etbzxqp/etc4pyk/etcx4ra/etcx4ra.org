That's fair, I just wouldn't consider any of those words to really be “1950's” words, if you get my drift. There's no slang or cultural references (beyond the CRT being an outdated technology), just typical English test vocabulary. And yeah! That panic over not being to connect to everyone reminded me personally of parents who get anxious whenever their kids can't be found with GPS location apps, either due to signal or deliberately putting it on airplane mode.
