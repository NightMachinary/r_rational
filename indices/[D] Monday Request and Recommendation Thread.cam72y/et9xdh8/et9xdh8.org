I have been reading a collection of Ray Bradbury short stories and The Murderer ([[http://www.sediment.uni-goettingen.de/staff/dunkl/zips/The-Murderer.pdf][fulltext link]], sorry it's in columns but this is all I could find online) was very prescient for something written in the 50s. If written today it'd be a garden variety "what if phones, but too much?" short story, but its age really makes it remarkable. A quick read, totally worth it.
