Good to know. I thought there were more rationalist light novels (like the ones written by Eliezer). I have the following on my reading list (mainly because the anime had some rational elements or I liked the story): [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/9115/Ookami_to_Koushinryou][Spice & Wolf]], [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/46024/Log_Horizon][Log Horizon]], [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/3083/Suzumiya_Haruhi_Series][The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]].
