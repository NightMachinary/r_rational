Thanks for the recommendations :) I have a couple of those on my to-read list as light novels, which probably isn't that surprising. You should check out some of the ones I mentioned -- Yatsubato! is often recommended as being easy for those to learn Jaapanese, though it sounds like you may be beyond that point.
