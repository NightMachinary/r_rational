"So I'm a spider, so what?" is absolutely amazing, it's actually told from a perspective of a spider, as the title may suggest. And I think it's done very well. One of my favourite worlds AND stories of the past few years for sure. I admit, I read the LN not the manga, but I heard that the manga is great too.
