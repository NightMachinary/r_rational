I haven't read the story, but real-world fertility limitation would be difficult to implement. China had a hell of a time just restricting it to one child, and one child in a population of virtual immortals would increase the population by almost fifty percent every generation (depending on assumptions concerning pair bonding, heterosexuality, murder and accident rates, etc.). People have kids for a number of reasons. Poor people who can't find a way to improve their status, and who you'd think would be strongly motivated to live within their means, don't. It's not, from what I understand, a matter of not knowing about birth control, or lacking access to it; it's just that if you're stuck doing miserable unfulfilling work, living in a dump, and being regarded as a loser, having a kid can seem like your one shot at happiness.

Even if you eliminate that as a consideration thanks to magical post-scarcity and perfect social engineering, the desire to have and raise a family is very deep-rooted, by both tradition and biology. A population that doesn't suffer natural death would have to have very close to no kids whatever. As conceiving children is extremely easy for most people, and perpetually young people would have perpetually young libidos, you'd need, I guess, drastic alterations of human nature, or something like a police state. Actually, just the second one, because you'd need a police state to enforce extreme mods of human physiology and behavior. Or so I think.
