Of course. You start out with a population of 1 unit, defining unit however you. Suppose these guys live forever and they have on average 0.8 kid per person. The population now is 1+0.8=1.8 with 1 of them already having had a kid and 0.8 not having had a kid. The 0.8 go through adolescent and also want kids at the same rate. That results in 0.8*0.8=0.64 born children for a total of 1+0.8+0.64=2.44. The following generation then is 0.64*0.8=0,5 for a total of 1+0.8+0.64+0.5=3ish.

As this process continues the childless/new generation gets smaller and smaller, and even as time continues forever you will never get over 5. [Here]([[https://imgur.com/a/rYJMij1]]) is a plot to show you what I mean. You see the population of 1.8, 2.44, 3. Notice that while the total population always increases, it's rate of increasing is decreasing an it never goes above 5. I just chose 50 years to make things visible but trust me that we could see this go for thousands of generations and the total population multiple still wouldn't go above 5.

Does that make some sense?
