Yes, thank you. It seems the effect would require less than 1 person per couple on average, yes? So .9 would work to a lesser degree, .95 even less so, 1 not at all, and anything over 1 Malthusian doom at varying rates. How would you counteract Darwin? This is an average, I gather, and people tend to adopt their parents' values, so it doesn't seem like you could count on that .8 remaining stable. Even a small fluctuation would add up in a big way over generations.
