Try following the math of a one child + absolute immortality policy to the end. Because the result is /not/ an infinite population. This is entirely classical Xenos paradox - the total population will end up being twice what you started with minus one (and the unlucky person who makes up the entirety of the final generation never gets to have a child because you cant have half a child)
