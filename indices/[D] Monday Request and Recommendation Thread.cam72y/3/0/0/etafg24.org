  why is it so many stories are about teenagers in life-or-death fights that are mandated by the school?

The Watsonian reason is that, if you have a bunch of teenagers developing lethal powers, you absolutely are going to put them in a situation where they have to learn how to use them properly or die trying. It protects everyone else.

The Doylist reason is because adolescence is the conceptual "hero's journey," and life-or-death struggles make a blatant framework for that. Ritualizing combat is a common metaphor for how kids feel as they're being shoved into a competitive social landscape.
