I quit due to a couple reasons, one of them being that the mc is on a super secret, so secret explaining it spoils half the twists up to that point, station with a bunch of kids. MC's attending a class with the kids, and Super Bad Ass General Spy From All The Wars (seriously, explaining her backstory would spoil the other half of the twists up to this point), who's telling the class about some piece of history.

Proceed MC to have a dialogue with this character, completely ignoring everyone else in this room, with no one batting an eyelash.
