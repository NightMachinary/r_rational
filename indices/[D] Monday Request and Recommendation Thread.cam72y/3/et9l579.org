So I've seen [[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]] recommended here a few times, and a few arcs in it doesn't look at all rational to me. I'd envision the Heretics to have more interaction with the normal one even if the muggles can't remember it, maybe disguising those teleportation mirrors as powerful technology or something. I had good feelings about this story when the students were all given magic cockroaches and told to kill them for power, but this is never taken to its logical extent. Why aren't there super powerful hunters going out and caging powerful Strangers so that you can have the students whack a bunch of them assembly-line style? The story explicitly shows that you only need to get the final hit. Also there's no shown limit on how often the Heretical Edge can be used, why aren't they getting as many people shoved in there as possible? More generally, the main character often just ... stands there while her team mates are getting wailed on. She's supposed to be this experienced reporter who bluffs a drug lord into opening his safe. That opening was cool, and it promised good things; a hero-type who's motivated to do the right thing and is unflappable in the face of danger. Except no, she then spends her time frozen while analyzing how her friends fight the Strangers for her, and then getting the totally-unearned final blow on a complete technicality. And no one takes issue with this. I mean, I'm glad the author didn't go into teen drama territory, but someone questioning if that was actually fair and organizing the final blows so everyone gets roughly equal slices of power never happens. And the constant yelping gets annoying.

Sorry, that was a whole lot of nitpicking. I dropped the story, but it's not bad, especially if you can put aside the implications of the premise and just go along with the story.
