So the argument is that if you remained twenty something for eternity then you would continually want more children? It's possible but I don't see a compelling reason. You would definitely want sex but fortunately there exists reversible ways of becoming infertile.

Yes yes, I know that TFR is given per woman. In 2015 the TFR in Europe was 1.58 which is approximately 0.8 child per person. I personally like per person better because it's easier for the lay person to understand. 1 child per person and 2 child per woman is roughly equivalent, and we just need a rate of children less than any of these numbers.

The thing is that the current TFR does account for the strong biological urge to have children. The only compelling argument (assuming the absence of a total society restructuring) I see for why the TFR might rise is that the children of people who reproduce more probably also have a tendency to reproduce more, however this assumes that parents have a stronger influence on personal fertility rate than societal incentives which I am not convinced is true.
