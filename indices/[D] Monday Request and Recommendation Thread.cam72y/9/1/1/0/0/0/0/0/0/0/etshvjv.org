My intended point was not that you would continually want more children, but that you would have obvious opportunities to do so. Many, many people find it fulfilling to raise children, and while the elimination of the biological clock reduces the pressure, it also removes the limit. I would argue that a good part of the reduction in fertility is tied to women's lib and the increasing presence of women in the workplace; women are effectively forced to choose between building careers and building families, much of the time. By the time they've built up the professional life they want, they're past peak fertility and may not have a partner they want to settle down with, or the energy reserves to contemplate eighteen years of parenting. This is leaving out issues like declining male fertility and innate fertility problems in many women, which would presumably be fixable with advancing tech.

If women can be in childbearing condition forever, that door is never locked shut permanently. They don't have to worry about mutational load from age, or declining fertility, or dealing with teenagers during menopause. All of that's gone. A sixty-eight-year-old woman would presumably be just as potentially fertile as a teenager, and look forward to being vigorous, spry and alert for many, many years.

Now, all this would entail such a profound restructuring of society that it's hard to imagine clearly what the finished situation would look like. Probably society would be much more atomized, at the least, which is generally bad. People are social animals, and the effective death of family life might manifest some truly weird coping mechanisms. But I don't think it's safe to assume that current patterns would hold, no.
