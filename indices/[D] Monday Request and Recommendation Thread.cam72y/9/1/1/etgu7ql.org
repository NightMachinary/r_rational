I got two main counterarguments.

First, the world wide birth rate have fallen from around 2.5 to 1.2(per person) over a 50 year period. This downwards trend seems to continue.

Second, we just need a birth rate of less than 1 per person to never go above a finite maximum. If this is confusing look at geometric series. The birth rate in Europe is just short of 0.8 per person. Assuming that everyone lives forever and every new generation keeps the same birth rate, we will never become more than 5 times the number of people currently in Europe, not counting migration. That is a lot yes but solvable in the long term.
