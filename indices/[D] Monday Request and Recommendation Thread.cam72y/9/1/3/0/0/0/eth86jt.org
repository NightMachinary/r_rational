We're having two different arguments here. Assuming government continues to be by the consent of the governed, one way or another, you're going to have to enforce this idea that people can be immortal but can't have kids (or have to accept strict fertility limits). I suspect this would be extremely difficult at best, because many people rather like having families, to put it mildly--infertile Americans will spend tens of thousands on IVF or adoption fees--and human beings by and large do not make decisions based on Kantian can-my-behavior-be-universalized logic. Nor on long-term sustainability. Unless the infertility is a natural side effect of the immortality, people will work tirelessly to dodge restrictions one way or another, and either kick the can down the road or offload costs onto people they don't care about.

This could be the springboard for any number of fascinating and probably dystopian fantasy worlds, but I don't want to get into all that right now.
