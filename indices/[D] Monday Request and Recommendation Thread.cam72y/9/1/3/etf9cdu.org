  I haven't read the story, but real-world fertility limitation would be difficult to implement.

Wait, what? Sigh.

Ok, so do you even have a vague idea of how human biology works? Because if you did, you wouldn't post such nonsense.

In order for a male or a female human to conceive a child, it's an extremely complex process. Thousands of things have to go right. If any one thing at a critical step goes wrong, it will never, ever work.

Sooo....this is a society where the technology exists, whether it be through a magic spell, nanomachines, or lots of careful genetic edits using a tool like CRISPR. Anyways, it would be extremely straightforward for the doctors(s) and AIs or magicians or whatever who are processing each patient, restoring their youth and rebuilding their bodies, to break just one tiny thing, making them infertile.

There are countless things that could get broken. One tiny gene in specific cells in the testes would make a man completely infertile. Tiny changes to monthly cycles in a woman to just reduce fertility, not eliminate. One tiny gene in every egg in a woman would make her completely infertile.

Sure, this tweak can get undone. You know, by wizards or someone with a license to control nanomachines or with very specialized equipment and knowledge. But it's not going to come undone by accident, and people can have as much sex as they want, this will never fail on it's own.

At which point, a society trying to keep population levels down to what their available resources can handle merely needs to license/restrict the equipment and people doing the rebuilds.

This is nothing like China's one child policy, where they had a corrupt government and the resources of a third world country to police it.
