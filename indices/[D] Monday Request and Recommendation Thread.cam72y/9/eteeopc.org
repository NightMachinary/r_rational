Harry Potter and the Secret of the Patronus.

​

Why do I want to read it? I started the story, and in the very first chapter, I see this gem:

/The world isn't big enough for everyone to be young and immortal forever. Even after exhausting every esoteric and obscure form of magic known to Wizardry, there's simply not enough food and not enough space/

​

This is utterly retarded and no intelligent character could conclude this. Young != Reproductively Fertile. /Obviously/ if there was a mechanism to reverse aging and to make everyone presently alive their optimal biological self, anyone who wasn't an utter moron would put some limiters to at least /reduce/ fertility temporarily until a longer term system is figured out. Or, at least, if this was the objection and the alternative was to keep letting millions of people turn into corpses every single year.

​

Sure, the rest of Harry's reasons make sense, but this one is so utterly stupid that I kind of haven't finished the first chapter. Why should I keep reading?
