I've never watched Stargate in my life, and I'm enjoying it so apparently not. I just pretend I'm observing things from Zuko/Toph's perspective, so it's natural for me not to understand any of the technology. :)

Besides, let's be honest: Intergalactic space soldiers who fight an ever-present alien threat with the aid of precursor technology doesn't sound all that unfamiliar, really.
