Haha, same here. The thing with the penguin surfing was too stupid for even my brain to handle. I watched a lot of youtube clips though, so that might have helped. Still, there are only two Avatar characters in the story so far, so if you just remember that they are kung fu kids who can shoot fireballs/stone with their fists and feet you should be good.
