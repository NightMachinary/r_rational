  entorhinal cortex

Based on the 3 minutes I just spent reading about it, it sounds like the pattern in which the neurons fire in the entorhinal cortex are correlated with the direction someone is moving at that time. So maybe (prepare for pseudoscience) stimulating the neurons in a specific pattern will result in a person moving or thinking about moving in a specific direction.

Thanks, I'll look more into it but this sounds promising.
