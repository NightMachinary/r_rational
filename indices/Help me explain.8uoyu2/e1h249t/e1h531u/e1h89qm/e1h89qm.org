I'm not ruling this out but genjutsu in my story is supposed to be difficult on the neuroscience front. Also, I'm not sure how much nuance a feeling can have if it isn't attached to a memory, so I feel like an implanted memory packet would be necessary and that's not something genjutsu can do (in the thing I'm writing). However, I love this idea and fully intend to have the character/clan that can fuck with memories utilize it so thanks for the great response.
