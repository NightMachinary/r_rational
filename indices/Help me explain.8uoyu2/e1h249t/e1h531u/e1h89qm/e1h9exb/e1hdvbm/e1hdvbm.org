  the term "memory packet" is problematic. ;-p

Lol I know, I've just started reading MoL and it's the first thing that came to mind when thinking of a relatively small collection of memories.

Thanks for another great response.

  temporary non-hardcoded memory pathway to create the "illusion of a memory" using only that short-term non-hardcoded electrochemical memory pathway, without actually recording one for the long-term so it would go away and not be remembered afterward.

I love this and I'm going to have to think about it for awhile. I think ultimately the question is going to be whether or not I want genjutsu to be capable of this since I already have a character that can do the hardcoded version of it by other means, but genjutsu is something anyone (technically) can learn. What if the temporarily implanted memories condition the person away from wanting to break out of genjutsu? Also, I think if someone suddenly decided to go down path B instead of A, not because of a vague gut feeling/intuition but because they now remember all of the awful things that will happen to them if they go down path A (the idea of having multiple memories of doing something you have yet to do is confusing me atm, i'd say at the very least it would be jarring) they might suspect mind magic is at play and break out of it. Or is that even how this would work, they may just have a sudden and unconscious sense of dread in regards to path A only realizing later that it's because they have memories they shouldn't have, which would still be extremely useful for getting predictable knee-jerk reactions from people. Ya, I'm gonna have to think on this for a bit.
