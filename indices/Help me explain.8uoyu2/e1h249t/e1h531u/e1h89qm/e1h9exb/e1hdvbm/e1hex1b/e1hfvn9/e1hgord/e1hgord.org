That's a good point, but considering that the good or bad feeling can exist in your immediate awareness without also thinking about the memories that caused it at the same time, doesn't that make it a related but distinct "entry" in your mind? If so it should be possible to have one without the other.

What I was imagining was that the temporary brain circuits are activated to create the [effect of conditioning] without any related memories, so if you tried to do a "memory trace" to figure out why you're having that feeling, it wouldn't lead anywhere rather than leading to false memories. This gets you away from the "memory manipulation" issue too. It's more of a trance/hypnotism than anything.

So if you get that feeling, trace it, but can't think of anything, what do you do then? At that point, you have to ask yourself "do I believe this hunch or not?" It's essentially creating a gut-feeling based on scientific principles. And like I said, it probably won't work on a rationalist with a lot of time to think in a world where gut-feelings don't have precognitive powers, but it would totally work on canon!naruto. Even a rationalist in a hurry has a decent chance of attributing this "feeling" to years of experience combined with a bunch of sub-conscious details that you notice but can't call out individually.
