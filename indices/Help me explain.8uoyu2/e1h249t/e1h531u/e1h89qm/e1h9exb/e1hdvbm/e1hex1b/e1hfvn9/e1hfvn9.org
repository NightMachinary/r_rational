This is one of the things I was struggling to conceptualize here, when it's a person like in the above hypothetical, they expect dread when considering path A but they don't necessarily remember all the dreadful memories, but they're going to almost immediately question why that sense of dread is there and recall memories that shouldn't exist. Like if the dogs were to question why they expected food they would know instantly. Unless the spell was ended immediately after it produced the involuntary response, leaving the person/dog with no idea why they had said response.
