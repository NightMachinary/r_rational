Draw the brain's attention to a spot, repeatedly, and they might choose to investigate it without even realizing if they were already moving. [[https://www.sacklerinstitute.org/cornell/summer_institute/ARCHIVE/2006/papers/Corbetta/Corbetta.Shulman.2002.NRN.pdf][Here's]] an interesting paper on it, the jist is that attention in the brain is both top down (you find something you're looking for) and bottom-up (it's called stimulus driven in the article, but I learned it as bottom-up).

Genjutsu messing with memory is pretty OP, unless you're Kishimoto and are incapable of figuring out how to use the powers you already gave your characters. I think it's better to have something that only affects the senses and some short-term memory. This makes more sense neurologically, since short-term memory seems to be mainly in the prefrontal cortex and senses are in several distinct lobes, whereas long-term memory is everywhere and usually needs the hippocampus to be encoded. If you could mess with the mid and hind brain like that, you could just turn off someone's heart. In-story I would say genjutsu messes with the frontal cortex, and can do that because that's the part of the brain that interfaces directly with chakra (we know chakra can enhance senses, the sense lobes interacting with chakra helps explains the super-awareness of skilled ninja) and genjutsu works by injecting chakra into the chakra system, not the brain (again, you could just turn off the brain or give someone an aneurysm if it was direct). That's also related to how I explain the sharingan (the eyes interface directly with the chakra system, which does all the information processing and then writes it into the brain leaving a strong memory) but that's not really relevant.

You could draw their attention to what you want while hiding other things from their attention, implant something into their short-term memory that will draw their attention to something similar or make something stand out to them, mess with senses and make certain experiences strong enough to be encoded in long-term memory, but you can't mess with long-term memory directly.

For this specific case, I'd have characters seem drawn to it or find themselves moving in a direction without even realizing that's what they're doing. The unconscious handles more than you'd think. An observant character might realize this is suspicious.
