Dampen entorhinal cortex firing in response to movement away from the point of interest, maybe? That might produce an effect where they'd have difficulty situating themselves spacially unless moving towards the point. If you can find a good human case study of a lesion there that might point you in the right direction for the subjective feeling of it, or you could just make something up.
