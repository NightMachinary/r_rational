Thanks for the response, and no problem. Though I have to say if you're going heavy real-world neuroscience, the term "memory packet" is problematic. ;-p

AFAIK, short-term memory is mostly electrochemical, activating a certain pathway of neurons, and then if you want it to go into long-term memory, you have to keep activating that same pathway electrochemically until the brain eventually builds something physical to represent the memory.

If genjutsu is "magical enough" to mess with a brain from a distance, it might also be "magical enough" to cause the brain to continually activate that temporary non-hardcoded memory pathway to create the "illusion of a memory" using only that short-term non-hardcoded electrochemical memory pathway, without actually recording one for the long-term so it would go away and not be remembered afterward.

That said, my neuroscience is a bit sketchy, so I'm not sure if there's major issues with this, but it might be helpful in some way somewhere.

Cheers!
