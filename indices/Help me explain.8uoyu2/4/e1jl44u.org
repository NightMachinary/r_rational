I imagine it could merely twist whatever decision process the person uses to pick an optimal route? Switch their priorities and the way they assign preferences. The way you said it it shouldn't be so radical as "sure, I'll go there by walking through the river of lava, seems the safest route to me!" - just nudging your preference between similarly plausible routes.
