David Brin has a story, The Loom of Thessaly, that starts with the finding of a hill where, at every point on the hill, the easiest path, because of slope or thorn bushes or whatever, is always downhill. The only way to the top is to always push through the most inconvenient direction of travel.

A genjutsu that created the seeming of a path like this that leads through the target spot might work for you.
