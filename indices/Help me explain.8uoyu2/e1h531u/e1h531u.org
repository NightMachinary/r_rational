I think getting really deep into the neuroscience of it would probably introduce more room for error. Why not just say it places a "temporary conditioning state" on the opponent's brain?

--------------

Imagine the person had to pick the route 10 times. Every time they picked the route you want them to, they got rewarded. Every time they did something else, they had a bad time. The next time they want to choose a route, they're going to get a "good feeling" from the route you want them to take, but a "bad feeling" from the other ones.

Now imagine that the prior conditioning didn't actually happen, but your mind magic hijacks their brain to make them feel like it did (without any explicit memories of it of course).

In absence of compelling reasons to go a different direction, they're probably going to pick the one they feel good about. Especially if they're not rationalists themselves. Naruto and friends totally make their decisions based on gut feelings in canon. Not sure how applicable this is to your story though.

But given that it's supposed to be "subtle", I think this is about as much effect as you can really expect. The other solutions seem very NOT subtle and will make it pretty obvious they're under some kind of spell effect.
