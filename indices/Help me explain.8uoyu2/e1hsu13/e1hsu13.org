That sounds similar to the earlier versions of the Déjà vu no Jutsu in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu][Déjà vu no Jutsu]]. In that case it affects several things. 1) The initial intuitive pattern recognition 2) The intuition that raises attention to things like movement.

The use mainly hinges on how ingrained skills is, as well as paranoia. Basically, if they move around they will think there is something they need to investigate /over there/. Then they walk happily into a trap because the don't recognize that this pile of leaves looks suspicious.

Of course in the story it is a completely OP skill that also makes people misjudge distances and run into walls, lets you walk right up to someone and stab them and is also impossible to dispel if you do notice it, but I assume that is not quite what you had in mind.
