With Pickler coming back into the limelight to reveal a new invention, I'm getting concerned about the possibility of Gnome intervention. Every race in the Guideverse has, so far, gotten to play at least a tangential role in the story. Even the Elves and the Giants have gotten to come in during this Book. Maybe they'll be the exception, but I'm skeptical.
