It crosses from general political incompetency to idiot-ball territory in my books, I'm not sure what your tolerance is!

The very existence of GAI should have allowed for more robust fail states, while there must have been /some/ reason to use Vampire brains for tasks as opposed to emulating them in software, nothing called for them to be left running around with just a single biological gun to their head, a gun that proved utterly ineffective. You should have cut them off at the spinal cord.

I can't imagine the system was robust at all, when the vampire could get around it by the simple expediency of /closing their eyes/!

Additionally, Watts lampshades the problem by claiming that the vampires couldn't be kept in VR for a bullshit reason like 'they could see the pixels', if I remember correctly. Leaving aside that we can manufacture screens of density sufficient to pass today, if not commercially, that is a very lame excuse. You have options like laser scanning the retina like a CRT if that's an issue.

I'm not saying it's a bad book, but it takes liberties and ignores sensible solutions in a way that Blindsight never did.
