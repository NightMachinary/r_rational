  By the time he reaches the level of Jade though, he's powerful enough to accomplish his goals. He is much, much stronger than any of the other people in the valley and he needs to use force to convince them, he can.

His stated goal is to save his home from the dreadgod attack that's supposed to happen in 15 years, though, for which he needs far greater power. I suppose your point is that he can accomplish the saving the people part by just forcing them to relocate, but that also seems implausible at that level of power. An entire valley of people, some of whom are antagonistic towards Lindon, aren't going to just head off into the deadly wilds j ust because he says. And what, is he going to just kill anyone who doesn't listen? I'm not sure how you think he can really accomplish his goals at the power level he achieves by Jade, even if he didn't care about saving the valley itself.
