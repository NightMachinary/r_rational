Unfortunately, that doesn't work. You're missing the fact that the Sacred Valley is marked as a quarantined site in the Akura maps, which is first mentioned in (I think) Underlord. Eithan doesn't have enough pull with the Akura to get around that.

Obviously they're not enforcing the quarantine super well, but the migration of an entire clan out of the Valley would definitely be noticed and stopped.

Lindon was probably planning on asking for something along these lines after the Uncrowned Tournament, given that he did pretty well.
