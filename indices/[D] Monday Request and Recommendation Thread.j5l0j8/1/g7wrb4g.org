For those who don't know, Cradle is a fairly well written eastern inspired fantasy series written by Will Wright. It adheres to the the concepts of progression fantasy where people continuously can get, 'better," and improve their level with more training. Like litrpg stuff but inherently better because it avoids the fate of inevitably turning into excel number crunching porn where characters spend thousands and thousands of words agonizing about point allocation and scaling modifiers.

Very very high level Summary:

MC is a guy who has no chance of cultivating power b/c of a genetic defect. A weird glitch in the universe occurs and he gets both motivation and advice to be more than just a nobody.

Pros for the series:

- Well written
- VERY bingable
- The characters act quite rational in most cases
- The action scenes are pretty well written (coming from someone who skims them normally)
- The worldbuilding is really, really cool
- The plot is scaling just as well as the characters scale

Cons:

- The mc is an obvious and blatant hypocrite post book like 4-5ish?
- The characters occasionally feel a bit tropey
- becomes somewhat cliche in later books
- Tbh the first book felt extremely slow for me
