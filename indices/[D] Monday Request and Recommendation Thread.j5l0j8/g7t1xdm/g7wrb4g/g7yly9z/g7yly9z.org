I started reading The Humble Life of a Skill Trainer recently, and I'm really liking it. It's got one of the rarest things ever in fiction, constructive introspection. The main character develops skills for self-awareness and later more skills for deeper introspection, and the writing actually reflects that as he starts narrating his thoughts more than his actions. And what's more, it's not all depressed navel-gazing! The story feels well thought out so far (around chapter 25), and nothing has been egregiously irrational. The world does feel dark and somewhat medieval, which leads to some cliches in characters. But otherwise it's been really good!
