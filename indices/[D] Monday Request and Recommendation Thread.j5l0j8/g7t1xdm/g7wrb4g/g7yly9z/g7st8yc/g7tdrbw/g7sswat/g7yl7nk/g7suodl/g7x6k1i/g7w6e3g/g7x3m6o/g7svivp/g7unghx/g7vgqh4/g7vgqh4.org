Echopraxia felt too self indulgent to hit Blindsight's high notes.

We know that humanity had GAI around doing the heavy lifting, what were they upto, while the vampires took over, sleeping? I doubt it was something as stupid as them considering vampires to be just as legitimate as Homo sapiens, causing them to sit out the war, because we already know that there were arbitrary nation-states around, which implies not taking such a broad view of the whole affair.

They were also /horribly/ blase about controlling the vampires, I'd have kept them outright paraplegic if possible, or genetically tweaked them to be weaker and slower physically than baseline humans. It's not like they had much in the way of rights, so what stopped them?

Plus no end of other post-humans to keep the peace, unless they were all trivially neutralized somehow.
