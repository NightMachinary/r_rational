I'm following and enjoying Impurity, but I'm not finding it to hit the same emotional buttons for me; I'm not entirely sure why.

Sleepless Domain is, indeed, enjoyable; I've been following it serially for a while now, but maybe I should give it a from-start-to-present reread and see if it hits the relevant notes for me. I don't /specifically remember/ it doing so the first time around, but that was a while ago, and in terms of content it definitely /seems/ like the sort of thing that might.

The "dark and gritty but with lots of hope/fluff" part is a lot closer to the thing I'm after than the "everything going wrong in ways that totally make sense" part, I think; but it's still not quite the thing. (I wouldn't consider either Nanoha canon or Shadowjack's Sailor Moon recaps to be particularly gritty, even if they're both periodically somewhat dark, and they still have the thing; meanwhile, Higurashi: When They Cry /does/ fit that criterion, but nonetheless /doesn't/ have the thing.) I'm not sure /what/ the thing is, yet, despite multiple attempts at introspection towards it and one long conversation about it with a friend.
