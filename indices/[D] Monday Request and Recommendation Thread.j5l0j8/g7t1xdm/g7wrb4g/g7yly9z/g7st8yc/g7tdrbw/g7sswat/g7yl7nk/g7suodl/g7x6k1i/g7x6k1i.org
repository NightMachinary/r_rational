[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two][Copy, Paste: The Misadventures of Milo Two]] is pretty entertaining, and has a fairly rational POV character. I've enjoyed the reasoning and enthusiasm of the main character. The abuse of the skill system is good for a laugh as well.

The main character, among other things, turns a "book summons" skill into a guided missile.
