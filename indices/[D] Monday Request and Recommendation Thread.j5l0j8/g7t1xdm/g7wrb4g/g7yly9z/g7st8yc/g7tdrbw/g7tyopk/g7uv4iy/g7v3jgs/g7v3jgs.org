I agree with a lot of your points, particularly with the perhaps overly-ambitious scope of the story. I think it's pretty clear that Kale's final arc was probably severely cut down in the final book, for example, and he became very one dimensional "because the plot required it".

I do disagree with your point regarding the epilogue, though. To me it hit the spot, I can't see a better way to tie up Ruka's sad story.

Also, I consider book 3's climax to be not the end of the siege with the empire, but the final confrontation with Ando, which gave the trilogy the overarching theme that it was missing. The idea that human ugliness, brutality curiosity, and search for redemption triumphs over divinity and superstition. The saying "perfect is the enemy of good" comes to mind, together with the thought that while humans can be good at times, and should strive for it, perfect will forever be out of reach. Or that's my thought on it, I'm still thinking on the it.
