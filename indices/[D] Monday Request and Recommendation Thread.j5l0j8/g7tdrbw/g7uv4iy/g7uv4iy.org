I began this series on your previous recommendation and have since finished the entire trilogy. It was a pretty good series with a lot of feeling and the author doesn't pull any punches.

I really enjoyed Ruka as a character and the character interactions in general were quality. The opening act of Book 2 was my personal highlight of the series and managed the rare feat of enriching much of the work that came before.

I think the plot structure was a little ambitious, particularly sans a professional editor, as some of the timeline jumps were very abrupt and some plot developments just burst into the story out of nowhere throwing off the rhythm of the narrative. There were a few too many chapters without enough purpose or significance that would have benefited from removal. Pretty much all things a professional editor would have picked up on.

Book 2's climax felt like more of a proper climax than Book 3's too, even if it felt rushed. It held more weight for me than the conflict with the empire. Also, unnecessary and self-indulgent epilogue imo.

All that aside I would (and have) happily recommended the series.
