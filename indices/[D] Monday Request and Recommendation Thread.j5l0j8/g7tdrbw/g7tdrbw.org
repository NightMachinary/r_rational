I'm going to again recommend [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35994830][Kings of Paradise]], book 1 of the (completed) [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/233409-ash-and-sand][Ash and Sand Trilogy]], this time by itself in a parent level post. The final book of the trilogy was released recently and I can now say that this is not just the best self-published trilogy I've ever read, but among the best fantasy I've ever read.

blurb:

#+begin_quote
  Ruka, called a demon at birth, is a genius. Born malformed and ugly into the snow-covered wasteland of the Ascom, he was spared from death by his mother's love. Now he is an outcast, consumed with hate for those who've wronged him. But to take his vengeance, he must first survive. Across a vast sea in the white-sand island paradise of Sri Kon, Kale is fourth and youngest son of the Sorcerer King. And at sixteen, Kale is a disappointment. As the first prince ever forced to serve with low-born marines, Kale must prove himself and become a man, or else lose all chance of a worthy future, and any hope to win the love of his life. Though they do not know it, both boys are on the cusp of discovery. Their worlds and lives are destined for greatness, or ruin.

My one caveat to potential readers is that the book starts out rather brutally, grim and dark and with canibalism, but it shouldn't scare you away, as the story as a whole is anything but /grimdark/. Ruka's character arc is amazingly well done, and final book's ending is one of the finest I've ever read. My advice is to keep reading until it changes POV from Ruka to Kale at the least.

(read the following only if you need more convincing)

My favourite part of this book, which took me a while to figure out and which I think is seldom mentioned by other reviewers, is a mirroring he does with the two main POV characters, where their lives, their attitudes, their character arcs, the people around them, and even their powers are inverted reflections of one another. An example:

- Kale is handsome prince born to privilege on a tropical paradise. He is a disappointment to his family and disdains his circumstances and his education. Kale does not know what he wants from life, or who he wants to be.
- Ruka is born disfigured in a harsh frozen tundra with only his genius level intellect and his mother's love, and he has to fight for survival every moment of his life. He takes nothing for granted. Ruka knows exactly what he wants, vengeance, but is constantly trying to a better person for the sake of his beloved mother.

The mirroring continues even with the powers that they later develop. Ruka's power is apparently inborn and involuntary, where he seems to have a private, fully realized world inside his mind, where he can build things and experiment on his physical skills without risk before trying it in the real world. This private world is populated by people he kills or caused the death of, who carry over their skills in life, but who are unable to communicate. Ruka often wonders if this power is real or just a facet of his insanity. He constantly fears that he is a demon sent by an evil god. Kale's power is taught to him and comes at great effort. He has the ability to affect the physical world directly, to manipulate the power inherent in things, power which is generated by living beings. It elevates his mind and makes him look like a god about to ascend.
