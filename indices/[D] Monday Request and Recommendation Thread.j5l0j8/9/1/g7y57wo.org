I liked the first book a lot, recommended it here a bunch. I hated the every single one of author's other books, but thought he had turned a new leaf with this series. Maybe xianxia was his actual passion project and LitRPG just paid the bills or something.

And then the second book was so godawful that I stopped recommending the series right away. It's basically the worst anime filler episode you can possibly imagine, put to book form. Imagine the novelization of 10 episodes of Goku running on the snake way, that's the gist of it.

Thankfully for the integrity of our reality the third book was not worse than that, but it was still bad enough that I've lost all hope that the author, Tao Wong, is anything other than a talentless hack who got lucky once, along the lines of that thought experiment with the million monkeys with typewriters.
