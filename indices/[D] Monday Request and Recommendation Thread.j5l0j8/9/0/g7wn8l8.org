[[/r/ProgressionFantasy]] raves about the book, but I found it quite underwhelming. I dropped it like 3/4rths through the first book.

The whole story comes off as a the most cookie cutter version of a xanxia story there can be. The characters, setting and plot follow the exact style you'd expect and in the worst way. There seems to be no originality or soul in any part of the story.

The only real positive thing going for it is that it is written in English, but for anything else that you might care about in a story, any of the novels found on [[/r/noveltranslations]] are better.
