The manga [[https://mangadex.org/title/48045/sousou-no-frieren][Sousou no Frieren]] (lit. "Aftermath of Frieren") is about the elf in the Hero's party. Her lifespan was much longer than that of anybody else in the hero's party. Reality ensues.

This manga is one of very few that contains what I'd call real emotion. I wish I knew of more like that.
