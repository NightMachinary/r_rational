The VR was mostly to keep people occupied since most people don't even work. Panem et Circenses. So the vampires just did their own thing, had their own social circles not tied to the humans, etc.

So not being in VR was part of the whole vampire rebellion background because a big part of society's keep people pacified mechanisms didn't work for them.

IIRC the protagonist gets grief from his mother about why does he even bother having a job, he should be normal.

Ah, I found it. The pixels line comes from Amanda Bates, the combat specialist character who is very much not an intellectual. The same page says vampires have a quadrochromatic set of receptors, and presumably the VR is still using RGB like we do...
