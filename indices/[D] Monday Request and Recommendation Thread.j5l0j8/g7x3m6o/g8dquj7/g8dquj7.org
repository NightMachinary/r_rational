The obvious answer would be the current work of that author, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/][Impurity]] (Worm fanfic). For the "other authors" part though it really depends on what exactly you're looking for. The "dark and gritty but with lots of hope/fluff" part, the smart worldbuilding, or just the sense of everything going wrong in ways that totally make sense.

I've been enjoying the webcomic [[https://www.sleeplessdomain.com/comic/chapter-1-cover][Sleepless Domain]], seems to have a similar feel.
