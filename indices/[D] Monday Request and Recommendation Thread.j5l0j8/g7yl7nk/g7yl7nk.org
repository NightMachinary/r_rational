The author of Young Woman's Political Record has started up [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35875/yashima-chronicles][Yashima Chronicles]], which is kind of a non-fanfic spiritual successor to YWPR.

The main character is kind of YWPR!Tanya but with /even more/ capitalism, and she's transmigrated to magical Sengoku-era Japan.

As of the most recent Royal Road chapter, she's been granted a LitRPG-style system interface and then immediately had it disabled (complete with sad trombone noises) because she refuses to play nice with the local equivalent of Being X.

Thus far it seems like the arc of the first story is more along the lines of The Devil of the Rhine portion of Tanya's life, rather than the politics that happened in YWPR.
