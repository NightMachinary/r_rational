My closest recommendations - though it's been years since I read /Game Theory/ - are:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984][/To the Stars/]] - /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ far-future fic. Fantastic worldbuilding on the SF/cyber-non-punk side, surprisingly deep plot, best infodump I've seen in ages (character watches movie of their own backstory; much better than it sounds).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892672/1/Haigeki][/Haigeki/]] - /Ranma 1/2 / Sailor Moon/ cross taken seriously.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4119917/1/Hakumei][/Hakumei/]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors][/Vapors/]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu][/Déjà vu no Jutsu/]] are three excellent /Naruto/ fics on the theme of competent-people-in-hard-situations. The first is AU, the latter two reincarnation-ish.
