Apologies if I'm not getting the tone quite right, I'm stealing Game Theory to add to my own list of To Read so I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Re-CREATORS/dp/B06Y3KGYR3][ReCreators]] plays with a lot of the Anime / Manga tropes including Magical Girls, letting the Meta interact as characters from some 'recognizable' but tweaked just enough to avoid lawsuits come to the real world and meet their Authors.

Past that and more into the weird Magical Girl kinda, [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia][Qualia the Purple]]. Which I'm not going to spoil as a bunch of it's twists are better blind.
