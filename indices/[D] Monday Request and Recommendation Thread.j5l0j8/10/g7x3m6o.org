Do people have recommendations for stories emotionally similar to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1178710][Game Theory]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1184729][its sequel]], or to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1220107/chapters/2498197][Of the Stars]]? I've been getting the urge to reread those, but last time I read them was recent enough that I don't think they'll actually land right for me right now. Those three are all by the same author, which leads to some natural clustering; but I'd be interested in recommendations for other stories by other authors with similar emotional tones.

(I'm unfortunately struggling to figure out how to /explicitly articulate/ the tone in question, beyond "the one that keeps popping up in a lot of the best magical girl stories". Otherwise I'd do that, so that people not familiar with the three linked stories could more effectively contribute here.)

...also, for those who haven't already read them, Game Theory and its sequel are /very good/, and I recommend them. Lots of nice beefing-up of the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha's worldbuilding, compelling character relationships, conflicts that make sense given everyone's actions and motives, generally excellent. The first few chapters more-or-less follow canon events, albeit with various expansions and minor divergences; but the divergences build up, and by the mid-point things are pretty dramatically departed from the canon.
