That's a valid take, I think that's a bad way to start a story, particualy this story which is not ultimately brutal or grimdark, and it turned a lot of people off from a great story.

If you can keep going I would tell you that a major theme of the story is self-hate and redemption, and that Ruka, the cannibal in question, has an amazing arc.
