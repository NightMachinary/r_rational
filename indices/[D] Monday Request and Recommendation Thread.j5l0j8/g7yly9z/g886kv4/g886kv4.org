Alright I'm caught up with the story, and to be honest it has let me down a bit. For someone who thinks so much about himself and the world around him, the main character really has an annoying tendency to make rash decisions. It feels somewhat out of character, even if the author tells people in the comments that these are some of the protagonist's flaws.

Also the premise of the book takes a back seat to politics and meeting new people, which leaves new chapters feeling pretty boring. Someone else may find it fun though, so yeah.
