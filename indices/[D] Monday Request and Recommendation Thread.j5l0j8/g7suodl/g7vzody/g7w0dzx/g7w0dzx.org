Book 1 (ch 1-31) for the most part is slow, the last few chapters here is when it picks up. By the end of book 1 all the changes from the movie to this AU are setup, most characters are introduced, and the playing board of world politics is set.

Everything past this so far is playing out history with the Dragons as a part of it, which as we move along is further diverging from history as we know it, but in a realistic fashion I think.
