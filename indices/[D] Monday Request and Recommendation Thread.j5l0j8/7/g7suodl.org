So a new(?) recommendation I haven't seen here at least recently.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10408971][A Thing of Vikings]] You'll need an AO3 login to view.

A Logical, but not completely rational of story where the How To Train Your Dragon island of Berk and it's characters are inserted into history around the time of the Romans.

Politics play out as an island nation of only a few hundred people now control Dragons as a massive force multiplier. Hiccup being an intelligent leader, understands this to some extent and controls the Dragons and favors he gives out in at least a logical fashion given his age, lack of global political knowledge, and general experience.

Battles and the like play out as curb stomps at first but enemies adapt and acquire their own dragons as an arms race hits full tilt.

Dragons as heat sources and in some instances replacements for industrial cranes and machinery, as well as Hiccup's own mechanical aptitude lay the foundations for the industrial revolution a few hundred years early, while skipping over and realistically missing some technologies as Dragons replace them or are not needed.

It's a bit long and drawn out at points, especially at the beginning, but teenage drama and feelings slowly fall away as the characters on Berk are forced to grow and deal with the outside world.
