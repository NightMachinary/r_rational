He's not doing something dumb for 'the sake of the plot'. His approach is baked in to the premise for the series. He is literally told by an agent of the heavens that this is the only way he can achieve his goals. His actions are well-justified in both a watsonian and a doyalist framework, and complaints that he shouldn't approach things this way are missing the point entirely.

It's like complaining that Frodo in the Lord of the Rings was stupid for taking such insane risks to travel to Mordor. Why didn't he just build a big forge and melt the ring down in Rivendell? If it needs to be hotter, then you just build a hotter forge; it's not like lava's that hot. Obviously, he's just an idiot...
