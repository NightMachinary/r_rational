From the start of the series we're told over and over again that his motivation for gaining power is to save his family and the others in the valley. That's why he's willing to take insane risks that constantly put his life on the line.

By the time he reaches the level of Jade though, he's powerful enough to accomplish his goals. He is much, much stronger than any of the other people in the valley and he needs to use force to convince them, he can. If his reason for gaining power is to save his people, he doesn't need to continue to risk his life and gain more power. He is more than strong enough to go back and get everyone to leave the valley to anywhere else.

The fact that he sticks around in the Blackflame Empire, continuing to partake in insane training and events to gain more power go against his stated reasons. At some point his motivation warped from saving his people to just gaining power for (to gain power? be the best? be with his friends? idk, it's kinda ambigious)

Like a basic cost benefit analysis that a child could run would point out that his chances of becoming a monarch powerful enough to stop the upcoming destruction to his home are infinitely small. That it's much, much, much more likely that he will die at some point in the process. It's smarter and much more logical to go back and save his people with the power he has now.

At the very least, he should go back, move his people AND THEN pursue more power for whatever reasons. Instead he's risking his family and everyone entire future for personal selfish reasons. If he died leading up to the tournament, in the tournament, after the tournament, all the people he supposedly cares for would probably die, because there would be nobody there for them.
