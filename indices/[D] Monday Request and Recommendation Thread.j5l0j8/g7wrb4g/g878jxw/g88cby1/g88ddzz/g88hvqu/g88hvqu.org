Ok maybe just him solo at Jade might not be enough, but by the point that he's Jade, he could have convinced EIthan to come along and convince the people in the valley of the impending threat. Eithan is an underlord with a strong powerbase beneath him at the time.

If Lindon tells Eithan that for him to be all in with him on Eithan's goals for him, he needs his family + clan moved to a safer location/ect, he could have done it.

There are a billion other plans he could have pursued, but it's an obviously insane and stupid plan to try to become a monarch and especially to become one in the needed 15 years. At a number of points after book 5ish he's, "powerful," enough to convince other powerful people in exchange for favors/ect to relocate his family ect.

Instead he continues to risk his life and any chance of his family/clan/people in the valley's chances to survive by throwing himself into insane do or die situations.

--------------

Like in short my point is this. At some point Lindon has gotten to the point where he has enough solo power, general influence, relationships he can leverage and negotiating power to get his family/clan/everyone in the valley to leave. (Join the Blackflame empire, start a seperate clan, become a part of Eithan's clan, ect) Instead of realizing this and pivoting from power gaining to power leveraging, he risks everything he has gained so far in the pursuit of more personal power for the insane^{^{2}} dream of saving the valley as well. If he can't realize that it seems like he's the dumbest person ever and if he does and still pursues the insane^{^{2}} plan, then he's a hypocrite and used his the, "dream," of saving his family/people as a cover for a plain self interest pursuit of power.

--------------

Another example would be that Lindon's family is in debtors prison and he needs a ton of money to save them. He tries his hand at playing poker to save them. Because of some crazy rounds and amazing luck he's made enough to pay for their release. Instead of taking the money and leaving, he continues to go all in on every hand, risking everything on the chance he can also make enough money to save the family house.

If he wanted to just save his family he would take the money and leave. If he really needed that house, then he should leave, pay for his family's release and then try to go again with what money is left over.

There is no situation where continuing to go all-in and risking what he has gained is worth it. The fact that he still is playing though makes it seem like his motivations were fake/and or shifted in the time he's been playing poker.
