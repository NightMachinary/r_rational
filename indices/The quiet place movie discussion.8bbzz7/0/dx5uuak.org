Interesting movie. I don't think it's very rational, though.

Well, the first thing to do is to kill them all, obviously. Put a powerful loudspeaker near an explosive, broadcast human screams through it, detonate the explosive when they come near. Repeat until they're all dead. Not sure why they weren't gunned down by the military, back at the very start.

That's boring though. Let's assume they are invincible and implacable. Can't be killed by anything short of a nuke, can tunnel their way through kilometers of rock. Ultrasound tricks don't work either: their ears are sensitive, but not /vulnerable/.

They're blind, though, and not very intelligent. No tools, no tactics smarter than "unfamiliar sound â†’ ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK". Animals to be tamed, not true opponents.

- Strong source of ambient noise was shown to successfully mask human activity. Live only near waterfalls and the like.

- Better yet: Set up several aerostats with powerful megaphones around your habitat, constantly broadcasting a loud noise of your choosing. The enemy can't fly, so it can't do anything about them. They'll be livid for some time, then will have to learn to ignore them --- and you will have a safe haven.

  (And if they don't learn, you now have a way of drawing them to a location of your choosing for an indefinite time, which is even better.)

- Better yet: Teach them to /ignore/ human sounds. Scatter loudspeakers broadcasting human noises (conversations, screams, falling objects) around a territory, then wait. Assuming that they care about attacking human-noises only because they want to kill humans, they will soon learn to ignore them.

- Additionally, it may be possible to sic them on each other. Attach a small loudspeaker with a recording of human noises to one of them, activate it, watch the rest attack it.

Still too easy.

*Increased difficulty:* Monsters are now invincible, implacable, /and/ have a magical ability to distinguish human-made sounds from /recordings/ of human-made sounds. How do you do?

I think flying settlements would be our best shot at rebuilding civilization, in that case.
