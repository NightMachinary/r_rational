If the city entire is covered by the grid, yes, why not? You just need a sufficiently powerful noise generator. And hundreds of thousands of earplugs to prevent hearing loss in the population, I suppose.

That brings to mind an improvement on the idea: imagine a 180-km-wide circle of land covered by the sound grid, with a 18-km-wide "quiet" circle at the centre containing the city. Would monsters, roaming the noise-saturated wilderness, be able to detect the city? I don't think so. The only danger would be one of them wandering into the city by accident, and it could be led away with sound-grenades as proposed above; the city could also be flooded with noise for the duration as a precaution. In the meantime, we would have a safe and comfortable living space.

Living in the countryside may be better if you're a group of post-apocalyptic survivors, who accepted that the civilization has lost the first battle and needs to be rebuilt from scratch. If you're a government or a corporation attempting to stop or reverse a collapse-in-progress, reaching for some kind of city-wide defence is your best bet.

That seems to be interesting idea for a story, by the way.
