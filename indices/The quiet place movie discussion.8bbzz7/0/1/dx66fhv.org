I really like your thorough write up! I like to think that the are literally invincible and can't be killed by guns or human weapons , just to make it more interesting. So the best bet is to distract monster. Some follow up questions. Since eventually with the development of your sound grid monster distractor, the monsters become a threat but not an extinction event. Here are some specific problems that would be fun to solve. 1) what if despite all other protections, a monster heard and noticed you right now and is heading in your direction and you have < 1 min to complete an action? 2) what if you saw monster from a distance notice and heading towards your loud kid. What is best course of action to save kid? 3) where and how will you get the energy and supplies to construct sound devices? As in how will you ensure existing human made generators and subsequent ones etc. don't get immediately or quickly destroyed by monster and how not to die during construction of one.
