It's not rationalist for sure but I love a premise built movie that involves problem solving. To make it less plot holy, let's assume that the monsters aren't vulnerable to sound, but just sensitive. As in, if the monster has its hands on you, no human weapons can kill it. And noise doesn't harm it, just distracts it. What are some things you would do to survive?
