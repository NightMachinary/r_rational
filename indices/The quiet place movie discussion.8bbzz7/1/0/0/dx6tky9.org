So it's indestructible, but /why/ is it indestructible? Is it big or small? Can it walk through walls or dig through large amounts of ground? Can it fly or jump very high? Can it, say, climb a tree?How strong can a cage which contains it be? Can you destroy it if it doesn't have its hands on you? Can it starve to death? Can it be poisoned? Can it burst through heavy walls? How many humans do we have and how much technology do we have?

Or are we rounding the problem up to "minimize noise" or "evade" them? What's the reaction time between "it hears you" and "it kills you"? Does it stupidly follow any noise or is it targeted? Is it clever enough to see through most obvious forms of misleading? How good is the hearing really? Echolocation level, or just human good? Why doesn't it echolocate? How many of them are there, what's the population spread, density? Does it sleep? What else does it eat? How fast does it reproduce?

Any one of these questions could completely change the survival strategy. There's a lot of "false constraints" that might get introduced when the enemy is totally ambiguous. (e.g. You can find a lot of uses for a hammer if you know something other than "it pounds down nails")
