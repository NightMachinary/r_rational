#+begin_quote
  When the creature returns to invade the basement, Regan realizes the power of the boosted cochlear implant. She places it on a nearby microphone, magnifying the feedback to ward off the creature. Painfully disoriented, the creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, rendering itself vulnerable to a shotgun blast from Evelyn. The security monitors show two other creatures approaching. With their newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, Evelyn and the children prepare to fight back.
