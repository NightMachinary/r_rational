So, for instance, no sound proof box? Because it will know that you're inside the box somehow, because you made a sound inside the box, and will magically appear inside the box?

At that point I think you basically have to drown the whole world in extremely loud background noise and take care not to sound sufficiently "different" to set off the detector. The new question becomes, how "different" is sufficiently different?

There's now a lot of math involved in when a noise is sufficiently "different" to be detectable e.g. Can they distinguish human speech from ai babble, etc which will determine the quality of life. There exists some threshold of accuracy at which the problem becomes impossible (e.g. If they can distinguish a human heart from the best imitation of human hearts money can buy, we're all insta-killed)

If the ambient noise of a babbling brook is sufficient to blend in we're pretty much fine. We even have time to solve the problem because a cityscape is louder than a brook. Drowning the world in white noise basically solves the problem. A nice microphone + earplugs + headphones combination could even get us comfortably speaking to each other in sufficiently loud areas.

You still didn't say if they are smart (simple sound seeking missile? Cat level? Toddler level?) . If they're not smart and high enough latency with hearing, but still good at accuracy that white noise won't work, you can use a mic and speakers to echo all sounds any human makes to be louder and in a different location and they'll all go there instead.
