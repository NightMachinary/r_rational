Let's constrain it to “literally can not be killed whatsoever by any human means”. Population density high enough and spread out that if you make a noise. monster will get to you and kill you within 1-5 min. Navigates with alien senses unknown to human. Biology is unknown. Only observable affect is if a noise louder and/or different from background noise is made, monster comes a kills you. Suspend your disbelief and construe a world in which if you make noise you will definitely die.
