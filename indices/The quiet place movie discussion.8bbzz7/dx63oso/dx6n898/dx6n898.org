I really felt like that ruined the whole movie in the sense that it made it no longer believable that the monsters managed to wipe out most of civilization. From what I understand of cochlear implants they work using radio waves. So what was really hurting the monsters wasnt even sound but radio waves, which is ridiculous.

You can work under two assumptions, they came from space or from Earth. In space they should have died in transit to Earth because space is where youre bombarded with more radio waves than on Earth. And if they came from Earth you mean to say with all the radio waves we broadcast we didnt manage to find, or already be broadcasting, the frequency that harms them?

Especially since the cochlear implant hurt them, which means most people with hearing aids or cochlear implants would have been safe.
