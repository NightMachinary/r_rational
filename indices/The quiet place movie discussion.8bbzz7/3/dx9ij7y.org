Some defensive tech:

A. Soundproofing. Live in soundproofed rooms. Look up instructions on how to use egg cartons and such to create a makeshift recording studio. Etc.

B. Noise mines / decoys. Set up a bunch of devices near your house that can make a noise at the push of a button, in order to divert the monsters when they're nearby. Could be as simple as a doorbell or walkie talkie, or you can set up something with fancier tech.

C. Masking background sounds. Live near a waterfall, or set up something to create lots of background noise nearby which the monsters will ignore and which drowns out your noises.

D. Distant permanent diversions. Keep the monsters away from you by setting up noisemakers farther away. For example, there are those prank devices that you can hide in a person's room which occasionally make a loud chirping sound - scatter dozens of them throughout the forest a ways away from anywhere that you regularly go to perpetually draw the monsters away from you. Try to prevent them from being destroyed by using devices that only make an occasional sound, and putting them up in trees or buried.

E. Habituation testing. There are some sounds (e.g., waterfalls) that the monsters will habituate to (i.e., learn to ignore), and other sounds that they do not habituate to and perpetually chase after. Run a bunch of tests far away from where you live) to find out which are which. Then use the ones that they don't habituate to as distant permanent diversions and the ones that they do habituate to as masking background sounds near your house (or near yourself as you walk around). If possible, teach them to habituate to the sounds that you naturally make.

F. Soundproof booths. If you often need to be out and about in other places (near your house, on certain paths, etc.), then see if you can also scatter some soundproof booths in those areas where you can hide when the monsters are nearby.

G. Sound grenades. Create devices where you can "pull the pin" and throw it, and it will start making noises a few seconds later. Carry a couple with you when you go out, to use as decoys if the monsters are nearby. Lots of children's toys are like this, except they don't come with a delay.

H. Drone airplanes. When the monsters get nearby, lure them away with a noisy unreachable airborne device for them to follow. This seems less practical than the other options because the drone is likely to get destroyed when you use it, though maybe you can grab a whole bunch of remote control drones from a store and use this trick for awhile.
