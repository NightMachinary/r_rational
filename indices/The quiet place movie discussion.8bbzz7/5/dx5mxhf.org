It's a good watch, even according to my friend who isn't much into horror. Watch out-- most movie reviews for it spoil it badly, if you care about that sort of thing. A review that spoils only the basic premise that you learn early on is here: [[https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/04/quiet-place-spoiler-basic-premise.html]]

  Yes this is a horror movie but no you don't have to like horror movies to want to see it, you only have to like original movies. [[#s][Mild basic spoiler]] It is one of the most implicitly Christian movies I have seen, though no reviewer seems to have noticed. Think monasticism, devils, baby Moses, the unwillingness to consider abortion as an option, silos of grain, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_(film][Shyamalan's (underrated) Signs]]). It's also one of the most insightful films on disability issues, although further explanation there would indeed give you too many spoilers.
