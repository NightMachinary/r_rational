In reverse order...

  where and how will you get the energy and supplies to construct sound devices?

Well, I was partially assuming that realistic!civilization wouldn't collapse quite as steeply as was implied by the movie. Research and development of countermeasures would begin as soon as the first attack happened, and if I came up with that list in the first ~forty minutes of the movie, there are good odds that someone out there would give orders to start mass-producing/kludging up similar defenses by first day's end. Depending on exact distribution of these smart people, numbers of monsters and their invasion vectors, and efficiency of defense prototypes, we could expect results anywhere from "some cities continue to function, sustaining minor damage" to "there's a few ruined factories with half-workable defenses scattered around".

If it's the worst-case scenario and we're not near one of these convenient factories... I don't know, just raid electronic stores and work on building your tools in sound-proof rooms. Would take time, though.

Regarding generators, same: put them in sound-proof rooms. If you don't have one, [[https://www.google.ru/search?newwindow=8MPNWvjNL-OX6ASx0buYDw&q=how+to+soundproof+a+room][make it]]. Depends on how noisy your generators are, how good your sound-proofing is, and how good monsters' hearing is, but there should be plenty of workable combinations. And, of course, what could be done by a ragtag post-apocalyptic bunch, could be done better by a mid-apocalyptic factory's workers, if they're quick on the uptake.

(Ohh, also, water-power plants! They're perfect counters for this entire scenario. Source of electricity + natural source of noise.)

  2) what if you saw monster from a distance notice and heading towards your loud kid. What is best course of action to save kid

  1) what if despite all other protections, a monster heard and noticed you right now and is heading in your direction and you have < 1 min to complete an action?

I'm assuming that monsters react differently to different human-activity sounds: if they heard a heavy object falling nearby, then immediately someone screaming in a different direction, they would go after the scream, not the fallen object.

As such, research which types of noises they like the best. Then throw sound-grenades (i. e., portable durable loudspeakers) with recordings of these noises in their direction, whenever you realize they're coming after you or yours, then run away. Carry a few of them with you at all times, obviously.

In case they're attacking your base, have an outer perimeter of powerful loudspeakers with these noises, to be activated remotely.
