  Ask in writing groups for people who want to volunteer to be a beta reader, or "beta". Let them read your creative writing and accept their technical help in rewriting your rough* drafts. Note when things you release are unbeta'd (i.e. rough drafts). But usually, rough drafts aren't published "publically", where tens of thousands of people are likely to read them and clutch their heads in pain.

I've been looking for beta readers for a while now actually. It got to the point where I just said 'screw it' and started just pushing stuff out there as I went. I've asked in this subreddit for beta readers before, on other forums I follow, on facebook...no one seems all that interested.
