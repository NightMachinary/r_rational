Technically he would have already gotten the 'seed' of it before the start of the story, the point of divergence is already in the past, it'll just take some time to actually, you know, diverge. I could have skipped forward to the parts where the divergence really becomes significant, but episode III really isn't all that long, so I thought it'd present a more unified piece if I just started where the movie started and ran from there. There's still some changes, Obi Wan losing his hand, etc, but yeah, I do hear where you're coming from. I might end up cutting this part out, but I do think it helps set up the story a bit.
