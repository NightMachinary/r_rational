I see now. Essentially, I should be using much fewer commas and many more periods. That being said, I have a fear of breaking up a sentence too much and having it become stilted feeling. Like. Even with having read the wikipedia article, I'm not entirely sure where my commas are appropriate and where they aren't. Was the comma in that last sentence used correctly or was that a splice? I worry I could easily go too far the other direction and end up with an endless chain of sentence fragments. Should I simply try and reduce my number of splices or are they never in any way acceptable? I look at the above responses I have to you, which you said contained splices, and rewrote them below:

#+begin_quote
  I usually do past tense. I thought the presence tense might work better for this though. Its something of an experiment still at this point.

  I didn't intend to. I'm not sure what you mean by a comma splice?
#+end_quote

This feels..choppy. I can't explain exactly what I mean by that, but I can't imagine myself /speaking/ in that manner. When I read the sentences that are 'fixed' /they/ are the ones that feel wrong in my head, not the original versions. And I /am/ a native english speaker. Is this really this much of an issue? I mean I've gone through enough college lit that I feel like I should have encountered this before today if it was that much of an issue. Does it become more pronounced when I'm writing in the present tense?

Not trying to sound whiny or anything, I do want to improve my writing and above all I want people to /enjoy/ my writing. Still though, when I look at a correction and it seems worse then the original version, I have to ask these questions.

And I just realized there's probably a splice in the last paragraph.

That /doesn't feel better/ to me. I'm sorry but I'm really not getting it I'm afraid.
