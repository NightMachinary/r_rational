I'm not an English major, but I'll do my best in a minimally-technical sort of way.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Was the comma in that last sentence used correctly or was that a splice?
#+end_quote

It was done correctly. This is some of the why.

#+begin_quote
  Even with having read the wikipedia article
#+end_quote

This is not a stand-alone sentence. It is a dependant clause, and can not stand alone. Thus, it *can* be joined to the other independent clause with a comma here:

#+begin_quote
  *,* I'm not entirely sure where my commas are appropriate and where they aren't
#+end_quote

Let me make it *wrong* here:

#+begin_quote
  *I read the wikipedia article*, I'm not entirely sure where my commas are appropriate and where they aren't.
#+end_quote

Right again:

#+begin_quote
  I read the wikipedia article, *and* I'm not entirely sure where my commas are appropriate and where they aren't.
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Essentially, I should be using much fewer commas and many more periods.
#+end_quote

[[http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/conjunctions/conjunctions.html][Conjunctions]]. Use them to join two independent clauses. [[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/indep_clauses.htm][Something a bit more casual on that]].

#+begin_quote
  Should I simply try and reduce my number of splices or are they never in any way acceptable?
#+end_quote

Never acceptable.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  I am a native english speaker. Is this really this much of an issue? I mean I've gone through enough college lit that I feel like I should have encountered this before today if it was that much of an issue. Does it become more pronounced when I'm writing in the present tense?
#+end_quote

This is not the worst issue ever, however it is very, very close. As a possible reason this is a problem for you, poetry allows all sorts of comma splices and run-on sentences. But it is not correct in novel writing or business writing.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Still though, when I look at a correction and it seems worse /then/ the original version, I have to ask these questions.

  And I just realized there's probably a splice in the last paragraph.
#+end_quote

You are wrong. That last sentence in the previous paragraph was correct. "when" made the first part dependant on the second part after the comma, which means it /could/ use a comma. Read it by itself:

#+begin_quote
  when I look at a correction and it seems worse /then/ the original version
#+end_quote

See how it seems to hang? You can rewrite the sentence to check that it works like this:

#+begin_quote
  Still though, *I have to ask these questions* when I look at a correction and it seems worse /then/ the original version.
#+end_quote

If it still works without the comma when flipped around, it is almost certainly right.

Also, "/than/".

--------------

#+begin_quote
  That doesn't feel better to me. I'm sorry but I'm really not getting it I'm afraid.
#+end_quote

Read it out loud. If you really talk like this, stringing separate ideas together with only minimal pause, that won't work. But if you talk like a normal person, you'll notice the difference of about half the pause duration between sentences ending in periods, and commas joining two clauses.

If you don't notice it, do it on purpose with the correct and incorrect versions. This doesn't always work, written English is a separate but related language, but it is the guideline that people usually use.

I must emphasize again: this is not people being grammar nazis. This isn't ending a sentence with a preposition or splitting an infinitive, for example.

You *must* fix this if you want strangers on the internet to read what you write. It is a major, major issue. You can also work around this.

Ask in writing groups for people who want to volunteer to be a beta reader, or "beta". Let them read your creative writing and accept their technical help in rewriting your rough* drafts. Note when things you release are unbeta'd (i.e. rough drafts). But usually, rough drafts aren't published "publically", where tens of thousands of people are likely to read them and clutch their heads in pain.
