I'm going to assume you aren't trolling, despite you doing it /again/. But I also question why you can't google this yourself. ESL issues happen, and this is a common one, but not knowing how to put two words into google is simply not acceptable.

You should have googled this. Shame on you for that.

--------------

Comma splices are a serious issue, but one that is easily fixed. If you have two complete clauses (subject-verb phrases) that can stand alone (with no conjunction) *do not use a comma to join them*. Use a period or reform the sentence.

You are not writing at an acceptable level if you consistently do this with post-rough draft quality material. Comma splices are the sort of thing that /must/ be caught in the first couple of editing passes. They should be caught even in informal internet posts, but people sometimes miss them.

Please understand, however, that it /physically hurts/ experienced native English readers to constantly encounter comma splices. You *must* fix them. This is not a style issue or somehow optional.
