Yep, you don't read. Just wanted to make sure.

Nothing you wrote there is factually correct. You missed that the expert reader statement wasn't an absolute one for an entire group, that my advice was asked for multiple times, and that the "shame" was for not googling, not for the /major/ syntax mistakes we were discussing how to fix.

OP doesn't need defending, and certainly not so incompetently. Take you pathetic outrage elsewhere before you embarrass yourself further.
