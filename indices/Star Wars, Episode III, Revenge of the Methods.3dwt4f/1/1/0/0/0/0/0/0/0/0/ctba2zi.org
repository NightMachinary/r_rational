Fine then. I'm stating that you're projecting your mental anguish at noticing comma splices onto all native English speakers. I in fact read that entire conversation, and while I consider correct grammar to be important, I do not find things like comma splices physically painful, as your own psychosomatic hyperbole would suggest. I think you're overstating it as an issue and needlessly concerning a hobby author, let alone a /beginner/, with a minor mistake pattern. "Shame on you?" Really? You've been ridiculous in this entire thread.
