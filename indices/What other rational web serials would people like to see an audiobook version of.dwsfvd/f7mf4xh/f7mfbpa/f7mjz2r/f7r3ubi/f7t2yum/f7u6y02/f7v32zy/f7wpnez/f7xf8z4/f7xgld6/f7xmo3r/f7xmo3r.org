Ah, that makes the disconnect a lot clearer. See, works where the protagonist or protagonists are flawed rationalists making internally logical decisions, such as PtC, Wildbow's serials, Metropolitan Man and Code Geass:TPR, fall under the banner of rationalist fiction for me.

Rational fiction is a more advanced genre where the rationality bleeds into the setting, with HPMOR, r!animorphs, Pokemon: TOoS, Practical Guide and UNSONG being some examples. It sounds like you mostly count this as the bar to meet, while this sub accepts the first group as part of the genre.

Sorry for getting snippy earlier, and touch√© on the precieved tone. Been a long day, finally got a chance to sit down and review my thoughts.
