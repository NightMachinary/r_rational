Parting the Clouds is realistic; one flawed rational 13 year old girl without a leadership position among non-rational peers can only do so much so quickly, and yet the changes to canon are adding up. The status quo is becoming more untenable with every new book as Cassie's individual actions build momentum.

As much as I enjoy and avidly read your take on rational animorphs, the AU elements introduced often fly in the face of canon and realism for the sake of the plot. It's still engaging and raises deep philosophical questions, but it's no longer simply "Animorphs, but both sides are hyper-rational", it's "Animorphs if it was HPMOR, except the changes to canon mechanics continually crop up at convenient times instead of being outlined early on".

Like I say though, I'd still love an audiobook version of either one. Animorphs deserves the love, and it would be timed well with the official audiobook releases coming up.
