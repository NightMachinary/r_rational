To the first point, this sub is home to both rational and rationalist fiction. r!animorphs is actually rational fiction(rational actors and logical mechanics), while PtC is rationalist(characters aspire to better themselves or the world through rationality). Both belong here.

To the second point: I apologize for the perceived hostility, I have a gift for poorly conveying tone over text. Animorphs is a difficult setting to AU because unlike many settings, the characters get very little starting information to build from. It's obvious in hindsight that you planned the changes to canon from an early stage, but from my perspective as a reader they were about as expected as The Ellimist was in canon. The fact that the changes are often discovered right on time to, say, revive a character from the dead, or prevent an obvious route to victory for one side or the other... It's not exactly deus ex machina, but it tended to reduce the impact of those moments for me even as it sent me reeling with repercussions.

I still love the story and read every update though, major setting divergence is a skill few pull off as well as r!animorphs.
