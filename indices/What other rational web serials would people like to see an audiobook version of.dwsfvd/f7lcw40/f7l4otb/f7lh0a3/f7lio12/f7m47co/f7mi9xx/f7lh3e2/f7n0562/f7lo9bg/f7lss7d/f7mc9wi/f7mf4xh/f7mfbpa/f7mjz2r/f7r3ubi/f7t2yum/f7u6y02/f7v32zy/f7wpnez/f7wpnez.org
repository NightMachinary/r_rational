I don't know what fic you've been reading if you don't think that the characters in r!Animorphs "aspire to better themselves or the world through rationality;" fully a third of the inner monologue stuff is thinking about thinking and reflecting on blind spots and biases and doing explicit metacognition; as described by the rules of the subreddit "the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities; this is a feature of *rationalist fiction*." You can also check out the wiki, which lists seven distinguishing elements of rationalist fiction, all of which r!animorphs hits consistently.

(I note also that my literal job for three years was teaching applied rationality to adults, and that about half of the curriculum of CFAR has made it directly into the fic.)

I also dunno what to say about you not being able to pick up on telegraphed and foreshadowed and pre-explained stuff. I guess just "shrug emoji."

If your Animorphs story doesn't radically deviate from canon within about six pages, it's neither rational nor rationalist. I love Animorphs canon to death, but you can't even get through the first book if you have a main character being actually sane.
