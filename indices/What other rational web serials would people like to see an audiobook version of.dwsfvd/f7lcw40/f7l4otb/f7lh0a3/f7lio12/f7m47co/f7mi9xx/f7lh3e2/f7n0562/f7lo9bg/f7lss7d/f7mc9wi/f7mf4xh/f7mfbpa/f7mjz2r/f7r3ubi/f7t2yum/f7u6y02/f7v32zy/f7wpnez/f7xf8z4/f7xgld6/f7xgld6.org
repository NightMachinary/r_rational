/shrug/ I repeat your words back to you, about tone being hard to convey through text, and perceived hostility not always being intended. I certainly do not intend hostility myself, nor do I think it makes any sense at all to police people's preferences.

I have only two claims, and I don't think it's /fundamentally/ rude or hostile to make either of them; to the extent that you were able to find rudeness and hostility in my choice of words, I apologize for leaving you with that impression.

Claim 1: It's not possible to /both/ have rational characters /and/ stick to Animorphs canon closely enough to still hit the same ending as the first book, let alone the second and third and fourth. That's not dragging PtC's name through the mud /as a work of quality;/ it's just pointing out that it doesn't qualify as being a member of a very specific genre.

Claim 2: r!Animorphs easily and consistently meets the criteria in Eliezer's linked post, which is where the wiki and subreddit descriptions came from. I've just reread Eliezer's post again to be sure, and it does /not/ make the claim that rationalist fiction "focuses solely on the internal struggles of the aspiring rationalist."

/shrug emoji again/

It's fine for you not to like r!Animorphs as much as you like Parting the Clouds. It's fine for you to love Parting the Clouds. But the terms "rational" and "rationalist" are important, and it's important that their meaning be defended, and I'm not going to /not/ disagree with what I believe to be inaccurate evaluations of the natures of the two works, just to avoid having you think that I'm hostile.
