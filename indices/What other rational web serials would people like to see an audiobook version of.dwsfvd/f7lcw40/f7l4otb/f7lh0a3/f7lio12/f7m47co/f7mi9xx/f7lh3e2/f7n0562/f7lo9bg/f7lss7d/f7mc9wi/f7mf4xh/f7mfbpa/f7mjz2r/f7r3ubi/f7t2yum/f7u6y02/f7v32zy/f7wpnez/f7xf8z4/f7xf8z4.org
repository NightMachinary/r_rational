You're being very hostile. I simply expressed my personal preference in fiction and offered some critique I had as an admitted fan of your work. Parting the Clouds doesn't deserve to have its name dragged through the mud for not being as rational as your own story.

Rationalist fiction is a subset of rational fiction. The former focuses solely on the internal struggles of the aspiring rationalist, while the latter can have more elements like logical systems or major canon divergences. See EY's linked post in the rules.

I will continue to enjoy your work, but the saying about never meeting heroes is really ringing true right now.
