I'm guessing here, but I think it's because they have a release format which rewards continual output over conciseness. It's more important to consistently get out content than it is to sit back and ask "Do I really need to add in the events of this arc/chapter in order to tell the complete story I intend to tell?" Because unlike traditional stories, your readership is likely to drop if you don't put out chapters quickly enough. So You don't have time to make things perfect and plan things out so that all the unnecessary bits get cut.

Also I think some of the authors don't always know where there story is going to end as they're writing it, so they just keep writing the logical progression of what would happen next until they feel like they've basically written everything that this particular mix of characters/setting will allow for.
