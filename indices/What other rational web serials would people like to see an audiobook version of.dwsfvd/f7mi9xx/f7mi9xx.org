I would say Worth the Candle but, IIRC, AlexanderWales is tentative to do an audiobook. You could do another of his books, though---I don't know if he feels the same way for Shadows of the Limelight since it's not so personal to him.

The Waves Arisen would be good, if you wanted to do fanfiction, but Wertifloke disappeared off the face of the planet after publishing it, and definitely wasn't Eliezer Yudkowsky the entire time.
