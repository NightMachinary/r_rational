I guess what I'm getting here is that there do need to be more hints. Thanks to everyone who speculated on the outcome!

What happened was:

[SPOILERS AHEAD]

...[[/u/SkyTroupe]] got it right.

Let's put the pieces together:

- Humanity's survival depends on the success of Kastner's project.
- Kastner is not cutting it. Not only are the tests failing, whatever they are, but he's lying to his superiors.
- Kastner is a bit of a dick (hopefully this comes across in the email). He is unlikely to be a good leader, given how he repeatedly denigrates his team.
- Four is a lot smarter than Kastner (a 42-61% IQ gain is huge).
- He's also more conflict averse, more productive due to the natural secretion of ADHD medication, and can stay awake much more each day.
- He has a very similar background to Kastner, so that catching up to whatever Kastner has accomplished can be done relatively quickly.
- There are too many gaps in the story of Four's suicide. Each one might be perfectly innocent, but all at once strongly suggest something nefarious is going on.
- The leadership of Site 48 was likely involved (because their investigation was so cursory, because they are clearly uninterested in following up, because the body seems to have been immediately cremated, and because in a highly controlled environment like an SCP site, it probably would have been difficult for anyone else to create a power outage at the right moment).
- Kastner's boss is likely involved -- there is a clear hint of that in the "better man" line, and presumably he would have been the one to initiate the switch in the first place after observing Kastner's repeated failures and lies.

In my headcannon, Four probably had little to do with the physical act of killing Kastner. He's a physicist not a soldier. But his cooperation was clearly necessary, both to bring Kastner to an urgent visit to Site 48, and to pretend to be Kastner once everything is done.
