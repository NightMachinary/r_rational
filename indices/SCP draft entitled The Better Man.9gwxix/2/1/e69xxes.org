4 killed Kastner in order to replace him and be with his family, because the clone had the same emotional connections.

Alternatively, Kastner, having been lambasted about how his clone was better for so long and upon hearing the clone again wanting to take over his life, killed the clone and then made it look like a suicide.

In the first case, the clone may have killed the only man who could avert the temporal doomsday, meaning the world will end in under a year.
