Yay I got it right!

I thought the smirk and the line reply together make it a tad obvious. I think the implication from just either is good enough but if no one else got it right maybe it's a good thing you included both.

I really enjoyed the story, but would have preferred it to be more fleshed out/longer with more examples. But you definitely hit the SCP "style"! Which I thought was great.
