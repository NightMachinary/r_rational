Juniper lost the vote on what quest to do next (chapter 76), although it turned out that accessing the time chamber was useful for saving the locus.

He contributed in the assault on Kuum Doona, but I am willing to guess we'd agree that combat is not /character/-driven to the same degree.

Juniper's main contribution was the soul mage shenanigans that brought Solace closer to a recoverable state. Moving those numbers around: not /quite/ delivering the same in-universe emotional impact as childbirth.

As for Juniper's own engagement: Given

  “I'm not talking about downtime,” said Amaryllis. “We're in a pattern of reaction right now, we have been since I was taken by Aumann. You had the crisis of needing to save me, then the crisis of needing to cure me, then the crisis of needing to cure your own ailment, and now we have the crisis of Fallatehr, not to mention trying our best to save the locus. We need to break out of the cycles of crisis. We need to chart a path forward of our own accord.”

  “Ah,” I replied. “That's kind of hard to do when we're still putting out fires.”

  “I agree,” said Amaryllis. “The problem is that the fires multiply. They're what I'm worried about, when I talk about stability. We need to keep our fires contained. Episodic.”

  “The n-word,” I said with a grimace. “I'm not sure how we can do that.”

I think the DM agrees with you.

  I wasn't going to do that though. If I was going to reject narrative, I was going to do it with all my heart. I kept thinking that Arthur must not have, that he'd let himself get wrapped up in it. If he made his choices based on what he thought the story wanted, it would explain so much about his failures over the years; they would make sense as sacrifice to the greater good, maybe.

Maybe the DM instigated their meeting to steer Juniper away from narrative and try to make him engage more. We'll see what happens now that the figurative bottle episode is over.
