The /one time/ Amaryllis puts her faith in the system, and a nurse gives it all away.

Anyway, friends in high places.

  Special Liaison on Existential Emergencies

Maybe that's why Uniquities is so interested in her? But I don't really see it. /The heart of Anglecynn?/ Maybe some effort to portray her as sympathetic? Her position is hereditary, so I'm not sure quite where the popular interest comes from otherwise.

Prediction: More Grak soon. For one thing:

#+begin_quote
  I wanted to go ask him what was up, but I was feeling drained, and Valencia was describing an encounter at a tavern with considerable enthusiasm. It was easier to listen to her than to think about Grak, so I took the easy path.

I can't help but be reminded of a [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/78][certain chapter]] of HPMOR:

#+begin_quote
  Harry wondered if he might just be procrastinating, if his mind had just found a clever excuse to put off something unenjoyable-but-necessary.

  He actually thought that.

  And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he'd just talk to Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday breakfast, and /then/ talk to Hermione.

  Human beings did that sort of thing all the time.

Grak might also be getting cold feet:

#+begin_quote
  “We're planning malfeasance?” asked Grak.

  “We'll be accused of malfeasance no matter what we do,” said Amaryllis.
#+end_quote

Ok, now Valencia.

#+begin_quote
  She moved one of her tendrils away from a target, through the layers of hell, until it was up beside her, in the same room as them.
#+end_quote

I'm trying to search back through the full text: did we establish what sort of sensory ability she gets from a tendril? Can she see whatever on Aerb she would like?

Also, I'll mention that I was spooked that Valencia let her new friend have an Earth book. Not because they should be precious to her, but because the book's existence hints at another big secret.
