  Her position is hereditary, so I'm not sure quite where the popular interest comes from otherwise.

For a hereditary government chosing the right leader becomes even more important because you have a limited pool of possible candidates and their effect is much longer lasting. If the uniquities are part of the "deep state" /establishment they probably have an interest in making sure that the best available heir takes control.
