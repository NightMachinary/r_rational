Very good point, I didn't think of that. It'd indeed make the book immediately, and highly, suspicious.

Still, I think their first thought would be that someone dream-skewered recreated it using Earth's weird standards, or that it was pulled from a dream-skewered's memories, or something along these lines. Not that Juniper is dream-skewered, or that Earth is real and the Council can summon items from it.
