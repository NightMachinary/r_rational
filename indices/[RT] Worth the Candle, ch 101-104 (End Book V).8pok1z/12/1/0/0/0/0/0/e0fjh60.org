Animorphs 01 - Invasion is set in America, but it doesn't mention it much in that book as far as I can tell Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets references American plumbers in a Dursley chapter, and Goblet of Fire references a group of American witches from the Salem Witches Instiute with a star-spangled banner. Deathly Hallows references Native Americans once. It takes a fairly close reading to find these references (I don't think Uniquities will have the benefit of ctrl+F).

They clearly belong to the same culture but identifying continuous elements in the settings will be a product of time and close reading, rather than being immediately obvious. The more obvious things like sharing weird formatting and presentation details (ISBNs, copyright pages, etc.) will be a quicker tip-off that these are two artifacts from the same culture which is dissimilar to their own.

Still, it's probably worth June's time to try to get the books back before they are closely examined, if possible.
