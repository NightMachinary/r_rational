I noticed a continuity error in chapter 103 regarding Grak's arm and who's holding baby Solace:

#+begin_quote
  “She did not enjoy bed rest,” said Grak, /folding his/ */arms/* /across his chest/.

  “Yes,” said Amaryllis. “Can you ward us, please?”

  Grak snorted, but /uncrossed his/ */hands/* /and got out his wand/.
#+end_quote

He's supposed to be cradling Solace at this point but there's no mention of him passing her to someone else, or how she ends up back in his possession a few lines later.

Otherwise, fantastic set of chapters! Thank you very much. :)
