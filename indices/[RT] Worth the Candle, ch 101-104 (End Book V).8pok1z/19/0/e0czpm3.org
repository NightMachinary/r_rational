  I don't think she liked the idea of giving us *free reign,*
#+end_quote

The expression is "to give /free rein/," meaning to hold a horse's reins loosely so the horse can travel at a pace it finds comfortable.

I'm pretty sure I've run across this one a few times in the story, but this is the first since I've caught up. Or maybe it was "reign in" for some of the other times, which should similarly be "rein in," meaning to grasp the reins and take control of the horse, or pretty much the opposite of "to give free rein."

Edit to add: the ones I've seen earlier might also have been "*seize the reigns*," which, again, should be "seize the /reins/," implying you're taking control of the horse from someone else.
