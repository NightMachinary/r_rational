Fixed the first.

Unicorn horn is actually correct -- they have an alicorn that they were going to sell in Boastre Vino, but were prevented from doing so by Larkspur showing up.

There was a bit about unicorn blood not being shelf-stable (along with a whole meditation on how inventory in videogames tends to assume no decay or change because that's not very fun) that I keep putting in and then keep cutting, since it never seems to flow right. I thought I'd put it in this chapter, but apparently if I did, I cut it back out. Obviously that needs to go /somewhere/ though, but it's been almost 300,000 words since it was last mentioned. Maybe in the section when they're in the time chamber and Amaryllis is talking about how they're eating food from Earth, since all the Aerb stuff that's not salted/cured/dried has gone bad? If that section wasn't also a victim of editing?
