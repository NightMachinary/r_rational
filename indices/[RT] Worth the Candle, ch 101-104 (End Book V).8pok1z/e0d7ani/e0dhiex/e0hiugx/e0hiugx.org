I think we're supposed to reflect that this is what the Narrative/DM thinks Joon wants. It may be right, or it may be that this is showing us something about the DM. Either way it fits with this harem that the DM has set up though claims he's been only giving "subtle nudges" on.

I personally think that explanation is a bit BS as early Joon was strongly following the game rules and he didn't think he was building a princess harem when recruiting Grak or Fenn. Additionally the disruption of the aging process is more DM fiat that anything Joon chose. So I'd say the DM is vicariously living through Joon more than fulfilling Joon's true wishes.
