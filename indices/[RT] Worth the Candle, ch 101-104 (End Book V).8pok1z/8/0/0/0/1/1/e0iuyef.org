I don't think the author is required to debunk wrong viewpoints, else be "problematic." Harry doesn't have to win every political argument, just like goodness doesn't win every argument in real life. Taylor doesn't have to tell the E88 why they're wrong for the benefit of the audience. A lot of the time this makes for bad writing. Not only this, but the author's also left at least two author's notes and several reddit posts saying he doesn't endorse the villains of his story's viewpoints.

Also, after all, all you're really complaining about is the author /not/ anvilling at you which viewpoint is right or wrong! In a work about rationality and science!

Though it /should/ be fairly obvious to anyone who reads his work about "saving humanity and giving them the stars so they can decide how they want to live" that Eliezer is, like, the /opposite/ of an evil terrible person.

(Also manipulating people isn't in fact inherently bad.)
