That centaur was obsessed with murdering an 11 year old and was in the process of attempting it, I think that makes for some extenuating circumstances. I agree Quirrel got away with a lot, though.

And regarding the E88 being cool, I don't think Wildbow /NEEDS/ to debunk their coolness, they are nazis. I assume knowing what a nazi is and why they are bad is part of the basic knowledge set of the average Worm reader, there's no need for Wildbow to hammer it in.
