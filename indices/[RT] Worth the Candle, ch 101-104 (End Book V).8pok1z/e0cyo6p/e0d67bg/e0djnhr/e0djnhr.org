Juniper and his team have quite a lot of esoterica of his own, and a track record of dealing with other people's esoterica. I'd give him pretty good odds, actually -- for one thing, it's very unlikely that anyone is prepared for Bethel's ability to apply 5 pounds of force to the inside of your brain. Perhaps a still mage could handle that, but perhaps not.
