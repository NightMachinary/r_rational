I dunno - These are the people the empire send out to deal with bullshit, they know what happened to the helicopter strike team... and they still came. I give it high odds they have something completely bullshit. A bone-mage with a arsenal of unicorn bones or worse. Or perhaps this is the social-fu team, and the horrifying kill-team is just on standby.
