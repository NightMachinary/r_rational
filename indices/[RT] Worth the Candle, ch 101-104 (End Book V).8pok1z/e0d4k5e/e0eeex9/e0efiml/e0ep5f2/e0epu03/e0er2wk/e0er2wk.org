I think that was the crucial piece information I missed. I honestly misread it as she was 'upping' the price, so Grak wouldn't leave after completing said quest. The time limit got to me.

Okay, now understand, and oh boy, that's sad. Yep, they are very close to losing Grak's loyalty...

Thank you for explaining!
