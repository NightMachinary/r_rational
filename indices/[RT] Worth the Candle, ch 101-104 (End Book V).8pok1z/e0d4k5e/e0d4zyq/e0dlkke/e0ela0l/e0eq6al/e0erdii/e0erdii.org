There were several things pointing in the direction, quarter elves look human, Nellan was raised by humans and Fenn only ever saw Nellan very rarely, if ever. This fits perfectly with Joon's bodies backstory, of which we know that it was raised by humans and nothing else. We also know that the DM has a tendency to arrange non-standard love interests for Joon, including a dwarf, a deer, and a house. It really wouldn't have been terribly surprising if the DM had set up an Oedipus arc.
