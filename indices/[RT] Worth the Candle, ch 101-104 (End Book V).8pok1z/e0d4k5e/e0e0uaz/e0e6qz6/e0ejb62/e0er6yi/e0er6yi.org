Thanks!

  Wouldn't Joon have seen this when fixing up Grak's soul?

I think it's plausible he did not:

  When I finally got it, it was different from how I'd experience Amaryllis and Fenn's souls. Those had been, in some respect, extensions of my own, governed by the same logic, at least from my point of view. By way of analogy, if my soul was an enormous sheet of paper, Grak's was another sheet laid on top of it, this one without writing. I had to navigate between the two frequently, because his soul didn't have the order to it that mine did. It felt like sitting in front of a television with a printed out sheet of paper, trying to follow an FAQ to a game, going from instructions to screen and back again.

At the very least, Juniper doesn't have the right "muscle memory" to intuit the structure in Grak's soul. He only found Fallatehr because he was specifically looking for Fallatehr.

On looking more closely at this scene, I think Grak is dropping some hints here that Juniper is (again) failing to follow up on at all.

  “It wasn't service,” said Grak. “It was wanting something more than myself.”

  [...]“What happens when you take your thousand pounds of gold to Darili Irid?” I asked.

  “Nothing,” said Grak, looking past me.

  “I have a quest for it,” I said, but at that he turned further away from me. “I really don't understand you.”

  “There is not much to understand,” replied Grak.

  “Sure,” I said. I was watching him closely. I wanted to say that all of this could have been avoided if he'd just been more loyal to me, or that I had been trying with him, was trying with him even now, and it was frustrating for it to not be paying any dividends, but that wasn't the kind of thing that I thought would be helpful, and if I needed to vent, I would go vent about it to someone else.

Grak sure is acting the way someone might act if they were in love with someone they knew they didn't have the /slightest/ shot with, who also happens to keep making attempts to be friendly /to further their own ends/ and /without genuinely wanting to help/ and then /consistently refuses to get a clue even though they talk the talk about being a better person and a better friend all the time./ Oh, and he tends to act like a pretty good friend to all the hot girls.

Just think of how many times clueless adolescent boys have asked "Why's she acting so /weird?/"

Also, the above happened at loyalty 7, just before getting loyalty 8, and Grak is now at loyalty 10. I think the only time Juniper has touched da nad soul since then was to make /grak.bak/, and he was in a bit of a hurry at the time.
