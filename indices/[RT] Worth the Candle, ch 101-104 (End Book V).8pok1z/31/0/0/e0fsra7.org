Tricky, because that requires including that person in the ritual, which includes aspects of the soul mage thing and knowing about the last druid. I had a half-formed guess that Esuen was going to raise Solace a bit in the time chamber. This guess has some problems, not intractable ones, such as the operation of the time chamber as a long-term residence by a set of people that does not include Amaryllis.

Had the time chamber been used for long durations before? Between the forge frenzy and the haphazard addition of entads that may have brought it about, maybe no one actually had a good plan for long-term use.

The story already went over the big constraints: air, temperature, and food. I suppose there could have been other ways to address all three, such as the blanket of really long naps. Somehow those didn't make their way into the house though.
