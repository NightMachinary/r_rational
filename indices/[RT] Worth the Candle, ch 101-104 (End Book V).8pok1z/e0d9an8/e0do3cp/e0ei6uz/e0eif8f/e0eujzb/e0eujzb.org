The uniquities seem like the sort of organization who might have looked into dream-skewered folks a bunch already. If they figure stuff out enough to show a Harry Potter book to one of the other dream-skewered, if there are any of those around, they'll get some right confusing reactions; I have no clue what conclusion they'd come to.

Remember, also, that /in addition to Harry Potter, Mary and June each left her a dozen books to read/. These are unspecified except at least one is Animorphs first book. So I figure we might have more than one other Animorphs book, and possibly a bunch of other Earth fiction too. If someone left an Earth dictionary for Valencia - which they might well have done to help her with Harry Potter - that'll raise tons of questions immediately too. If there's any more explicit reference material there, it gets correspondingly weirder from their perspective. If Mary was trying to further Valencia's education and provided her with a illustrated book of science from Earth, that'll puzzle them a /lot/.

But just from what we /know/ was there -

Animorphs cover art might raise questions if they look at it closely - they were produced digitally using morphing software. And the inside cover art when you open the cover in Animorphs 1 is distinctly computer generated images of a lizard on a shoe in a locker which they /also/ won't know how they were made - it looks super artificial and weird as it was from the [[http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/The_Invasion?file=Animorphs_1_the_invasion_inside_cover_only_high_res.jpg][early days of computer generated images]]. Like, it's got a very pixellated look to it, and if they go over it with a magnifying glass it might boggle them a bit.

Moreover, if they read the text of both Animorphs and Harry Potter, they will discover that they are two books both set on a fictional world that shares startling similarities. To start with, both mention nouns that have no meaning and aren't described at all that are very similar - Animorphs 1 mentions video games within a page or two, while HP&TPS mentions a video camera and computer games being given to a Dursley fairly early on too. The idea of whole classes of unknown, undefined nouns for a population large enough to have it's own literature, with those nouns undefined in the text because they're so much a part of their culture, that the Uniquities have never heard of before, might worry the heck out of them.
