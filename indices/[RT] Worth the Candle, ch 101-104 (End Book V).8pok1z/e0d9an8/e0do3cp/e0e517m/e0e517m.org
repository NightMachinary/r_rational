If the book wasn't specifically Harry Potter I might have a harder time agreeing with you. Its background is our world plus a hidden, smaller world of magic users, so I suppose that the average reader on Aerb would see it as their own Harry Potter story being transplanted onto a weird alternate universe. (Such a reader might be confused that the book then kept so much of the original story the same, but the hypothesis space won't immediately narrow down to the truth).

Amaryllis had tried to extract enough from the backpack to be self-sufficient, so that integrating it away would not be a huge loss. From the outside that might not seem that far from a forge frenzy (if not "merely" a conventional discovery, which seems to have been outpaced by the otherworldly magic).

Demonstrating the summoning ability is also more difficult now that it's entangled with Bethel. Now you have to reveal the meta-entad, convince Bethel to do the thing, etc.
