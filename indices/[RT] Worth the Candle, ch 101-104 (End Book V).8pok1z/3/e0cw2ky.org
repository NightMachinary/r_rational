  “The illusion,” said Bethel. “I produce it for the sake of convenience, so others can imagine me as though I am one of them.” “I dye my hair,” said Valencia with a nod.

This got a hearty laugh out of me. Valencia is adorable.

  “You can do real-time false-color imaging of a person's interior,” said Amaryllis. And here I was ready to mistake that look for a mother seeing her baby for the first time.

Never change Amaryliss.

Also, for those that got a kick out of Valencia's demon fueled analytical combat competence and devil derived social manipulation I strongly recommend the 'Prince of Nothing' fantasy Trilogy by R Scott Bakker. The protagonist is from a once monk like order who secluded themselves away from humanity in order to conquer their emotions, focus on reason and logic and having /complete/ and utter control of their environment. Skip forward thousands of years of eugenics breeding programs and you have a sect of hyper competent individuals who are trained in various things such as emotional reading through flayed (living) human faces in order to study which muscle contraction combinations indicate which mental states. The protagonist is in many ways a Strawman Vulcan version of Valencia holding a demon and a devil at the same time except with just as much big picture awareness as situational awareness but secluded to the point that they have, almost literally, no knowledge of the greater world around them. The writing is also brilliant, packed with philosophy and the author writes my favourite battle scenes bar none with a switch to a wonderfully grand omniscient perspective.
