Fridge horror: since the level ups are now so intense they singlehandedly wreck his priorities at the soul layer every time they happen, that means low-hanging fruit quests like say, sleeping with every member of the party are the kind of thing LevelUp'd!Joon might sieze upon with extreme prejudice if he realizes there's a chance it'll get him to the next level faster.
