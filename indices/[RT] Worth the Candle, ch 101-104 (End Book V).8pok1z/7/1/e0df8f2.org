I'm honestly not sure that he should try to change that. Don't get me wrong, Grak is a huge asset to the group, and would be sorely missed. But recognising that he's close to leaving, and changing behavior so he doesn't, seems too much like the quid pro quo social interaction that Grak has already criticised.

If Grak would be happier going home, or wherever, let him be happy, I say.
