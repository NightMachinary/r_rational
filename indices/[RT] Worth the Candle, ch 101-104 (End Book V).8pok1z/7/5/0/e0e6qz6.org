It's more that /every time/ Grak has basically said "uh hey, I'm a party member too, with my own backstory, motivations, and needs" Joon has pretty much responded "Cool." It's been pointed out in the text a few times that Joon (at least in retrospect) recognizes on some level that he's neglecting Grak.

So from a munchkin perspective, yeah, having that 10 loyalty seals the deal. From a storytelling perspective, from a /relationship/ perspective, Joon has been a bad friend to Grak, who has consistently been there for him. It's easy to say "but da's just in it for the money," except we know, specifically, that da needs the money for deeply personal cultural reasons. (Da also has no clue what to do with da nad life after da completes the penance. Da also is deeply uncomfortable with all forms of manipulation, perceived or otherwise.)

So even Amaryllis saying "fucking whatever, we'll put a hard date of 2 years on when we solve your problem" is doing more to address Grak's feelings and motivations than Joon has done up till this point.

  “Return my body to Darili Irid if I die,” said Grak.

  “You know I would,” I replied. “And if you fall, we'll pay your penance.”

  Loyalty Increased: Grak lvl 4!

  [...]Grak and I weren't exactly friends, not yet, but that was how you made friends, in my opinion; you committed to the friendship.

At this point, Joon gets it, and is treating Grak the way Grak wants to be treated.

  “No,” said Grak, returning his gaze to me. “You are not the family I would pick, but you are also not like my father.”

  Loyalty increased: Grak lvl 8!

  I wanted to ask what it was about me, but that seemed like a conversation that would just irritate me. Count on a guy like Grak to sap all the enjoyment from having made a breakthrough in soul magic and fixing him.

By this point, in his heart at least, Joon is being a /bad friend./

  “You'd be making me blush, but I can control my bloodflow,” I replied. “But I am serious, the gap between Grak and I just seems so huge that there's no way that I'm going to overcome it.”

  “Bigger than you and the locus?” asked Fenn.

  “Point taken,” I said. “You know, sometimes I wish that our party were just,” /the Spice Girls,/ “more archetypally arranged, it seems like we've got a ridiculous, erratic spread both in terms of personality and utility.”

/Ooooooff,/ Jooooooooooooon.

  There were very few personal details I knew about Grakhuil Leadbraids. Most of those, I had learned from his biography. The only personal story he'd ever told me had been when we'd been at Weik Handum, a story that I thought was just him being incredibly blunt about weird stuff that I didn't care about, by way of telling me not to sleep with Fenn. And my response to that had been to say ‘sure', and then the very next morning Fenn had teased him, very graphically, about all the ways that we hadn't had sex. Worse, I'd only really put effort into trying to raise his loyalty after learning about the Twinned Souls thing, which hadn't really been my intention, but I could see how that looked.

  “Fuck,” I said. I closed my eyes and scrunched up my face, trying to think of some response without the distraction of having to look at anyone. “Okay, I can see it now. I'm going to have to hope that I can explain what was going through my head at some point, but I want some time to think about things, how it looks from your perspective, and where our different cultures are getting in the way. And even if I could explain it perfectly, that probably wouldn't be enough, because with you, I failed. I need to just ... listen more, I guess, and focus less on the end goals, at least when it comes to our kharass.”

  I opened my eyes.

  Loyalty increased: Fenn lvl 22!

  Loyalty increased: Amaryllis lvl 16!

  Loyalty increased: Grak lvl 10!

And see, with effort he can still find the right things to say to show how he should be changing his behavior.

  “That would be telling,” said the Dungeon Master. He flashed me a smile. “And for now, I plan on being just the right amount of opaque. They weren't set up to wait forever though. Amaryllis will get over you, if you let her. Null Pointer Exception will too -- she's malleable.”

  And Grak? The Six-Eyed Doe? I didn't ask. I didn't want to know. Better to keep assuming that Grak was just a straight dude that didn't happen to have a penis.
#+end_quote

That's such a horrible thing to assume! And it's the only time Grak came up in Joon's conversation with the DM.

My gut-level read at this point is that Grak is at least a little bit in love with Joon (da /is/ a princess in Joon's harem,) Joon can recognize it with his enhanced social stats, but he's choosing to ignore it because he's uncomfortable with the idea of romance with a very male-seeming creature of non-human-analogous gender, and he's even more uncomfortable with the part of himself that's uncomfortable at that thought, because he irrationally wants his feelings to be /fair/.
