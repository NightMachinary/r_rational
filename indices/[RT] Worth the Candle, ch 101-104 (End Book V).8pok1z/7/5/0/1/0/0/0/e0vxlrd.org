This is a thing of beauty and I've corrected my one incorrect pronoun use:

#+begin_quote
  Mary went from trying to haggle da down, thinking of the utility of the obols
#+end_quote

To the correct form:

#+begin_quote
  Mary went from trying to haggle di down, thinking of the utility of the obols
#+end_quote

(If I understand it correctly.)

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_language][Ergative-absolutive languages]] look crazy! Juniper's got a pretty awesome grasp of some cool linguistics.

Thanks for the worldbuilding, CRJ!
