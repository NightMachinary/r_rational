Ugh, good catch on subject/object form of the pronoun. I could have sworn the same word was used in both cases, but a scan of the work only turns up its use as a subject (looks like the object form was avoided through use of the passive voice.) It's also kind of sad that it's only used 24 times in the story so far, and only by the game layer.

I guess this is my appeal to [[/u/ale--]] cough, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] to canonize my misunderstanding so I don't have to go back and edit my posts (hey, at this point I've used the word only five fewer times than the story itself, haha.)
