Superbly put. Joon has a terrible habit of shallowness in how he sees the people around him, and Grak is at the top of the list of people who suffer as a result (although Valencia, on the other hand, has really benefited from it).

I kept thinking throughout the last chapter how important it was that Solace and the Six-Eyed Doe were introduced relatively early in the story - if they had been the 7th member to join the troupe I think it would be much easier as a reader to partially dismiss them as "also that weird druid thing with them". You made me realize how crucial that was for Grak as well. Da's a very complex character who on the surface looks very simple, because da doesn't emote very openly and is explicitly in it for the money, and it would be very easy to treat [them] as just a straight male dwarf mercenary if we hadn't had time to get to know [them].

Uh, as an aside, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] could you possibly give us an object form of Grak's prefered personal pronoun?
