Haha, my thoughts are colored by my own perceptions and understanding, but I'm glad they're coming off semi-coherently!

I don't know this is /necessarily/ the case. I can imagine Grak privately talking to Mary to excise da nad feelings for Joon, though.

Ugh the more I think about this the worse I feel for Grak. Da doesn't want to be bound to Joon by game abstractions. Da doesn't want da nad individuality to be snuffed out. Da doesn't want to pine after Joon in secret for decades. I'm starting to think da /should/ get Mary to tamp down the feels, and maybe even the loyalty too.
