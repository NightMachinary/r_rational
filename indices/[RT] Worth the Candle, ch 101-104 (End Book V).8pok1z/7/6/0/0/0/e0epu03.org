  Grak frowned at Amaryllis. “I do care for you,” he said. He looked around the small room. “All of you. Some more than others.” That was characteristic dwarven bluntness right there. “I will not be subsumed by this group.” That was also a characteristically Grak way of saying things. He seemed allergic to the word ‘but', so instead, he'd just give two statements of fact, one of which undercut the other.

  “Fine,” said Amaryllis. “It's going to cause us no end of problems with capital, because we'd be idiots to plan on paying anything out in the beginning, but I'll personally guarantee you forty million obols within two years time, and if I don't have it, we'll go kill a fucking dragon and take its hoard or something, okay?”

  Grak stared at her, then nodded.

It isn't about the money. It's about /finishing da nad quest./ Mary went from trying to haggle di down, thinking of the utility of the obols toward the goals of the Council of Arches, to setting a hard time limit and thereby acknowledging Grak's importance and status in the Council. Grak just wanted somebody to say, without prompting or quid pro quo, that they'd take care of da nad thing, not /someday/, but at a set time.

Mary (and Joon) are also ignoring that from a gameplay and narrative perspective, quests that involve giving up enormous amounts of dosh typically involve commensurate rewards-- not in coin necessarily, but in terms of politics, capabilities, items, and XP, completing that quest will probably have /some/ kind of awesome consequences. (Although to be fair, if this was the reasoning behind assistance rendered, and Grak realized it, da would probably reject the assistance.)
