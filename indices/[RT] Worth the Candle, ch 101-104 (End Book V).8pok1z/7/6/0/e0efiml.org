Grak basically screwed da nad clan by running away from an arranged marriage that stood to enrich them by the equivalent of a thousand pounds of gold.

Grak's primary motivation this entire time has been to restore da nad honor by repaying the debt. Da has no plans for what happens after that... it sounds to me like da could use a friend.
