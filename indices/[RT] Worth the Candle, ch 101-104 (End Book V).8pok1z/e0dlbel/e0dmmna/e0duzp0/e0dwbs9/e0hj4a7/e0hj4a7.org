HPMOR has the continuous problem that the literal message/moral given, the intended message/morale, the characters exposition, and the emotional message are often at odds with on another. I.e. Quirrel explains why fascism is cool and democracy sucks while being really cool and edgy, Harry fails to reasonably defend democracy, and Eliezer in an author's note gives a weak reminder that Quirrel is a villain.

Harry's view of friendship as manipulation is an example of this. The plot never really conclusively shows manipulating friends is bad, Harry is sometimes rewarded and sometimes punishes for it by the story. Even at the end of the story he is manipulating Hermione to take out Azkaban for him.
