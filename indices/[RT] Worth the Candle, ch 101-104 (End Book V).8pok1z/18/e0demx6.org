I completely missed that level ups were getting progressively more addictive as Joon got them (as if they needed to be even more horrifying).

Kind of confused as to why level ups would be like this though. Even if level ups weren't particularly pleasurable at all I feel like Joon would more or less be doing the same general thing, he didn't need that extra carrot. Does that suggest that the game layer is a general thing and hasn't been customized to Joon, even if the individual companions and world both are?

Also, what would have happened if Joon hadn't gotten access to soul magic and had no way to manage the level up value? Is the plot on rails enough that he'll reliably get soul magic, or is the PC becoming solely devoted to leveling up at any cost the expected norm?

Maybe it's the game layer's closest way to represent the single mindedness of PCs in RPGs? But again, getting stronger to achieve goals seems like a perfectly valid in-universe reason for wanting to level up, why the addiction?
