My best guess is level ups feel better the more time has elapsed between them (Joon spent two months and change between level ups, rather than a couple of days). Another possibility is that level up not only heals all physical damage, but also all mental damage and soul magic counts as mental damage, and massively increasing sensitivity to a reward at the same time as receiving that reward feels amazing, but none of that happened the last time Joon leveled, so I don't believe that.
