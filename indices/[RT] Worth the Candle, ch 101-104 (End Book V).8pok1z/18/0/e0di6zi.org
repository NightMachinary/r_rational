  I completely missed that level ups were getting progressively more addictive as Joon got them (as if they needed to be even more horrifying).

But it's weird; this is the previous level up:

#+begin_quote
  I laid both hands on my chest and concentrated my power, burning through bones on my left side in order to fuel the healing in my ribs. It would take some time to reset those bones, but that was now a solved problem. The changes came fast, first sensation returning to my skin, then a gnawing hunger from an appetite that was finally waking back up. I didn't suffer from a sudden heart attack, as I had feared that I might, and whatever the soul's conception of the body was at the boundary areas, nothing horrible like a rending of my flesh happened at my shoulders or hips.

  The quest didn't show up as completed though, and I slapped my forehead when I realized why; I'd drained bones in order to complete the healing. A quick dip into my soul was enough to fix that, and I came back out quick enough to see the notifications in my view, before they were washed away.

  Affliction: Drained Bone Removed!

  Skill increased: Essentialism lvl 23!

  Quest Complete: Boneitis - Your body is back to normal, and under your control to a far greater extent than in your wildest transhumanist dreams, if you dare to risk fucking it up.

  Level Up!

And then the end of the chapter. No mention of how it felt at all.

[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] what was different about that level up? Was it that it happened inside soul-view?
