OK So I got some serious foreshadowing vibes during that talk between Val and Jorge. Mary mentioned a reckoning and this has got to be the start of it.

Val's best protection against any sort of retribution from demons and devils was her absolutely anonymity, they can't hit back if they don't know what to hit back against right. But now that she's told Jorge what she can do, and he wants to use her against known devils up on the surface, that information is absolutely going to find its way back to Hell and they're going to do everything in their power to stop her eventually.
