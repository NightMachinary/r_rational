Well that was an ominous ending, seems like the level up broke something. Valencia trying to write fan fiction is a fun little author insert. I expect to learn more about the iniqueities trough a did session on the conditioner men. So far there hasn't been any large time jumps though I suspect we will pick up next with the concil of arches a little more set up.
