  Well that was an ominous ending, seems like the level up broke something.

It's been obvious that each succeeding level up has been increasing in pleasure and before Juniper learned soul magic to lower the value/desire for level ups, he had been growing more and more frustrated that he didn't get a level up after combat. It's most noticeable when he's debating to fight a few more golems for the XP instead of escaping when the group were breaking Fallatehr out.

The most recent level up most likely was so intense in pleasure that he won't listen to any logic to lower his desire for level ups. Just like how the people Fallatehr soul-changed didn't have any desire to change back despite their memories telling them otherwise.
