For anyone who is curious, the name of the doctor, Nonnatus, translates from Latin to English as 'not born' which is not a name you want to hear right before a birth.

I'm also totally shipping Valencia with Mary after their hotel departure scene.

EDIT: I thought Nonnatus was a nurse, not a doctor. Thanks [[/u/rabotat]] for the correction!
