Another thought, Arthur isn't known to have been a soul mage in his time. He might not have been able to suppress the effect the drive to level up would have on his thinking. If that was the case it might explain a lot of why he was constantly adventuring and unable to attend to his wife/kids/court properly. Or maybe even explain his disappearance.
