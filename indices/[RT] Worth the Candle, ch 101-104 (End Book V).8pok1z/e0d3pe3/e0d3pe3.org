Well that is alarming.

It now seems clear that the degree to which level-ups affect Juniper is growing at a significantly-greater-than-linear rate. This seems like a very big problem, since he has rapidly become one the most powerful individuals on the planet, he is still getting stronger, and at any moment he could be driven unexpectedly insane by a future even-stronger level-up. What if this happens later when his other party members aren't around, and he wakes up and just starts murdering everyone he can see in the hopes of getting experience for it? If Arthur faced a similar challenge, then I think that should increase our sympathy for his situation.

Hopefully the group will place a high priority now on finding some kind of solution to this problem.

*Edit:* Some further thoughts.

So on some level, this portion of the level-up mechanic seems intended by the GM to drive continued adventuring and questing. Providing a powerful incentive to avoid just resting on their laurels.

I will propose that the extremity of the effect this last time may have been affected by some combination of two factors:

1) Juniper's attempts to reduce the level-up's influence on his thinking with soul magic.

2) The fact that he was "relaxing" for two months in the time chamber for their recent quest.

This raises the question:

- Is this a semi-automated process that the GM isn't paying that close attention to?

- Or is the GM purposefully trying to "punish" Juniper for some combination of the two points above?
