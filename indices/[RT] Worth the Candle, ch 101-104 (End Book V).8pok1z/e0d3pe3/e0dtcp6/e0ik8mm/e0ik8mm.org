Seems like the DM is being contradictory if that's the case. On the one hand he tells them to ignore the narrative aspect of the world and treat this as seriously as real life.

On the other hand he's giving him a super-heroin addiction that can only be satisfied by pursuing increasingly difficult goals.

It really seems like an unnecessary step at this point to make the Level Ups more and more addicting. It feels like he's putting his hand on the scales much harder than he implied he would. But I suppose this was already a mechanic of the game before they had their conversation, and if it was something that Arthur had to deal with as well, then it would be inconsistent to change it at this point.
