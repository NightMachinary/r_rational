I haven't figured that passage out yet. This part feels like a straight-forward description of the experience:

#+begin_quote
  My brain splattered across the ceiling of the universe, becoming stars in the sky, each neuron a swollen red dwarf, the hyperspace connections between them engorged with the pleasure feeding through them. There was nothing like awareness to me, only pleasure so vast that I couldn't hope to feel anything else. It was reductive, stripping away the thinking part of me and leaving only the animal,
#+end_quote

While the end is the aftermath:

#+begin_quote
  When I came to, they had me pinned down. Amaryllis was fixing my soul; she had intuited, correctly, that it was no longer a change I could make on my own, not after what I had felt.
#+end_quote

But in between seems like a mix of both:

#+begin_quote
  pinning me down and fucking me, a fist thrusting straight into my brain, thick fingers manipulating my internal wiring.
#+end_quote

Is he feeling Amaryllis working on is soul here, but thinks it's part of the level up experience?
