I know the updates accumulate but what does the release schedule typically look like for this series? What is the usual gap between?

I do like the story Alexander, you've done a great job creating this setting. I read the whole thing in one go without reading your real name and I believed you were Juniper, funnily enough. The hombrewness of the world makes it very unique.
