Eh. It's text and not actually drawn out as it is in manga. You only "see" her as a nude and sexualizd underage girl in your mind if you actually put some mental energy into it. And at that point you could just as well have imagined any other fictional character in a creepy/taboo situation since cthulhujerpsen didn't actually describe any part of Solace's new anatomy other thanher height, skin color and voice.
