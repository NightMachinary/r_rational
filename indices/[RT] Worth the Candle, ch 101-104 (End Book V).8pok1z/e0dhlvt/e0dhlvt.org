Joon not being able to work out what was going on between Mary and Grak but noticing Valencia's noticing it is funny. Similar also Amaryllis and Solace's interaction. It's weird that the story being from his perspective means that some stuff is (on the surface) opaque to him, if not necessarily as much so for the reader.

Incidentally, it's interesting that when it was time for Amaryllis' side adventures it was told from the perspective of Joon recounting how it was described to him, but Valencia /actually/ gets to be a POV character for a bit.
