  "The Mary show as seen by a kind of socially dim dude who's very wrapped up in his own shit" is a difficult lens with which to view it.

I agree that the story kinda has turned into "The Mary Show". But I really like viewing it through the lens of "kind of socially dim dude who's very wrapped up in his own shit". Told from her perspective, it would run the risk of becoming "Mary Sue, boring"

This allows to keep us readers guessing about her internal conflicts (she also is kinda wrapped up in her own shit) and plans; just telling all is boring in comparison. For comparison, Tettletale would make for an awful PoV-protagonist in Worm, even though she is the secret protagonist of the first half. Or like, for good reason, Bakker's "Prince of Nothing" series does mostly not tell the story from the viewpoint of the prince.
