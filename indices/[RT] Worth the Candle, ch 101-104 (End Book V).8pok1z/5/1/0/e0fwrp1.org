A good question. I think it's up to the author, of course, but so far increasing Juniper's social stats has made him more aware of what /others/ are thinking and feeling, without being any more competent at managing his /own/ thoughts and feelings. A significant number of his issues seem to stem from his depression and inability to let go of the past, and the rest seem to come from his indifference toward his companions other than Fenn and Mary. He really hasn't put much if any effort towards socializing with Grak, Solace, or Valencia. To be honest, he hasn't put much effort towards /anything/ including his own personal goals. Frankly I don't think he needs social brilliance, he needs to stop being such a frustrating non-entity in his own story and show some engagement with the world. For example, he has completely blanked on the Grak byplay during this several-month sidequest. Grak is now much more closely bound to Mary than to Joon.

I agree with you (and other responses) that the story wouldn't be the same if perceived by Mary. I can't help but feel like that'd be a good thing, because it might lend the story some direction. Mary is /driven,/ in one way or another, and driven characters are interesting. When they overcome a challenge, it feels like a victory. Let me pose a counter-question: We just finished another book in this story. What was the climax, and what contribution did Juniper make to it versus Mary?

All of this could be authorial intent. The whole story is a unique window on escapism and depression and how the former doesn't cure the latter. But I don't feel like there's been a whole lot of emotional or character growth for Joon, or any opportunity for him to demonstrate the same. If anything he was substantially /more/ active and engaged towards the start of the story than he is now.
