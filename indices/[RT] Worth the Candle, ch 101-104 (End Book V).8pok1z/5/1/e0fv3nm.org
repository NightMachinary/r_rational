I can understand why 'most recent 15 chapters' is a useful benchmark, but large parts of recent events were boring and/or stressful downtime in the chamber (for the characters, but not for the readers).

Juniper/Mary is an important thread on the nature of self-modification and personal identity. I'm not sure it would be the same if we read about that as perceived by Mary.

Juniper's reckoning about Arthur might be part of what he's wrapped up in, but I wouldn't say it's not important.

Letter 15 advanced Fenn's character and all the relationships between Fenn, Juniper, and Mary. That said, it /was/ Fenn-and-Mary driven, so I can see how it contributes to your count of times we didn't need Juniper to narrate.

I think you're right to say that Valencia and Amaryllis still have the more interesting dynamic than Valencia and Juniper, so far.

The dynamic between Bethel and Juniper, once it gets going, should be interesting because while Mary is Uther's descendant, Juniper is his analogue, and Bethel won't want to make the same mistakes twice.

  Negotiations took hours, and I was thankful that my role in them was very minor. There were hundreds of things that needed to be hammered out, but Amaryllis and Valencia (with the most cunning devil she could find) were both up to it.

This... would not have been fun to read, I think.

Here's a question for you: do you think Juniper will acquire increasing social brilliance?
