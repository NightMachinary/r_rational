I feel like, as time goes on, Joon is slipping further and further away from being the protagonist of this story.

I mean, think about the last I dunno, 15 chapters or so. Amaryllis plans the modernization of her planet while pregnant with a druid baby and bonding, one at a time, with Grak, Fenn, and Joon. She has the more interesting conflict-connection with the newest cast member, the house. She has the weird big-sister relationship to Valencia. In the final meeting, she's the one proposing the plans and the methods used. Joon barely even speaks at this point except to give away the game to an agency that is, natch, /hunting Amaryllis./

I don't /particularly/ mind the Mary show, because I think she's got more interesting character motivations in general, but "The Mary show as seen by a kind of socially dim dude who's very wrapped up in his own shit" is a difficult lens with which to view it. It's like trying to read Worm if it was still abut Taylor, but for some reason told from Armsmaster's perspective.
