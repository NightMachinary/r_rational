This series of chapters was great.

Did Arthur pull these Uniquities from his ideas/memories from RPing with June, maybe?

Shipping, as of now:

Fenn x June (canon ship!)\\
Mary x Valencia (that Valencia chapter is adorable!)\\
Rope x House (obvious ship - /Ropey had been providing the strap, and was wrapped around the staff with elaborate knotwork that struck me as a little bit too intimate. I was used to his knots being economical./)

And that leaves Grak x ???, Solace x ???, and Six Eyed Doe x ???

Can't really see Grak with the Six Eyed Doe, to be honest. Solace... I feel like we haven't seen enough.
