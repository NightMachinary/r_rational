On one hand, that's a pretty "safe" romance choice to try and date someone outside of your work colleagues, so to speak.

On the other, it's kind of obvious she mainly likes him because he reminds her of Joon, with the train of thought of being

- I can't date Joon because /morality ethics mumble mumble/

- therefore, the next best choice is the next person I see who sufficiently resembles him

which miiiiiiight have some problems if that subplot actually goes anywhere, lol
