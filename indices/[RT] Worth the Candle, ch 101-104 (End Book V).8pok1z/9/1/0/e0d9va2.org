  Her falling for Valencia wouldn't be possible without some soulfuckery

Actually it's already been briefly discussed that Amaryllis is likely to be asexual or lesbian with an exception for Juniper when she normally is repulsed by the idea of dating and having sex with a man.

From chapter 52 about her distaste for men:

#+begin_quote
  “If you tried to kiss me, I would kiss you back, and if you wanted to fuck me, then I would --” she looked to me, “Endure it,” she finished, apparently not pulling any punches. “I would get through this thing that I didn't want to do, and I would learn to like it, or at least learn to not visibly dislike it.” She folded her hands in her lap. “I'm aware of how that makes me sound,” she said.

From chapter 93 about how Juniper noticed her likely sexual orientation:

#+begin_quote
  “No, you're not,” I said. “Just ... asexual?”

  “Mostly,” said Amaryllis. She frowned at me. “Did you know before I did?”

  “After our long talk in the bottle [in chapter 52], it seemed like one of the two likely options,” I said with a shrug. “The other being that you were lesbian.” I hadn't wanted to pry or make assumptions, but I'd really been hoping that her revulsion towards sex with me wasn't just because it was me.

  Amaryllis gave a nonchalant shrug. “A bit.”
