Mary is heterosexual, now? Her falling for Valencia wouldn't be possible without some soulfuckery...Which now that I think about it, may actually be possible. Don't know how I feel about Mary editing her soul to let her fall for Val.

Anyways, I doubt that will happen, because it looks like Valencia has the start of a crush on Jorge.
