Fenn could be Slytheryn. She's brave sure, but she only fights for the people she cares about. The insecure-style devotion to the people she loves is very un-gryffindor. Then there's early-book Fenn being immodest just to get a rise out of Joon. Just because she could. Because it was fun.

Most convincingly, she'd totally be willing to kill someone if Joon or Mary asked her to. The reasons why might interest her, but only in an academic sense.

She's like a cute and sarcastic Goyle.
