Oh, it's back? I was following Liar Game for a while but then it took a really long break and I forgot about it. Truth be told, some of the later games are designed confusingly enough that I can't really strategize well within them (perhaps also due to information lost in translation?), but even so watching the players hack their way through the game is entertaining enough in its own rights.
