I think the above poster was referring to the rule that if any Liar Game associate lies about anything, it costs them 10 billion yen (or at least I think that's the amount).

In any case, one could perhaps assume that since this deception took place before that rule was placed, it didn't count? Or perhaps the Liar Game Association's lawyer agencies were in fact legally legitimate, but were also made to slant things in their favor. I don't recall if he ever said a straight out lie.
