Yeah. The one thing that bugged me the whole time was that noone had mentioned it. I would be far happier of someone said "hey didn't you lie earlier" "Oh, that was before the game started for you"

Unless they are trying to set up an Enders game reveal where they cancel a debt with that later. That would be mildly slick of them.
