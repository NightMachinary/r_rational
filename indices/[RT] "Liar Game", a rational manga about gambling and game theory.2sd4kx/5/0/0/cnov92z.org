Could be the translators, I guess. It was something like non-main character participants going into a game with 1,4 billion yen combined debt and somehow ending up in he black after having been given 1,2 billion of the prize money. So translation error or the author added together 12 people's debts wrong.

These are unpaid, volunteer translators, so it's possible they made a mistake, but they've been at it for a while and numbers should be easier to translate than most things.
