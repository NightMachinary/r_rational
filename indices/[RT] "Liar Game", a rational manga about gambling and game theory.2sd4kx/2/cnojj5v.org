Haven't read "Liar Game", but I've enjoyed the first arc of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsuBt6Aq3B8&index=1&list=PLweslq_DKeVKbsjWTPWbfvki8JEX6AXK-][Kaiji]], another manga (and anime) about gambling and playing games. Haven't made it past the second arc (which is pretty weak as the game played in it isn't interesting) yet, but the first storyline is fairly clever and very compelling (and works fine as a standalone story).
