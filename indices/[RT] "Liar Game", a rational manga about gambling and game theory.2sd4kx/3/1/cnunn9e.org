Well, they were under a lot of stress at the time, and nose-chain guy (I forget his name) wasn't really all that bright to begin with, so he's not likely to think of that. Fukunaga's main concern is /winning/, so a draw probably wouldn't occur to him/her; the only reason he/she suggested a draw at all was because he/she was getting shafted by the original deal, and even /then/, No. 15 was the one who introduced the idea to take both of their "Yes" cards. At that point, they were probably relieved to have any solution at all, which means they weren't thinking too hard about the possibility of exploitation (besides, from their perspective, why would No. 15 deliberately lose by voting "Yes"?). In addition, Fukunaga (who's the more intelligent one of the two and thus more likely to see the flaw) was also affected by perceptual contrast (getting shafted by the deal is clearly worse than holding off until next round), and thus was more likely to accept No. 15's suggestion.

My point is that your idea is valid, yes, but it was very unlikely to be thought of in time by either Fukunaga or nose-chain guy, especially with No. 15 there to actively steer them away from the thought.
