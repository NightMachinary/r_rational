I wish you had stuck a big longer. The female protagonist had her own character development which did not start until the plot progressed quite a bit.

The story does have episodes of down time, some chapters feel like fillers. However, overall quality is pretty good.

On a side note, I have been compiling a list of rationalist manga/anime for a while, hoping to post on this subreddit once it's finished. Liar Game is among them.
