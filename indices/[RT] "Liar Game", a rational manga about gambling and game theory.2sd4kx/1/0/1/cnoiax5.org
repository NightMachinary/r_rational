I will say that she does start learning and applying the "teachings" of Shinichi later in the series. She keeps with her goal of being the kind of person who would always comply in the prisoner's dilemma and tries to be a good example of why it would be in the best interest of everyone to comply too. This does not mean she remains a pushover.
