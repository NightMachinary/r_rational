This is exactly the problem I have with Liar Game. The female protagonist is so annoying and sometimes it feels like the author is substituting Nao with the reader.

While the way Shinichi hacks his way into winning makes it interesting I didn't find the story all that compelling. Gave up by chapter 10.
