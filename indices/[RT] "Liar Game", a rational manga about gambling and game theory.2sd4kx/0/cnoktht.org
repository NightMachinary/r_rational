I am a fan of this one, and it is pretty smartly written. Clever strategies are definitely its focus and its strong suit. The plot and characters are also interesting, even if the story focuses almost solely on the cerebral aspect at times. One monologue from the story sticks with me even now.

"People SHOULD be doubted. Many people misunderstand this concept. Doubting people is just a part of getting to know them. What many people call ‘trust' is really just giving up on trying to understand others, and that very act is far worse than doubting. It is actually ‘apathy."
