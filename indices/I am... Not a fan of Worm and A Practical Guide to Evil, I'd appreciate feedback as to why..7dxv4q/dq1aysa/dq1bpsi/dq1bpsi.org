I had somewhat the opposite reaction to Worm. Notwithstanding the high school bullying scenes, which really dragged, the beginning was my favorite part, and I had more complaints as the story progressed. I still liked it, overall, but don't plan to read it again until it's edited, and I'm really hoping that the things I most disliked get edited away (and Wildbow has already said as much when discussing the edits).
