I don't like A Practical Guide to Evil.

I like Worm's emphasis on... I'm not sure how to put it. Logistics? Mechanics? Worm talks about heroism in a practical way. A lot of thought goes into equipment, power utilization, power function, etc. It's not a how-to book, but it's closer to a how-to book than the average novel about people with powers. People use powers for mundane utility, or in conjunction with ordinary tools, or for creative applications, in a way that feels very real.

There's also a feeling of empowerment with reading Worm, because of this mechanical focus. Almost every problem can be solved, with enough advance preparation and cleverness and willingness to run away, and when problems are solved it does not feel artificial because the details are done so well. Threats escalate over time to force character growth in capabilities, but the difficulty of pulling off solutions always increases relative to the level of escalation.
