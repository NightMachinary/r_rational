Even though this was 5 months ago, I feel like I should mention that the lack of guns is completely deliberate. Lethal force is almost never employed against parahumans, because there's a great fear of escalation (for example, if you start shooting at Taylor maybe she'll decide to just bite everyone in a several block radius with black widows). It's only used against parahumans who have repeatedly shown themselves willing to kill, like the Slaughterhouse 9. Otherwise, parahumans generally fight "with their gloves on" in most situations, because things would become chaotic very quickly otherwise. Cauldron also manipulates things behind the scenes to discourage killing strong parahumans, since they want as many possible for the conflict with Scion. In the sequel, Ward, guns are brought to a parahuman fight and it has a big impact (because most parahumans are actually vulnerable to guns). Victoria (Glory Girl) is the protagonist, and guns are a big problem for her, because a single bullet will knock out her shields for several seconds.
