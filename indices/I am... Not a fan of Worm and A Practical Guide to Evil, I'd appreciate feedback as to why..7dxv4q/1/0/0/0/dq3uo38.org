It's the Endbringers. If heroes do things like set sniper rifles on villains who aren't killing people a la the Slaughterhouse Nine, the villains stop being willing to show up at the Endbringer fights. If you look at how Endbringers get defeated, sometimes it is just Eidolon stalls until Scion shows up, but other times you have people like Lung who carry the day, and they wouldn't do that if not for the "unwritten rules" that you don't sniper rifle the average villain.
