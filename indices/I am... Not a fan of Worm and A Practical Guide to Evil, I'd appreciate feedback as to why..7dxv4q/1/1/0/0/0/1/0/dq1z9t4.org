I've tried rereading Worm, but knowing how the action plays out really takes away a lot of the suspense. Given that the story uses the constant escalation so much, it removed a lot of the "what's going to happen next?" feeling I read it for in the first place. I've never made it farther than the Levi arc after I finished it the first time.

Fair point on the coloring of my interpretation from fanfiction. I would offer that re-reading inner monologues is not my preferred entertainment.
