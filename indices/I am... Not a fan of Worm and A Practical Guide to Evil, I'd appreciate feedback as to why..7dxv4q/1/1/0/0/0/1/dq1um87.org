I was giving a few examples, not talking about the entirety of the work. Taylor's emotions and attitudes are muted by design, but on a reread you'll notice she conveys them much more strongly through her actions rather than through her inner monologue.

I think as someone writing fanfiction you've probably spent more time reading that than you spent reading the original, and other people's interpretations of the characters have colored your impressions. Before rereading, I was in the same place.
