  I personally found her emotions to be muted and flat throughout the series, which is not a small flaw, and not one limited to Taylor (you see this in most interludes as well, though the epilogues are better).

Well, she's basically compartmentalization incarnate; it seems very fitting that the emotions she's trying not to notice are not front and centre?

YMMV, but I think I really enjoyed catching the small things that betray Taylor's actual emotional state and worries, rather than what she /says/ those are.
