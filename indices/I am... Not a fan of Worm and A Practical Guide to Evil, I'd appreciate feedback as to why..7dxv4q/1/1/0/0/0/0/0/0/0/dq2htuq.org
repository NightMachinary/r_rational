*(Part 2)*

The following contains *HEAVY SPOILERS* up to Arc 25.

  “Hey Shitcrumb!” Regent hollered, backing away from cover. “Easy-”

  Behemoth dropped the flame attack. I could see Yàngban members raising forcefields as he reached out, casting a bolt of lightning in Regent's direction. The forcefields did nothing, not even softening the blow in any measurable way.

  Regent was snuffed out, dead.

  A small sound escaped my mouth.

  */But there was no time to react./* Reeling, grieving, it would cost us. He'd done what he did for a reason. The antigrav on the flight pack kicked in, I waited until it started to drag me, then let it go. It skidded across the gap, across the road, to Imp. She caught it, and I controlled the motion of it to drag her away.

Justified in the moment or not, you can't ignore that Taylor is once again trying to box up and throw away feelings that are hurting her.

This is how Taylor systematically deals with issues. She doesn't. When something bothers her, it no longer gets mentioned in her narration.

Let's see how long she can keep that up for, though. Much later in the chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Silence, stillness. The buzz of my power at the periphery of my consciousness was a fraction of what it might otherwise be, limited to the bugs that crawled in the recesses of my costume. There was only the press of bodies, two dogs and all of the rest of us in an area smaller than my jail cell.

  I tried to speak, and emotion caught my voice. */It threw me, as if it didn't match how I felt, didn't match the composure I felt like I had./*
#+end_quote

Taylor still tries to ignore the reality of how this is making her feel. It's safely tucked away in its compartment so clearly it can't be affecting her emotionally.

This is a /really/ good characterization beat, imo.

  /Think, think./

  “Sorry about your pal,” Tecton said.

  I shook my head. A denial? He was important to me, but... what, then? Was I wanting to focus on the situation?
#+end_quote

In a previous example, I showed Taylor using flowery language when talking about her awful coping mechanisms to make them sound better, something that I think is a very believable and human touch.

Here, she's rebranding her coping mechanism to do the same thing. Clearly, she's just doing what she can to focus on the mission, and certainly not trying to put off dealing with something traumatic because that sort of thing has been consistently hard for her.

This is /wonderfully/ indirect characterization.

I don't really get how someone can go through Worm with any semblance of literary analysis and come away thinking the characterization is "lackluster," or how these very deliberate character beats can be misinterpreted by someone as the author "not being great at writing emotion."

Dude, I get it. [[https://i.imgur.com/QWGrU.jpg][Sometimes the curtains are just fucking blue.]] But I think you can go too far in the opposite direction, and end up wilfully ignoring a lot of things that are pretty clearly intentional.

*Edit:* Worm is an incredibly heavy novel. If you're still having trouble interpreting it, I recommend checking out the [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/weve-got-worm/id1232043483?mt=2][*We've Got Worm*]] podcast. They do a good job of making the themes and nuances of Worm understandable to people who aren't used to looking at a novel that way.
