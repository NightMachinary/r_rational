Characters get a wholly undeserved bad rap in the Worm fandom. Taylor is phenomenal if you pay attention to the writing. Theo is a fantastic contrast to her, later in the serial when he gets the focus. Armsmaster's development is easily some of the best Wildbow's ever written. The interactions between the characters past the halfway point are incredible. Defiant and Saint, Taylor and Bitch. Worm fanfiction only suffers because it's forced to retread the start of the story, when those interactions weren't fully developed.
