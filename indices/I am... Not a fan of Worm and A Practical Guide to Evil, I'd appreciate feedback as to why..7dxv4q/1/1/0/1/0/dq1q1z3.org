By way of explanation, Jack is shallow. Astoundingly so. That's why he built the Nine, to show the world that he's the big bad, that he matters. Whenever someone calls him out on this, he freaks out and tries to kill them. In this way he is a consistent and interesting character.

Everyone be else is kinda eh in Worm. Again, I liked it, but as a character study it was nothing spectacular.
