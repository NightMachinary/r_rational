The thing is, that's depth. He's a whiny son of a bitch playing charismatic slasher villain, and succeeding. Until he doesn't.

By dissecting such a stereotypical villain, WarBoar actually forces depth upon him, showing the how and why such a person could exist. Much in the same way Skitter uses breadth of power to make depth (turning a Master power into Tinker/Shaker/Thinker ratings), Jack Slash uses breadth of horror to create the illusion depth (so many different types of death from the Nine make people unsure as to what he's going to do next, and conceal the fact that he's a murderhobo). Meanwhile, the rest of the cast of Worm have clear, defined goals that inform their every action. Jack's the odd man out, until he isn't and thus you /feel/ as if his character developed, even though he's the most childish person in the entire serial.

TL;DR: Jack's depth revealed as shallowness is actually more entertaining to go through than watching realistic people do realistic things. It's much more fun to watch Superman turn into Clark Kent than watch realistic people kill each other.
