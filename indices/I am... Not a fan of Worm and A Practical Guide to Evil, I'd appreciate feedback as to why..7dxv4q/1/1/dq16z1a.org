I guess my big issue with work is the inter character interaction then. I don't remember the challenges and solutions building very well, but I'm down to accept that I might just not appreciate it. What really gets me down is the idiotic and not particularly consistent social strength of the characters. They seem to hold certain values close to heart, but only until they talk to someone else, or in the case of the main character until she's has a few minutes to think, where on she decides that she should roll back any character development that would lead her to being a badass.

I guess my issue with aPGtE is a little bit of both. Weakly represented intercharacter relations, in addition to weak problems and weak problem solving, with a extra large dose of Deus ex machina.
