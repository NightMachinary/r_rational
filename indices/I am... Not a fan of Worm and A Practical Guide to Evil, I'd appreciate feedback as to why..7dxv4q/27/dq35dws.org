I agree with you. A Practical Guide to Evil is just mediocre in everything, mediocre writing, mediocre characters, mediocre story. Author seems to be very young and it shows not in a good way. Feels like any fantasy paperback timekiller off the shelf

Worm should've been great, but I lost interest because of mediocre characters. Battles and challenges became boring after a while, I was skim reading a lot.
