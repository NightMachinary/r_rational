Brave of you to post that here!

While I wouldn't say that either story you mentioned is strictly rational fiction, what I personally like about them, Worm especially, is their high level of realism within the established boundaries of the story. For the most part, the characters behave like real people would if they got powers, and to the extent that they don't, there is a satisfying in-universe explanation as to why. This is in contrast to most other super hero and fantasy stories (super hero stories especially) where characters often do things that make little sense from their perspective, just because it's necessary to move the plot along.

I would even suggest that the prevalence of this issue in these genres is the source of much of the enthusiasm for the stories you mentioned. People who love these genres but are still bothered by that they often suffer from this issue, are understandably very excited when they discover great stories like Worm or PGtE that avoid this problem.
