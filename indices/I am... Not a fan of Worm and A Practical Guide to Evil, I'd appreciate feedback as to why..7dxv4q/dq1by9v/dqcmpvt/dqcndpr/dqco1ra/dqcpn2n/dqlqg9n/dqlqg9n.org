  They are destroying the Earth as part of a science experiment in an attempt to reverse entropy and stop the heat death of the universe,

Please tell me if I have this wrong, but my understanding of the Entities' plan is:

1. Find people who are traumatized and psychologically damaged
2. Put worms in their heads that give them superpowers
3. Have the worms mind control their hosts into punching each other instead of doing science / improving everyone's quality of life / anything useful
4. After they've punched each other enough, blow up the planet and take back all the worms
5. ???
6. Stop the heat death of the universe.

Do I have that right? If so, that is literally the least productive route to the goal that I can imagine. Maybe talking to humans and recruiting them as research partners would be a better plan?

This is why I so thoroughly dislike Worm. The entire thing is a series of author fiat diabolus ex machina from the large scale to the small, simply to justify wallowing in grimdark.
