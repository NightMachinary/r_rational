Never read worm but practical guide is a fun deconstruction of the Lord of the Rings fantasy genre mixed with strong characters and a sense of scale of abilities that isn't often done well.

Catherine looks and acts like someone who was pushed well beyond what she could bare and kept herself together by convincing herself it was for the greater good. Problem is, she actually *is* willing to do what that entails, and as time goes on her solutions are more and more pragmatic in the HPMOR!Dark Side version of pragmatism IE "I don't have time to redeem every motherfucker I come across, they either die or fall in line because I don't can't spare them any more thought."

This leads to her to becoming very good at her chosen field IE murdering those who disagree and getting the survivors to fall in line, hell, just look the Gallowborne. Unfortunately for her (and some of her agency) she has put no points into diplomacy, she honestly has neither the time nor the inclination. This leads to her getting screwed over by Heiress or Malicia or the First Prince or whoever in the long run because she just ignored politics as a thing-I-don't-have-time-for. This can leave a bad taste in your mouth, especially as the amazingness of Malicia and Cordelia Hasenbach becomes evident.

In the end though, I find the whole thing rather satisfying, especially the outside-view chapters where everyone is all "how the fuck did she do all this and how the fuck is she still alive? WHAT DO YOU FUCKING MEAN SHE MUGGED A FUCKING ANGEL?" etc etc.

Of course, I like deconstruction in general and the characters were just what put it above the rest for me.
