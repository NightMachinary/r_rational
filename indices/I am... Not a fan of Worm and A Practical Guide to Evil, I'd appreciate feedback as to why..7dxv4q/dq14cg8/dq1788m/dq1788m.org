So, I appreciate a lot of what you're saying, but it was really her POV mugging an angel that killed it for me. The author seemed to take too much joy in it, the scene was pretty bloated, and I couldn't reconcile all the previous descriptions of insanely powerful angels with her interaction with it. It seemed a little bit too lucky to me, and because every character is a Hero or a Villain with tons of potential and an empathetic backstory, it's harder to accept that the protagonist wins just because.
