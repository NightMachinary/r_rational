For the record, I did not get that vibe at all. Yes, Molly is described as very attractive once she's grown up. Yes, she's got a huge crush on Dresden. No, Dresden is never remotely tempted.

As an example, there's one scene where she makes a play for him by walking into his living room in a towel after taking a shower and then drops it. His response is to dump a pitcher of ice water on her head and say "That will never happen." Yes, when she drops her towel his internal monologue recognizes that she's attractive and is willing. No, he's not seriously moved by it.

As to misogyny...I don't really see it. Karrin Murphy is a badass, very honorable, and smart. Molly is a complex character but very positively shown and I wouldn't describe her as a "bad girl" unless the definition of "bad girl" is simply "woman who is in command of her own sexuality". Dresden's girlfriends are both badasses, mentally and physically, who have serious agency and don't need to be rescued more often than any other character. There are villainous women, but there are villainous men, too. Offhand, I can't think of a single Distress Damsel or Overbearing Shrew or Subservient Housewife in the series. I see that others are saying this was mostly an issue in the first couple books; it's been a long time since I started the series, so maybe I'm not thinking of something from the start of the series. It's definitely not an ongoing thing.
