I think both of them resort to "magic" and "fate" to resolve problems, which is likely why they don't really feel rational to me. The characters don't plan and find smart solutions to problems, they kind of just blunder on driven by the momentum of their role and environment.

They also both feature protagonists that have an ethical core but are pushed into being archetypical villains, and this feels a bit forced at times. Rationality is a lot about morality and effective pursuit of values, and the villain trope sometimes feels forced and in contradiction with their aims.

I enjoy reading both but have stalled out several times and have yet to finish either for the above reasons
