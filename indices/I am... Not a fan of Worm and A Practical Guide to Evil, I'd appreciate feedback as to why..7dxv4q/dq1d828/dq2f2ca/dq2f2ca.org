  I remember in one of the recent ones, Cat purposefully surprised Masego during the middle of a supposedly critical combat. That took me totally out of the story as she wasn't treating it as "we are one mistake away from total catastrophe." instead it seemed like "I trust my plot armor to protect me from pulling stupid stuff in a critical battle."

I'm not souring on PGtE yet, but yeah, this bugged the heck out of me too. That, and when Masego and Cat had the option to catch Archer as she was falling in a recent battle. Masego's ready to do so and Cat's like "Nah, let her break her fall on that house, it'll be funny."

Archer's one of the strongest forces in Cat's army - why in the world would she risk letting her get seriously injured!? It was a terrible tactical decision that was seemingly done just for humorous byplay - not at all how a commander would handle a valuable asset, or a leader should support a teammate.
