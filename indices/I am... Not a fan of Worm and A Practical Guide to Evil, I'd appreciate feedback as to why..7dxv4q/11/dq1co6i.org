Crapsack worlds generally don't appeal to me. The logistics of throwing thousands of people into the meat grinder while having whole societies somehow continue to function is a bit difficult to swallow. We see the people getting wiped out by immense powers but we don't always see the babies being born and grown to sustain the destruction. The glass is often too empty to seem rational.

However I enjoyed Worm and PGTE. Worm manages the post-endbringer struggle of Brockton Bay with some semblance of balance up to a point. PGTE's good versus evil motif seems less developed what with the artificial famines and mass ritual massacres on the evil side and the good suffering from near constant depredations.

I suppose I like these stories because it helps that the protagonists are more ably depicted as damaged (yet functioning) products of their respective worlds. They become what they oppose. That's not conducive to forming an emotional attachment with the reader though. Bad things are expected to happen to the protagonists and I often concede they were deserved or shrug it off cuz shit happens in a crapsack world. I don't always empathize or make myself feel shock for their circumstances.
