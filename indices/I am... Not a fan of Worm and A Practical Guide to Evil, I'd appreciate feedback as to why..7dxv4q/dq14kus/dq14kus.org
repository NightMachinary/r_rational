Do you have any clear thoughts as to what you find objectionable, unenjoyable, or irrational about them? Far easier to begin a conversation based on that than to list all the varying things that cause others to enjoy them.

If not, may I suggest you put thought towards clarifying it for yourself? I realize that this may be part of the reason you posted, but it's difficult for others to predict all the nuances that combine to make up your thoughts. We could then provide input and opinions regarding those thoughts.

Mostly I think we would discuss the parts you find to be irrational. I can definitely understand if the style of these fics is not to your tastes.

EDIT: didn't read the other posts before responding to this comment thread. Productive conversation has ensued, OP's point has been clarified. I consider my question answered, and point I made herein no longer relevant.
