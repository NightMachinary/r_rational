  Do you have any clear thoughts as to what you find objectionable, unenjoyable, or irrational about them? Far easier to begin a conversation based on that than to list all the varying things that cause others to enjoy them.

This sounds as though you are asking for points you can rebut. I find it often leads to an argument of the form "No, that aspect actually /is/ enjoyable, for the following reasons..." or "That's part of the appeal." Neither of these sorts of arguments does anything to help me enjoy a work. I find it hard to imagine you aren't winding up the OP just to be condescending when he finally does reply.
