I could only read Worm once, because the main appeal of the story is seeing how powers interact. If you're not into that, the story isn't actually that special.

I'm also frosty on a Practical Guide to Evil. This is more because the update time is so long, but more than that the main characters are simply too cavalier for me. It never feels like bad shit will ever stick, which drains tension from it like a /motherfucker/.

If you're looking for something else, the Legacy series of FanFiction for Worm is much more character driven, in many ways surpassing the source material. Or you could read The Metropolitan Man for the fifth time.
