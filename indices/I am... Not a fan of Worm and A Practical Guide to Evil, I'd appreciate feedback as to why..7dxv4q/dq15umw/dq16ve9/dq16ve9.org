Yup. Worm feels less like standard superhero fiction and more like Reality Ensues - people who practise things get better at them, hard work pays off, sometimes luck goes the wrong way, and there's less of a mindset - at least with Taylor - that powers are something which must only be used when in costume, or that fights must adhere to Queensbury Rules, or that people are either super-boy-scout Heroes or cackling mustache-twiddling Villains, and never the twain shall meet. It feels a bit more like the Whateley Academy universe, where smart minor supervillains work under the radar, there /are/ supers who have been both villain and hero at times, and one of the central original story concepts is that heroes can and do often have deep secrets.

Worm's capes are flawed. They're /people/ - they have their own individual mindsets and ways of going about things, and sometimes those blur or straddle the lines between Hero and Villain. Particularly when there are Endbringer fights, which force everyone with powers to work (and often die) together. That tends to break down the artificial "us vs them" barriers, and introduce more of a "human vs Unknowable God-Thing" distinction which is always lurking the background, corroding the standard tropes.
