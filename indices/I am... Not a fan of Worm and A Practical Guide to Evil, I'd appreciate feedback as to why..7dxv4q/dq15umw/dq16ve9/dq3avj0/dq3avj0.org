Unfortunately, Worm didn't have this feel for me. Just for instance, there is actually a huge emphasis on the Queensbury rules: after being told that capes never use guns because of potential escalation, there are literally only two instances in the story where capes use guns in a plot-relevant manner. I think there's a supervillain who uses a sniper rifle who has one appearance. While the characters who are powerful enough that guns are pointless get a pass (as does Miss Militia) I can't see any reason the main characters never get them. Not after their city is turned into a flooded war zone, not after they're invaded by marauding serial killers, etc.

Even non capes do dumb things, somehow. When the Undersides rob a bank, why don't the police have snipers on every roof around the bank... like at all? I'm pretty sure the robbery was long enough for that to go down. Stuff like that. And any explanation that has the words "Contessa" or "Shard" in it misses the point, because a) those are the idiot ball personified and it's unsatisfying because it's a cop out, and b) we don't know about those until the end, so the reader is left scratching their head for a million plus words.
