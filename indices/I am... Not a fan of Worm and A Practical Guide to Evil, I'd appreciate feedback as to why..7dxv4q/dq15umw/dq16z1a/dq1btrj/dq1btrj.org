Honestly, the characters in Worm are not impressive (coming from a guy writing FanFiction for the damn thing). Most of them are fairly lackluster and unoriginal, with only Jack Slash having any real depth. A fellow by the name of notes wrote a much more character-driven FanFiction by the name of Cenotaph. In the event you think that is what was holding you back, I recommend checking it out.
