I mean, I can be wrong. This is something I think I made clear in other comments, and I do not appear to have read it close enough to pick up on this.

Again though, what does this have to do with the OP? If you have to preface a story with “look for the more subtle emotions,” are you writing a good story? Maybe I'm not a good enough reader to /get it/, and that's a criticism of me, a reader. But level that lens at the work too. What is the barrier to enjoyment in Worm?

Again, I read and enjoyed Worm. But I can't seem to reread it, and my attempts to do so are thwarted by Taylor's monologues and the feeling of a glass screen between the rest of the characters and me. Maybe that's what WarnerBrothers was going for. Maybe it's a problem I have. But I don't feel like Taylor is human sometimes.
