I would counter that creating an in-universe reason to cover a mistake is a thing authors do. Again though, the biggest thing that screams "mistake" rather than "misreading" to me is that Taylor shows more emotion as the series goes on. I think this is because SavageBreau is getting better at writing, rather than Taylor developing a greater emotional range.

All of this is slightly tangent to the OP: why would someone dislike/be unable to get into Worm? In the context of the OP, I'm taking the stance that the main character is a little flat at the beginning, to which you are saying is a personal failing. I would ask you if you know of any other explanation/flaws in Worm that would turn a reader off.
