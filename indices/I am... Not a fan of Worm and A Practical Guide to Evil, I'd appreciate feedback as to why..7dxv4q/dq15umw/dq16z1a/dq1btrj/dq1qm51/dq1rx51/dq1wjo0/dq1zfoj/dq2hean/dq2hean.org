  you can say it's compartmentalized, but it could also be the author not being great at writing emotion
#+end_quote

Man, I really don't know what to tell you.

Wildbow [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/63m2cd/weve_got_worm_podcast_readthrough_episode_5_hive/dfvtew2/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Parahumans][says]] it was intentional:

#+begin_quote
  I do feel you guys are 90% right when it comes to your take on what was intentional or not, and what fell into place with some attention to themes and some consistency on other fronts

  [...]

  It's validating. I've found myself doing little success kid fistpumps when you guys dropped the word compartmentalization a few times and when you drew some parallels.
#+end_quote

Reading through this thread though, I get the feeling you aren't picking up on a lot of less explicit characterization in Worm, which would explain why you felt the characterization wasn't /there/.

I don't think Taylor's compartmentalization and rationalization is something that can be missed if you're dissecting the work at any level of depth. It's a very explicit part of who she is.

She puts people into boxes. She takes bad thoughts and feelings, locks them away, throws away the key, and forces herself to not think about them. This is in stark contrast to other viewpoint characters, who don't do this.

This isn't minor detail stuff. You cannot understand this character without being aware of this. Taylor's attempt to segregate her feelings into boxes is the driving flaw behind most of her actions in the early novel, and a point of reflection and personal growth in the later half.

I'm going to show you some examples of how Wildbow expertly does characterization, using two separate chapters as examples.

--------------

At this point in the story, Taylor's rationalized a lot of morally questionable things in her pursuit of rescuing Dinah.

This is the chapter where the neat little boxes Taylor's been building up finally fall down. Notice the disparity between Taylor's thoughts and involuntary actions.

#+begin_quote
  I passed the invisible boundary between the neatly manicured lawn of the mayor's expansive backyard to the tall grass at the glade's edge. My hands were shaking and my breathing was heavy. I hadn't done anything more strenuous in the past few minutes than talking to the mayor and walking at a good pace, */but my body was reacting like I'd just sprinted halfway across the mayor's property./*
#+end_quote

She can't continue ignoring this. She physically has to face what she's done.

Powerful imagery.

#+begin_quote
  I put a hand on a tree as I walked, as if it could steady me and keep me from falling. */I wasn't in any danger of falling that I was aware of,/* but it was reassuring nonetheless.
#+end_quote

Taylor's barely standing upright, but in her head she's still trying to keep her feelings separate from her thoughts to ignore the reality of what she's done.

#+begin_quote
  Damn. How big was his property? And he could still afford to hire someone to cut his grass? Eat a nice dinner on a huge wooden table, complete with courses? Blithely ignoring what was going on in the rest of the city with his superhero son and superheroine date?
#+end_quote

Taylor reflexively tries to judge or hate the Christners in a weak attempt to justify what she's done. With that having failed...

#+begin_quote
  No, try as I might, I couldn't bring myself to get angry. Couldn't blame him for what I'd done.
#+end_quote

...the walls come down. This is a pretty big moment of character growth for Taylor.

Just weeks before, she wouldn't have been capable of doing this. It's only after ignoring increasingly horrific actions that Taylor's coping mechanism breaks down.

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't afford to dwell.
#+end_quote

However, people don't change in an instant. Taylor finds new reasons to ignore Triumph.

Taylor says she /can't afford to take time/ to think about this.

Let's look at what Wildbow does immediately after.

#+begin_quote
  I directed her to me with my bugs, drawing arrows in the air. /A minute or two passed before she caught up./
#+end_quote

So in the two minutes Taylor spent standing there, waiting alone, she has avoided thinking about Rory once.

Worm is explicitly first person. When a character thinks about something or notices a thing, it's supposed to be /that character/ doing it. When they don't narrate something that we would ordinarily expect them to narrate, the same rule applies. Worm uses this as a literary technique often, informing personality traits via what things a character does or does not pick up on.

This is deliberate, indirect, and interesting characterization.

Do you think the emotion of the scene is being mishandled?

From later in the chapter:

#+begin_quote
  It was times like this that I felt less normal, less human. It was dark, the foliage overhead dense, branches blocked my way and the ground was riddled with roots, stones and uneven footing. It barely mattered. My bugs flowed ahead of me to check surfaces, clinging to branches and carpeting the ground. I passed through the trees as though I'd spent my life among them, memorizing where everything was. I extended my foot just a bit further to accommodate the slope ahead of me, ducked a branch with wickedly pointed tips and found a handhold on another branch to help myself hop over a spot where water had pooled.
#+end_quote

Okay. Taylor's going pretty in depth with her description of the local flora.

Kinda weird, yeah?

#+begin_quote
  I liked running. For months, I'd used running as a way to forget about whatever was plaguing me. Before, it had been the bullying. Then it had been the pressures of dealing with the Undersiders, my undercover ruse. Separating from my dad. Dinah. The fallout from the Endbringer attack. Coil.
#+end_quote

Running? Taylor, what on Earth does running have to do with-

Ah. I think I see where this is going.

#+begin_quote
  The times I hadn't run, I'd felt like I was losing my mind. Did correlation equal causation, there? Or was it just that the moments I was unable to run were the same moments I was under the most stress? When the Slaughterhouse Nine had been in town, when I'd been living in the shelters after Leviathan hit the city, before I rejoined the Undersiders?
#+end_quote

She's thinking about literally anything except Rory Christner and what she did to him. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization][Compartmentalization.]]

#+begin_quote
  Either way, it was good to break free of my thoughts on Triumph and what I'd done to him. I could focus on breathing, on putting each foot exactly where it needed to be, keeping my balance and letting my subconscious guide me through the woods.
#+end_quote

And then, Wildbow comes out and more explicitly states that Taylor is avoiding her problems and putting them in a box. Since another one of Taylor's character traits is a lack of self-awareness, she chooses to phrase this in possibly the most flowery and positive way you could phrase such a thing.
