Again, this is a matter of opinion. Yes, you can say it's compartmentalized, but it could also be the author not being great at writing emotion (which is hard). I think it's the latter in the early arcs of Worm, you don't, and we're just going to have to disagree.

If you enjoyed finding these things, great! You've got a better eye than I do. On the other hand, Taylor felt a little lifeless to me, and that may be a problem in me rather than the work. I don't know, I'm not a good enough writer to get the truth yet.
