Note that you added a qualifier to your statement: past the halfway mark. Before that, it's not that the chatachters are god-awful unreadable garbage: it's that they're really not anything that great. And to get to the point where they're actually good, you need to read through more than /700,000/ words, which is the length of seven novels.

And honestly? Taylor isn't that great, though I think this is primarily a matter of opinion as opposed to technique. I personally found her emotions to be muted and flat throughout the series, which is not a small flaw, and not one limited to Taylor (you see this in most interludes as well, though the epilogues are better). On the other hand, lots of people did enjoy Taylor, probably because she's one of (if not the most) sympathetic super-power since Spiderman.

I guess what I'm getting at is that the time it takes to get to the really good stuff in Worm is, in fact, a reasonable criticism to level at it. That and this work is basically the definition of YMMV, due to choices made by the creator that lead to many 'matter of opinion' cases.
