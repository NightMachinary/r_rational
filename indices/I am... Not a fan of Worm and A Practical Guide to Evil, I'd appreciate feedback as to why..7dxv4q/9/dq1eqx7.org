I've been feeling this a lot lately, especially in regards to PGtE. I just... don't like it very much. It had promise in the beginning, but now the whole thing just feels like multi-chapter battle after multi-chapter battle, with superficial casualty numbers that become more and more stupidly unrealistic every time. I didn't care about the demon arc and I care even less about the fae arc, so... been a while since I actually gave a shit about anything that was happening in the main story. The snark is more grating and silly than endearing to me, "the woe" is a stupid name, Cat's victories don't seem particularly earned, the overarching plot is very much Worm with a fresh coat of paint, and the aspect system...

Well, that's gonna require a whole separate paragraph because I hate, hate, HATE the aspect system. What could have been a cool, interesting way for villains with the same name to distinguish and differentiate themselves is... super lame. They've become superattacks /activated by saying the name of the aspect ffs/ and that's never something I wanted from the aspect system. When they were first introduced, I thought they'd fit into this whole theme of getting powerful by following the story vs. gaining advantage by subverting it but that's a theme that has been largely wasted.

(Also I think I was doomed to dislike the story regardless because I've never been a fan of elaborate settings with pages of exposition on each minor principality. But that at least I can see being a strength for others).

Worm, on the other hand... I liked it. Up until the S9 redux arc. If one of the S9 clones had been a shark-man and Taylor had jumped over it, it would have been strangely fitting. The story got better again once that was finished, but the damage was done. Also, admittedly, my eyes kind of glazed past most of the action scenes past the halfway point. There were too many of them and not enough were plot-important enough to justify their existence.

Still, I really did like Worm, for many reasons already articulated in this thread! If I had to pick between reading PGtE for the first time or Worm for a second, I'd go with Worm.
