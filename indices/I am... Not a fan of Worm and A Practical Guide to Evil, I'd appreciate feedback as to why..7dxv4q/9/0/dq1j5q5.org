  (Also I think I was doomed to dislike the story regardless because I've never been a fan of elaborate settings with pages of exposition on each minor principality. But that at least I can see being a strength for others).

Haha, I'm a fan of elaborate settings with pages of detailed exposition, yet I also have grown to dislike PGtE!

It's interesting, because the story overflows with hyper-focused details on how the empire is run, the structures of principalities, etc...yet the whole 4th-wall, genre-following/bending/breaking system upon which the world is built, is /extremely/ ill-defined, and so much of the power interaction/development feels pulled from thin air and then rationalized after the fact.

The author gives us an overflow of information for one major part of the story, but very little for another major part, and I think it ends up pushing out both categories of fans.
