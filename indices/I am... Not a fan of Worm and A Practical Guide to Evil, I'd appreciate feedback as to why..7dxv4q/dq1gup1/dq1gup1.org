I finally gave up shortly after the Leviathan fight. Now that I have enjoyed a lot of worm fanfiction I might try again. I've been on the fence pretty much from the first chapter on, though, and I think many of my complaints are still valid, even after reading spoilers that might explain them in-universe.

Please note that the following is based on recollections from years ago. It summarizes my impression, nothing more.

--------------

Every single fight I can remember felt incredibly narratively convenient to me, to the point of being unbelievable. It started with Lung. Taylor managed to narrowly avoid an experienced superhuman melee-fighter a few too many times for me to really be invested in the fight. Even after he grew too much for the pepper spray and bug-bites to really affect him, he just stumbled around. This started my belief that Taylor has plot-armor, which solidified throughout the next few arcs. In turn, this lowered my emotional investment significantly. I semi-fondly recall playing the yackety sax theme in my head while Bakuda and her goons chase the Undersiders with machine-guns and grenade launchers. Not really what imagine wildbow was going for.

Barely succeeding against impossible odds once is exciting. Doing it routinely is boring.

--------------

At the same time, Taylors life was designed to be as soul-crushing as possible. So many things happened /just so/ in order for her life to suck, that I didn't even care anymore. After having read some spoilers, I'm convinced Taylor's life has been a Simurgh plot to get her in the right mindset for killing Scion by thinking depressing thoughts at him. (That's roughly what happened, right?)

--------------

The setting was vaguely unbelievable. This is later revealed to have been engineered by Cauldron, but Contessa inducing world-wide learned helplessness in regards to snipers vs. parahumans does not make a compelling setting. This is mostly a number of miniscule subjective things that vaguely irritated me in the background. The one thing that bothered my had been that mundane humans were completely side-lined when parahumans were involved.

--------------

For me to enjoy grimdark settings I have to either take the seriously, or laugh at it. I could do neither fully here.

--------------

Tl;dr: Worm felt like each action had two possible outcomes: 1) Failing as inconveniently as possible; 2) Barely succeeding against all odds.
