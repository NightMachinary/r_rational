I tried to get into worm. I really did. I kinda liked it but it made me too tense. All that sneaking around and wondering if/when the protagonist might get caught. For the same reason I couldn't get myself to keep watching Merlin, despite it seeming like a pretty decent show. Makes me kinda sad though because I'm always running out of ratfic to read and there's probably some good stuff in the worm fandom...
