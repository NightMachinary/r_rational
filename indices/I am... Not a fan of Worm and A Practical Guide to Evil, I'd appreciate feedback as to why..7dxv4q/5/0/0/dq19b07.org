I think maybe you might not be a fan of constant escalation. You're probably more interested in the munchkining and exploration of systems than you are the drama of overcoming ever-increasing obstacles with the odds stacked against you.

All the stories you listed seem to be more about about smart characters exploring their worlds and trying to find optimal ways to deal with their problems. Whereas Worm and APGTE are more heavily drama/action focused with worldbuilding/optimizing as a means to drive the drama instead of as the main focus.

So that would be my guess as to why you don't find them appealing.
