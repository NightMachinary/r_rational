Not really. What's the point of even considering 'your taste is bad'? There's hardly a 'good' (desirable) and 'bad' (undesirable) taste, at most there's 'high status' and 'low status' taste. The point of this thread isn't to make OP start liking different things. It's to either point out things he isn't noticing in the books that he might like, or notice how his tastes differ from other peoples so that he can better predict if he'll like something the subreddit likes.
