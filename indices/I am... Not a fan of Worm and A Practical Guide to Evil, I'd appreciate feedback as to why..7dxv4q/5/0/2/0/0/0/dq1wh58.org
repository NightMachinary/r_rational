  It's at least useful to consider, isn't it? However, I would rather OP take it as "Your tastes are probably not mature."

My problem with this line of thinking is that it tries to make opinions into objective truths. What you consider "mature tastes" is probably not what many other people consider "mature tastes" and it's not really fair to say that one person is right or wrong.

The closest you can get to defining an objective opinion would be to say that "the most popular opinions are the right ones and all other ones are the wrong ones", but I don't think anyone really believes that when taken to its logical conclusions.

Also even if it was an objective fact that OPs tastes were not mature, I don't think knowing that helps OP. They can't force themselves to like things they don't like. So at best you've only made them aware that their tastes are atypical (something that they likely already knew given the fact that they made this thread in the first place). At worse, you make them feel bad about themselves for not having good/mature tastes.

But just to be clear, I'm not saying it's a bad thing for you to voice your opinion and say "I don't think some of the things you listed are classics *in my opinion* and here's why...". That could be an interesting conversation starter. But the way you stated your opinion makes it sound as if you believe your opinion is some universal truth, instead of an opinion. And you never really elaborated on why you don't think those stories are worthy of being classics or list stories that you consider classics, so it just feels like you're trashing OPs opinion without explaining how your opinion differs.
