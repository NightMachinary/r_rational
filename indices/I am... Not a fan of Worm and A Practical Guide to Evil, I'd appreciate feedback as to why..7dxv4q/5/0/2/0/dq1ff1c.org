I don't really like it when people give downvotes without explaining why, because it doesn't really accomplish anything. So even though I personally didn't downvote you, I feel compelled to take a guess at why other people did.

I think the reason you're being downvoted is because your comment doesn't really help OP in any way. You basically just said "The things you like aren't good and your opinion is wrong".

What OP was looking for was an explaination for why he might not like Worm and APGTE that much or an explaination of why other people do like it. And you saying "Your taste is bad" is sort of an answer I suppose, but not a satisfying or helpful one since it's completely subjective.
