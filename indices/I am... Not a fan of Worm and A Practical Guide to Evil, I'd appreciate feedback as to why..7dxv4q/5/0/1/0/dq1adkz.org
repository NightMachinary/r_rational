[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Origin of Species]] is basically just Pokemon but rational. All about realistic Pokemon as creatures with special qualities, and the science behind why they would work the way they do, and why the world works the way it does.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]] is a Superman fanfic that is mostly written from the perspective of Lex Luthor; not only is it rational, but it's also (IMO) one of the best Superman stories ever written, and that includes the comics and movies. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]] is a Terminator fanfic that fully utilizes the time travel aspect of the original setting, and is similarly rational and fantastic. I mention both of these in the same paragraph because they were both written by [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]], and are basically classics of the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] genre.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/1/friendship-is-optimal/prologue-equestria-online][MLP: Friendship is Optimal]] is actually very good. It features one of the best representations of artificial intelligence in any rational fiction, and actually focuses somewhat on the "MLP is childish" idea. You don't have to be a fan of MLP to enjoy it (and, in fact, I'm not), and if anything the concepts shown in it are more interesting from the perspective of someone who isn't a fan.
