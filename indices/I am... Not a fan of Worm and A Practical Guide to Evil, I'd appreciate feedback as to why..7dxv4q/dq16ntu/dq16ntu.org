I have lots of thoughts on why, but I felt like if I put them out here initially it might stymy any feedback. People talk about Worm's emphasis on practical heroism, practical application of powers, stuff like that.

But I don't see it. What I see is extended middle school interactions between highly similar characters with cosmetic differences in place of real divergence. Repeatedly the Undersider members express or come to a resolution to do what needs to be done, but insist on either inefficient or erratic behaviour, justified by the moral compunctions they just foreswore, or by the adolescent and basically uninteresting extended arguments they get into.

A practical guide to evil seems to suffer from the same thing shadows of the limelight does, recursive narrative dependent worlds that lose sight of character development (here I am referring to both of them running into the same issue, creating world's where power is dependent on being genre savvy, and then having your characters do stuff like debate what will be genre savvy before they act). Sometimes it introduces new characters that are superficially distinct from the people we've seen so far (I'm thinking of the Tyrant), but it seems like every auxiliary character checks their actions and decptions against what the protagonist can deal with. Also there's really no evil to speak of, just modes of management with varying levels of effectiveness.

It's been a month or so since I read either of them, and my once cogent criticisms may have withered, but this is the gist of my issue with these guys.
