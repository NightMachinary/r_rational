I disagree pretty strongly with your characterization of Worm, but I /agree/ strongly with your criticisms of PGtE, especially in the more recent arcs. The overuse of this type of narrative device:

#+begin_quote
  creating world's where power is dependent on being genre savvy, and then having your characters do stuff like debate what will be genre savvy before they act
#+end_quote

has really started to bother me, and the story's focus on characters out-meta-ing each other has really taken it in a different direction from the first arc (which, despite some rather unoriginal plot elements, I actually enjoyed a lot).
