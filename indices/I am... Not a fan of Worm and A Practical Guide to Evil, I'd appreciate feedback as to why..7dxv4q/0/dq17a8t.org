Worm isn't really intended to be rational. The characters/protagonist are smart about some things, like power use and immediate problem solving, but not about other things like morality or introspection. Taylor is a very flawed person, and that's very much intended. I don't think anyone on this sub looks at her ruminations on the morality of what she's doing and goes "Yes, that's smart, that's the type of thinking everyone should have". It's a popular book on this sub because the world has fairly consistent rules, because it deconstructs or examines aspects of superhero fiction in a way that little else does, and because people win by thinking through things instead of via Deus ex Machina or because their powers are naturally stronger than others'.

Characters applying values differently to other people than to themselves is a recurring theme, and it's pretty realistic in that way. From a rationalist perspective, it's more of an examination of the biases people have and why they have them than how people can reject and overcome those biases.
