Worm's definitely in the category of novels that become a vastly more enjoyable once you realize the author is in on it.

A lot of Taylor's scenes take on deeper nuance and meaning once you realize that she is not always right or even rational, and that this is a deliberate choice made by the author.

I don't particularly think it matters whether Worm is "rational fiction" or not, because it is amazing and thematically rich fiction that explores humanity in ways that a lot of my favorite rational authors would not be able to.

Edit: [[/u/slinkinator]] if you're still having trouble, consider the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5yfs9d/weve_got_worm_podcast_episode_1_arc_1_gestation/?st=ja74s1v5&sh=73ec3102][We've Got Worm]] podcast, it does a /great/ job of recontextualizing a lot of interactions in the story and explaining in a really direct what this says about the characters, themes, etc of the work. Worm is an incredibly rich narrative work that goes out of its way to not present itself as such, and I think reading it only on the surface level is missing out.
