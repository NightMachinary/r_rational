There is a difference between rational fiction and rationalist fiction. Worm is, I think, considered to be something like the former, but nothing like the latter.

Specifically, Worm is very satisfying to people who like their stories to be... "closed-world automatons"? It's the quality that Tragedies have, and good Mysteries have: that the characters and the setting are /consistent/ in ways that let you predict a lot of what is going to happen. The characters might be irrational, but they're irrational in precise, predictable ways that let you ask yourself "what conclusion would a perfectly rational agent---but for [this known set of flaws]---draw in this situation" and end up coming up with the right answer as to what's going to happen.
