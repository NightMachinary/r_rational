  I don't recall her ever using excessive force for no good reason and escalating when a calmer, more peaceful solution would have worked.

The thing is, her definition of a "solution" is total victory over her enemies and accomplishing all of her goals without compromise. There are probably a lot of ways in which she could have done things without so much escalation.

For example, in the bank robbery, Taylor gets the Undersiders to change the plan to incorporate more direct confrontation, and she puts venomous spiders on everybody. She could have stuck with the original plan, or decided that it was too risky and backed out.

How many times does Taylor ever retreat? I can't remember any. Even her "arrest" and surrender happen on her own terms. Whether she's fighting against Endbringers or the S9, she keeps fighting until the threat is driven out of her city. The only way to accomplish this is to escalate.
