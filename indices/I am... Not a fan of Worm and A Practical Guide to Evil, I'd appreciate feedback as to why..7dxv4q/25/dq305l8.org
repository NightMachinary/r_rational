Huh. I've seen a lot of people talking about how Taylor escalated and her decisions weren't healthy. And maybe it's the rose colored glasses of nostalgia (it's been over two years since I read Worm in full) but I don't really understand why this is such a popular opinion.

As far as I can tell, Taylor made the sort of ruthless decisions she made because she had to. I don't recall her ever using excessive force for no good reason and escalating when a calmer, more peaceful solution would have worked.

However, it has been some time, and I've seen enough people talk about how she's mentally unstable (which she definitely is) and prone to escalation that I'm just curious; anyone want to give me a quick concise summary on why so many people regard Taylor's choices as irrational/too escalation filled?
