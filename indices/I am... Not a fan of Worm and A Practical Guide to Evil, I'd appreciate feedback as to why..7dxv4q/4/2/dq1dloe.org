I agree with pretty much every point you made. The meta story elements are probably the weakest bit of the story because they don't feel predictable (like the conclusion of book 2). Maybe if the rules of manipulating the meta-fiction setting were explained in more depth it would help it feel more like sufficiently understood magic. But as is, only really the rule of threes seems to be fully outlined and even that feels arbitrary concerning what is considered a win, loss, or draw.

I still like the story despite this, but that's probably my biggest complaint with it.

Also, I don't think it's fair to compare Worm using the term "villain" to Practical Guide having people call themselves Evil. In Worm it's explained that the system of Heroes and Villains isn't something that exactly sprung up naturally, but is rather a calculated thing to control public perception. And a lot of the Villains wouldn't actually call themselves villains either, like Kaiser and other people who are pushing an ideology.
