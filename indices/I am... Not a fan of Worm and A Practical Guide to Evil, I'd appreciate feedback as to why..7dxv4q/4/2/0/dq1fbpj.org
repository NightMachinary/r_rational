I don't know, I feel like the meta-fiction rules (and ways of exploiting them) have been fairly consistent, especially since the fae showed up. I can think of three times off the top of my head that someone has used an archetypal story to their advantage (spoilers follow for anyone who isn't caught up): [[#s][]]

My interpretation: Following an archetypal story is a path of least resistance. If you set up the right conditions for a story, the universe will facilitate that story playing out in a predictable manner. Therefore, it's useful to arrange a story whose archetypal outcome benefits you.
