Eh, it's not /consistently/ fun, the same way Practical Guide to Evil isn't, and in fact there's a bit less of the light hearted scenes, but Harry and his friends have a lot of amusing banter too, and Harry's flair for being irreverent to Big Bads and nerdy references is often a strong theme in the story, to me.
