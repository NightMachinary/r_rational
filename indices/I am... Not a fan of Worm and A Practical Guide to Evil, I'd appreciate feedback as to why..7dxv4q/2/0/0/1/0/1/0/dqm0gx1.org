I should clarify that it was more specifically Dresden himself who was giving me the vibes in the book I read. For example, he argued that the killer must be a woman because "women are better at hating than men", and he also had this benevolent sexism thing going on in his internal narration. I'm all for flawed protagonists but there was a kind of smugness in his attitudes about women that made me uncomfortable.
