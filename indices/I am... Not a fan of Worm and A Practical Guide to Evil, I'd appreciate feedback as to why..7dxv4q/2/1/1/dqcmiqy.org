Dude, it was a joyous scene. It was a plan coming together. It was pulling one over on the Lawful Good mind-rapers. I'm not really surprised that you wouldn't have enjoyed it, if you didn't enjoy what came up to it. Why would you expect to enjoy the celebration if you didn't like what was being celebrated?

They were forced to interact with her in the manner they did because she managed to set herself up as the narrative protagonist for that short period of time. She won because she was able to use a narrative structure to make herself 'the protagonist who gets resurrected'. Her later ploy with the Winter Court makes this entire concept much more explicit, but this isn't a thing you can just do with a whim and a prayer. You've got to play the part, fit the role.

Fundamentally, in PGTE, the more primeval a character is (barring demons), the more they must bend to narrative causality. There is nothing at all suspect about angels (second only to gods in narrative causal binding) being forced to act in certain ways in keeping with a narrative for no other reason than the narrative the character asserts demands it.

If that doesn't seem appealing to you, then yeah, I don't know what would make you enjoy the series.
