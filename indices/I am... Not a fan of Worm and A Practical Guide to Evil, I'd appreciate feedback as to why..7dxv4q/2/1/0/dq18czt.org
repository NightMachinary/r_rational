  So, I appreciate a lot of what you're saying, but it was really her POV mugging an angel that killed it for me. The author seemed to take too much joy in it, the scene was pretty bloated, and I couldn't reconcile all the previous descriptions of insanely powerful angels with her interaction with it. It seemed a little bit too lucky to me, and because every character is a Hero or a Villain with tons of potential and an empathetic backstory, it's harder to accept that the protagonist wins just because.

This was kind of set up a lot along the way. She has admitted a lot of times that she is not a good person, and is okay with that. She is willing to become a monster for the sake of the people of Callow. She didn't quite /get/ that until she was faced with the screaming voices of the heavens inside her *demanding* she regret what she did. Then she finds that she really doesn't, even if she should. She is a monster, heart and soul, and has done everything for a greater purpose which she does not regret. Angels are bound by stories, they are not..... creative. They do a thing and that's it. Contrition finds your sins and makes you contrite with them, but they can't really change you if they're not actually sins (at least to you), which is, admittedly, rather unique so far. Evil acknowledges they commit sins, that they are, in fact, Evil. Catherine proclaims herself a monster for a greater purpose, and that her sins and all the blood she has shed is worth it for the greater /good/.

The problem that's going to bite her now is the fact that, okay, she's a monster and she's been doing what's pragmatic not what's ethical for a while now. Has she accomplished anything? Has it been worth it? Saying it's for a greater cause is a great thing to say, but does it actually end up being for a greater cause? She now faces the Choir of Judgement, and is going to be faced with the fact that she hasn't really improved the quality of life of the people of Callow. She's going to face judgement incarnate with the blood of thousands on her hand and they're going to ask her "Was it worth it?"
