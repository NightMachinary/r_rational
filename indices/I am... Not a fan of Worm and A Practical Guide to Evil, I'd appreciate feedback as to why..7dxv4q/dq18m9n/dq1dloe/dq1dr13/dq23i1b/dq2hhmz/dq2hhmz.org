Short version: there's a lot of debates and frustration online about some aspects of Worm's worldbuilding that explain why capes work the way they do. Stuff like "The shards make the capes more likely to conflict", or "capes who just use their power for money are rare because the system is set up to create Heroes and Villains", or "Tony Stark isn't curing cancer because when he tries SIMURGH IN YOUR FACE", etc.

Without getting too much into details, it can be seen as clever worldbuilding justifying superhero tropes, or as annoying rules depriving characters of their agency.
