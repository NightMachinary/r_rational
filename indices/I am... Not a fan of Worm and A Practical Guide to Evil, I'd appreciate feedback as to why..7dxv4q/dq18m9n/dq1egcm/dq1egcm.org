  The meta story-telling is when a character goes "I'm a villain and he's a hero, that means he's going to win because stories!". I don't have much to say on that except I don't like it. It's another thing that drawn from Order of the Stick (Black is basically a cross between OotS' Tarquin and Darth Vader), and... I dunno, it's not very interesting to me. I'm not really a fan of 4th-wall breaking, unless it's used sparingly in comedies, so the whole idea of "We know we're in a story, so let's use strategies that will work because we're in a story" doesn't really appeal to me.

This isn't fourth-wall breaking. From the perspective of the characters in the story, the fact that the universe partly runs on tropes is as much a law of reality as physics. It's the author's perogative to set up the rules of the universe however they want, so long as they are consistent.

Like Philip K. Dick said, "reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." It doesn't matter how bullshit the rules may seem to the reader, they're the reality the characters have to deal with. If the characters said "that's really stupid" and tried to ignore the tropes, their actions would likely be highly sub-optimal. Remember, rationality is systemized winning.

In some ways these sorts of situations where the rules are unclear (and bullshit) can be more interesting than those where the rules can be systematically pinned down through rigorous experimentation and used to formulate complex solutions to problems. Making decisions from very limited information is a /really/ hard problem. As an analogy, contrast a hard science (e.g physics) with a soft science (e.g economics). Physicists may look down on economists, but in many ways the economists have the harder problem: there aren't any nice, neat mathematical models that almost perfectly descibe everything down to a ridiculous degree of precision. The best economists may be able to produce is a bunch of ad-hoc models that rely on dubious assumptions and frequently fail catastrophically, but that doesn't make their work any less valid or important.

My point is that being able to draw useful conclusions from limited information when the rules are messy and complex is an important skill, and more challenging to the characters than a world with "sensible" rules. Characters may not be able to come up with as complex or intelligent-looking solutions, but the solutions they manage to produce are that much harder earned. This can be less satisfying for readers, though (i.e. Sanderson's First Rule of Magic), and can enable the author to "cheat" by arbitrarily introducing solutions or challenges in a manner utterly opaque to the reader.
