Well I guess all I can say is that I disagree with you.

I don't believe something can be inherently good or bad. Especially when we're talking about entertainment value. It's not a fact that He-man isn't good. In fact your definitions are completely backwards.

"Fact: I enjoyed He-Man when I was young. Opinion: He-man isn't good" would be the correct way to say this. Your personal enjoyment of something is a fact. Any rating that you give to it is the opinion.

Sure you can argue by certain metrics certain things are good or bad, but you first have to define those metrics and not everyone is going to agree on what they should be.

For example someone might say "A game that runs at less than 60 fps is bad", but other people might say "As long as I have fun playing the game it doesn't matter what the frame rate is." The metrics that you're using to judge are just as subjective as your overall opinion of something. So unless you can get everyone in the world to agree to the same metrics as you, any assessment you make based on those metrics are still opinions.
