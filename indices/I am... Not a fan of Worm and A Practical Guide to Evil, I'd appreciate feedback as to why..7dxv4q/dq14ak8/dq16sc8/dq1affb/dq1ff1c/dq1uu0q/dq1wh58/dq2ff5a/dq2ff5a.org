I really don't want to address the "opinion vs. fact" thing ever again, but well, now we're doing it. It was tired and old in grade school, and it's even more worn now.

There are "opinions" and there are "beliefs". The two often get conflated. As you are doing so now. As as statement of fact: it is possible to take a work and say whether it is "good" or "bad". There may not be some universal metric, but any such claim can be judged by various metrics. Take something like... I dunno, /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126158/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]/. Fact: it isn't /good/. Opinion: I /enjoyed/ it when I was young.

When you say mature tastes /cannot/ be differentiated from immature tastes... you're just wrong. Probably because of a lack of experience.
