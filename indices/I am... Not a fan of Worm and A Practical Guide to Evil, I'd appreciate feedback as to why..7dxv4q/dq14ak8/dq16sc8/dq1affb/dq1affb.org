Okay, some of those are pretty terrible. "Branches on the Tree of Time"? Seriously? Not a very good story; I consider the time spent reading it to have been a waste. Good thing it was short.

"Mother of Learning" is certainly fun, but while I find it enjoyable and would recommend it to people with similar tastes, I would never hold it up as "exceptional". Like, I wouldn't nominate it for an award. Think of it this way: pick any of the Marvel movies. I like them, and would recommend them to fans in the target demographic, but they're not exactly Oscar material, and none of them are destined to be classics. In other words, not /exceptional/.
