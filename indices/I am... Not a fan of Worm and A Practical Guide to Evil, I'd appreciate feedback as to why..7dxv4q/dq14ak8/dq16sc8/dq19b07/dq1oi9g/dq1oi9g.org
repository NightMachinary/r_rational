I know I'm not.

Worm was bad in that regard, but there were enough down times that I made it through. Pact (also by Wildbow's) was much worse in that regard, and it got to the point where I stopped and couldn't continue. Reading it was just too stressful!

I've stopped (maybe permanently, not sure) with PGtE for the same reason.
