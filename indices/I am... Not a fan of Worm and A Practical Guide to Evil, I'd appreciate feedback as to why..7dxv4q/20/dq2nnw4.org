Speaking as someone who's a fan of Worm but ranges from to okay with to actively annoyed by Practical Guide I feel that both these stories have a common surface throughline but are highly divergent on a deeper level.

Both of them work very well as power fantasies. You have moderately clever young protagonists with a ruthless streak getting into fights with people who generally represent some ideology the reader is led to find either ineffectual and distateful and coming out on top because they're harder and smarter. Fights are constructed to feel like they have a layer of mechanics to them that the characters can exploit so they seem smarter and more calculating than they are. These are stories that are very good at getting an audience of disaffected and often geeky young people to root for the protagonist.

But on the deeper level things diverge. Worm is at it's core a character journey from the perspective of someone who is highly intelligent but weighed down by trauma and a biased perspective. She sees problems as simpler as they really are, and favours simple, violent solutions, but the world fails to bend to her expectations. Things are not that simple, the people she fights are people, and her violence and lone wolf attitude hurt herself as much as her enemies and don't do much good in the end. At the end of the day Worm is self aware of the fact that it's a power fantasy and delivers a story in which acting on the power fantasy only makes thing worse.

Practical Guide, by contrast, is much simpler and shallower. The authoritarian power fantasy is accepted as a truly effective way of dealing with the world. Catherine is on surface level has just as much depth as Taylor but her conception of the world as a place where might makes right solutions and hard man decisions can fix the world is validated. She solves all her problems with over the top violence and domination and things just kinda... work out for her and she doesn't have to deal with the negative consequences for those decisions.

Conflicts are far less ambiguous as well. Catherine always has a clear idea of who her friends and enemies are, people within her monkeysphere are deliberately written to be more likeable and three dimensional than those who are not, her adversaries are often either much worse or much less likeable and unlike Taylor for whom the less savoury aspects of her friends is a source of internal conflict Catherine just accepts them for the most part unless it directly affects her.

It also hides it's lack of moral introspection by clothing itself in deconstruction of stock fantasy, which seems impressive to people who see fantasy in terms of tropes and cliches and have more limited reference pools, but falls flat to people who have a deeper, more varied, and more literary understanding of the genre.

The messy part of it is that on a writing level Practical Guide is the more tightly written and effective story compared to Worm which is very uneven in it's pacing and storytelling. To sum up, I think that Worm is a story that's compelling because it indulges in the power fantasies people crave while at the same time examining them, whereas Practical guide is enjoyable to people because it distills the elements that make Worm appealing and gets rid of the parts that make Worm less comforting to the reader.
