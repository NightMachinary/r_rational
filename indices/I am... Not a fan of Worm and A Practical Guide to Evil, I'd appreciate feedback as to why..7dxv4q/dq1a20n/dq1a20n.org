I can't speak for A Practical Guide to Evil, but a big part of Worm is that the protagonist is biased and is not socially healthy. It's considered rational because the world-building is a more realistic look at superhero tropes and how they might come about, things don't happen for no reason, and the characters all make sense as people and do their best to solve problems like an intelligent person. But if you compare it to explicitly rational fiction, there's a big lack of scientific methodology and it doesn't do a good job of teaching rationalism, not to mention how the main character is clearly biased against authority. So you can definitely make a case for it not being rational; something being compelling is more a personal thing, and without knowing more about your tastes we can't really guess why. It also might help to know where you stopped reading, because there /is/ a quality drop later that a lot of people stopped at.

TLDR: Don't look at Worm as a rational fic, I would say that it isn't. It's a constant roller-coaster with no brakes, some people just don't like that.
