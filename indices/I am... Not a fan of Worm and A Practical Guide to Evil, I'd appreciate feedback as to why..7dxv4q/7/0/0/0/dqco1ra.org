Oh hey, do I recognize you from [[/r/wormfanfic]]?

I would challenge the S9 being evil for the sake of evil. Jack has skewed motivations to leave a mark on the world. He brainwashes and shard-manipulates members into following his plans, though most of their motivations can be similarly explored, especially when shard-induced behaviors are taken into account. They are no more inexplicable or unbelievable than real world school shooters, terrorists, and unethical scientists.

I very much disagree with your rationale for disqualifying PGTE. Good and Evil are fixtures of the world, and do not (as has been remarked upon many times) strictly correspond to our moral ideas of them. Good is known for mind-raping cities into perfect utilitarians, and Evil is now creating public schooling and freeing its once-slaves. It's much more of a Lawful vs Chaotic ideation, as Black and others have discussed (though they may not be the most unbiased sources). Even if it were more strictly good and evil, the characters still very much are driven by their beliefs and values, perhaps even moreso on the side of Evil than Good, though, this is again a lampshaded concept within the world. This is like saying Eliezer's /Sword of Good/ isn't Rational for the same reason.

The Regent example is meh. They're in a war-torn feudalistic city. Finding cars more reliable than powers is of non-negligible difficulty, and certainly isn't a strong point in your favor, even if it could be argued. Plus, intimidation has non-zero value, and this is definitely that.

It is true that the consistent rules in both are revealed in an ongoing fashion, but frankly, there are simply too many to be easily info-dumped near the beginning for our benefit. The general premises of each were established early on, and in Worm, they come as important spoilers later, and in PGTE, they are not known to the perspective character any more than to us.

While I will agree that more foreshadowing could be done in either case (Brandon Sanderson comes to mind), it's still well above average, and well above the standard for what gets characterized and labelled as rational fiction on this subreddit and elsewhere on the internet.
