  Oh hey, do I recognize you from [[/r/wormfanfic]]?
#+end_quote

Hell yes, you do, I can't get enough of Worm, which is why I'm talking about it on the internet on a Saturday night lol.

  Jack has skewed motivations to leave a mark on the world.
#+end_quote

Even the most cliched villain almost always has some motivations or past trauma that made him "evil." If the bar for being "evil" (as opposed to being driven by a core belief) is that low, then virtually all villains would meet this standard. Sauron had his reasons for doing what he did, and so did the Green Goblin. I still wouldn't classify those aspects of LoTR and Spiderman as "Rational" in the way we use it in this sub. I can't even think of a story where the villain is evil for no reason at all. Even Marvel's Thanos wants to destroy all life because he wants to impress the avatar/goddess of death.

I think that a better example of a Rational explanation for evil behavior would be the Entities. They are destroying the Earth as part of a science experiment in an attempt to reverse entropy and stop the heat death of the universe, a noble goal for any Rationalist that even HPJEV would approve of. [Side note: what I really love about that aspect of them, is that it takes this idea of utilitarianism and the question of, "what /isn't/ justified to avert an existential threat?" to the absolute extreme, because the Entities are just doing what Cauldron is doing, but on a broader scale, just as Cauldron is doing what Taylor is doing, but on a broader scale.]

I do agree with you about the rest of the S9 having a Rational explanation for their evilness, but the Rationality of "An evil character made them" as a motivation, IMO, depends entirely on the Rationality of the evil character's motivations, and here, Jack's aren't particularly Rational.

  They are no more inexplicable or unbelievable than real world school shooters, terrorists, and unethical scientists.
#+end_quote

Hmm.. I thought a while about this because it's a really good point. I think that in a piece of Rational Fiction, a school shooter or a terrorist would be a poor choice for an antagonist. Think of it this way, if Jack were the main antagonist for all of Worm, wouldn't that make it less of a Rational work? Rational Fiction is different from other fiction, in that characters have motivations other than being evil for evil's sake. Just because some people /are/ in fact evil for evil's sake doesn't mean that they should feature in a Rational work.

And not to get too lawyerly on you, but the language I was addressing says, "Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil". Jack is defined by, and driven into conflict by, his value of being evil, which is not meaningfully different from just being evil. I don't know if I would go as far as claiming that characters like Jack or a terrorist have no place in Rational Fiction, but it was an example of a part of Worm that didn't abide by that "rule."

  Good and Evil are fixtures of the world
#+end_quote

This point convinced me. I was going to say that they choose to go out of their way to be Good or Evil for the sake of being Good or Evil, but in their world, reality works in such a way that that behavior makes the most sense, since acting Good or Evil beneficial.

I haven't read /Sword of Good/, so I don't know the reference.

  The Regent example is meh.
#+end_quote

I used that example because it stuck out to me as an example of the author just looking for an excuse to use the new power (of course, as I write this, it occurs to me that Regent would probably also look for such an excuse), rather than the characters just doing what makes the most sense. If their car breaks down, they can make a glass-door-float then. And I'm not sure that a handful of people all trying to balance on a floating door is that intimidating. They could just stride down the street surrounded by a hurricane of glass if they wanted to go that route.

I agree with your remaining points.

#+begin_quote
  well above the standard for what gets characterized and labelled as rational fiction on this subreddit and elsewhere on the internet.
#+end_quote

I haven't read a ton of what gets posted here, so I may have been too literal in my application of the definition.
