Lol that's not how I would phrase it exactly, but you've got the basics. I agree that from our view, doing science might seem more productive than fighting, but keep in mind that these creatures are utterly alien to us because they evolved in totally different circumstances and think in different ways. They're obviously extremely advanced, and it seems likely that most of their advancement was centered around conflict, so that's what they consider to be the best way to get new ideas and technology. They would probably scoff at the idea of doing science to make progress as much as you do at the idea of punching each other. They certainly don't have any reason to be interested in humans improving their quality of life. Humans are like little processors to them. They have enough self-awareness to realize that their minds are probably not capable of finding the solution, but not enough to realize that conflict may not be the most efficient way for all species to maximize innovation. Their logic isn't completely horrible, though, because it is true that war tends to lead to technological advancement, and they're careful to not let anyone get too destructive to the point of interfering with the overall experiment. Not only that, they probably tried lots of different strategies on various planets, and determined that conflict was the optimal path to getting the most useful information.

I disagree that the conflict with the entities is diabolous ex machina, and I also think it's more productive to interpret Worm through the proper lens. I think that the purpose of Worm is to take the crazy, irrational, often silly world of superheroes and comic book villains, and come up with the most realistic explanation that could justify all of that existing, and I think it does a great job at that. How would you suggest changing the story to fix the flaws you see in it, without altering the essential aspects of the setting? In other words, if you change the story so that the entities are peaceful and people aren't going around using superpowers to stop crime and fight each other, it's not really a superhero story anymore, and you've totally changed the story to something completely different, and neatly sidestepped the problem of writing a realistic, mostly rational story that incorporates all of the traditional elements of the superhero genre. If you think he failed at writing a rational story in which all these elements can reasonably exist, but you can't think of a better way to accomplish that, then maybe your point should be that the superhero genre is inherently irrational, rather than that the author failed at writing a (mostly) rational story.
