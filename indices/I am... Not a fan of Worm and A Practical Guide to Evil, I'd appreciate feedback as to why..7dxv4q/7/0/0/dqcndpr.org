I agree that neither story is Rational/ist/ at all. I said that neither story is /strictly/ Rational Fiction. I would say that for a story to be strictly Rational Fiction, it should never or almost never break any of the rules of Rational Fiction.

According to the sidebar definition, I would say that Worm is mostly Rational Fiction, and PGTE is somewhat Rational Fiction.

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

Worm and PGTE follow this rule for the most part.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

Again, Worm follows this for the most part (e.g., the S9).

On the other hand, in PGTE, being "Good" or "Evil" is an explicit motivation for almost all of the characters and factions, with the Black Knight and the Dread Empress and the MC being the notable exceptions. Since there are good in-story reasons for this, I can see how it could fit within this rule. But still, it's even more overt than LoTR, and I can't think of another story where so many characters base their actions on their identity as Good or Evil, so I wouldn't say that PGTE is strictly Rational.

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

Both fics follow this rule, with very few exceptions (e.g., in Worm, after Regent takes control of Shatterbird, he uses her power to transport their team on top of a door with glass shards embedded in it, because if they just took a car, it might break down. I guess powers influence users to use them, but it would probably still be better just to drive).

- The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

I'm not sure exactly how to apply this rule, since in both stories, the reader becomes aware of new rules well into the story, but those rules aren't ever inconsistent with what happened before (e.g., second trigger events).

What do you think?
