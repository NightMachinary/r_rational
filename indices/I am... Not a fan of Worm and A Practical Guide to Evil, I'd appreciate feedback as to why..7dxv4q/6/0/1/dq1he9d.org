/Not relevant to larger thread discussion/

I had a response here that I deleted after I read all the other responses.

With regards to your point - I can see how it could seem like I was trying to set up a straw man for me to knock down. Totally get it. Not what I was aiming for, though. I was trying to clarify what areas were those he found unenjoyable, so I could talk about the reasons I either did or did not enjoy those specific points, instead of writing all my thoughts on the works in general.

Given that others in this thread managed to clarify that point through discussion of what they thought, I concede that my question was not the best way to go about answering OP's question. Especially since, upon reflection and reading of other comments, OP didn't seem sure of his own reasons and was looking for us to help clarify his own thoughts.
