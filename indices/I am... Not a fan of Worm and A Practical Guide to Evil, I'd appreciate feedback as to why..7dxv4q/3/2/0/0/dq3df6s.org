  Oh shit, the story tropes got her!

That's exactly what was worrying me about it! Recently she's been relying on story tropes to play the system - which works OK in Arcadia, where all the fae are literally bound by tropes - but not so much in Creation, where the tropes always end with the villains losing. Granted she's fighting fae now, and another villain later... but if she keeps relying on narrative to see her through, she's screwed when she goes up against heroes again.

Hoping that as of today's chapter, Winter's influence on her will be significantly lessened or ended, and she'll stop making these kinds of choices in future conflicts.
