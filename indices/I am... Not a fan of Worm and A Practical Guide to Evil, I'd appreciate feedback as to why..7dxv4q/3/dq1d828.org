With the Practical guide to evil, I'm starting to sour on it.

Mainly because I found the Calamities compelling in the way that they hacked the story conventions and worked around them.

With them, it always seemed very careful and discussed and tactical. They seemed like focused adults who very well knew that they were pushing against the forces of all creation.

As the story has gone on... Cat has become more powerful, but also much more cavalier. The Calamities had to overcome other people's plot armor which they did through careful study and planning.. In book 3, Cat seems to have her own plot armor.

I remember in one of the recent ones, Cat purposefully surprised Masego during the middle of a supposedly critical combat. That took me totally out of the story as she wasn't treating it as "we are one mistake away from total catastrophe." instead it seemed like "I trust my plot armor to protect me from pulling stupid stuff in a critical battle."

It took me out of it a lot.
