I read a good chunk of Worm, probably over half. It wasn't /bad/, it explored a superhero world with some depth to it. But it didn't wow me, and eventually the grimdark level exceeded my tolerances (specifically, [[#s][when]]).

It has explorations of interesting concepts. But I don't see what I can learn for my own life [[#s][from]] except "don't do that."

As a "world of superheroes" story, I prefer Doc Future. It really tries to tackle the question of "Why wouldn't this person use X power to do Y?" and IMO it does a good job.
