The way I'm picturing it is a high-bandwidth channel of pushing pure concepts into your head directly.

It becomes difficult to understand the point exactly when it's translated into low-bandwidth written English but as an actual communication method I could imagine it just making intuitive sense, with the intended message emerging in much the same way as you sometimes "just know" something during a dream.
