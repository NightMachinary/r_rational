Have been thinking further about this, and our written languages are really just a means of transcribing the noises we make at each other, with spoken language itself being a crude affair where we take an abstract and nuanced concept then force it through a lossy and limited little information channel of "flapping our [[http://www.terrybisson.com/page6/page6.html][meat]] at each other" in a desperate attempt to convey enough of the relevant details of the concept that a listener can reconstruct the idea inside their own head out of their own thought-stuff. But along the way we lose encoded connotations and associations (and pick up unintended new ones) and introduce all sorts of ambiguity by virtue of not having a word for every conceivable thought and feeling.

So when we try to voice the welcoming familiarity of a warm summer's day at your childhood home with the family, tinged with the subtle sadness of returning home to find it not quite the way you remembered it, the knowledge that your parents won't live forever, and the slowly growing responsibility to take care of them (I'm not sure precisely why this was my first go-to for a thought with a lot of little nuances attached but I'm running with it)... well our best option is to describe it with clumsy words and hope we have enough shared reference with the other person that they say "Oh yeah", and imagine /their/ home and build that whole dense web of emotions anew, but there's no guarantee that they actually feel the same way, and no way to check, and limited ability to articulate the differences.

Long story short, I am /not surprised/ that Andalite has the potential to be a faster means of communication.
