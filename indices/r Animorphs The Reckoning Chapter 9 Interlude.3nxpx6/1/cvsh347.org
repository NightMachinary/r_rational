I was on a bit of a rational fic binge a few months back and I read the first few chapters of Animorphs: The Reckoning. I was really excited about seeing one of my favorite book series done in a style I had just started being exposed to. I initially wasn't a huge fan but read it anyway and I'm very glad I did.

The author has done a great job varying his writing style, especially in the last few chapters, and I love his Marco and his Jake. I'm really interested to see how things go with Ax, considering the major shift from canon we got from Elfangor.

I loved the lizard and fly morph scenes. It was very reminiscent of the canon scenes where the Animorphs experienced a new morph for the first time.

Really glad to see that you've seemed to hit your stride and really excited for all that comes next!
