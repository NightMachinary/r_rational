I really don't see what incentive Tom has to accept this vow. Harry already gave him all relevant knowledge of the future, and he can adjust his plans accordingly. Harry's own memories show that he is a terrible student, so his help isn't worth enough to throw away entire promising fields of research.

If Harry is hiding more future knowledge as a bargaining chip, no worries, that's what Legilimency is for. If Tom isn't a Legilimens yet, a surprise /expelliarmus/ and silencing charm will make it easy to have the basilisk petrify Harry until Tom learns.

He can always accept the vow later, if it turns out to be a good idea. But I can't think of why it would.
