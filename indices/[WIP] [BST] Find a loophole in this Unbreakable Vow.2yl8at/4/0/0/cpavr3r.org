If torture works, then do you have to objectively be killing someone? Or can you be fooled into thinking that you're torturing someone (you're confunded, the other person is a simulacrum, &c) in order to get the same effect?

Of course, you probably wouldn't want a society of immortals who are all willing to torture people for immortality even if they hadn't actually tortured anyone. So it might be good for Tom, but Harry wouldn't like it.

It'd be fun if Tom came up with that line of research and Harry only found out about it somewhere down the line.

"WHAT DID YOU DO?"

"Well, I didn't /kill/ anybody, for starters."
