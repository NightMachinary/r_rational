I don't know if you're looking for canon-thumpy comments, but I don't think that Item 3 would actually work.

What evidence we have on the subject (elaboration available upon request), as well as thematic consistency, suggests that it's not the /act of killing/ that allows the horcrux to be created but the /magnitude of evil/ that a murder is: evil acts damage the soul, and murder most foul is the only act evil enough to tear it so that a piece can be bound to an object. The upshot of this is would be that if the act of killing is not sufficiently evil (e.g., self-defense, mercy killing, accident), then the horcrux wouldn't take.

This means that if Harry consents to be killed and will die soon anyway, is that evil enough to count? Considering that that's almost exactly what Snape did to Dumbledore, I don't think so.
