Harry is not yet the old and wise lorekeeper. That'd be Lysander Scamander, from further down the timeline, who may also frown on what Harry's done here.

Perhaps instead of the mutual estimate, Tom simply has full permission to kill Harry whenever he thinks that it's necessary, unless he has acquired some other means of immortality. It's a little more weighted in Tom's favor, but there's still an incentive to not kill Harry until it's absolutely necessary.

Otherwise (as Tom would reason it out), you run the risk of the two of them being in a situation where they can't communicate.
