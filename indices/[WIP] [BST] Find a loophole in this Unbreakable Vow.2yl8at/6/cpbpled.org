Is Harry going to be an old and wise lorekeeper or a very smart version of himself?

You need him to be at least one of those, or Tom has no reason to believe he will find an alternative means of immortality.

Also, I would suggest that Tom might insist on changing

#+begin_quote
  If Harry has reason to think that his death is imminent, then he has to give permission to Tom to kill him. With this clause, Tom gets at least one horcrux, so he's no worse off than if he didn't take the Vow (again, the pensieve memories suggest that multiple horcruxes may not be worth what they cost)
#+end_quote

to

"If Harry fails to make Tom immortal by (arbitrary time-limit), or by the time they mutually estimate a greater than 1/3 probability that Harry will die soon then Tom gets to use him to make a horcrux."

Otherwise the chance of Harry dying unexpectedly without a chance for horcruxing is too great for this to be in Tom's interests.
