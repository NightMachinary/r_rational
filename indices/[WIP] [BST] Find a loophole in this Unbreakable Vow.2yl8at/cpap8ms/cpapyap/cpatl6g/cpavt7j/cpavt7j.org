I'm trying to figure out how much a threat he would consider that. Certainly some of a threat.

[[/u/clawclawbite][u/clawclawbite]] mentioned the possibility of Tom torturing people in order to get Harry to give him general permission (it'd be tricky, but I think that loophole is there, especially since I don't think Harry would have made the Vow /quite/ tight enough to disallow it).

With that in mind, do you think that Tom might take the Vow just to make himself seem like less of a threat, knowing that he can later force Harry to remove the restrictions later on?
