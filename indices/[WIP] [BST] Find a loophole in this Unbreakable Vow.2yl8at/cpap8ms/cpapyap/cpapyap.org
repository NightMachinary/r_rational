It's in exchange for Harry helping Tom. If he takes the Vow, then he has something that he wouldn't otherwise: A person that he can trust to help him in his search for immortality. If six horcruxes didn't do the job, then just one may not be helpful either (although simply trying to do a different horcrux is still a possible route).

Harry messed up by already admitting that he outright doesn't want to kill Tom and that it would be difficult for him to do so. It would have been much better for him to play at having a different reason, and then threaten to kill Tom if no Vow were made.
