The biggest problem that Tom has is that, while his situation is okay /now/, Harry could very easily make life difficult for him. And if Harry is harmed in some way then there's another person in their group who knows just as much as Harry does.

Harry has not spelled this all out, but both of them know it already. Tom should probably take that under consideration as well.

I wonder how the conversation might go if Tom tried to argue some of those points.

"What if I have to kill some people to save many more people?"

"Riiiight. Give me an example."

"Well, what if I decide to take over St. Mungo's?"

"Take over?"

"Right. Bad choice of words. But you know what I mean."

"Yeah. And... You, working at the hospital? Really?"

"Hey, you just said to give an example, alright?"
