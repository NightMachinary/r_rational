Heh. By far the safest option would be just waiting until they died. The oldest of them, Lysander, is /quite/ old, so he'll die inside of a couple of decades at the latest. Trying to confront him, otoh, is far riskier: he's about a century into Harry's future, so he's not only had a very long time to learn things, but has been able to learn spells that hadn't even been conceived of in Tom's era.

I don't think Harry's realized what Lysander represents, but Tom's a little more paranoid (it helps, too, that Harry knew Lysander's mother, Luna, and it's easy to forget how little that might mean)
