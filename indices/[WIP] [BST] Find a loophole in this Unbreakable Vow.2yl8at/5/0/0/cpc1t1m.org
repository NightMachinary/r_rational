  The biggest problem that Tom has is that, while his situation is okay now, Harry could very easily make life difficult for him. And if Harry is harmed in some way then there's another person in their group who knows just as much as Harry does.

The more I think about it, the more inclined I am to think that Tom would try to be a sneaky bastard and not take the Vow. Perhaps by confunding Harry into believing that Tom had actually made the Vow, and then finding Harry's confederates and eliminating them all.
