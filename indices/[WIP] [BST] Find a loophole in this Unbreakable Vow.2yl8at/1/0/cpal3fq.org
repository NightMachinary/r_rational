Hm. That's possible.

I'll have to sneak back into Harry's head and see if that's a thing that he would do.

Right now he's pretty stringently against letting anybody die for any reason at all (which is why he took the risk of making this offer, because he doesn't want to kill /anyone/) but it's plausible that he might see one of the above as being okay. I'll have to think about it.
