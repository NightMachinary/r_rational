I found a loophole.

Is Harry actually strong enough to overpower this Tom Riddle? An actually sane one? Because if he isn't, Tom's response is /Avada Kedavra/. Or perhaps just Stupify, followed by mindrape to get all the future information out, followed by /Avada Kedavra/.

Because really, as stated, he has pretty much all of the information a Canon Harry is useful for. Canon Harry is an idiot who only wins because of plot, and because Voldemort was insane.

Also, the defining factor is that Tom cannot take an act with the /intention/ to cause a death. That's an easy one to get around. His actions are intended to create a Horcrux, not to cause a death. The Death is incidental, but not the intention of the action.

If that doesn't work, /Confund/ yourself first so that you are literally incapable of intending to cause death.

3 is useless as well for Tom, since it only works in situations where Harry does not die instantly or otherwise too fast to cancel the vow.

2 is useless because aside from future knowledge (which can be gotten through Legilimency) Harry is not any help on that score.

Tom Riddle would not take this deal without some actual benefit. Unless he is being forced to at wandpoint, with death being the other choice.

And if Harry /could/ kill him, he probably /should/ anyway regardless. The chance of semi-redeeming Riddle is not worth the risk of all of the deaths he causes. This is Killing Hitler Time Travel issue.
