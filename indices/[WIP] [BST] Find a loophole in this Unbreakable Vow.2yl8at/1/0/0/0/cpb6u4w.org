Ahaha.

Yeah.

Even better: Somebody from downstream (Lysander Scamander) told him that in the mid-21st century, the Statute comes crashing down. There's a bad, /bad/ war.

Right now, everyone's in 1904. Lysander's idea, having /lived through the war/, is to break the Statute /now/ because he thinks that both that and the war are inevitable, so let's have it happen when the muggles don't have nukes and even worse things, and magic is also a /little/ less fantastically dangerous (a few less spells, &c).

Harry, on the other hand, wants to try to find some way to just protect the Statute forever. "Let's just, like, not make the mistakes that were made in the original timeline, right?"

Harry is just too tired of people dying. He's going to have to learn, though, that sometimes the best you can do is minimize the death toll.
