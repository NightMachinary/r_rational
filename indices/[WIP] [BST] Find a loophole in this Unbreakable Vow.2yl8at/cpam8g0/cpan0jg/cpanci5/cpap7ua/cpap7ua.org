Dang it, Harry! /What did you do?/

Blackmail isn't going to work either. There are a few other people who have been displaced in time along with Tom and Harry, but only one of them also knows who Tom is. Most of the others are going to be useless here even if they knew, so the game isn't changed if Harry tells them about Tom's past.

And Harry isn't going to tell the world at large, because the one thing that everyone has managed to agree on is that they need to hold the cards close to their collective chest until they figure out how this time junk happened in the first place.
