Harry only gave Tom certain memories, specifically memories of Voldemort. Especially the ones which emphasize Voldemort's crappy decision-making and various failures.

So Tom doesn't know that Harry was Worst Student Ever.

(Too bad Hermione's not here. Though, Hermione may not have gone with this plan in the first place, so...)

At this point, Tom knows very little about Harry's qualifications except that Harry was an accomplished auror before this time kerfuffle, and that Harry killed Tom's future self /as a teenager/.

That said, this is not Harry's first questionable decision. I'm pretty "let's not kill people, especially just for things they /might/ do" myself, but even so I'd have a hard time justifying what Harry's done.
