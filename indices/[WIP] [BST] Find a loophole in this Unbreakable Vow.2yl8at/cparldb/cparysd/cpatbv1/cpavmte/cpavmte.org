Actually, a flaw that I see in the Vow in that "you can't indirectly kill someone" is that it seems to need a target.

Tom can't do X in order to cause Y's death.

But I think that Tom could be permitted to torture people in order to get permission to kill people /in general/. It may not allow him to kill people he wanted to kill before he got permission, but anyone else? It might work.
