"intent" is slippery. People already rationalize a great deal and lie to themselves about their true reasons and intents.

Not sure what the Vow uses, but I don't think it's a stretch to say "I got this lovely weaponized smallpox from a secret Russian military base and wanted to see what its effects were on the nervous system because it'll help me analyze degradation from aging [insert other rationalization here] OOPS it's out of control murdering 90% of the entire population of the world."
