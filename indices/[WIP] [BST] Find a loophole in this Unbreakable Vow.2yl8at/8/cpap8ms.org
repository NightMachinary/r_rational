I'm confused. What reason would Tom have to take a vow exactly? Vows tend to not make you more likely to succeed in your utility function seeing as they usually reduce your options.

Of course it could be in exchange for mentoring Tom, or not killing Tom. At any rate it seems like harry has enough leverage here to not need to adhere to Tom's utility function.
