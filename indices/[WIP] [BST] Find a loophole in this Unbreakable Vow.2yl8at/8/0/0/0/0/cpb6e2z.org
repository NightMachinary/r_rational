I think Tom would have little respect for anyone who admits to not having the will to eliminate a threat to their own interests. That being the case, I suspect that Tom would start working on getting rid of Harry in the most final way possible. He might be willing to take the Vow, thoroughly obliviate Harry when he let his guard down, confund Harry, then tell him to give him permission to kill everyone.

Of course, I'd be more inclined to believe Tom to be too arrogant to take Harry seriously enough even for that.
