  If Harry has reason to think that his death is imminent, then he has to give permission to Tom to kill him. With this clause, Tom gets at least one horcrux, so he's no worse off than if he didn't take the Vow

Unless I'm missing something, this is not true. In a world with insta-death spells like Avada Kedavra, it's very easy to go from thinking that you're perfectly healthy and then dying, which means that Tom cannot make a Horcrux. Tom is then left unable to kill anyone, a severe limitation on his abilities, and lacks Harry's help finding immortality.

Tom being unable to kill doesn't even just prevent him doing evil, it also limits his ability to effectively defend himself. And, depending on how the vow is interpreted, it may prevent him doing things like take a position of power or of responsibility in a hospital, where you are required to make decisions which will lead to deaths in order to reduce total deaths.

Besides, Harry clearly doesn't intend to die for a while. What if Tom is killed in the meantime? Securing his immortality seems an important priority, and waiting for Harry to near death is a massive risk. Alternately, Tom's Horcrux may be destroyed and he'll need a replacement.

Is Tom being given an incentive to make this vow beyond Harry's help? Because this seems a massive curtailing of his abilities for little benefit otherwise
