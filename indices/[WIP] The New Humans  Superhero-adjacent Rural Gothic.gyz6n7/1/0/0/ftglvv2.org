Also, I'd argue that the story also has a number of transhuman (posthuman?) themes and motifs. I'm very interested in the "lived experience" of beings with nonhuman capabilities and perspective, a bit like mild xenofiction.

For anyone who's familar, Alan Moore's /Miracleman/ is a bit of an influence, to put it lightly. Fun fact, that comic basically invented /Luminosity/'s ending about twenty odd years early.
