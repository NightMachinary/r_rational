Hi, author here. So, I didn't really write /The New Humans/ as rational fiction per sae, but me and my team did try to approach the world building and characters thoughtfully.

So, a summary, /New Humans/ is basically a 1960s period piece examining the nature of cults cult and children's psychology through the lense of the superpower genre, against the backdrop of a Cold War ended by a Superman like figure called "The Flying Man." I'd say "superhero" genre but none of the main characters actually qualify as superheroes, not yet at least.

Tldr: /X-Men/, but it's a cult. Also Australian.

Just a warning, the story does start as a bit of a slow burn, and some of the earlier chapters are way too long.

Am interested in any and all input.
