In this particular case, I'd look at a number of possible approaches.

A classic one is that there's some new factor which appears, and the protagonist is just the one who rides the wave of change. It might be as esoteric as aliens turning up; it might be as prosaic as the Golds expanding their territory just a tiny bit too much to be able to hold onto it with their usual methods. Or it might be that a Red stumbles on something which changes their status (directly or indirectly).

Another one is that the protagonist effectively rides a short-circuit of changes which have been building up since before they came on the scene. If there have been secret groups of people looking to overthrow the Golds, for example, then the protagonist potentially has access to resources which aren't necessarily obvious just from looking at the surface of the society.

Some of it can be made more plausible by having it be logical outcomes of other people's plans. Perhaps there's a Gold who wants to disrupt society in some way to gain an enormous amount more personal power, and a deliberate aspect of that is giving the protagonist (and possibly others) access to things they wouldn't normally have, or arranging a string of what looks like strokes of luck. The story can be expanded in the second and third act by revealing this. Perhaps they want the protagonist (or several people) in a particular position, or perhaps they're going to use them as a scapegoat, or as a rallying point, or a false flag, or something of that nature.

A variant, combining the puppet-master and the unlikely opportunity, is there being a super-scientist who has the absolute latest in super-gene-editing tech or similar, and for some reason wants to stick it to the Golds, so they pick a Red and use it on them. Or maybe the Red is just a random experimental subject. Or gets lumped with the tech through some mishap.

There can also be aspects of the protagonist's "luck" being due to the way society is actually set up. If they get Gold-level access to things, for example, then perhaps all non-Gold people will refuse to believe the protagonist is not a Gold, because they've been raised/brainwashed into obeying all Golds absolutely. Or maybe the computer systems have no protections against a 'false' Gold, because there's been no need for such protections for centuries.
