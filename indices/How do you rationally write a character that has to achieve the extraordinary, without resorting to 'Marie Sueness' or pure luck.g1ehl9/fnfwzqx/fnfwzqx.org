I think you're depicting a mistaken account of what a Mary Sue is. A Mary Sue is what occurs when the reader gets annoyed at the character and author because the narrative is clearly pushing an agenda that the reader feels is annoyingly self congratulatory or fanning the author's ego in some way.

The "[[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-einstein-humiliates-professor/][Albert Einstein Humiliates an Atheist Professor]]" meme is a Mary Sue. What you'll notice is that although the author wishes to portray the protagonist as exemplary, in reality there actually are /no/ exemplary characters in the story. Nobody in the story is admirable- the whole thing is mocked because of the clear wish-fulfillment agenda of the author.

Writing a truly exemplary character - a character we /actually/ aspire to be ... rather than just someone the author /wishes/ people would look up to - would make your story truly exemplary.

And of course, one person's exemplar can be another person's Mary Sue - often happens when the reader and the author do not share a worldview and value system.
