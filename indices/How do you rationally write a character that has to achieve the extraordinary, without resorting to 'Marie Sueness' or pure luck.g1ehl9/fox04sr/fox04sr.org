It's probably just because I'm already thinking about it but the talk about the history of the Necrons in Terror and Peace Among the Stars comes to mind for a species wide scale. It discusses what would be necessary to do such a thing, progression fiction is often about the technological advance of a minor civilization to gain victory over a more advanced foe but almost never think about what that entails in a meaningful way, this story has the interesting perspective of a member looking back over what brought them here, how one can accomplish everything one set out to do perfectly yet end up so wrong. The previous one is good too(different focus, not nessesary to read for the sequel), it starts mentioning how the MC had attempted this many times before and implying that this current story is being told because it turned out differently justifying a degree of good luck.
