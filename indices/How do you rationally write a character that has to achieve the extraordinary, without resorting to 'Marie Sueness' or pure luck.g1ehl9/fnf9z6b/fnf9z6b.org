  They are not only considered the most superior- they actually are

Then a story about beating them is a story that demonstrates how this premise is wrong, right?

Knowing nothing else about the setting, here are some ways it might be:

- Superiority isn't a total ordering. Superiority along one measure doesn't imply superiority along another. The measures that have historically been the most important for comparison might not be in the presence of big changes.

- Even if the individuals are better in every way that matters, their society might not be. Maybe their norms push them to squander their potential.

- A caste isn't a monolith. Not all members are necessarily working toward continuing their dominance. Maybe they take it for granted. Maybe their attention is directed toward winning zero-sum games amongst themselves.

- Homogeneity is a structural weakness. If your nation grows crops that are all the same species, your food supply is brittle. Anything affecting that particular crop - weather conditions, pests, illness - will have outsized effects on your food supply. A society strictly ruled by a homogeneous ideology should have similar problems.

- Being better /on average/ doesn't mean every one of these is better than every one of those. If the group with the lower average has higher variance, they will still be well represented among the tails. The top percentile of Xs can be almost all red even if most reds are worse than most golds at X. Maybe nobody invests in training reds because their rigid hierarchy rewards average outcomes more than peak outcomes.
