  On a mission to topple the entire galaxy-spanning social order that's been enforced for centuries by vastly superior and almost godly beings

There's your problem. You don't do that. That's doomed to being a bad story. Doing it on one planet is hard enough, but a hundred billion planets each with their own variations of that society, which has proven itself improbably successful in the first place so it can't have any "collapse social order" buttons lying around or someone else will already have slammed them already? You're going to die. Even if you're a combination of Paul Muad-dib and the Mule, no. If you're one of the underclass, double-no.
