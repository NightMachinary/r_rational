Yeah. Some luck is fine. Encouraged, even. It just has to be moderated and used well. A good protagonist doesn't /rely/ on luck, but when they do get a lucky break, they exploit it for all it's worth. That way, one coincidence can snowball into the protagonist saving the day, just by virtue of them using that coincidence well.
