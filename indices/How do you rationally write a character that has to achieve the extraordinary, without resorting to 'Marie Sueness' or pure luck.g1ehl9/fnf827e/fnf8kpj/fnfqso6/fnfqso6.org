Failure, even in modest amounts, can make "good luck" a lot more plausible.

One "cheap trick" that you can use to sometimes mask improbable luck is to break a "big break" into a sequence of "smaller breaks." e.g. if a protagonist has only a 12.5% chance of success, and then succeeds, then it might feel like they got unfairly lucky. But if a character has a 50% chance of success, and then succeeds, and then repeats this two more times, none of their individual successes seems too unreasonable (after all, they only had to beat 50/50 odds), even though the chance of beating 50/50 odds three times in a row is 12.5%.

This is a bit of a "trick" that lets you do something rather implausible by masking it somewhat, but you can make it a lot more plausible just by adding one failure to the mix: flipping "heads" 3 times in a row only has a 12.5% chance of happening, but flipping "heads" at least 3 times out of 4 coin flips has a 31.25% chance of happening, which is a level of "luck" that strains our credulity a lot less than if our protagonist /never/ loses.

Letting the protagonist lose every now and then is also important for preserving dramatic tension. Outside of a quest/RP with an actual dice system, people will generally willing to accept that the real odds will favor our protagonist slightly more often than the stated odds, but if you always "round up" a 50% chance to a 100% chance of success, you'll start to remove any sense of uncertainty from the outcome, and why would someone keep reading if they know exactly what's going to happen every time? (Even when playing with actual dice, people will probably forgive the DM for a small amount of fudging in the absence of an auditing system for dice rolls. If you decide to treat a 19 as a natural 20, it will take awhile before people realize that they're getting that extra crit bonus 10% of the time instead of 5% of the time. The old Fire Emblem games "fudged the numbers" when it came to hit%, but they kept it somewhat plausible by not messing with them /too/ much: if the game tells the player that they have a 80% chance to hit, and then changes that to 96% behind the scenes, most players won't notice or complain, and in fact might actually find that the "lying" numbers actually agree with their own mental model more than if the game was being completely honest about the odds: how many people have played a strategy game, seen a 85% hit rate, and mentally rounded that up to, "That's almost a guaranteed hit"?)
