Not all stories can be rewritten as rational fiction, nor should they. If these Golds are orders of magnitude smarter, and have more resources than the MC, then it's safe to say it's impossible to write the story, and have the MC succeed in their goals without luck, inconsistencies, and other tropes antithetical to rational writing.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Rational stories are just another genera. A tool to use to write good stories. If you write a good story that isn't rational, it's still a good story.

As far as making the story you read more rational, there'd first need to be a way to limit how smart the Gold collective is. This can be done in the form of collaboration problems, or short termist leadership policies. Leaders don't want to make a big deal about an escaped slave, as that may hurt their ability to get re-elected. Also, it's fairly unlikely the golds actually rule the entire galaxy. Could just be propaganda they feed to their slaves. It may not be worth it to launch invasions of all solar systems, just the more profitable and strategic ones. Basically, to fix the rationality issue, give the enemy, chinks in their armor, which the protagonist can exploit.
