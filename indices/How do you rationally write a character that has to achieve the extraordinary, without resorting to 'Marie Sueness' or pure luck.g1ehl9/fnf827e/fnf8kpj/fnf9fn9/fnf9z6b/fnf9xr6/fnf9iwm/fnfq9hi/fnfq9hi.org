In my eyes the measure of a Mary Sue is how much the world exists on its own merits apart from the Mary Sue - it's a quality of the world and the overall approach of the story, not the specific character or their specific plot.

A Mary Sue will be surrounded by people who are defined in relation to the Mary Sue (increasing in one-dimensionality the more Suey the story) and the story and world will also be defined in relation to the Mary Sue. This leads to the consequences of 'everyone loves Mary Sue' or 'Mary Sue never needs to struggle' because that's the most common way it manifests, but it's also why you can't avoid making a Mary Sue by just having some people dislike the Sue or by making them dramatically struggle at certain points. It's at the end about how robust your world is, how much your characters are real people instead of cardboard cutouts and how much the setting is a world with rich history and rational actors instead of a stage prepared solely to give the Sue powerups and stuff.

The flipside of this is that you can have a character who is beloved and does not struggle without making them a Mary Sue, as long as you make the world and characters robust despite this (OPM comes to mind for the second factor). Relevant to your circumstances, it's perfectly acceptable to make the MC exceptionally powerful and/or lucky, as long as you don't break suspension of disbelief. Notably, when you are setting up a story's premise you have a lot of flexibility to set up /one/ strange thing. It's sort of the principle that this strange thing is why this protagonist is worth paying attention to in the first place, as compared to every powerless wannabe revolutionary who just dies instead of accomplishing anything.

So, for instance, if your story is about a powerless rebel who has a magic sword fall out of the sky in front of him, and the sword makes it impossible for him to lose a fight, that hasn't made him a Gary Stu. It's contrived, but the premise of a story is allowed a contrivance. The measure of whether he'll be a Gary Stu or not is what he does with the sword, how his friends and companions behave, and how the world behaves in response to him.

On the luck side of things, a favoured strategy is prophecy. This kid isn't just some clever lad, he's the /prophesied hero/. Events contrive in his favour because the hand of Fate is on his side, and even though he looks like the luckiest guy ever we can know that it's not implausible. I personally don't like the Fate play for other reasons, but if all you want is to give him the opportunity to be truly exceptional without breaking SoD then some IC-explained plot armor is a perfectly viable way of doing it.
