He's not truly alone or percieved as the underclass - a group of people, who are higher caste but not the highest caste and as such are maneuvering for political power, surgically, cybernetically, and retrogenetically modify him to both appear as a 'Gold' caste and have enough of the physical enhancements that he won't give himself away.

It's been ages since i read it, but iirc he doesn't completely overthrow the social order, but he rises in political and military status and ends up throwing a coup with the backing of various groups that would benefit from a change in leadership and sympathetic ears to leave the caste system in place but removes a lot of the coercive elements of it and allow a little more social mobility instead of absolute slavery for the reds.

Then there's a second trilogy that i haven't read that seems to follow with him dealing with the fact that all the golds are still around, still rich, and still scheming, and trying to turn his new social order to their advantage at his cost.
