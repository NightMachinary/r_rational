Careful thought and diligence, it's not about accomplishing the impossible, it's about finding a perspective and approach in which it might be possible and then do it like that. You might like "The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress" or "Street Cultivation" those two are very different from each other but I think they're both relevant to this. It's also acceptable to have some luck, for example in the example you gave there'd be a lot of reds motivated to rebellion and naturally some would be in better or worse positions to do so, if one only looks at the most successful one there'd naturally be above average opportunities.
