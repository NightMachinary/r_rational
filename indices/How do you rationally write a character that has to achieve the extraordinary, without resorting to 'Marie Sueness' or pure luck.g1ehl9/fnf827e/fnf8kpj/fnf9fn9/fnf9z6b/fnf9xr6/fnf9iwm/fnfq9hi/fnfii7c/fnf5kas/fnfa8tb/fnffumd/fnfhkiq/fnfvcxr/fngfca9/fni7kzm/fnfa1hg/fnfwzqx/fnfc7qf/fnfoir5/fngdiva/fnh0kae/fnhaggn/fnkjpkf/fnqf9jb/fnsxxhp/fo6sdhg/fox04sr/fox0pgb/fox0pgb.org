It's probably just because I'm already thinking about it but the history of the Necrons talked about in Terror and Peace Among the Stars comes to mind on a civilization scale. A similar idea I read in a different story with a rather violent and temperamental "wise sage" figure to the hero has her mention that there's been hundreds of fated heros before him and being a hero only means that it's possible he'll succeed not that he will. It might be interesting to write a story with a lot of "heros" trying to topple the evil emperor or what have you and show how most of them die, some get luckier than others but in the end show how behind the finally victorious hero there are a thousand failed mayrters, perhaps not entirely failed, have their stories interact, all leading up to the end.
