Their superiority is strictly physical and social in nature. I don't think the series ever mentions mental enhancements. They also seem to have a socialized weakness of a nearly psychotic devotion to competition, infighting, and one on one duels in power armor. Darrow is basically able to recruit anyone with a smidgen of conscience for the price of asking. This lets him become the sole pupil of the single greatest warrior in living memory.

In the same vein of the Golds being stupidly adversarial because they are in love with the image of being hard men making hard decisions, they genetically engineered super soldiers and proceeded to enslave them all with a mix of lies, threats, and superstition rather than genuine loyalty.

But yeah, Darrow is a Gary Stu. I love the series, but far from being a critique of hard men making hard decisions, it's the story of the hardest one of all, who is given a moral justification in order to keep him at all sympathetic.
