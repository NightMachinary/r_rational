I would compare what things happened historically, but at the end of the day if you do something like that you have to have some sort of sueness involved.

If you read some biographies of the "great" people of history you'll see that some of it was ridiculous, no flaws, perfect rng. Usually however we know the ending to the story afterwards with history, so Alexander dies early for example, or look at Napoleon.

Their rise to power and defeating the empire seems like Gary Sue, up until they are actually in power or after they're in power.

But I don't think any single genius could topple a GALAXY empire without them being a singularity versus say the human bell curve. Just in terms of propagation I struggle to see how an individual human esque figure could emass that much power.

Revolutions happen certainly, but they don't happen alone or by one individual. See the Great Man Theory of history versus a Marxist understanding of history versus some modern approaches. Again Napoleon is a great example. Certainly the start of Revolutionary France but how much was really him and not all the other people involved?

Look at the story of Bernadotte for example, randomly elected King of a country he wasn't even part of. If you wrote that in any story people would say this is author bias.
