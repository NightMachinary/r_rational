Just make sure they're extraordinary from the start. People can improve, use, but usually there's a limit to the degree. An average person that ends up as an overpowered Mary Sue is just weird and unrealistic. An already exceptional individual rising to Mary Sue level? More acceptable. Red Rising's problem is that Darrow is just plain /capable/. I'd have much fewer qualms about his ability if he already had a strong reputation among the Reds as being absurdly smart, quick-witted, calm, rational, etc. At least by helldiver standards.
