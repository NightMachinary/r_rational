If the extraordinary is achieved,it is achieved by someone or some group.

Look at what is achieved,then look at the requirements for that to happen, and sort out the path backwards.

Then sort it out forwards, story-style, and make the people real people.

One thing to consider is the role of where you have them start. Say your desired endpoint is /most/ likely to come from a starting point of "comes from wealth" and "has an education": what happens to your story when you change the variables? Can you, as a writer, plausibly concoct a story in which the person or team hasn't got those resources? What does it look like?

Is your team saving the universe a scrappy band of thieves or a well-trained band of military folks? Who is actually more likely to get the job done? Are they working with or against official support and knowledge?
