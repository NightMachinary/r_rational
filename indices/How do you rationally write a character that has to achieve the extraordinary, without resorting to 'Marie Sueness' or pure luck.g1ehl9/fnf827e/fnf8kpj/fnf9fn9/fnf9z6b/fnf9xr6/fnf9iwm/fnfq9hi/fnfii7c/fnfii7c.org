Some initial author fiat is permitted. Think of it as a survivorship bias serving the narrative. I haven't read the book you're mentioning, but I assume there are billions of reds, and none of them too happy about the current order. So there are millions or billions of reds striving to change their dole, right? But most of their stories are not interesting, because they fail and fail again (or die as a result of a first/second failure). For the story to be interesting the author must invent a red that gets some special advantage over other boring reds. Of course, there are limits how much you can give initially, and you can't give out more fiat just to bail the protag out in the middle of the story.

The general answer to the problem is that engaging writing can be summarized with the word BUT. The protagonist must never get a decisive victory in any act leading up to the finale (and probably in the finale as well). There's always a complication, or several, leading to further escalation. The first group of mooks is defeated BUT one of them escapes and reinforcements are coming. Or, the protag gets a full tactical victory BUT at a very high moral cost (i.e. all hostages killed). The Sue (Stu) doesn't have a good, concise definition, but as a rule of thumb Sues don't get these BUTs. They are over-competent and morally superior at the same time.
