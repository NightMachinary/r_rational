  Now how can he do that, being anything but perfect, or extremely and recurrently lucky?

Some luck will necessarily be involved. But the majority of the unusual-things-have-happened-to-me could be in the form of things that give them opportunities or push them outside of the normal circumstances, rather than giving them direct advantages. What put /this particular/ Red on a mission to topple the galactic order? By the time they're on that path they're already unusual.

A Mary Sue / Gary Stu is unusual but doesn't struggle at all. Everything is handed to them.

Don't make their innate capabilities exceptional, or at least don't rely on that. Make their chance circumstances and personal struggles in response to them exceptional.
