ideally, these circumstances should seem extraordinary but also *inevitable*. That is, the social and historical climate allowed for this moment to occur - *someone* was going to fill that role, this is the story of the person who happened to be in the right place and seize the opportunity.

Revolutions occur not because one person has the unique thought to overthrow the social order, they occur because the social order is imbalanced or corrupt in a way that may not be immediately obvious but in hindsight is inevitable.
