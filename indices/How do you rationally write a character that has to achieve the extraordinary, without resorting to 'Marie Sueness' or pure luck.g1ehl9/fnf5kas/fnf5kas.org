Proper character development. Usually happens with deep despair, desperation, loss, physical injury or being hit extremely hard by reality. For example that story you just mentioned, i haven't read it, but can you imagine if the MC one day found out that the adminstration/government had direct control over everyones color and they could change that any moment they wanted to? Maybe it happens and MC becomes the worst or lowest graded, that could be a form of character development, that might help the MC become better than gold. Just a thought.
