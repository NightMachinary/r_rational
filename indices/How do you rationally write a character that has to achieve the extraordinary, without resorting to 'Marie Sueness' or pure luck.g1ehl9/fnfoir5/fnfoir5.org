A certain degree of fortune is always required, but if you want to make it more plausible, make sure that his or her talents are well suited to the specific situation at hand. Then, make it hard. Make sure whatever flaws he or she has come up.

Also, mix the luck up. If the person is *always* lucky/unlucky, particularly if it's always the same way, this will become tedious.
