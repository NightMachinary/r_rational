Prefacing this by saying that I haven't read the novel, or the Goodreads review.

In these scenarios, superfuturistic spacefaring societies you can't topple regimes by punching them into submission - unless we're talking deliberately overplayed things like WH 40k, or run of the mill bad writing. Also, with the exception of /extremely/ authoritarian powers or truly henious poverty, access to some Internet - like information network should be at least plausible (not necessarily easy).

The MC is already driven, this we already know. For whatever reason they want the system to crash and burn, or be replaced or whatever. With access to information and your standard package of Main Character's luck â„¢, you already got yourself a fairly good coctel to shake things up.

It's a matter depending on setting and the flavor you wanna give to the protagonist. Is booming the economy feasible? Maybe terrorist attacks? Guerrilla tactics, cut supply lines to cities/countries/planets? Collaborating with the underworld? The possibilities are not few, what has to remain true is the core of a sufficiently inteligent character (doesn't have to be a genius, acknowledging your limits and grabbing yourself a brainy sidekick would also work) who is driven and can access valuable information.
