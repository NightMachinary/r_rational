I don't think writing with the reception in mind will do you any favors. Like, any time you are 'against' your audience stuff gets weird. Writing is hard enough, if you are like 'I want the character to accomplish X but I have to make it clear that they aren't unrealistically gifted AND I have to make it clear that they acknowledge the role of fortune in their...' you are gonna go nuts.

I mean, if you are pro, you are singing for your supper, that's a whole different deal. I don't know anything about that. But if you are just writing web fiction then my advice would be not to beat yourself up about it. Write what you want, and if people call it a Mary Sue, just do more writing. People are gonna say stuff no matter what you write, might as well make yourself happy.
