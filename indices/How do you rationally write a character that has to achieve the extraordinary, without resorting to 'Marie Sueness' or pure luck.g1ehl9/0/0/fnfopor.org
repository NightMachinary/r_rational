There's an old saying (sometimes attributed to Seneca the Younger) that "luck is what happen when preparation intersects with opportunity."

The gripe about "lucky protagonists" is about individuals who seem to have every opportunity presented to them -- almost as if the universe is bending its shape to suit their needs. If you want to give your protagonist opportunities without making them seem unfairly cosmically blessed, just make sure it's clear that other people were given these same opportunities, and failed to capitalize on them. This makes it so that the protagonist's differentiating feature is not that she was blessed with good fortune, but that she had the ability to seize upon an opportunity that others might have missed or ignored or otherwise failed to capitalize on. The multitudinous ranks of "people who had this opportunity but failed to grasp it" might include past versions of the main character. It's possible that the main character might encounter an opportunity several times before learning or realizing something that causes them to change their perception and discover the opportunity that was "hiding in plain sight" the whole time.

If you want to let the main character to succeed at something that nobody else has achieved, one fairly straightforward "hack" is to just make them try harder than anyone else is: having a character win because they tried harder than anyone else often makes us like them more (probably for reasons similar to why some audiences hate "overpowered protagonists" who just immediately win without really having to struggle). I recently wrote about [[http://kineticliterature.com/the-master-and-the-apprentice/][the trope of the enthusiastic neophyte]] who wins through sheer willingness to engage in arduous tasks, which is one example of this. I think there's some amount of resistance to this within this community, because we like our protagonists to work /smarter/, not /harder/. Some people are resistant to the idea that brute effort could substitute for domain expertise, and for good reasons: not every problem can be solved by just bashing your head against it. (The solution, I think, is to present your character with the kind of problems that /can/ be solved through sheer effort early on, before they've had a chance to accumulate enough domain expertise that they can rely more on competence or "playing the system" rather than just trying really hard.) We'd all like to "work smarter, not harder," but there's a certain rationality in realizing, "I'm in a situation where I /can't/ 'work smarter,' so I guess the most rational thing for me to do right now is roll up my sleeves and work harder until I can navigate myself to a position where I'm able work smarter. And maybe I'll /keep/ working hard even after I get to that point."

Often, the most successful people tend to be those whose immense effort intersects with immense opportunity. Taylor Swift was born to affluent parents whose ample financial resources allowed her to travel regularly for vocal and acting lessons, and her mother was willing to fly with her to Nashville (the country music capital of the world) to distribute her demo tapes from a young age. But Taylor Swift is also the kind of girl who, when told by her parents at age 12 that her fingers were too small to play a 12-string guitar, responded by practicing the guitar for four hours a day (six hours a day on weekends) past the point where her fingers were bleeding and calloused.

While success in the real world is often more than "just try really hard," the more I read biographies of successful musicians, the more I see the common refrain of, "I was willing to practice for 3 hours a day when my peers were only practicing 30 minutes a day, which allowed me to progress in skill more rapidly than anyone else in my cohort." Skill is one of those things that tends to have compounding returns: the person who is the most skilled in their class might catch the eye of the teacher and get extra private lessons, the person who gets private lessons is more likely to get into the more elite music schools, people at the elite music schools get the most elite trainers and often gain connections that allow them to turn pro early, the person who goes pro at an early age is able to devote more time to mastering their craft than an amateur who just practices in their spare time, and so on. Anyone who understands compound interest and exponential growth knows that over a long enough time horizon, differences in growth rate can outstrip differences in starting principal, and when you're comparing someone who practices 30 hours a week to 30 hours a month, you can get /massive/ differences in growth rate.
