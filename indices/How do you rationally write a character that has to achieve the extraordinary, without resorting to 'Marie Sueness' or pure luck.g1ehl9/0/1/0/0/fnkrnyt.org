I've been reading a lot of litRPG and quite often it shows how badly an author can handle that single starting lucky break.

I've seen protagonists who get some starting advantage and just coast on it without demonstrating any particular brilliance. It's particularly noticeable in this genre because - at least in theory - everyone has access to the same deterministic progression paths.
