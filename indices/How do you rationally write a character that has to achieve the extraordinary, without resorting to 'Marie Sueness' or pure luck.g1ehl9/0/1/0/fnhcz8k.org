I think the timing of the luck matters a lot for believability. In a lot of stories, the protagonist has plot armor so thick nothing affects them; they brazenly make poor choices then somehow get a lucky break at the end to save them. Blah.

On the other hand, if the protagonist gets a lucky break at the /start/ of an arc, then exploits that luck into advantage, well... That's how life works. It's realistic.

Nobody goes into bad situations deliberately expecting it to just work out. That's using luck as plot armor. But everyone has different opportunities presented to them, and most don't even necessarily notice the opportunities they ignore.
