Failure, and meaningful failure at that. Multiple times, with consequences that affect the character. You can do everything right, perform every action perfectly, and still fail. Having a character who gets back up and continues after failure will do quite a bit to keep the grounded.

In the same vein, compromise. Have a set of values and rules that the character follows, believes in, but then must betray. Batman is an example of this, his fight with the Joker is characterized by the fact he won't kill the deranged clown. That is where most of the angst comes from, Batman could kill him in an instant, the Joker knows it and also knows Batman never will. Establishing a rational character that won't change their rules after failing to get the desired rules with them though, would be difficult.

I might also consider having a 'foil' as a perspective wtihin the story. It's a little more difficult to pull off switching POV but it will Humanize the enemy and allow for both characters to operate rationally against one another. This does not imply that the enemy / protagonists organizations themselves are rational, so the enemy could be a slaving, racist, misogynist, if that is what their culture produces.

Such an enemy can rationally say slaves are 'worthless' given their life experience with them. It also allows for logical blind-spots that a protagonist could utilize, like no one of higher status noticing slaves.

A MC does not also have to be the most 'intelligent' person of a group. Most often they are not, instead having the ability to mesh well enough with all members of it to integrate them, not to mention make snap decisions and be able to trust those beneath the. Decision paralysis is a very, very hard thing for a singular person to bypass when it comes to world / galaxy changing events.

I also feel like it should be noted as well, things are hardly ever black and white especially with rational operators. You can have people operate off selfishness and be mercenary with both sides of conflict, you can have people who operate like Doctors without Boarders, or someone who really does wish to watch it all burn. So long as that is established and remains consistent, reasons for the behavior would be nice but not needed so long as their goals remain the same.
