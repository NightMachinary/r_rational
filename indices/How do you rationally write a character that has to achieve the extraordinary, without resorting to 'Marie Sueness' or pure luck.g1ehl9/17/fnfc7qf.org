The solution is don't write yourself into a corner where that's the only option. Specially if what you're writing is a book where you can edit anything and go back and fix things without anyone noticing. I also doubt this character was actually smart, most likely the author just made him sound that way by manipulating the plot.

​

The way you write a competent character that's not a mary sue is by making it take time to achieve his goal, making it cost him highly, maybe losing a hand or something else clearly noticeable.

​

Also avoid the trope of hard work can overcome inherent ability, that's silly people that are inherently talented can also work hard, and that just ends up meaning that the best tend to be very talented hard workers, rather than either or.
