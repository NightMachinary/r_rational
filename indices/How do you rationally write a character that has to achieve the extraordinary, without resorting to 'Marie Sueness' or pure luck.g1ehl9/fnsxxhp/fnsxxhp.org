Haven't read the story in question.

He could be 'lucky' in the sense he is contacted by an alien civilization or other outside power which secretly changes his color to gold along with all the advantages associated, even though he appears red.

Instead of the 'color change' he gets a SYSTEM which allows him to self-evolve his own intelligence over a series of 20 books until he matches then exceeds gold. Story so long because he fails often while learning.

He could seduce or befriend a gold which drives the social change and uses him as a figure-head for reds to rally behind.

Alternatively he could be chosen at random by a gold computer program to be this figure head because the really smart golds want to change their own social order in response to an outside threat or philosophical awakening. MC could be written as useless and bumbling here, but that would require another 'true mastermind' and might raise the question -- is 'mastermind' the real MC instead?

Gold society is invaded by a more powerful force. All the best golds are caught up in the real war and leave the imbeciles behind to run society. As a normal bumbling red, MC realizes society is not fair and figures our a way to generate resources that is too garbage/inefficient for the golds. He uses these resources to get an AI which does the thinking for him and gradually overcomes the 'gold dregs' until he encounters the 'real golds' and gets to fight in the secret war after reforming society.

I'm sure there's more ways to do it, that's about a half hour of thinking.
