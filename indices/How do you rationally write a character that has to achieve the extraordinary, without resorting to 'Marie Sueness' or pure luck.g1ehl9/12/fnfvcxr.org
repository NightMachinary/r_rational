The godly gold class MUST have flaws. One possible flaw they could have is overconformity. If everyone can gene edit themselves to be "perfect" what defintion of perfection are they using? Chances are certain genes will become more trendy and popular than others either due to government edict or due to gold class votes. If everyone in the gold class is constantly conforming to their rigid social order they would likely have difficulty with thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to novel problems. If everyone around you seems perfect at everything they do, there isnt much incentive to actualy put in an effort, so that creates laziness. Plus they have the other colors to do their work for them. The golds would be stagnating, in other words. They wouldnt strive to become all they could be and they wouldnt have the incentive to try. A red class person would not have that disadvantage.

Also, there's another risk to genetic overconformity: monocropping means that if one specimen is vulnerable to a particular disease, they ALL are. So if they encounter a novel disease they arent familiar with, the golds all get wiped out pretty easily. Unless they stop with bioengineering themselves and get robot bodies, and that would come with its own problems.
