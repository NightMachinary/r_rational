Mostly I don't think the author has any idea how big a galaxy is. There's at least trillions of golds, even at a handful to a star system, and this guy is pretending to be a gold without the background any gold grew up with. He's nothing special. He's no Paul Muda'dib and even if he was he's up against an unstoppable force.
