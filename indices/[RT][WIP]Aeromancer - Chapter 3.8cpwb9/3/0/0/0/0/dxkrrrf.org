Good to know. I figured if nothing else, getting feedback on how the story thus far is being perceived would be useful to at least calibrate whether it's coming across how you wanted it to or not.

I will echo the previous chapter's discussion around approaching blindness in stories with some amount of caution if you yourself are not blind and don't have access to someone with that experience to consult with. Acknowledging the limitations in his magical air vision (surface only, probably strongly limited when outdoors, and hopefully acknowledging some sort of cognitive limitation on the "I can see everything in full detail everywhere around me") seems to me like it goes a decent way towards that, but erasure of lived experiences by real people with blindness is a definite concern, but handled well is an incoming explored perspective in this space, which is always a good thing.
