Sounds good. No need to shoehorn in random historical lessons if they don't fit the story, just wanted to see if this was something I should have noticed or not.

Feel free to ignore this next question as well, but I'm a bit curious about the direction the story is going in; is the goal to primarily be a pseudo-blind MC, or if is it just a setup for the rest of the story, similar to other superhero stories showing the characters having to deal with broken bones or something else?

I mostly ask because the tone thus far in the story seems to be treating his blindness as "temporary setback/annoyance" while the prominence of it being the culmination of the first chapter makes to seem like it should be treated as a character trait going forward.

If this will be resolved one way or another, either by the blindness being removed or by his attempts at a cure from a professional vivimancer spectacularly failing just as his first attempts did, within the next 2-3 chapters, definitely don't spoil it.

The world as described feels like blindness is being treated similar to broken bones, though, and the MC's actions at this time come across similar to someone breaking a leg, stopping at the school's nurse and getting a splint and some crutches, and then deciding that instead of going to a hospital to get x-rays and a cast, he decides to go visit Elon Musk's prosthetics lab.
