Am I understanding correctly that on the Marco's escape pod where the communication setup what happened was roughly:

1. Visser's marble penetrated the box.
2. It dissolved.
3. A Yeerk vessel of the Visser's will grew in Marco's brain (presumably due to a plague or Z-space effect generated by the marble?

Because, like, they don't seem to be alarmed enough about this fact. Like, that's the ballgame, right? Dude has a plague he can use to seed his custom Yeerk equivalents in the course of minutes?
