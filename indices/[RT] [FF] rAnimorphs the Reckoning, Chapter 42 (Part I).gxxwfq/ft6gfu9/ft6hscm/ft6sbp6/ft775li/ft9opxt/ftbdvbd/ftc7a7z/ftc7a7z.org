As the person who complained last time about the Visser using the fuck-word, I didn't have an issue with him in this chapter. Maybe that's because he's speaking to someone else instead of as an internal monologue, or maybe because Jake notes his own anger at the Visser making a sarcastic joke. Or maybe because the fact this conversation is happening at all indicates he's open to getting some value out of conversations with other sapient beings, and therefore might not want to be the universe's sole intelligence. (I recall he's not morphing anymore and would have lost his Jake/Marco/Tobias/David morphs when Alloran died, leaving him with fewer options to entertain himself.)
