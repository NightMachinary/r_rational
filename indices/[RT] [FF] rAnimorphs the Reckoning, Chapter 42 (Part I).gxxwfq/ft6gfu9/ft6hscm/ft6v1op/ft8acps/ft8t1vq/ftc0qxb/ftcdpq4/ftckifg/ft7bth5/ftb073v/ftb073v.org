Longtime reader and huge fan of your work. One of the best fics - period. KA Applegate should be begging to partner with you and make this a new canon.

Very interesting chapter. I admit, the Visser convinced me already. Why not move towards a slow disarmament?\\
I'm willing to believe he's even mostly telling the truth - wanting to survive, primarily, and really only wanting/needing the cube. Though I suspect he's much less willing to let non-Visser life persist than he lets on in that conversation. Still, that would be evident from a Leeran, so why bother lying. All he has to really lie about is about not knowing what would really happen if he is able to use the iscafil device - and he could hide that by making the trade in a body never exposed to his research findings.

Way I see it, there are two paths moving forward towards the obvious end-game of unlocking the Eye of the Universe (to use Outer Wilds terms) where the gods reside. Either the Animorphs make the trade - buying human independence and safety (assuming they can work through the no-doubt-eventful disarmament and negotiation), but trusting V3 with essentially the key to the universe. They protect themselves and their people, at the expense of potentially Everyone, while trusting an entity that will definitely double-cross them any chance he gets, because they see no other choice.

OR - they do the reverse. If the Visser is to be trusted in his goals (big if) of living forever and stopping entropy, then he is kinda-sadly-strangely someone who could be empathized with. They can't trust him, after what he's done, but perhaps they could ask him to trust them? He has their morphs, he can see into their minds, and he could (potentially) believe some human is capable of holding the key to the universe and fulfilling its promise to follow their common goal - e.g. by solving entropy. They ask the Visser to give an Animorph the instructions they need to unlock the eye of the universe.

Of course, the Visser would never make that trade without considerable consolations - he probably wouldn't make it /at all./ I imagine taking that path and having the Visser let them lead the mission would mean basically trading him every shred of leverage they have - complete and utter surrender of the entire planet, any z-space nukes, every other Animorph, and probably even put a Visser-yerk in reduced-capacity in the co-pilot seat as they open the door. Everything short of the fact that the Visser needs to trust (in the end) that the key holder will use that power as promised. Just the way he operates. (And might would probably be trying like mad to control even that shred of agency). Still, ultimately it's a path of trust between the Animorphs and the Visser, betting everything on the Cube.

I see those two paths as the Crayak and the Ellimist split - one is the result of fear, one is (very reluctant, but still ultimately total) trust and understanding of one-another. It's possible because - strange as it sounds - the Visser really /should/ be able to trust at least someone. The humans and their goals are pretty simple, and they are naturally inclined to empathy. But also - he won't necessarily see that, and only point out the desire for vengeance. Makes it a very interesting negotiation. IF the Visser actually cared about what he claims (big if) then they could conceivably work together - and he could conceivably trust the humans to lead the mission of unlocking the universe.

So many game pieces could be played with here though. Even if the Visser somehow saw the logic of this trust and worked together, what's to stop Marco (or Rachel?) from sabotaging it all out of vengeance - fueled by Crayak? Looking forward to quite the complex swirl of trust as we reach end-game.

This is all to say, of course, I probably need to re-read the previous Visser chapters and realize just how fundamentally untrustworthy he is. Though honestly I've been remembering him as just a Pure Heartless Rational entity, so I'm willing to believe he's capable of seeing the path to total cooperation here. Just a question of whether the Animorphs will see it and be willing to take it too.
