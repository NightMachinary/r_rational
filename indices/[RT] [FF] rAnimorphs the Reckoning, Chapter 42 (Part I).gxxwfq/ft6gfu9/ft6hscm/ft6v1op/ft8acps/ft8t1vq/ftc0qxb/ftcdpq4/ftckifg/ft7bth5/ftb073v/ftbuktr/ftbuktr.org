My own inclination here would be to get the Visser to agree to tell Helium how to hack the god computer. Of course doing this in a way that prevents him from defecting and tricking Helium into installing a backdoor for the Visser to seize control would be tricky. Or even just having one of his clones attack at the last moment and stealing the key to victory.

Maybe if they had the same setup as their current negotiation but added a couple of Leerans at both ends it could work? Visser knows how to hack the computer a little bit and the Leeran copies his brain state to the Visser 1 fragment on his end. This information is shared between the fragments and the Leeran clone on Helium's end (at an undisclosed location to avoid ambush) copies the state into him. Then Helium works on the problem in manageable byte sized chunks and everyone in the system chews over the data to decide how to proceed. Except maybe the link between the Visser 1 fragments isn't high bandwidth enough to support the scheme. Maybe the two ends if the link can't be hidden from eachother. Maybe the Leeran on Heliums end is trapped.

The other option involves the Good Ship that Tobias found acting as a safe spot for a non hostile meeting. (I don't think any of the other animorphs know about that yet though?) It should have enough power to prevent violence/defection on the part of all parties. The setup then might be Visser locked in a room, Leeran locked in seperate room, and then Helium locked in a third room working on the hack. Except the ship is almost certainly more than powerful enough, but it might not be intelligent enough. The way it was described, knowing how to react to things by comparing the situation to other situations in its memory and selecting an appropriate response, it's like a super advanced neural net. It can probably stop Visser 3 from any form of trickery that it has seen before, which just leaves all the novel forms that the Visser's considerable intelligence can come up with for this super important event.

Trust is quite hard enough as it is, and V3's actions up until now are not exactly making it easier.

There's also the possibility that they successfully hack the God computer and then Elimist and Cryak both look at this branch if the They-Were-A-Simulation-This-Whole-Time and agree to not let it occur in reality and then end the simulation because it no longer has bearing on the game being played in the real world.

One last thought, going back to the Good Ship chapter I noticed I thing I hadn't before. "There was distress, then, or at least its shadow, for the ship also remembered what had happened next, last time---" I guess this is the time The One Who Is Remembered somehow subverted the anti violence program and made two Howler ships collide. I'm not sure how important this ends up being though.
