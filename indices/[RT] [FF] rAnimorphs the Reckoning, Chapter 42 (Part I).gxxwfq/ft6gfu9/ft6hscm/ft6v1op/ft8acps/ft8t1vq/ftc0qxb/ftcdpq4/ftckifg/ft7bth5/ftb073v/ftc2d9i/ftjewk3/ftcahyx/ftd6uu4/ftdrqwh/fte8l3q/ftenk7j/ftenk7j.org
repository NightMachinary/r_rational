Nice try, V3. But if you really wanted to build a Dyson Sphere around every star, you know that you'd need German Engineering. And.... you killed all the Germans :(

Anyway, his presented "wants" seem rather doubtful. Especially his claim that by the time humans and Andalites build Dyson spheres it "would be too late". Unless "too late" really means a couple trillion years in life expectancy less. [The average star has a lifespan in the billions, Andalites and humans would get around to harvesting them much sooner!] But since he expects trillion trillions anyway, then his other stated values of adventure, companionship, creation, experience and sunshine, green grass and blue skies basically matter less than a trillionth of a percent. (considering that his rampaging puts large costs on all those things)

Anyway, Jake should pretend to go along with this ridicolousness and negotiate for V3 sharing future sun-harvesting tech once developed and he should probably ask for the Milky Way or at least a spiral arm under Leeran. V3 can have the rest of the lightcone. [though really, aren't black holes the energy source for the endgame, anyway?]

Also I hope Magellan's next move is to create a couple more Jakes so he can use that lying trick himself. Plus a bunch more Marco, Rachel, Tobias and Garret spares. Give them all the Quat-morph, acquire a Naharan and start working on some quantum virusses!
