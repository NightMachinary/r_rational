Kinda wish that Garrett let a Jake morph do the talking, or that even the presumably powerful yet heretofore unseen Jake_morph!Aximili had. Something to throw either any pre-runs Visser did with Jake, or to insulate the real Jake from any wording-contingent manipulations that wouldn't be relayed by a summarizing morph of himself.
