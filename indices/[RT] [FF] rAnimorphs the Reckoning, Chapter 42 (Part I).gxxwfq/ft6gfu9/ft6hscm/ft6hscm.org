A random thought I had at the beginning of the chapter: "It's amazing how easy it is to remain a relevant main character, even as a kid, when you have a nuclear warhead that you can use at any moment against any target".

  “Sometimes you just gotta make the wrong move, you know?” I said.

  “Who are you, and what have you done with Jake?”

I burst out laughing at that line.

Overall the chapter was really good. V3 needs an editing pass, though. He sounds /way/ more like TK17Studios than like reckoning!V3, let alone canon!V3.
