Amazing chapter, I really liked visser 3. He's such a good villain: intelligent, not evil for the sake of evil, willing to negotiate, and shockingly clear sighted. I wish mainstream media had more villains like that. Jake and Marco too were awesome this chapter. I'm get more impressed by their characterization every chapter, especially with the way they argue and craft very elucidating arguments. Am a huge fan of your work, so please continue to make more.
