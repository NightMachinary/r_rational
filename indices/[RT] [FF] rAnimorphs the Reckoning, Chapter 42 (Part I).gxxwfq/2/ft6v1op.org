Oh, excellent!

I had a bit of an “I can see my house from here” moment when the Visser mentioned the thing about certain people being in contact with the manufacturers that made the repulsorlifts. It feels possible that I influenced that line with my comment on the /last/ chapter, wondering where the repulsorlifts came from. :D

Anyway, wow, who would have thought military negotiations could be so exciting? I suppose it helps that there's universe-level stakes and characters we love, and like, aliens.

Bit of a cold sweat when it came out that THEIR Iscafil device happens to be The Chosen Iscafil Device. Kinda makes you wonder if all the lame ones are called /Escafil/ Devices, eh?

Jake's poor little black box is right. There are soooo many layers here. Who even knows what's real? Who could possibly keep track of it all?

Also, Jesus, Magellan. Jake /knows/ you don't get in the car with the kidnapper, and he /knows/ you know that, and just - just let him, okay? He's probably better at this than you. He has the measure of the situation and the risk. This is THE way to dance with the top of the food chain, and didn't y'all fly into space looking to negotiate with the Visser anyway? Huff.

Shameless plug, assuming this isn't against sub rules or whatever: I started [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gwquie/rtwipff_ranimorphs_list_of_unanswered_questions/][this thread]] talking about as-yet-unresolved mysteries the other day, and it's only slowly gathering steam. Drop by! Contribute! :)

Edit: With this chapter, it looks like the fic has just hit 500k words. Woohoo, or wow, or something!
