This chapter was great, and I ended up reading it when I needed to calm down from something, so it was great to have something that was relatively straightforward and short and information heavy to comfort me.

I loved hearing V3's philosophy, though this "don't want to die" stuff is coming on a little... thick. At first I thought it was bad writing but now I am more inclined to believe that V3 was manipulating Jake somehow.

I do like this attitude towards negotiation. I like when villains tell heroes their plans, and I especially like knowing that these are not necessarily the REAL plan
