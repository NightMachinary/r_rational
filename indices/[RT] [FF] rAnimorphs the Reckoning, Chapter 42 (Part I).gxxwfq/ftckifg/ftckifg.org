Have I missed something, or do we have no idea how Leerans work? Because their abilities seem like the sort of thing you'd need to be a baby Ellimist to pull off.

I've also found it curious this entire time that Leerans are basically treated as machines, more than life. How similar/different are they to the Leerans from the books?

I do like how Leerans are taken a bit more seriously, here. I only remember them appearing in canon twice, in spite of there seemingly being a lot of background buildup toward their relevance. One showed up to save Vissor 1 at the end of 15, and 18 was all about a Z-space "accident" sending the Animorphs to Leera to resolve the dangling plot-thread. And I don't remember them ever being mentioned again, as though this was supposed to be the primary story arc for the teens and that was all.

18 is one of the few Animorphs books I own in Braille. It's also the one I haven't even opened, because in spite of being a major event that resolved a plotline we were being reminded of for a while... it felt out of place and fillerish. ... Huh, this probably applies to a certain important event in one of my original series, too, come to think of it. Hmm.
