I /expected/ V3 to sound more trustworthy/familiar/informal and less like V3 to manipulate Jake, and if he sounded like his V3 self, I'd be wondering what was his gamble with /not/ changing his language patterns.

Edit: But I see your point about the literary side... maybe if Jake's inner monologue remarked, at the beginning, that V3's language sounded suspiciously casual? (If that's the sort of thought that Jake would have.)
