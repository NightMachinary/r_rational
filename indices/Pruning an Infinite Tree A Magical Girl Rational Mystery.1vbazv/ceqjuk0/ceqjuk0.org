Tokyo is being attacked by monsters, but it is the appearance of three defenders with magical ability and a girlish theme that interests Sebastian. He is looking for an impressive project to leave the shadow of his overbearing and manipulative father, and this mystery presents an exceptional opportunity.

Who are the magical girls? Whence come their abilities, and what does the existence of magic say about the world? Not to mention: why are they so reminiscent of a certain genre of Japanese fiction?

Sebastian wants answers, and has a plan to extract them. He might be young, but he's armed with military hardware and professional training, while the magical girls let a knockoff supervillain monologue in the middle of combat. Can't be that tough.

I'm the author. The story is complete (71k words) and will be posted Saturday and Wednesday at 8pm EST.

I'm crossposting this with HPMOR, since that, Eliezer's lesswrong postings, and Dungeon Keeper Ami were major inspirations. Specifically I tried to embrace the fast moving escalation and clever solutions to big problems.

I also tried to adhere to the Chandler mystery story rules. You know what the characters know, and can make the same deductions.

You'll probably enjoy it more if you have some idea of the tropes of the 'magical girl' genre, but in-depth familiarity is not required.
