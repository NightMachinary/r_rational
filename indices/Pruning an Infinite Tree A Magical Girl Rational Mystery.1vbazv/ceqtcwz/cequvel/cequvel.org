I have read Artemis Fowl. Jackson being 'assigned at birth' had some Butler inspiration.

I actually am a native speaker. As far as an editor goes I've had several friends Beta read. I do have someone who has edited a couple books editing it. Stylistically I might have made overly convoluted sentences - sometimes I find it hard to resist. Do you have any specific instances in mind? Thanks for the comment!
