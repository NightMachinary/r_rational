Interesting, but don't forget the small-scale weirdness too. "Privacy/cryo nut in a robot body" is one thing, "privacy/cryo nut in a robot body /which is a blue rat skeleton/" is another. You got a lot of weirdness mileage out of Dan dealing with his small size and the various opportunities/limitations it presents.
