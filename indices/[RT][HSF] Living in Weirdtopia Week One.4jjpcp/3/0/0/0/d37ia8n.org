  You sort of front-loaded the weirdness ... the world stopped being Weirdtopia and started being a new normal. Just another story set in the Liberal-Democrat Techno Furry Quasi-Utopia (flaw: privacyless). Well okay, maybe there aren't any other stories in that exact setting, but most subsets of those five traits have been on this reddit.

And you've just nailed down pretty much the exact reason why I stopped writing where I did. Coming up with a proper weirdtopia is /hard/, and I seemed to be having troubles adding more weirdness than had been in the literal dream that inspired the whole thing.

At the moment, I'm seeing if I can get some properly decent levels of weirdness, with a cross of ideas between a Dyson swarm of bubbles, accidentally-sapient squirrels, informational immunology, anglerfish mating practices and Voltron. Not sure I've got the chops to turn it into a proper story, but it's fun trying. :)

Read it, absorbed it, building new ideas on it. :)
