My opinion exactly. I'll add that he's a very good writer with absolutely no ability to manage his Internet fandom/hatedom, much like [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/Chatoyance][another well-known MLP fanwriter with a transhumanist streak]]. I still occasionally check in on the QQ comics, but if his politics don't dull my interest soon then the lack of updates will.

Hadn't finished the story at the time I wrote the above comment. Valerie's art was the one that reminded me of RHJ, the lighting and layout especially. I'll stop talking about him now.

Damn good story. You really front-loaded the weirdness; the blue rat body and the rule against bodymodding set my expectations high, but after a while Dan started to strike me as more weird than the people around him. By the end, the world stopped being Weirdtopia and started being a new normal. Just another story set in the Liberal-Democrat Techno Furry Quasi-Utopia (flaw: privacyless). Well okay, maybe there aren't any other stories in that exact setting, but most subsets of those five traits have been on this reddit.

Point is, you got across really well Dan's initial disorientation and his eventual adaptation to the new world.

Incidentally, if you haven't read /Accelerando/ by Charles Stross, you'll love it.
