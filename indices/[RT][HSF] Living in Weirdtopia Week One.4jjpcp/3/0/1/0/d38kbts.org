I'm not sure that those three categories carve reality at the joints very well, in this case. For one example, after looking for any potentially relevant images of ostrich-taurs (there's a rule-34 corollary involved), and finding more than one by ECMajor that were of higher quality than any original images I'd likely be able to commission, I politely asked for permission to place a picture on the page (with proper credit and a link), and was kindly granted it. For another, I asked a furry writer's group which furry artists are good at shiny stuff, and Trunchbull was the first response; a lot of people who draw furry art are in financially precarious situations (ie, out of 50-100 journal posts whose titles I skim daily, I can usually count on seeing an average of one or two "emergency commission requests" asking for immediate help with funds in exchange for art), and it would be more than impolite to ask an artist to create original content without compensating them for their limited time, so that one involved a cash transaction.
