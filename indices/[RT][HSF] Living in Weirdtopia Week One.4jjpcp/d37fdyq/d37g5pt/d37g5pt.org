I enjoyed his comics for a number of years, generally able to ignore the times when his conservative Christian beliefs overrode good narrative, and willing to go with the flow when he banned me from his comics' forum. (IIRC, it was because I stated that I was helping to share the Wikileaks torrent.) Then he made the villain of one of his comics a straw-man scientist who claimed to want to prove biogenesis was possible by using a probability-manipulating device to repeat the phenomenon, without worrying about the collateral damage involved; and after spending a few moments thinking on it, I decided that his comics were no longer giving me the pleasure they once had, so deleted my RSS feeds. At the moment, I'm only subscribed to a few of his My Little Pony stories, and when those finish, that'll probably be it.

It's a bit of a shame - nobody who can get their comics on Atomic Rockets can be all bad, and he has some very interesting thoughts on death-killing in some of his MLP work - and things might change in the future, but for now, there's way too much good stuff to read, and figuring out how to filter it all is a never-ending project.
