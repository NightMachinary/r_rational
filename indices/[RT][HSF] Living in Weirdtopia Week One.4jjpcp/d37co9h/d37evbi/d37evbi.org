#+begin_quote
  Is this supposed to be a one-shot (about the first week) or the first chapter of a new series?
#+end_quote

I'm calling it a one-shot, while retaining the right to write more in the setting if I'm able to think of further ideas that do it justice.

#+begin_quote
  Is the main character another author self-insert like SI was?
#+end_quote

Indeed. In fact, the whole thing is based on a dream I had a month or so ago, which I wrote out in the form of the first section; and then I kept having a few new thoughts on further details to add.

#+begin_quote
  this story is very dialogue heavy
#+end_quote

That seems to be how I prefer to write in general. But if Homestuck could get away with almost all of its text in the form of chatlogs, then this seems more of a personal quirk than an outright lapse in my writing abilities. (I've got more than my share of those to try to improve, as it is.)

#+begin_quote
  Still I loved the blue metal rat-skeleton picture. Looks very pretty and exotic.
#+end_quote

I could throw in a good-sized rambling set of musings here, on the interplay between word and picture, heavily influenced by Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" (with minor digressions into typography and converting file formats). But it's probably best that I limit myself to saying that there are at least a few advantages to standing at the intersection of [[/r/transhuman]] and [[/r/furry]] . :)
