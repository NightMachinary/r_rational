Is this supposed to be a one-shot (about the first week) or the first chapter of a new series?

Is the main character another author self-insert like SI was?

I just read through this and...I'm going to wait until tonight before giving feedback, to reread it and think about what I've just read. Because while this story is very dialogue heavy, it's fairly fast-paced with a lot going on (and a lot of topics such as law are unfamiliar for me to read) and at 7 in the morning with me reading this while eating breakfast, I'm pretty sure I'm not quite getting all I want to understand.

Still I loved the blue metal rat-skeleton picture. Looks very pretty and exotic.
