Due to an unforeseen Master's degree, I've had to take a slight break from writing (for a little over a year), but I'm glad to say that Ascent is now finally finished. There are 7 chapters and a couple of interludes to come till the end and then I'll be moving onto short stories set in the wider universe. If you need to catch up, the story starts [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/][here]].

Chapter 18: *Abyssal*, starts it off; we catch up with Vash and Jan adrift beneath the ocean. In the meantime, [[https://ascentuniverse.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/a-dyn-and-her-conscience.png][here's another doodle]] I've worked on to tide you over -- an illustration of the Dyn governor and her â€˜conscience' from [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/chapter-ix-diplomacy/][Chapter 9]].
