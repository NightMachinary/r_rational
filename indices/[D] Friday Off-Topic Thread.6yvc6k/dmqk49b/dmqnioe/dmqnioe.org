I don't follow blogs, but I do follow some YouTube channels and Podcasts that give me the same fix. The Mixed Six applies intellectualism to pop culture and daily life almost every week and it's hands down my favorite podcast. Vlogbrothers provides something similar, though much less casual in presentation and I don't watch their videos as consistently.
