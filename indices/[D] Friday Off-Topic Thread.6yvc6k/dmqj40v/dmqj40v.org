I've been painting up some new models for my warhammer 40k army. I'm still trying to decide how the Fire Dragons should look. My army color is blue with silver guns, but Fire Dragons tend to be Red, Yellow, and Gold. Here are a few concepts I painted up that try to mesh those ideas. Which do you think looks best?
