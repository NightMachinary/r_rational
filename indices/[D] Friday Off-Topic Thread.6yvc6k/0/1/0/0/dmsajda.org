What I want is to have beliefs that will make the world better. To believe the best of people, in my experience, does that far better than the opposite. It's not about 'getting out of Hell,' it's about making Hell a more pleasant place to be. Where 'Hell' in the analogy is the real world, not, you know, actually a place of eternal suffering. :P
