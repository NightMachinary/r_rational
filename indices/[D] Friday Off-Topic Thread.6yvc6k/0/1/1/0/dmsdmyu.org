Honestly, while I don't /advocate/ unthinking empathy for other people... I'm not entirely sure that I wouldn't do exactly the same thing as Papyrus in that situation. I /actively/ admire him for choosing to do so, even at the risk of his own life -- he admits later that he was scared if you choose to spare him, so it's not like he was being ignorant in doing so!

And there's a certain type of person that he would serve as a stopping point to, in the context of the world, or the game.He's the first monster, who /will not kill you/ -- and on a genocide route, he won't even harm you.
