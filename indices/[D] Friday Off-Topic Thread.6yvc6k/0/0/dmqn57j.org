I don't think it's necessary or entirely accurate to reference blockbuster movies as an example of appealing to an uneducated audience. Instead, I think the ones with very simple conflicts are appealing to the same emotions engrained into us by children's stories. Pointing toward children's stories is enough to make your point since their entire purpose is to teach basic moral values to people who lack any ability to understand the context of real world conflicts.

Other than that, you put forward some ideas that offered insights I hadn't made before and I liked that. However, at the end I didn't get the impression that any conclusion had been reached. It's nice to have knowledge I didn't before, but I'm not sure how I could make use of it. Defining naïveté and exploring it's rhetorical use is interesting, but there didn't seem to be a strategy of how to improve discourse with this information so I don't feel a need to share it.
