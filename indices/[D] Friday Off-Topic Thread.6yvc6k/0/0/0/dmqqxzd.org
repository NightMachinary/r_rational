Thanks for the feedback!

  I don't think it's necessary or entirely accurate to reference blockbuster movies as an example of appealing to an uneducated audience.

I think it's important to point out that most major media we consume, even as adults, is selling us an overly simplistic narrative (a lot of people for example think that House of Cards is an accurate reflection of what US politics looks like because it's cynical, and it definitely contains a lot of truth to it, but it still simplifies things immensely to create a compelling narrative), so I'm going to try to reinforce and save this point rather than abandon it just yet. Would it help if I clarify that I'm specifically referring to people's ignorance about the issues addressed, and it's not about being "stupid" at all?

  However, at the end I didn't get the impression that any conclusion had been reached.

The conclusion was basically this:

"Acknowledging complexity would directly challenge our surety in the rightness of our Values, and so we do not confront our naivety in these fields because it is far easier to take an assertive stance that makes sense to our Values than to face the uncertainty of a complex world."

Do you feel like it needs something that's more explicit? Like "This is what you should do?" There's something in me that resists being so directive, though maybe just a summary of things to be aware of would be good?
