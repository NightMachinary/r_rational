Okay, now I get what you meant. I retract my criticisms, though the specific wording could possibly be better. I like the example you give of House of Cards since that's considered relatively "high brow" media, and while I don't believe it appeals to ignorance I completely agree that it doesn't dispel it.

For the conclusion, I misunderstood and thought you were saying "this is the way it is" rather than "this is what we shouldn't be doing". It's not an entirely new idea and I think effort should be put into how to correct this incentive for toxic behavior, but it remains a useful insight.
