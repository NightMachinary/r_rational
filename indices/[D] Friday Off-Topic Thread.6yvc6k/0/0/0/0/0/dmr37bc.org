Makes sense, thanks! New ending:

  Acknowledging complexity would directly challenge our surety in the rightness of our Values, and so we do not confront our naivety in these fields because it is far easier to take an assertive stance that makes sense to our Values than to face the uncertainty of a complex world. But that's exactly what we have to be willing to do if we want to ensure our beliefs are aligned with reality.

  Simplicity should be embraced in predictive models that are demonstrated to work, but we should be skeptical of it when debating hypotheses about how the world works.  Being "naive" is considered a bad thing because it makes one easy to fool... including by one's own preferences and biases.
