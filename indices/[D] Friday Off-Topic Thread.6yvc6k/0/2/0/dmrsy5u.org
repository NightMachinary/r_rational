  Pedantic frenchperson here. It's actually spelled either naivete (english version), or naïveté (french version).

That's what I thought too, but Oxford seems to split the difference:

I probably should just change the e :P

  Overall I think it could be structured better (maybe with distinct parts, a la Slate Star Codex)
#+end_quote

Right, would definitely have a section on that when I get the chance.

Thanks for the feedback!
