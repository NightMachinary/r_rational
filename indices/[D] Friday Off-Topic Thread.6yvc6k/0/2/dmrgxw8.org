Pedantic frenchperson here. It's actually spelled either naivete (english version), or naïveté (french version).

I agree with the point of the article... well, I can't finish this sentence, because reading it again, I don't see a central point. More like several, inter-linked points.

Overall I think it could be structured better (maybe with distinct parts, /a la/ Slate Star Codex). The whole point on rich people with Person A and Person B is interesting, but it's a bit of a tangent, and I think the whole dissertation would be more streamlined with a shorter example. On the other hand, the part about /House of Cards/ and how fiction portrays cynicism could probably be extended.

Also, you touch on the difference between naivete-as-positiveness, and naivete-as-simplicity in the beginning, but you present it more like a semantic "we use the same word for the different meanings"-type problem than a fundamental error we tend to make. People talking about naivete refer to an un-informed understanding of reality, there's no confusion about that. The problem is that people often think cynicism is equivalent to being informed, because both of those are traits you rarely find in young children.
