I have dealt with social anxiety in the past, but right now the main cause is a feeling of being antagonized. It's happened with my narcissist sister, though the primary source are dogs my family is watching that refuse to stop barking. There's one in particular that goes berserk every time she sees our cats and is driving me insane because she won't listen to us no matter what we do.
