I've learned to deal with social anxiety through communicating with others, meditating to relax, setting goals to step outside my comfort zone, and using my introspection to experiment with different mental strategies. When I'm being continuously antagonized, such as when a person refuses to stop doing something that they know I find annoying, all I can do is avoid the source of the antagonism or ask someone for help before I get overwhelmed.

I didn't finally get a break from my sister's verbal abuse until she left for college. Whenever she comes home I take care to interact with her as little as possible. I had to file 4 official complaints about a coworker harassing me before my boss held a meeting and told them to knock it off. With the dogs, I wait out their stay by distracting myself and boosting my serotonin through exercise, probiotic supplements, and lean proteins in food.

When I'm in a bad state and need to break my mind out of the loop it's caught in, I turn to slice of life stories. Anime like /K-On!/ and /Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid/ came along when I desperately needed somewhat-mindless wholesomeness to remind me that life can work out okay. However, my favorite example of this genre is the Avatar fanfic /What I Learned at SRU/, which you can read my full pitch for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6ffjma/monthly_recommendation_thread/dijbsfe][here]].
