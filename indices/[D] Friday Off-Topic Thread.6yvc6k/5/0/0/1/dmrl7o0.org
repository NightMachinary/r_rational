Do you mind sharing some of the causes? Financial, family, danger, etc? I have found my anxiety was completly caused by my fear of how others felt about me due to fear of not living up to expectations. I had to completly rethink my life, including selling my business, isolating myself from certain people, and exercising, and minimizing alcohol consumption. Exercise has been the hardest, but I feel much better and I am much happier. Because I don't feel the need to impress people any longer, making less money only impacts brands, and not quality. What I really learned was how to be more selfish, you stated you told a person and they aren't changing. Unless it is blood I would try to find others. There is a very small pool of people out there that can discuss a lot of topics the rational community holds dear, but if you find a hobby, it can be a great equalizer for common ground.
