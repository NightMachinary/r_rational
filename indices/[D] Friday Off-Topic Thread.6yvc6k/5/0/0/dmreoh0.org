That sounds nice, but at this point I'm not sure if it's possible for me to choose not to feel anxious about something. I've never encountered an external stimulus that caused me stress that I was able to stop from causing me stress, just work around it to prevent the stress from occurring. I've been dealing with chronic anxiety my entire life and have always had this problem.
