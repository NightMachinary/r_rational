  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference.

It sounds to me - from what you say - that what you're missing here is the serenity to accept the things you cannot change. The things that you mention here, are things that you /know/ you cannot change. You /know/ you cannot avoid. You /know/ they cause you stress. (And dwelling on this fact is just going to stress you out worse).

Any of your /current/ causes of stress may have individual solutions. I don't know enough about them to say for sure one way or another. But the overarching problem remains - that you do not have the serenity to accept a cause of stress that you cannot change.

...I don't /really/ know how to fix that. All I can suggest is not dwelling on it. Think about something else, instead. (Like pink elephants. Or better yet, make a deliberate effort to /not/ think about pink elephants.)
