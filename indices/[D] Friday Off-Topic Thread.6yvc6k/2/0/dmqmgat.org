A selection of blogs I read:

- *Politics, News, and Economics*

  - [[http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/][Esquire Politics Blog]] - Charles Pierce's political column is always a fun read for me, though this is more for entertainment than to broaden my horizons.
  - [[http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/][Lawyers, Guns, & Money]] - Covers American culture, news, and politics, co-written by a half-dozen academics scattered across America and England. More Left than Right.
  - [[http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/][Ordinary Times]] - Covers American culture, news, and politics, co-written by many bloggers. Generally trends Conservative or Libertarian. Good links collections posted here regularly.
  - [[http://marginalrevolution.com/][Marginal Revolution]] - The well-known blog of Cowen and Tabarrok, covering economics, culture, news, and rarely, politics. Premium-tier book recs and links.
  - [[http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/][Noahpinion]] - Economics and politics blog by economist Noah Smith
  - [[http://www.themoneyillusion.com/][The Money Illusion]] - Economics blog by market monetarist Scott Sumner

- *Skepticism, Religion, and Rationality*

  - [[https://plus.google.com/+KajSotala][Kaj Sotala's Blog]] - A blog about technology, culture, rationalism, by Kaj Sotala. Regularly links to interesting content.
  - [[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/marginoferr/][On the Margin of Error]] - A blog written by an ex-Muslim atheist living in Iran about politics and atheism.
  - [[https://freethoughtblogs.com/singham/][Mano Singham's Blog]] - A blog by physics professor and atheist public intellectual Mano Singham. Good discussions of politics and spirituality from a progressive atheistic point of view.
  - [[http://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]] - Psychiatrist Scott Alexander blogs about rationality, culture, and other sundry topics. Probably the best of the rationalism blogs.

I also subscribe to a couple magazines and newspapers that give me a regular supply of things to read. The San Jose Mercury News, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Foreign Policy, The London Review of Books, Car & Driver, and Popular Mechanics regularly give me plenty to read. I bet these offer web-only subscriptions too which is similar to blogs.
