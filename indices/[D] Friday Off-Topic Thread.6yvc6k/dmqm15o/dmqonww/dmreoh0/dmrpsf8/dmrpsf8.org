Have you tried therapy or medication?

I know some people that had good success using either of them. They had severe anxiety and managed to reduce it drastically to a level they can manage.

Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to work best from what I've been told.

Mental health problems may seem overwhelming, but this perception is usually caused by the condition affecting our brains, not by a fact of reality that it has no treatment. I had great success with therapy, some with medication, but I had the same perception of impossibility before.
