I've gotten really good at dealing with internal sources of anxiety, but I remain terrible at combating external sources and am not sure what I can do about that. I have a social contract with every person I know to be brutally honest about each other's behavior to resolve situations that make it difficult for me function, but when someone refuses to change their behavior after I've explained to them how it hurts my mental state I have no fallback.

It's gotten to the point where I'm screaming myself horse at dogs for not listening to me, so I think I need a new tactic. I have plenty of strategies to correct and prevent situations that cause me stress, but have no endurance for situations I cannot control. Cutting myself off from the world and exposing myself to relaxing stimuli is enough to calm me down when I'm having a panic attack, but it's always a temporary solution if the situation persists.

I thought I could get through life by using my problem solving skills to stop stress from forming in the first place, but I keep running into problems I don't have the power to change and just need to survive. Allowing anxiety to form has never been a concept I've considered before, to the point where I utterly despise stories where characters get continuously screwed over and don't succeed in a timely manner at overcoming the force that's hurting them.
