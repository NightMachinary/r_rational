Meds.

In my experience, anxiety is much like depression in that you can't just think your way out of it. You aren't anxious because you need to change the way you think, you're anxious because something is going on in your brain to make you that way regardless of logic or reason. Meds can help fix that problem so that you /can/ actually think through it.
