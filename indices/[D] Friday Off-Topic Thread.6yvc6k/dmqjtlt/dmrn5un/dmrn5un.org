I definitely agree with your viewpoint, and have to add that in a lot of ways, my worldview is what many would consider willfully naive. The fictional character closest to my view would be Papyrus of Undertale.

But I hold this view because I see cynicism as a sort of race to the bottom. It doesn't help anyone but oneself (in whatever regards it /does/) to look poorly upon people, and quite frequently, /genuine belief/ in them can change them. Not always, and I'm not advocating a lack of caution in how or where one shows such empathy, but I find it hard to imagine nearly as many situations where a cynical, pessimistic outlook could make the world a better place so much as their reverse.
