I think that's wishful thinking.

Ultimately, whether or not you're a cynic shouldn't be about what you wish the world was or what you want the world to become, it should be about having correct information. If the world is made of selfish people, I want to believe the world is made of selfish people, and if the world is made of kind people, I want to believe the world is made of kind people.

You don't get out of Hell by believing really hard that you're in Heaven, or by accepting really hard that you're in Hell. You get out of Hell by building tools, finding leverage, and maximizing efficiency.
