Yeah, I believe that cynicism, if we're defining it as "believing that people are motivated by self-interest; distrustful of human sincerity or integrity," is clearly wrong the same way that its opposite would be.

But (just for the sake of argument, I know you qualified that you don't advocate unthinking empathy) I do see Papyrus (and Pure Mercy Frisk) as basically that opposite. The second Papyrus meets a player who's morbidly curious, slightly bloodthirsty, or even just not curious at all in exploring the game's other options, he dies. And Frisk can only do what he does because the game's conceits are 1) The monsters are fairly weak, to the point that a child can get away with letting them attack him, and 2) He can reset as many times as he needs to find the right solutions.
