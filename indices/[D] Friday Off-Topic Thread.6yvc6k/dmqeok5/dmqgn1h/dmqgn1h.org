We can't reply to this in depth unless you mention what the root causes are. I'll go ahead and give my general advice:

If it's caused by a temporary situation focus on it being a temporary situation. I've found that I can push myself through quite a lot of garbage as long as I know there's a point where it'll end. Be prepared for delays though.

If it's a feeling coming from the external world (politics, international events) I highly recommend limiting the time you view or discuss such content.

If it's from work or interpersonal conflicts I'd try to make it a temporary situation. I.e. move or find a new job.

I hope it's not related to family.
