If you haven't read it and are familiar with 40k lore, I recommend [[http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com/index.html][The All Guardsman Party]]. This is a dramatization of a Dark Heresy campaign that the author is playing in, written from an in-universe point of view starting in chapter 2. It's no [[/r/rational][r/rational]] fiction, but it's a lot of fun if you like reading this sort of thing.
