Thank you for the feedback! I'll definitely go back and provide clarity for the type of issues you mentioned.

As for the perspective shifting from first to third person, could you be referring to the interlude chapters? The core chapters are written in Alec's first person perspective. The interludes are written in the third person perspective of other characters.
