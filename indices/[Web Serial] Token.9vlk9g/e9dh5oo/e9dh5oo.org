The premise (four friends or "friends" forced to play a game of unknown origin with weird rules) is interesting, but it escalates /way/ too fast for my tastes, and the first-person perspective locks us out of other viewpoints, making a lot of what the other characters are doing seem arbitrary and pointless. Then, starting in the second "arc", things just start getting too arbitrary and random, not the result of characters interacting with known rules, but characters interacting with /unknown/ rules, making the plot harder to predict and sapping a lot of the expected sources of fun for something like this.
