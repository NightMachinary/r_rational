Cool premise, but there were parts where I wasn't sure what each character was doing. Sometimes you are writing in first person but then refer to the viewpoint character's name in third person. It made me doubt who the narrator was supposed to be. (Especially when keeping track of who has the most points during the business game.)

I think that there is a difficult balancing act between explaining rules and jumping into action. My preference is very action heavy, but I think you might need to be more meticulous with your exposition. How did the players move from one tower to another? What did the surroundings look like? And even earlier, how did the players notice that they were in danger in the real world? (Why were they in danger in the real world?)

I gave a pretty casual/careless read but I think you'd do well with a beta. Ask someone to read a chapter and then summarize it for you. That might give hints about what sections are most clear or hardest to follow.
