Well I gave it a casual read through 1.6 and, I don't know, the premise seems interesting, but the chapters are really short, and seem like they should be merged. The escalation is abrupt and jarring, some bits are unclear to me, but that just might be the first read through.

I'll give it a go again in a couple of hours and write out a more detailed review, because the premise really seems interesting, I'm a sucker for that type of story.
