I think my /expectation/ on reading the blurb and getting through the first chapter was that we would:

1. Be given the rules
2. Be shown the reaction to those rules
3. See the characters cleverly accomplish their tasks

Alternately:

1. Be given the rules
2. See the characters balk at the game
3. See the consequences of not following the game
4. See the characters start to actually play the game
5. The story becomes either a character study, or a tragedy about people pressured into losing their other values in the face of survival

To take one example, I thought that Brad not revealing his card was because he immediately saw the game for /being/ a game and realized that it would be a tactical advantage to not reveal his goals, and/or his card contained something personally compromising on it. Instead, it was just that the game had told him not to. This isn't something that can be inferred from his actions, or from the text that we've been given thus far (especially as regards the game), it's just a "twist" without much punch to it.

In contrast to this, Brad's directive to be productive was something that /could/ be inferred, since it's noted as being contrary to what Alec expects. The reader can (does) figure this out, which means that there's some satisfaction when it's revealed to be the case. (Maybe not the story that you're going for, but it would be interesting for another player to figure that out and deliberately sabotage Brad's attempts at productivity in order to have more points.)

But before we've gotten much in the way of games and meta-games, we're off to the next thing.
