Thank you again. This was very instructive for what I need to fix. When I first set up the plot, this is what I anticipated writing (four friends playing out the game as it was meant to be played). Arc 1 was always going to end the way it did (for unknown reasons, the game starts trying to kill the protagonists), but I arrived at this plot point too soon. In my on-going re-write, I will spend more time having the friends actually play the game.
