Thanks for reading and giving feedback! Pacing seems to be an issue. I'm going to go back and spend some time getting readers better acquainted with the world and the characters.

The "unknown rules" problem is going to be harder to deal with, because I don't want to reveal too much exposition this early in the story. Still, I may have to. Or I could spend more time having the characters explain how they perceive the rules.

Also, thanks for The Metropolitan Man! I wasn't aware of your other works, but I'll start reading them soon!
