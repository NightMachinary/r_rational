  I was crushing it. The most recent service task had paid out $25,000, putting me miles ahead of the others. From worst to best, the rankings were Addy with $111,312, Blaine with $140,900, Brad with $142,000, and Alec with $190,950. Were the others even generating cash flows anymore?

I found this paragraph really challenging. I got concerned that Alec wasn't the viewpoint character! It was a silly thing to generate doubt but I admit I was reading in bed before breakfast...
