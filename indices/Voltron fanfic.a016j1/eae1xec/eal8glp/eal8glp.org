(IIRC disclaimer)

At least in the American version, the disassembly of goLion Voltron was a curse by the witch Haggar. So originally it was just a powerful humanoid mech, and the lions were a way to stop the mech from working by requiring all the pieces to be activated and specially assembled.

The explanation that it's beggars-can't-be-choosers lost tech was my first thought, but it just shifts the question backwards to whenever Voltron was originally designed. I think PR is the canon answer: a lot of stock is put into the idea that the legend of Voltron "brought peace to the galaxy" for a long time.

But I am now wondering if a reason can be postulated for designing goLion Voltron with Zarkon and Haggar in mind. I have some ideas, although they are pretty far-fetched.
