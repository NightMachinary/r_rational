this is one of those setting where an earlier age having a singularity, or at least a lot of lost tech, is a given. the lions are OLD, rediscovered technology. so rationally, they are using a weapon they dont fully understand and are unable to replicate. specifics depend on which version of the show we are talking about.

so you have a war with another planet, who can make giant monsters. and you have an old combining mecha in the basement that you can use... and oh hey, the princess is a replacement pilot for the 'dead' guy.

no, the least rational part is the mice. having their own episode.

from what i recall- the 5 lions get a force-field efect that makes it impossible to interrupt the combination sequence, but the activation of specific lions can be prevented (drain a lake). by comparison the 20+ vehicles version of voltron can have some parts prevented from combining, but the rest combined and the robot was missing that leg. the other version was 3 robots that make 1 robot... so yeah, version of voltron matters a lot.
