I'd be surprised; at least on a setting level, Combining Mecha as a sci-fi element is /really difficult/ to harden.

As a counterexample, I've seen TTGL sometimes get a pass around here since, in-universe, Rule of Cool is literally a physical law expressed as a function of Determination. It's already rational, from a certain point of view.

Without something similar to justify the cool stuff (sentient energy field that likes cats for some reason? Does the resistance value the PR and merchandising benefits of a brightly-colored hero-bot more than the costs of sub-optimal battleship design?) Voltron's premise runs into a /lot/ of problems in the form of "why don't they just ____?" and to my knowledge no one's yet had the /actual/ Determination to backfill that worldbuilding to even superficial Methods standards, let alone those of Pok√©mon: Origin of Species or R!Animorphs.
