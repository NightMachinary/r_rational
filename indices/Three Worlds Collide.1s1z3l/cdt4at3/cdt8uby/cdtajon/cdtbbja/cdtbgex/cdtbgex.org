Pain is by definition the sensation we want to avoid. If we grow to like pain, it won't be pain anymore, it'll be something else. So in the Captain Harkness level of immortality, avoiding pain is useless, and it stops being what we'd call pain on a philosophical level.

That is to say I agree to some extent.

However, complexity isn't a value in and of itself. If I had to pick two minds, Complexity would /not/ be anywhere /near/ the top of the choice criteria. And that's also a false dichotomy, we don't have to choose between having a highly complex pain-including life and a drooling blob of orgasmium. We can have a complex mind that doesn't experience highly negative physical sensations but is otherwise capable of qualia we can't even imagine as humans.
