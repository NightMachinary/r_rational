  In which our Hubble Volume is strictly finite. We can start traveling at the speed of light, and there's only so far we'll get before our constituent protons decay.

Right, if you're postulating that we eliminate the heat death of the universe but it will still keep an accelerated rate of expansion then it's not much use at all to torture anyone since our Hubble volume is strictly finite.

  So if there are 100 people in the world and I torture 99 of them (I'm the 100th) so that I can personally have a perfect life forever while they all suffer, you consider that all right? Or let's tighten the screws: I torture them for 100 years, and then they die, and then I keep living a perfect life forever.

No, I said that we can start talking about the problem once we go infinite. If we have an infinite population, any finite subset of it has measure 0. In a finite population, finite subsets have nonzero measure and so we can start talking about them. If there are 100 people in the world then the number of people you can torture will be finite, and it will be defined as a fraction of the total. The same argument goes for infinite populations which need an infinite number of people being tortured so that we can actually measure that as a fraction of the other people.

I don't actually /know/ the answer to the problem, mind you. There are too many variables, my brain isn't that good a computer. Will these 100 people reproduce? Will they live forever? Will their lives be worth living? If they live forever, will they generate an infinite spawn? I don't /know/ what fraction of a population could be justifiably tortured to guarantee ininite life-worth-living to the remaining, I don't even know if the fraction is superior to 1%. All I know is that it's superior to 0%, and torturing any finite number of persons to guarantee infiniteness to an infinite number of persons equals torturing 0% of people.

And none of those are actually answers and I'm not sure I /could/ live a life-worth-living in a Universe that required me to ransom itself with the lives of my fellow humans. I don't think I can occupy the epistemic state you're asking me to occupy. And I think that a sufficiently intelligent agent /should/ be able to find a third alternative. But /I/ don't know the answer to this problem.
