  I'm talking about the emotional one. Now, it could be that simplifying our emotional spectrum leads to Bad Places, but you could also be right that some emotions are outmoded evolutionary adaptations. I can't think what use a completely mature species has for squick/disgust, for instance.

Which is why I say that just shouting complexity isn't enough. Coherent Extrapolated Volition is a /hard problem/.

  As for consciousness, Schmidhuber was using the "aware of my own awareness"/strange-loop definition. He pointed out that if you gave a Goedel Machine the problem of solving a maze, it would simply self-rewrite into a maze-solving algorithm and thus eliminate its own consciousness.

I see. Interesting. We don't know that the strange-loop definition is sufficient for what we'd intuitively call personhood, though, just that it's necessary (I think). However, I disagree that if a conscious machine has as its maxim and only goal solving mazes it will probably self-modify to become a maze-solving algorithm. It would probably create an army of maze-solving machines to solve as many mazes as it could at the same time, and when it ran out of mazes, it might make new mazes. If its objective was solving a one specific maze, however, it'd probably self-modify into an unconscious maze-solving algorithm indeed. And it'd be "happy" all along, satisfying its own Utility Function.

  But a lot of people like a child's cognition, because it's simple. It's a world of big, bold colors where you never experience the frustrations of nuance, of gray areas. It's a reality that beats you over the head, emotionally, and lots of people, for a semi-justifiable reason, like that a lot better than an adult world that's often so gray and complicated you don't feel like you're feeling or experiencing anything significant at all.

  I'm not saying "We should revert to the cognitive level of children" is actually a good idea. I'm saying that it's an easy place to make a mistake in your self-redesign.

I think those people don't actually /remember/ what being a child was like xP My bet is that the vast majority of them, if made into a child for one day and then on the next be allowed to retain the completely fresh memories, would change their minds on the spot. But yeah, I agree it's not an easy problem either.

  What do you mean here?

I mean that post humans will probably not look psychologically like children or adults or anything we can actually currently imagine. Or at least, unlike anything we /have/ imagined.
