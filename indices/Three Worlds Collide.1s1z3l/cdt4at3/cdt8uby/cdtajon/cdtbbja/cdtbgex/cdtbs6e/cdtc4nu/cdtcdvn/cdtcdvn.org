Sorry, ok, let me clarify.

Complexity... two meanings here: computational complexity and emotional complexity. I'm talking about the emotional one. Now, it could be that simplifying our emotional spectrum leads to Bad Places, but you could also be right that some emotions are outmoded evolutionary adaptations. I can't think what use a completely mature species has for squick/disgust, for instance.

As for consciousness, Schmidhuber was using the "aware of my own awareness"/strange-loop definition. He pointed out that if you gave a Goedel Machine the problem of solving a maze, it would simply self-rewrite into a maze-solving algorithm and thus eliminate its own consciousness.

  I mean, children have very little cognitive ability, do not deal well with surprises, failures and not getting what they want, and would probably not do very well in our Big Unfriendly Universe by themselves.

But a lot of people /like/ a child's cognition, because it's /simple/. It's a world of big, bold colors where you never experience the frustrations of nuance, of gray areas. It's a reality that beats you over the head, emotionally, and lots of people, for a semi-justifiable reason, like that a lot better than an adult world that's often so gray and complicated you don't feel like you're feeling or experiencing anything significant at all.

I'm not saying "We should revert to the cognitive level of children" is actually a /good idea/. I'm saying that it's an easy place to /make a mistake/ in your self-redesign.

  I don't think adults would fare much better either, though. I'd think humanity would move... well, somewhere else entirely.

What do you mean here?
