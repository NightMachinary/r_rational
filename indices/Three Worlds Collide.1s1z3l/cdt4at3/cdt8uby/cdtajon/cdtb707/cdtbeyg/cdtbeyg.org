  Strangely enough, I've already considered this, and have a cached answer: my rejection is, in fact, that I think we acquire a lot of positive traits through the actions we take and the skills we learn to avoid painful outcomes. We all know, for instance, that children who grow up with riches and golden parachutes all their lives... never really grow up. Taking away pain /entirely/ doesn't enable someone to become the best version of themselves.

I was talking mainly about physical pain. I don't see why we should need it. Emotional pain /does/ sound like it's useful, however. You only become a grownup by being put in grownup situations.

  That doesn't mean we need to maximize pain, or simply accept levels of pain decided by Nature. Melioration is a real and proper attack on pain, and an ideal world should contain /just enough/ pain to enable learning to overcome it, /and no more than that/.

  As I put it to someone on another subreddit: in a good future, people might well cry over spilled milk, having nothing more genuinely tragic or evil happening to them. However, crying over spilled milk or a stubbed toe, and then learning resiliency and discipline, is better than simply removing pain entirely and having a race of spoiled brats.

I like that.

  And "romantic jealousy"? Remember, the Superhappies don't experience /attached, devoted love/ as we do, because they decided /romantic entanglements were too painful/.

I had forgotten about that, actually. I mean, I don't think romantic jealousy should be a thing because I personally feel it's quite silly to become possessive of a person you love, but that's part of my personal polyamorous philosophy. As for the removal of love, /bad/ thing.

Okay, you convinced me, I changed my mind. The Superhappy outcome is a bad one. Mainly because I think there should be some third alternative that is better. As you said, "We can and should do much, much better than them."

(But I wouldn't say no to keeping the old sensations /and/ adding the bizarre new ones previously known only to Cthulhu Below, either.)

TL;DR: I agree with you that the Superhappies suck and we should find a better third alternative. I don't think /physical/ pain should exist anymore because it's stupid, we can design better ways of making ourselves avoid physical damage without having to add the whole negative sensation thing, but other kinds of emotional pain can be useful in a human brain. This might not be valid for a posthuman, though.
