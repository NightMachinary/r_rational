Devil's Advocate: Yudkowsky himself said that he doesn't know which one would be the best scenario - he actually said he has fun watching people argue about which one he was really defending when he was defending neither.

My position: Sure value is complex, but are you sure you're not rationalising pain and sadness just like you used to rationalise death? And do please think for five minutes before answering. Have you actually examined your internal beliefs, weighed your reasons and found your true rejection? I used to think the true ending was the better one but I'm not so sure anymore. Mainly after reading [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/damagereport.shtml][this short story by Alicorn]].

In fact, I believe people romanticise pain and sadness as much as they romanticise death, and while sadness couldn't be eliminated (whatever lowest level of possible happiness there was would become the new highest level of possible sadness) (not sure the logic follows) pain should be.
