  Sure value is complex, but are you sure you're not rationalising pain and sadness just like you used to rationalise death?
#+end_quote

I never rationalized death as being /a good thing overall/ (growing on the /Young Wizards/ series does that), but I was not a transhumanist. I'm still not, really: I don't believe in getting my hopes up when no attack on "the death problem" has been even /partially/ successful thus far. Fund research? Hell yes. Start preaching from the mountaintops about how with strange aeons even death has died? No.

  And do please think for five minutes before answering. Have you actually examined your internal beliefs, weighed your reasons and found your true rejection?
#+end_quote

Strangely enough, I've already considered this, and have a cached answer: my rejection is, in fact, that I think we acquire a lot of positive traits through the actions we take and the skills we learn to avoid painful outcomes. We all know, for instance, that children who grow up with riches and golden parachutes all their lives... never really grow up. Taking away pain /entirely/ doesn't enable someone to become the best version of themselves.

That doesn't mean we need to maximize pain, or simply accept levels of pain decided by Nature. Melioration is a real and proper attack on pain, and an ideal world should contain /just enough/ pain to enable learning to overcome it, /and no more than that/.

As I put it to someone on another subreddit: in a good future, people might well cry over spilled milk, having nothing more genuinely tragic or evil happening to them. However, crying over spilled milk or a stubbed toe, and then learning resiliency and discipline, is better than simply removing pain entirely and having a race of spoiled brats.

EDIT: Oh, and that doesn't even begin to take account of masochists.

  In fact, I believe people romanticise pain and sadness as much as they romanticise death, and while sadness couldn't be eliminated (whatever lowest level of possible happiness there was would become the new highest level of possible sadness) (not sure the logic follows) pain should be.

And "romantic jealousy"? Remember, the Superhappies don't experience /attached, devoted love/ as we do, because they decided /romantic entanglements were too painful/.

Now, being in a long-distance and sometimes rocky long-term relationship myself, I feel qualified to rule on this one. Being attached and being in love is /way better/ than not, be that being single or screwing around (or /trying/ to screw around, in the case of us nerds :-p). I don't think anyone should give that up because it's /difficult/ sometimes.

TL;DR: The Superhappies /suck/, and I don't want my species joining theirs. We can and should do much, much better than them. I refuse to vote to scoop entire distinct color channels out of the sensory spectrum. If, on the other hand, you'd like to put new colors /in/, bizarre new sensations and emotions previously known only to Cthulhu Below, then go ahead ;-)!
