Actually, let me counterpoint with an alternative imagining: imagine you were fully, completely immortal. As in, Captain Jack Harkness-level immortal: you can't even be blasted into atoms, it will take a full-blown Reality Warper to get rid of you, and even /they/ might not be able to.

/In that case/, why would you even /want/ to eliminate pain? You don't want to run short of possible sensations or values in your everlasting life, do you? Surely you'd prefer your own mind have more complexity and for life to be more interesting versus simply trying to simplify yourself into a drooling blob of orgasmium in fear of the Reaper?
