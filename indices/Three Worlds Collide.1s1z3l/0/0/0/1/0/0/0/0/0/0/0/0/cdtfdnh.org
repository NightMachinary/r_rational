  I cannot picture myself during any second of these 300 years thinking that 300 years of torture could possibly compare to an eternity of life for every other lifeform in the universe.

Today you think it's worth being tortured for a day to prevent the heat-death of the universe. Tomorrow, you will still think it's worth being tortured for another day to prevent the heat-death of the universe.

Therefore, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1rflkj/storming_the_ivory_tower_the_girls_who_walk_away/][Omelas and Kyubee decree that you are tortured for eternity]], /proof by induction on the positive integers/. Yet that's obviously a repugnant conclusion, against which our very souls rebel (except, of course, for those ingenious "rationalists" who have carefully trained themselves /not to be affected by their moral intuitions whatsoever/).

So the question is: if we decree it ok to make a partial human sacrifice (which can be as large as 300 years of torture or as small as having to hold a job instead of getting everything for free), but not to make a /whole/ human sacrifice, then how do we build our ethical decision process to ensure sacrifices will always be partial?

In more general terms, if some values are "louder" (they remain morally significant over a longer time horizon) and some values are "quieter" (they attenuate more quickly), how do we avoid an inversion of control where our short-term plans accidentally overprioritize short-term values at the cost of long-term ones -- not because of a moral decision but because "short term" might come to mean "over the next year" and that's all we can plan for? This is already a problem in many human institutions.

  But the rest of the objections are exactly why CEV is a hard problem x)

Has anyone ever actually documented this? Like, I've read some of the FAI literature, but I don't recall people trying to actually explicate and unpack what the fuck this CEV thing actually is.
