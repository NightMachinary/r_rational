  Yes, we are doing it. It's part of the unsolved problems of FAI, with a lower priority than "making sure it won't go Unfriendly somewhere during its self-updating."

+Why? I would have figured that a /rational and self-analyzing/ AI won't allow itself to shift values during its self-update. It would simply perceive a deviant self-update as negative-utility and avoid that.+

EDIT: In order to do so it would need a Timeless Decision Theory whose mathematics is equivalent to the stable self-update problem. Though I still don't understand why the insistence on using model theory rather than some other branch of program verification.
