I... find that very strange? I mean, children have very little cognitive ability, do not deal well with surprises, failures and not getting what they want, and would probably not do very well in our Big Unfriendly Universe by themselves.

I don't think adults would fare much better either, though. I'd think humanity would move... well, somewhere /else/ entirely. And this whole argument sounds like you're just [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ix/say_not_complexity/][saying "complexity"]] and acting like you're done. It's not immediately obvious that just because a thing is less complex than what we currently understand as a conscious, living, thinking being it is necessarily /not/ conscious, living and thinking. Complexity is a /consequence/ of what we are and how we're set up, it's not the cause nor the goal.

Actually, it is likely that a good deal of what makes our brain complex is just the result of millions of years of Natural Selection's patchwork and at the very least the /first step/ out of human hardware will involve tremendous simplifications in our own selves. And physical pain looks a /lot/ like that. It's a feeling that was evolved purely and exclusively because those who had it exposed themselves to less dangers; it's a completely universally negative feeling that's supposed to be a reaction to injury and damage.

And then you have masochists. So the issue isn't as /clear cut/.

I think the solution will probably include not feeling /accidental/ physical pain, which is to say that we won't feel horrible levels of pain because we accidentally lost an arm in a woodchipper, just a beeping warning in our heads that our arm is gone and we should go get a new one (like Alicorn's story); while at the same time we should keep /voluntary/ physical pain.
