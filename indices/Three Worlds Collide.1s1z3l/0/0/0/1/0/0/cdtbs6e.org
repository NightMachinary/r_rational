  However, complexity isn't a value in and of itself. If I had to pick two minds, Complexity would not be anywhere near the top of the choice criteria. And that's also a false dichotomy, we don't have to choose between having a highly complex pain-including life and a drooling blob of orgasmium.

I agree that it's a false dichotomy, but not a /completely/ false dichotomy. To paraphrase Juergen Schmidhuber in one of his Goedel Machine papers, a self-modifying agent that determines its optimal program is /less complex/ than a conscious, living, thinking being will most efficiently obtain its goals by permanently sacrificing its own complexity and consciousness.

Some self-modifications towards less complexity can also be self-reinforcing on a much longer, slower timescale than that. Consider, for instance, if people decided, in slow succession, that they preferred to be more like children than what we today consider adults.

Actually, yes, consider /that one/, because I can't actually think what the right answer is there, so it's /interesting/.
