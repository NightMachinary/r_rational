  But what about in the middle? I mean, is it ethical to torture you for 300 years if it will, for instance, prevent the heat-death of the universe? You might approve before and after, but every "before" and every "after" are, at some point, the present. If we approve of our lives only when we're not actually living them, we've done something wrong there, too.

I cannot picture myself during any second of these 300 years thinking that 300 years of torture could possibly compare to an eternity of life for every other lifeform in the universe. But then again, too much pain might just turn off the smart part of my brain. I do know people can be trained to withstand any kind of pain.

But the rest of the objections are exactly /why/ CEV is a hard problem x)
