In which our Hubble Volume is strictly finite. We can start traveling at the speed of light, and there's only so far we'll get before our constituent protons decay.

So if there are 100 people in the world and I torture 99 of them (I'm the 100th) so that I can personally have a perfect life forever while they all suffer, you consider that all right? Or let's tighten the screws: I torture them for 100 years, and then they die, and then I keep living a perfect life forever.
