  Okay so um... this is a very very complicated problem because if you take any finite number of people, their sacrifice will still be worth making reality last forever for the infinite number of other people.

Who said the number of other people is infinite? We live in, as far as we know, a strictly finite universe. There is a finite amount of torture versus a finite amount of other people.

Now, we're preventing the heat-death of the universe, so we're at least hypothetically talking about being able to transform that finity into infinity, but come on. Surely we should be looking for ways to take the infinite torture in shifts, or make do without it entirely.

  That is to say, my soul does not in fact rebel against the conclusion that torturing one single person forever is not a valid price to pay for the eternal life of an infinite number of other people. Even if the tortured person is me. My moral intuition says that the result - an infinite amount of life-worth-living to an infinite number of people - is worth the sacrifice.

But doesn't that mean that, again, through proof by induction, you'll sacrifice everyone to save everyone? How many people, at minimum, must be actually enjoying their lives to make the sacrifices worthwhile?

If I have a Kyubee torture everyone else in the universe all the time so that /I and I alone/ can a perfect life forever, is /that/ worth it?

Where's your sense of individual rights? Where is the cross-over point in your utilitarian spectrum at which this becomes unacceptable? And by the way, doesn't sum-total utilitarianism result in the Mere Addition Paradox, also known as Robin Hanson's Malthusian dystopia?

  I don't think so, but the impression I had was because CEV was already properly labelled as "magical." We have no idea how to do it, and we don't pretend we do either.
#+end_quote

Isn't the whole point of "rationalism" that instead of just looking away from things and saying, "That's magical!" we actually clarify our thinking, unpack our questions, do mathematical and empirical examinations, and /come to some freaking answers?/
