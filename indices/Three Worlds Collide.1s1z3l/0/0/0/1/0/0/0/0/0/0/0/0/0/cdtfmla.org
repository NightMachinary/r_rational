Okay so um... this is a very very complicated problem because if you take any finite number of people, their sacrifice will still be worth making reality last forever for the infinite number of other people. It only starts really being a problem if you need an infinite number of people to suffer forever because then you can actually compare the infinities (both countable, of course, because sapients are a discrete quantity) (or are they?)

That is to say, my soul does /not/ in fact rebel against the conclusion that torturing one single person forever is not a valid price to pay for the eternal life of an infinite number of other people. Even if the tortured person is /me/. My moral intuition says that the result - an infinite amount of life-worth-living to an infinite number of people - is worth the sacrifice. It also says that whatever third alternative that doesn't involve dooming anyone to eternal torture is to be preferred.

  Has anyone ever actually documented this? Like, I've read some of the FAI literature, but I don't recall people trying to actually explicate and unpack what the fuck this CEV thing actually is.

I don't think so, but the impression I had was because CEV was already properly labelled as "magical." We have no idea how to do it, and we don't pretend we do either.
