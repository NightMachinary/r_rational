There's actually several fics doing that, although generally more organisation-based rather than a single person doing detective work. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]] has an infiltration, and the sequel of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/40/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]] also touches on it.
