I'm one of those pro-Fiona people, but I am willing to admit that what I really want is a story whose premise is "someone trying to infiltrate wizarding society and break the masquerade". The fact that it's grafted onto this story probably doesn't do it many favors.

(I started writing my own story along those lines, but it wasn't working well enough to continue with.)
