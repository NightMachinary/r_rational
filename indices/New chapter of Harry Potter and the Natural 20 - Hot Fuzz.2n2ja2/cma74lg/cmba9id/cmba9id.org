Avoiding Polymorph because it's so broken was actually pretty popular back on the old D&D 3.5 Character Optimization boards. Milo has a lot of their other quirks too, like a love of Benign Transposition and the Spontaneous Divination option. On the other hand, he's broken much more serious taboos before.

Story-wise, having Milo be able to pull new forms out of nowhere is a lot less satisfying than his limited list of abilities. And a lot of challenges would be negated by his options to be a 7-headed hydra or an invisible flying will-o-wisp.
