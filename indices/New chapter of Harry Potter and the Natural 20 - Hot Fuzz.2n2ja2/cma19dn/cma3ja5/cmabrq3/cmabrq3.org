I think the problem is that Fiona, in some sense, has the least power compared to the problem she's trying to solve, which puts her in the most jeopardy and is a huge gravitational force attracting the story to her. Same reason HPMOR's perspective shifted hard toward Hermione after Ch. 63; Harry had become too powerful post-63, and couldn't be the center of the story again until the threats had amped up far enough to balance, but the threats couldn't come out of thin air, so they had to develop out of the story, but the story couldn't center on Harry until the new threats appeared, etcetera.
