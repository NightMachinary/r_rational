This post was removed by AutoModerator due to the number of reports it received for being off-topic. I agree with that assessment, since this is mostly a post about the means and methods of critical discussion rather than rational fiction per se, and seems like it would be much better deployed to combat the problem as it happens, rather than as a general message to this subreddit (which we don't encourage). Feel free to repost it in the Friday Off-Topic thread.
