The solution to a vague term is an explanation of what the term means. Yes, if I call Rey a Mary Sue, that's dangerously vague---but, if I call her a Mary Sue /and provide a dozen examples comparing her to Luke Skywalker/, I'm providing a definition for the term. However, even though in theory the term is superfluous when you can use the definition instead, in practice I don't always have my definition available---at this very moment, for example, I can't post my two or three images comparing Rey and Luke because I'm on my phone and the images are on my computer.

There's a continuum between "every use of this vague term is bad because the clearer alternative is just as convenient to use" (/e. g./, generic singular "they" vs. explicitly saying "they (singular)" or just not using a pronoun at all) and "some uses of this vague term are allowable because the clearer alternative is cumbersome to use" (/e. g./, "Mary Sue" vs. a specific list of the character's missing faults and failures).

Furthermore, moderation must be destroyed.
