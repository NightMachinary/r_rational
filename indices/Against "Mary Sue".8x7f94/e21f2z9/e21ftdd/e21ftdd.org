Saying that a story with a Mary Sue in it is one that revolves principally around the Mary Sue (to the exclusion of everything else) is a good definition in theory, but it still relies on the subjective observation of the critic. In effect it's the same, because the only indicator of /whether/ a Mary Sue is a Mary Sue is whether it meets the criteria outlined in my post. Only counting "pure" Mary Sues that meet all of the criteria will make actual instances of the trope astonishingly rare, and the kind of stories that fit the Pure Mary Sue category will generally have much more to worry about than the story revolving around the protagonist. (like /My Immortal/) Besides, we should take the word to mean how it is colloquially used if it's used more often that way. Otherwise we have the perfect set-up for a motte-and-bailey argument.

Also, no matter /what/ the phrase Mary Sue means, so long as it's a conglomeration of lower level deficiencies in a story, it would still be more accurate to address those lower level deficiencies. A big concept will have a larger concept-space, and a large concept-space means a larger body of fringe examples that require time and argumentative energy to properly classify. And the more a concept stands for, the easier it is to include hidden connotations.

EDIT: This is a less formal but related argument. I dislike terms like "wish fulfillment" and "power fantasy" because they usually imply that the author is /wrong/ for writing a power fantasy, which is inane. "The author wrote this because they had a strong desire to see it written." is essentially the same argument - you wouldn't expect an author to write something they didn't want to see. The problem is /obvious/ wish fulfillment, but if it's obvious wish fulfillment the problem is that it's obvious, not that it's wish fulfillment.
