  So does every other criticism...
#+end_quote

Every criticism is subjective, some criticisms are more subjective than others. The Mary Sue isn't bad /because/ it relies on subjectivity, it's bad because it relies on it more than most. This is because in its unrestricted form, it contains a large number of works.

No it doesn't. I'm not saying an umbrella concept is bad, I'm saying that an umbrella concept has the potential to be misused because of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yuKaWPRTxZoov4z8K/sneaking-in-connotations][sneaking in connotations]], which I linked to in the post. Mary Sue sneaks in connotations like "the author wrote this purely for masturbatory self-satisfaction" and "the author is bad at writing". If you disagree with this point, I can gather thousands of examples of people using the term like this just skimming through the YMMV page of basically every work on TV Tropes, or leafing through reviews online, or online criticisms.

Note that in the case of the subreddit, we're running into debate about what is rational fiction or not. This is not in the design of the term "rational fiction" - we did not make the label so that everyone could get confused and argue over definitions, which is why we're redefining it. But there is no moderator to make the "redefining the mary sue to be less ambiguous" post, and arguments thrive off of being discussed, so people continue to accuse something of housing a Mary Sue. It doesn't just have the potential to be inaccurate, it has the potential to be inaccurate because it survived a long process of memetic natural selection purely for the sake of being applied as a criticism to as many works possible.
