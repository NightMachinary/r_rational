No, be blunt. I literally asked for it. If you have the power to show me how I am incorrect, then you are improving me in some small way. I do not think that you will do so, but I am happy to be proven wrong. Let us examine your list:

1.

I once again strongly disagree with this. Fear is a valuable tool and should not be discarded because it is unpleasant. In an ideal and magical world where all things are possible using any tools, then I agree that fear can be discarded. in the distant future maybe that will truly occur, but in the present and especially for this specific task, I cannot take it seriously that the use of fear for this specific purpose is unjustified.

let us imagine that what you have asked for has come to pass. we cannot speak of this idea of "Mary Sue". on average, how much effort would it take to explain to every writer who fearlessly posts a first draft that they have made a common error? how much effort could their self-doubt save, if they knew there was something to fear? instead of a void in which the utterances of "Mary Sue" are verboten, in reality they will see this concept pop up from time to time, and will be exposed to the idea of "here is a generic thing that we don't want to see". they will know fear, and they will expend personal effort to correct the most grevious of their errors, and grow in the process. the simple act of not censoring the idea from this community brings that about.

I mentioned the use of fear specifically as a tool to drive people away, in a selective and targetted fashion. some authors will not fear this reaction, and will instead lash out at critics. they refuse to change, and ask that a community change for them instead. I do not and will not ever feel bad to see such people driven from any given community.

my background in deontology is very much lacking, and I do not ascribe much weight to moral good beyond what things do harm and what do not, though the mention of morality does remind me - the foundation of western civilization was built on fear indirectly through the imposition of moral norms. hundreds of years ago, people didn't cheat on their spouse because, on average, people feared to be caught breaking that taboo (and subsequently punished by their community). if that were not so, then punitive punishment would never have been developed. on average, people did not abuse children, did not murder their neighbor, did not do all manner of horrible things because they feared what might happen if they were caught. these axioms, which have been baked into our culture over the centuries, all are rooted originally in fear, even if they are something different now. while modern moral systems may be founded on more positive principles (and in doing so achieve better results), fear definitely works until you have the luxury of developing that something better. we should not shut down our coal power plants until we have enough nuclear plants to handle the load, so to speak. nothing you have presented so far contains any benefits of sufficient magnitude to justify a horrific act such as censorship simply because you don't want fear to be wielded against people to a useful end. show me something which works better or takes less effort and I will happily abandon fear in this instance.

2.

while you are correct that writers are not soldiers, it should not be the case that a person is so fragile as to be unable to undergo the experience of having something they've written subjected to vague harsh criticism. this is one of the things which horrifies me most about people in recent years. it feels like an entire generation of people have somehow failed to learn how to manage their emotions. let people be offended, let them be hurt (non-physically). people are not brittle, either in body or mind, unless you coddle them. a person who never physically moves for decades to protect them from the possible harm of falling down will probably end up dying if somehow they did fall down. someone who cannot face small mental pains may indeed become hopelessly depressed as you describe. these fragile sorts of people are broken, and I refuse to adjust my world to make them safe. to be perfectly clear, I do not mean legitimate medical conditions such as clinical depression. I would never imply that someone who suffers so is weak or that it is their own fault.

regarding the idea of the meme of "Mary Sue", it would actually be a common sort of contagious anti-infohazard. an idea that protects you from itself once you know it. many hazards work this way. with respect to writing specifically it does actually make you a better writer for knowing it - every detail you know about what is not good writing potentially improves what you produce. once you know something exists, you are there after always on the lookout for it. Discordians call this the Rule of Five in its generalized form regarding human perceptions.

3.

I did indeed take the time to understand what you wrote. I just disagree with you regarding whether or not an imprecise grouping is useful. it is broad enough that a pathological reader could throw almost every possible story there. on average, however, that does not happen. the usefulness of such a label shows itself when many readers apply it to a story, and on average people will not apply it unless many of the vague criteria for this imprecise label are met. in the military it does sometimes happen that the term I gave as an example is used for someone who has a true medical problem such as a broken leg. in this cases the rest of the military community correct the person who used the term in a way which does not fit the average definition, or else this single aberant voice is ignored. the same is true here of this label: if someone wrongly labels a story, their voice will be alone or they will be refuted by another commenter. these vague labels only work effectively and are useful when they have the weight of a community behind them, not just a single voice.

4.

this one ties into the above - when an auther seeks to avoid such broad judgement, they make what effort they think will be sufficient to do so. the amount of condemnation, if any, gives them a more accurate read on what, specifically, it is that they need to avoid. it is impossible to account for the opinions of everyone, but it is possible to account for an iteratively observed average. the point of the scare tactic is not to ensure that they poll everyone, but that they do any polling and self-reflection at all. while it is certainly possible for a new writer to become good purely through consulting lists of things they should not write and things they should write, many writers improve through more intuitive means. technical lists for those budding authors who will seek them out, fear of condemnation for those who will not. isn't it better to be inclusive of as many learning styles as is reasonable?

5.

saying "this is a Mary Sue and you should feel bad" is not actionable, but this community does not provide that sort of feedback on average. I more often see something like "this feels a bit like a Mary Sue for the following reasons explained in five paragraphs with excellent spelling, grammar, and formatting..." which seems to me that the audience of this sub is indeed doing rather a lot of work.

 

I do apologize for consuming time if you cannot spare it. while I suspect that the inferential distance is less than you think, I also suspect you have a much firmer grasp on the theory of rationalism itself (while I tend to spend more time watching and adjusting people and things in meatspace to optimize time, effort, and effect).
