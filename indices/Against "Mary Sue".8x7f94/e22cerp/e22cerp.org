I disagree strongly, and fully intend to continue using the term, not just despite it being "toxic", but because of it. almost everything "toxic" in the world exists for a reason. "Mary Sue" is useful both as a categorical criticism to identify a common kit of writing failures to an author, and as a derogatory term writers fear being applied to their own creations. I expect the use as a categorical criticism of a work will be a common position, and thus vigorously defended by those probably better suited to do so than I, so I will leave it to them.

I will, however, attempt a defense of my intent to explicitly continue the use of a phrase with the specific purpose to cause harm to the feelings of others, as I suspect that position may be rarer and thus my contribution here will not be repetitive. I feel that having hurtful language which is extremely specific in who it targets to be an extremely useful component of enforcing soft standards.

Take the US military, for example. There is an extremely common bit of jargon which specifically refers to someone who goes to the doctor too often and for minor things, and misses a great deal of work because of it. this not only is not against the rules to do, but making any sort of rules limiting a person's access to medical attention would be illegal. thus, the denigration of those specific people is important to keeping soldiers productive, and the ability to wield a word which is meant to specifically hurt the people who have that negative behavior is amazingly powerful. with the inclusion of this word in common parlance, anyone who has this habit will continuously be reminded and shamed for it, until they either stop or are removed from the community one way or another.

as it is useful for the military, so too is it useful here. having a term in common parlance which offends and hurts the feelings of the type of author who would write a Mary Sue in the first place is one of the circles of protection in place which shelters our community from those authors and their stories. a writer who fears that they may be writing a Mary Sue has two options: either they will take steps to ensure that they are not to varying degrees of success and will grow as a writer regardless, or they will complain about the term, hopefully be ignored, and eventually will leave. in either case this community benefits, and I might go so far as to suggest that the fear of writing a Mary Sue itself may be one of the most potent protections against doing so. the refusal to change one's self and the demand that the community change instead should be a sufficient red flag that we should ignore that person.

while there may indeed be a good deal of subjectivity to the label of Mary Sue, that subjectivity becomes a valuable trait when it is used as something to avoid. in trying to avoid something which is subjective, the writer must take pains to try to see his work from as broad a perspective as he is able to imagine. avoiding the label takes work. and should an author fail, and receive this particularly painful criticism? at least in this specific community, they are more likely than not to also receive a list of reasons for it. thus the author is given the opportunity to see which specifics triggered the reaction, and how frequently the same criticism comes up. being able to sort through criticism and use it to better yourself is also a vital skill for a writer (or anyone, really).

I don't really know if I have made my point, but I do feel like I have probably rambled enough. please let me know if I have made any glaring errors, for I too benefit from criticism.
