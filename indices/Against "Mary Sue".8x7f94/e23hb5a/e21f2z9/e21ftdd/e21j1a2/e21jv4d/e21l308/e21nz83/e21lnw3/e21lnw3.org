The problem is that the vast body of criticism is misuse. Even Ardvarkeating's point, which spurred me to write this post to begin with. I didn't want to tell him off, because that thread had too much inertia and I've been sitting on this general Mary Sue counterargument for a while now. His specific issue with The Arithmancer was that she was praised for using basic modern military techniques when really she should have been scolded for not immediately using the most brutal and efficient modern methods to win the war. This is the minimum requirement for being a Mary Sue? Sure, he backed it up with evidence, but since when is "the author didn't think of everything" justification for all of the other baggage Mary Sue has. In no way is The Arithmancer central to the category of Mary Sue - he did exactly what I said in this post, which is wait until a single part of the story broke his suspension of disbelief and then fit the rest of it under that umbrella. And people do this /all of the time/. When does something stop being misuse and just start being use?

  it becomes bad wish fulfillment if they compromise the story to make it go the way they would've liked it to go in real life

But the dividing line between good and bad wish fulfillment is a subpar execution of storytelling techniques. If the author could have /possibly/ retained the integrity of the story while still doing the same wish fulfillment, then the problem wasn't the wish fulfillment damaging the integrity of the story, it was the author rushing, or doing a bad job of justifying themselves, or any number of other smaller failures. Criticizing them for "bad wish fulfillment" does nothing for the author or the audience other than point out where the failure occurred, and only reinforces the silly idea that wish fulfillment is somehow a badness-attractor.
