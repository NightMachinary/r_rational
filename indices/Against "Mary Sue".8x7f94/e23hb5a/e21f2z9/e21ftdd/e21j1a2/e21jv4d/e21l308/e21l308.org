then maybe object to misuse rather than use. it sounds like youre saying "some people are using mary sue without backing up their arguments, so nobody should use mary sue". [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8wvprh/rtffc_the_arithmancer_and_its_sequel_lady/e1zkqpb/][this dude]]'s criticism is more what i encounter on [[/r/rational]], where yeah they call her a mary sue, but he backs it up so you know exactly what he means (and he's totally right btw)

also on the wish fulfillment/power fantasy point...those are much better defined terms, and i think you might have a misconception on what they mean. it's not "The author wrote this because they had a strong desire to see it written" so much as "The author wrote this because they had a strong desire to experience it, but couldnt, so this is the closest they could manage" and it becomes /bad/ wish fulfillment if they compromise the story to make it go the way they would've liked it to go in real life

so of course wish fulfillment has a negative connotation because the only time it's ever an issue is when its done poorly.
