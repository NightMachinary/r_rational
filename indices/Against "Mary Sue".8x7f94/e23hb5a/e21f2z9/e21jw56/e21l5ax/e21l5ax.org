  I don't like being told what to do.
#+end_quote

That's precisely why I tried to be a little gentler about this, but I get the feeling I've prickled more than just you. I apologize if it sounds like a demand - I've just been bottling this rant up for half a decade of reading. As for the other points:

#+begin_quote
  The types of stories it is supposed to describe would still exist, and people would want some word to talk about them with, even if not this one. If I'm warning people why I don't think they should read a poorly-written power fantasy, I'll still use words like "Mary Sue".
#+end_quote

You seem to have grasped what I'm trying to say, but missed one of the key points. Incontrovertible Mary Sues still exist, but they tend to be very rare, and the works that they're in have other obvious flaws besides Mary-Suism which would be better to point out, and on top of that you still have an /incredible/ amount of works that are "borderline" Sues where you could argue one way or another ad-infinitum. HPMOR is one of these, Daystar Eld launched a massive reread investigation into this, and he could only come out with something like "I believe in this, but it's still probably possible to construe it in the other way."

  The solution isn't to destroy words that can be used for that--it's to notice when people are doing that, and not be fooled. And also try to get people to quit doing that, which is a really hard problem. Are the people you see using the term on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] trying to sneak in connotations? If so, you should address the problem directly when they do that, instead of suggesting we discard the word.
#+end_quote

What do you think I'm doing? (lol) I can't possibly write out this entire thesis every time I try to talk someone off the ledge, so I wrote a big post to convince people otherwise that I can link to. I think it's reasonable to expect people on the subreddit to read this at some point, and maybe it's a good enough meme that it sticks in their head and they share it around. I couldn't possibly destroy the word, but maybe having people think about what Mary Sue really means every time they use it will make them more reluctant to do so. ([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words][Eliezer also wrote an essay on this]]) You do exactly this when you say there are two possible uses for Mary Sue. If it's as simple as saying:

#+begin_quote
  ...the story is too much of a power fantasy and it's damaging suspension of disbelief.
#+end_quote

Then why not say exactly that? It's not too many words, and it's certainly more helpful. In fact, words like "power fantasy" have a large number of meanings as well - if I wanted to make my story less of a power fantasy, I wouldn't just turn down the "power fantasy" dial on my write-o-tron 2000, I would have to do other things like make sure that the character had a few more permanent losses and that he didn't grow too much better than the antagonist. If those things constitute better advice, then /obviously/ it's better to say those than to say "power fantasy" or "mary sue".

#+begin_quote
  It's not a coincidence...
#+end_quote

That was the whole point of me saying it was an enormous coincidence, so much that I couldn't have possibly made it up. The implication was that the coincidence was so big it couldn't possibly be a coincidence.
