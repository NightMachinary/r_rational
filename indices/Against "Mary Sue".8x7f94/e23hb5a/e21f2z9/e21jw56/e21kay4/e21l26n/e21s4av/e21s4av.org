The occasions when I'm inclined to call something out as a Mary Sue, it's because the characters virtues dissolve conflicts before they've materially inconvenienced that character.

More generally, It's not about a specific set or high amount of attributes, it's how many of the character's conflicts are overcome by attributes they're purported to have had since the start of the story. A character who's capabilities at the start of the story are sufficient to overcome all the conflicts that occur in the story.

This may or may not break someone's suspension of disbelief but that isn't really the issue. Rather, characters who never fail or need to grow reduce the tension, and that's a story structure problem.
