I'll just chime in what I thought a Mary Sue was, without ever having looked it up and only ever heard it colloquially:

A person who's so good at everything there's no real reason for anyone else to exist aside from creating conflict. And for this to /seem/ unrealistic or unreasonable to me as a reader.

So, mostly in line with your definition. But I won't argue strongly for this. I'm sure other people use it differently, but this is one point in favor of your guess.
