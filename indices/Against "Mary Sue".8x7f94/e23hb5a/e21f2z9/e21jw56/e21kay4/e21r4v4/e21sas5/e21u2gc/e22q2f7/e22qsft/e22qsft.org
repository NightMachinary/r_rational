That seems most sensible, I agree. The word is out there - it /exists/ - and trying to sweep it under the carpet won't work - tying it more securely to a useful and well-defined concept seems a much better strategy. Then, as with many other concepts, the short word can be used when referring to it tangentially, and the longer definition when it takes a prominent place in establishing whichever point one wishes to make.
