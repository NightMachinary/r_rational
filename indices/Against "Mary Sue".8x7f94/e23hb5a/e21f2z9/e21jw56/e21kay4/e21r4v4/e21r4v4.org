I had understood 'Mary Sue' to mean, in short, 'a character who is never at risk of failing to succeed, and who never loses anything'. I do see your point that there is a strong overlap with 'protagonist' in there, and there are indeed some very famous protagonists who would fall under that definition.

Consider, for example, Sherlock Holmes. When you start reading a Sherlock Holmes story, you know he's going to solve the mystery, win the case, and the rest will continue in more or less the status quo. But Holmes is not /quite/ a Gary Stu character, because he often not only risks failure, but often /fails/. He almost never loses the war, but he will sometimes lose battles along the way - sometimes come to an erroneous conclusion and have to frantically work to recover from the error (and, in one or two stories, even Holmes did fail to solve the mystery correctly).

Sherlock Holmes can take one look at a person and describe his profession and what he did that morning. A Gary Stu version would take one look at a person and describe the mystery that he was presenting and its solution; and in there we have the difference between a mere protagonist and the far less interesting Gary Stu version.

Which isn't to say that you don't have a good point... the term is perhaps being used too broadly, and it is reasonable to suggest that [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words][that phrase be tabooed]] in order to better understand precisely what the problem is with a given story.
