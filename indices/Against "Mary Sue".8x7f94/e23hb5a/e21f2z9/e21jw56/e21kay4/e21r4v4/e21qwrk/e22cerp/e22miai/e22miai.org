I don't want to be too blunt, but this is really, really wrong:

1. It's a general principle of western society not to rule through fear, and the utilitarian reason is that the order it creates does not offset the negative emotions it instills in people. The consequentialist reason is that in an open system, ruling through fear drives people away more than it brings them in. The deontological reason is that using fear tactics will reduce your moral character. I think all three of these arguments have merit.

2. In the military, we allow it because the possibility of disorder could destroy the usefulness of a military. You'll notice that writers are /not/ soldiers - their only instrumental purpose here is to entertain and possibly educate, and as a whole they are entirely individualistic. If an author can't write a good story, peer pressure isn't going to make them write a better story, it's going to make them sad and depressed, and then they won't bother writing a new story that has the possibility of being better. You don't want to discourage new writing from an author because every additional word is a word spent getting better at writing, and because badness is localized within an author. You can argue that maybe the Mary Sue is a meme that spreads from author to author, but I'm fairly certain it's just naivety from not knowing how writing works, and not some kind of contagious infohazard.

3. I made an entire post discussing why the Mary Sue isn't precise, and i would appreciate if you actually took the time to understand it. If the category is so broad that a minor infraction can allow a reader to lump that book into the rest of the pile, it's /not good/. It'd be like the military using that derogatory term about someone who broke their leg. I'd imagine that the author would rather read that events X, Y, and Z in their story stretched the suspension of disbelief of the audience, than read that their work is now a part of the category that includes stories like /My Immortal/ and /A Trekkie's Tale/. Saying that an author at the fringe should worry about the same failure as an author at the center is the non-central fallacy.

4. If subjective judgement requires a broad imagination on the part of the author to avoid, in /every possible instance of writing/, the audience will still be able to subjectively judge the author, because it's impossible to account for the opinions of everyone. You're going to say that the author /shouldn't/ account for the opinions of everyone, but if they don't, what's the point of using the Mary Sue as a scare tactic for doing so? And the Mary Sue is a contagious form of criticism - the louder the audience arguing for it is, the more it catches on, because people are attracted to conflict like moths to a flame.

5. Holy shit, at least leave /some of the work/ to the audience. If the impetus is on the author to write a decent work, the impetus is on the audience to write a constructive piece of criticism. If the Mary Sue isn't constructive in the sense that it provides direct, actionable feedback (which it doesn't, as I've gone over elsewhere in this thread) then it's not the author who has failed to live up the audience's whims, it's the audience that's failed to /correctly/ point out where the work became bad. It's like making a weather forecast saying it's anywhere from 0 to 800 degrees kelvin outside - the Mary Sue correctly encapsulates the boundaries of the failure, but you wouldn't say the weatherman has done their job.

And more, but I don't have much time for this, and your post seems to be a very large inferential distance away from my own.
