  "Mary Sue" is a category created in response to a suspiciously large number of stories with protagonists that share the same few traits. The most archetypal example of a Mary Sue is a female character that will be liked by the protagonists of the story and disliked by the antagonists for some tangential reason, who has very few flaws and many strengths, some of which are out of place in the setting, who also has some kind of relationship tethering her to the main cast whether it be familial or coincidental, and has some kind of sympathetic backstory meant to engage the reader in her story (and little else). There is a male analogue to this, the Gary Stu or Marty Stu, who has all of the same traits with the gender reversed.

from my experience 'round these parts, a mary sue is a protagonist who is too good at too many things in a way that violates suspension of disbelief and robs the story of suspense and a satisfying resolution. im not gonna argue about which definition is superior because that sounds boring, but i think most people on [[/r/rational]] who say "mary sue" are referring to something akin to my definition.
