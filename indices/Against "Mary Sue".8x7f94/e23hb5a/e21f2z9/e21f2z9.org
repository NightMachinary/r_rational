Personally, after the discussions I've seen on how to define Mary Sues and whether X character is or isn't one, the best understanding I have of it is that a Mary Sue is a character who the story and world revolves around to the exclusion of anything else.

The only point of other characters is to reinforce or oppose the protagonist, anything beyond that is frivolous set dressing. Further, since the only relevant points of those characters are their relationship to the protagonist, they are best served by having those points at the forefront of their character at all times.

The protagonist will have a backstory chock full of plot devices and tragedy because they're the only person that really matters. The protagonist's flaws only exist to highlight flattering features, or are flattering features masquerading as flaws. The protagonist is tethered to the main cast in order to have easy access to people who reinforce or oppose the protagonist.

There is overlap with protagonists as a whole in this, since a story will invariably focus on the main character and pay attention primarily to them and things relevant to them, and more than likely the protagonist is one of the most important people around, but the difference in magnitude is starker here, and it's not a difference that can be discarded. There's still room for ambiguity, someone might say that a story is a Mary Sue story because they feel it revolves around the protagonist too much, and someone else might disagree. This is okay, to me.

At the end of the day, I believe that a Mary Sue is less a quality of a character, and more a quality of the story at large, describing a story that has nothing to show but the protagonist and things directly connected to the protagonist, most commonly but not inherently wrapped up in a shameless power fantasy. Calling a character a Mary Sue, I believe, is an accusation that the story, world, and characters are not fleshed out and that the protagonist is the only character treated as a person.

I could be wrong about this, approaching it from the wrong set of assumptions or lacking a key insight, but from what I know right now I do think the term has merit.
