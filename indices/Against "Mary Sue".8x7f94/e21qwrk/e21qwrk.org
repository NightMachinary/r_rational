I think part of the problem we're running into is that we've expanded a term that was invented to describe a trend in fanfiction to use in general fiction.

In fanfiction, the setting that is being used already has a distinct fabric to it, a set of relationships between people and other people, between people and things, between people and the power they have, etc. Original characters that are inserted into these settings disrupt these relationships somewhat by their existence, if they are relevant at all.

The classic example of Mary Sue bent the fabric of the existing setting around her like a black hole, damaging the existing setting and characterization by their new relationships to her. Dangerous enemies were easily overcome, authority figures cede authority, etc.
