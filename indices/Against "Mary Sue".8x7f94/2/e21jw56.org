There are at least two ways to use the term.

One can use it to point out that the story is too much of a power fantasy and it's damaging suspension of disbelief.

One can also use it to insult stories one doesn't like, and maybe declare oneself high status by disliking a story.

Let's say we quit using the term "Mary Sue", finding it too easy to use for insults and status and less useful for describing actual flaws. We'll use the term "monofocal" instead to describe the same class of problems in a story. Well, as soon as the term is widely adopted, 'monofocal' becomes a handy insult and status grab. We'd have to discard that term as well. But won't we still need to refer to stories that damage suspension of disbelief by making the protagonist too perfect and too central?

It's not a coincidence that the Mary Sue, a type of protagonist, has all the characteristics of a protagonist. Even if those are the only characteristics a Mary Sue has, the way they are depicted can still make the Mary Sue distinct from protagonists without those problems. "Too much of a protagonist" would also be a useful description, although I don't think that's what Mary Sue means.

  Well, by definition...

The problem warned against in the blog post is people sneaking in connotations. The solution isn't to destroy words that can be used for that--it's to notice when people are doing that, and not be fooled. And also try to get people to quit doing that, which is a really hard problem. Are the people you see using the term on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] trying to sneak in connotations? If so, you should address the problem directly when they do that, instead of suggesting we discard the word.

  relying on the Mary Sue to express this dislike is not a good way to critique, because the category is so broad it doesn't allow you to suggest improvements.
#+end_quote

I think you're right. Part of the reason the term is so easily abused as an insult, is that if you are applying it correctly the work has so many problems that delving into the specifics isn't worth the effort. If you want to suggest improvements, at best Mary Sue is a launching point for more specific criticisms.

  I hope that, going forward, most of you abandon this word when describing a story
#+end_quote

I don't like being told what to do. Even if you are trying to make this a gentle suggestion, telling me to quit using a word makes me bristle.

#+begin_quote
  the world would be a much less toxic place without it
#+end_quote

The types of stories it is supposed to describe would still exist, and people would want some word to talk about them with, even if not this one. If I'm warning people why I don't think they should read a poorly-written power fantasy, I'll still use words like "Mary Sue".

#+begin_quote
  I would like to suggest reducing everything you read to its component pieces to be more accurate
#+end_quote

That is excellent advice and prevents many of the abuses of the term. I'm definitely going to use something more specific than "Mary Sue" when I have a criticism that's actionable. I'd also like to suggest that everyone do that.
