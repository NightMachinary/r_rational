Thanks for explaining.

  but they tend to be very rare

I think that they are common enough. Perfect examples are very rare, but plenty of stories make mistakes in the direction of Mary Sue.

#+begin_quote
  you still have an incredible amount of works that are "borderline" Sues where you could argue one way or another ad-infinitum
#+end_quote

That's a good point. I think the "don't engage in arguments with those whose goal is only to insult the work" is the best response. I don't think refusing to use the word would reduce arguing overall, but it might in some cases.

    If so, you should address the problem directly when they do that, instead of suggesting we discard the word.
  #+end_quote

  What do you think I'm doing?
#+end_quote

I meant that you should tell them immediately and directly. A few months from now this post will be buried. If the problem is connotations, we shouldn't fight against the words "Mary Sue", we should fight against the connotations.

If your goal was to recruit others to the cause of resisting the connotation issue, this post makes a lot of sense. We should just make sure we know what we're fighting--not the words, the hidden connotations. The words will help us identify them but aren't a perfect test.

  If it's as simple as saying:

  #+begin_quote
    ...the story is too much of a power fantasy and it's damaging suspension of disbelief.
  #+end_quote

  Then why not say exactly that?
#+end_quote

Well:

#+begin_quote
  words like "power fantasy" have a large number of meanings as well
#+end_quote

is part of it. The other part is that I used those related terms that you don't necessarily object to, to try and illustrate that these kinds of terms have value. There are many ways to state things, but I still think Mary Sue is a convenient handle for several ideas.

Regarding coincidence... I thought you were trying to say the terms were identical except "Mary Sue" has a bad connotation, making it worthless for all things except insults. My counter is that it is a subcategory, so of course the words overlap significantly. Mary Sue is useful despite that. Making the implication that a subcategory fits in its super category doesn't seem that enlightening.
