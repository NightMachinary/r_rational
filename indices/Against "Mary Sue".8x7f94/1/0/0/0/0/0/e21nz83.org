I haven't read the Arithmancer, but I've got to say that reading that comment makes me want to use the words "Mary Sue" half as much as I did previously.

I almost can't believe we are talking about hidden connotations because of a comment that makes arguments with masturbation, gratuitous swearing, all caps enthusiasm, and the word 'cringe'. The problem with that comment is that, whether he is right or not, 'Mary Sue' is the /nicest/ thing he said.
