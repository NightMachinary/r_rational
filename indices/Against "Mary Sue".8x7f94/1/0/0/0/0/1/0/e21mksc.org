  His specific issue with The Arithmancer was that she was praised for using basic modern military techniques
#+end_quote

that was one specific issue. i dont know if youve read it, but that is far far from the only one. its not even one of the biggest ones for me. the one that really killed it for me was when ron was only barely able to beat her at chess near the start, even though that was like...the one thing he's good at in this fic. and then they played together for a few weeks and she was better than him. and really, she's a better strategist, but they let him help sometimes cuz he has a relative advantage in terms of her time being better spent elsewhere. but again, thats just one more example out of countless others.

like, why is she so good at chess. its not like shes doing probabalistic analyses of every move or some such bullshit, she's just a super-smart-and-amazing-person.

  If the author could have possibly retained the integrity of the story while still doing the same wish fulfillment
#+end_quote

i think the problem is generally that...you can't. wish fulfillment implies that it's good stuff happening to the protagonist, cuz why would you wish for a bad thing to happen to you. and good stuff happening to the protagonist is very rarely good writing (the exception being, like, slice of life anime?)
