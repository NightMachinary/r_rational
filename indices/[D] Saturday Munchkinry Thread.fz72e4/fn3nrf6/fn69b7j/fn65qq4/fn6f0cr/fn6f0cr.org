This is a pretty dangerous power. Like, this is pretty much how you become Voldemort from Seventh Horcrux if you aren't extremely careful. You change your mind, then the new you with the changed mind changes it again, then again, and again, and soon you're totally insane and fall for your own lies.

The safest use is probably to just change your perception of time. If you can increase the speed of your thoughts without any side effects, that means you can get a lot of thinking done much faster than normal. That's great for all kinds of tasks that involve large amounts of thinking, like doing math homework or solving crime or writing novels.

Other than that, I don't think I would use this power much, not even to cure my depression. It's just too dangerous.
