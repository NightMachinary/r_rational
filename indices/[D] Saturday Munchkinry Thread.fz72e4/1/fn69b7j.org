Someone you're close to (partner, best friend, house mate, whatever) admits that they have mind control powers after you confront them with suspicions of the same.

They tell you they have the following limitations:

- The effect lasts ~2 minutes (so if you're ordered to dance, you'd dance for two minutes and then stop)

- The order is strong but not infinitely strong: a loving parent can't be ordered to kill their child, but all but The Most Pure and Fervent Believer would break a (non-violent) rule of their religion

- It requires eye contact and sunglasses grant immunity (blind people are immune at some level of "not being able to see their eyes")

- They claim they haven't ever done it to you

- You have reason to believe that they have mind control powers (you did confront them, after all), but you don't have reason to believe any of the above /specifically/ especially given the source

Discussion questions:

- How can you prove to yourself that they haven't mind controlled you? (e.g. if your partner mind controlled you into dating them, that would be a problem). At this point, you /feel/ as though you genuinely like them. Do you care?

- What information do you verify? How?

- Okay, how do you use your friend's power?

And finally, for people who don't want to participate in this thinly veiled attempt to help me write my story and just write how they'd end up with a volcano lair full of catgirl waifus:

- If you were the friend with this mind control power, with the limitations as stated above, how would you use it?
