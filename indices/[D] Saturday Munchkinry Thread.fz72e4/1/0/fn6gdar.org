  The effect lasts ~2 minutes (so if you're ordered to dance, you'd dance for two minutes and then stop)
#+end_quote

Do the 2 minutes have to be consecutive? Can the friend mind control a person more than once? What about mind controlling them several times in a row to extend the 2 minutes?

#+begin_quote
  How can you prove to yourself that they haven't mind controlled you? (e.g. if your partner mind controlled you into dating them, that would be a problem). At this point, you /feel/ as though you genuinely like them. Do you care?
#+end_quote

Evaluate how useful I could be for them were I totally mind controlled, and also compare how useful I am to them right now. If I am very useful to them if mind controlled and exactly as useful to them right now, then I have been mind controlled. If I am very useful to them if mind controlled but nowhere as useful to them right now, then I am not currently mind controlled, but I could be soon or could have been. If I am utterly useless to them, then I haven't been mind controlled and probably never will be, because why would they bother?

Note: By useful I mean, relative to other people they could mind control instead. For example, if I am much richer than everyone else near me, that raises the probability of me being mind controlled for the money. If I'm much poorer than someone else near me, then the probability that I have been mind controlled for money becomes practically nil.

Simply put, a mind controller isn't very different from a con artist. Most of the signs are the same.

Another approach that can yield great returns is to look for evidence that your friend has been in your life for a long time. If you can't find anything that suggests your friend has known you for longer than say, a week? That's a very strong sign that your entire relationship with them is faked, they have messed with your memories. On the other hand, if you find evidence everywhere that they have known you for years? That's a pretty good sign for you. If it has taken literal years to mind control you, why would they have done that instead of going for someone easier? The con artist rule applies again, no one will invest years of effort to scam someone when there are plenty of easier targets around (unless for some reason you are uniquely useful).
