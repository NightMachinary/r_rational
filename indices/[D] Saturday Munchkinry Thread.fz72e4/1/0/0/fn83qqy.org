Thanks for the great response - I especially like the very astute observation that your level of usefulness to them is important. If they've used their MC powers to become a billionaire and you're a friend from high school and you go roller blading together then yeah, why do they need to MC you.

  Do the 2 minutes have to be consecutive?

Think of the power as being an order that "decays" after two minutes. So you can't say "unlock this prison cell door and then when you go home put your keys in your letterbox" because the order would be "over".

#+begin_quote
  Can the friend mind control a person more than once?
#+end_quote

Yes (so they claim), though I think repeated MC would result in someone being changed mentally.

#+begin_quote
  What about mind controlling them several times in a row to extend the 2 minutes?
#+end_quote

That is fine (so they claim), but they state that it's difficult: 2 minutes is a "maximum" and it can wear off earlier or rarely slightly later, so if you order someone to dance, they could stop anywhere between minute one and minute two, so if it's important they don't stop you need to be ready to refresh the order; or to just be constantly screaming at them, every 45 seconds, to keep doing X.
