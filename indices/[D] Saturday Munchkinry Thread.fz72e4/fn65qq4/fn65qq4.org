*Faith; you can deeply believe anything you want and be sure that's true.*

You can believe in anything you want and you will immediatelly feel like it was true. You can change even your perception of pain and pleasure, of good and bad, etc, maybe even of time.

Of course, you can't really change anything except your own mind, you can't do magic, you can't get any external information about world that way, discover physics, etc....

You're just god of your own mind and manipulate it as you wish.

How would you live with it and what kinds of goals would you try to pursue with this ability?
