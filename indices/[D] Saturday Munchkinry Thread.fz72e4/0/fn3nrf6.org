Rebound: you can cause things to bounce off your body. When your power is "on", any matter, wave, or photon that impacts your body will rebound. This effect gives your body the appearance of a perfect mirror when your power is active. You can choose which body parts to apply this power to, but be careful; using it on your eyes makes you blind as photons bounce off, on your inner ear makes you deaf, etc.

Variant 1: The speed with which an object bounces off is equal to the /relative/ velocity between you and the object. This means that if you punch a brick wall, the brick wall molecules flee from your fist at the average velocity of your punch, with predictably explosive results. This variant means that using it on the soles of your feet while standing causes you to plummet through the earth, as the molecules bounce away from your feet.

Variant 2, less powerful, more challenging to munchkin: objects that bounce off you still transfer momentum, though you don't suffer negative effects from the sudden acceleration. This means you can't punch through walls, you instead bounce off them.

Variant 3, still more challenging: as Variant 2, but you /do/ suffer the effects of sudden acceleration. Your power will somewhat distribute the impact of e.g. bullets so they don't shatter your ribs, but the acceleration can still give you a concussion or whiplash or snap your spine.
