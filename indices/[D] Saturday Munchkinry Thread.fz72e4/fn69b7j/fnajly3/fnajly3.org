  How can you prove to yourself that they haven't mind controlled you?
#+end_quote

Record them commanding you to tell them if you've ever been MC'd. Only works if the MC'd version of you is able to answer honestly AND the MC requires a verbal command.

If those aren't true (or you don't know if they are true) then you could request a third party to place a hidden camera in your shared space to catch future MC activity.

You could also meet with old friends and ask about your likes and dislikes. Preferences change over time, but if there is enough disjoint (you picked up a ton of new sexual kinks, you went from being messy to extremely tidy, etc) you can assume tampering. You can also look for implanted memories (assuming those last beyond the 2 minutes) that couldn't have happened.

Pretty much any verification would require an unbiased 3rd party acting as independently and disantly as possible. Assume you could be compromised and give them up. Best would be if you could keep their identity secret from yourself, too (text-only anonymous communication? ).

  do you care?

Yeah, in all cases I require verification.

  how do you use your power?
#+end_quote

Depends on my circumstances and motivation, but at the very least I am going to make some money and have some fun.

The issue is that MC is incredibly unethical in many cases. It's right up there with rape in terms of violation when used to coerce. That said, there are uses that I wouldn't consider a violation: making sex more enjoyable for an already willing sexual partner, talking someone out of suicide, motivating a friend to work out (who already wanted to work out), stopping a violent crime, etc. I personally wouldn't hesitate to use my power casually for things like this.

Then there's gray area stuff. Getting a better than normal (but not outside the realm of possibility) deal on a car. Getting hired for a job. Getting a girl's phone number. Pranking someone (for example, telling some jerk to poop himself). This is definitely not moral behavior but a little bit of it is probably okay. If I had MC powers you bet I'd do at least a little of this.

And then there's the sociopath stuff. Rape. Major theft. Assisted suicide. Politics (especially if the power works across TV, you could absolutely dominate a nation while you are awake. If it works via recording too, you could broadcast "obey" commands continuously and have pretty much uncontested power). Any one of these actions pretty much instantly makes the character irredeemable.
