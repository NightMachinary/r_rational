I remember there being someone who asked a few chapter discussions back why people haven't seriously tried to kill the Stormbringers before, when there's no reason to believe they're not living breathing creatures that can't die if it's hit decisively enough. Well, I guess here's the answer.

Preconditions of needing pokemon that can fly for a long enough time to contest it. What appears to be high-grade and permanent Light Screen and Flash. Both of which, I'm assuming, was caused by so much electricity running through its body you can't even get near it without hearing a physically discomforting buzz in the air. Thunder or Thunderbolt powered up enough to OHKO anything that doesn't resist and/or doesn't have pseudo-legendary defences. Even theoretically immune things like Flygon is affected by secondary effects - wonder if that mention of heat being hard to ignore was an indication of Burn status. And with Pressure on top of all this causing emotions to overshoot, of course.

Anything I missed? Or, conversely - anything else it could have that wasn't explicitly demonstrated this chapter? Since abilities don't have the exact same mechanics here as they do in the games, I've been contemplating if legendary Pokemon have /all/ the abilities they could potentially have in games, instead of just one. Lightning Rod would fit with how its attacks are so powerful, for example, since it seems to be running so much electricity through itself it totally could've powered up its Special Attack by dozens of stages - though I guess its power could also be chalked up to it being just that powerful. Alternatively, it might also have abilities that haven't been given to it in games but would be appropriate thematically - Volt Absorb, for example, would make it plain unfair if Zapdos just running electricity through itself is enough to let it heal. Ah, the speculation.

All this makes me wonder again, though, what exactly motivates the legendaries to get near human cities. Is it as simple as animal instincts and holding so much power it just has to move wherever its impulse takes it? But if so, what makes it stick to Kanto instead of moving west sometimes to Johto? (Though that's maybe a possibility that could've happened once or twice, so what makes it stick to that area instead of relocating to somewhere like Sinnoh, for example? Assuming Sinnoh is located relevant to Kanto how real-life Hokkaido is to real-life Kanto region.) Or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is it some kind of intelligence that set it to clash with human culture? But if that's the case, what's the point of giving human society a metaphorical bloody nose every once in a while?

Other than that...Prof Oak's segment kinda made me reflect on myself. On one hand, I saw him as a supremely competent man, so seeing him so plainly screw up a job was surprising...but on the other, if I didn't have a direct line to his thoughts and was hearing a recording of that conversation, I totally would've thought he was just slapping those university presidents with the cold hard truth, wouldn't I. Though I guess it is pretty much both. And I guess there's still an opportunity for a mistake to turn into an advantage.

Thanks for the chapter.
