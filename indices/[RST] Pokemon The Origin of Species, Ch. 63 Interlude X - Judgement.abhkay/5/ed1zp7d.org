I'm a little confused about where Karen ended up luring Zapdos. The Elites were leading it southwest straight out of the bay, they drifted a bit too south towards Fuchsia, so Karen was trying to course correct... south again? Anyway after she's downed, which cardinal direction is Zapdos heading now, and is it vaguely hitting anything?

Good chapter. One thing I've liked about this fic is that it conveys a /very/ dangerous and scary world, but still keeps a sense of Pokemon Adventure^{TM} and doesn't devolve into complete "All pokemon are expendable murder tools that kill and maim each other horribly aaaahh" [[https://i.imgur.com/2Yni481.jpg][edginess]] it could very easily slip into.
