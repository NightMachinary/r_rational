I can't believe I forgot this, but I just remembered that Mewtwo actually has Pressure as well! I wonder if it just hasn't presented yet? Or maybe that's why everyone seems so unnerved by it (Mewtwo can have the Unnerve ability as well too apparently). OR maybe it only activates when he gets distressed, which would explain how it hurt the "comforters" way back in the first Mewtwo chapter.

Are Pokemon with Pressure immune to Pressure? They aren't in the games, at least, but imagine how horrible it would be to have TWO Pressure-having legendaries in one place...let alone all 4...
