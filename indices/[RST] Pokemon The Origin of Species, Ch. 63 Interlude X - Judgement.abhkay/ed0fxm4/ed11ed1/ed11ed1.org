You are really pretty amazingly good at making me care for and empathize with characters - both Seto and Karen immediately had emotional relevance to me. Their inner dialogue is so realistic and believable that I can't help but put myself in their shoes. And of course Leaf getting hit legitimately terrified me. Excellent interlude.
