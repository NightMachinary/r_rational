Better question, why is there a setting that even allows you to disable a region wide alert? I can understand having it go silent for a number of reasons, but in that case it sould have to vibrate at maximum intensity until the alert is acknowledged.

Also wait, what about the rest of the professors and university researchers? All of them also had the alert on mute?
