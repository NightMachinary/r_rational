  "With all due respect, you're on the review board for three different journals," Professor Elm says, adjusting his glasses. "How many papers have you personally looked over in the past year, out of all those that those papers published?"

  Osamu's face reddens. "Are you questioning my integrity?"

  "Not at all," Professor Oak quickly says. "I know you're a diligent and rigorous academic. But there isn't enough time in the day for you to be solely responsible for every paper in even one of those journals. And instead of hiring more reviewers, the names of the reviewers are what's being paid for. It's become a mutually beneficial prestigious position, not something that assures quality."

I thought the above was a typo initially, with Oak and Elm being used for the same person. Leaving it in this thread just in case.

On a first read, it was somewhat confusing (to me at least) why Oak reacted to Osaku's remark rather than Elm. It was not very clear to me that Oak and Elm were working together until the point that Osamu thanked them both for their time.
