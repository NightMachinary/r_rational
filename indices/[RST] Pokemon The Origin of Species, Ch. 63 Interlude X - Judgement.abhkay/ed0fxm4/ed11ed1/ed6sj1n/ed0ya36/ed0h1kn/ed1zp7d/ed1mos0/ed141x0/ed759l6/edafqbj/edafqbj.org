  not all pokemon that can have the ability do, like in the games, and unlike the games, even if they do have it, it's not binary, and varies in strength like any other trait.

So you're right that Zapdos definitely has more abilities than Pressure and those abilities are likely much stronger than what they are for normal pok√©mon.
