A very tense chapter, and I think the multiple perspective switches we're executed fantastically. Seto's section was particularly interesting to me, a really nuanced character peice in the midst of disaster.

A minor critique being that, I think that in the work read as a whole rather than serially, it will seem a bit strange/redundant feeling to have to catastrophic Magnemite/Magneton attack in back to back chapters.

Zapdos definitely racked up a few "not an evil monster, just an animal" points in the scenes with Karen. It basically responded to the attacks like a cockroach bumping into a wall. "Oh, that was weird, better turn a different direction."

I do really like Karen as a character too. I'm sort of on the fence about whether or not her in-game existence says about the subject of plot armor in this story. On one hand, I've kind of been enjoying OtOS as a sort of, higher resolution retelling of the Kanto story, so I am totally fine thinking things like, "I know Karen will survive because she is alive in Gold/Silver." But also I like the liberties you take with the story, and the future butterfly-effect it allows. But we haven't seen a whole lot of that narrative divergence yet, like the kinds in HPMoR for example, so I don't know if it makes sense to "start now" so to speak. I know that I would mostly likely be satisfied with this story if it ends with Red fighting Champion Blue and then him running off to stoically stare at the Peaks of Mt. Silver, but I don't think that's how I /expect/ it to end. Anyways, looking forward to finding out.

Side note, game canon states that at least one person, Pyramid King Brandon, was eventually able to capture (or clone!) the legendary birds and the regis. But maybe our heroes find themselves in one of the blighted universes where the Battle Frontier is perpetually locked in development hell and Brandon was crushed in another of Team Rocket's archeological "accidents." Perhaps after he came too close to unlocking the secret of capturing legendaries for Giovanni's liking.

Speaking of complicated game canon multiverses, I wonder what the implications are of LGPE forwarding that a version of Red, Blue, and Green!Leaf exist somehow in a time-shifted era before Oak finished his pokedex, where Fairy types, mega-evolution, alola forms, and Melmetal exist... But not baby Pokemon or happiness evolution... but after Mewtwo and Porygon have been created. LGPE are really just a mess. I think rat!Red's head would explode if he was forced to confront all of canon Pokemon's multiverses.
