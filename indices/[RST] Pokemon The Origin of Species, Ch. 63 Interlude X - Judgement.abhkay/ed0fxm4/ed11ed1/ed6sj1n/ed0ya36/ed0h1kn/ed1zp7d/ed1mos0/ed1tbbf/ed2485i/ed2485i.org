Wait a second. Giovanni's whole point of doing the Mewtwo thing is that he wants to use it to kill the Stormbringers. The plan at the end of the chapter here were to drive Zapdos south, which Karen immediately recognizes will put it on course to hit Cinnabar Island. So maybe he intentionally set it on this path so that he can get Zapdos to come to Mewtwo.
