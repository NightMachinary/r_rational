Man, I feel so bad for Seto. That constant guilt and self hate...

And Leaf. But I trust she will recover, as Aiko did.

I really like Karen's way of turning fear and Pressure to a motivating force. But it leads her into danger when she lets her desire for recognition overtake her senses. Is she a drug addict, addicted to Ether? She has a higher risk of addiction if her brother was a drug addict. And I hope she has a Surfer.
