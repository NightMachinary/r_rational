I'm now wondering how triage works in pokécenters. The ticket system suggests it is first-come, first-serve. And of course, the stasis of pokéballs means that there is no urgency to prioritise life-threatening cases. But when they are rushed, such as after a Tiered event, even the small medium of pokéballs might push the center's storage capacity, and more to the point, lots of trainers will be out of their pokémon for longer. This is a risk to the city and surrounding area as defence will be underpowered when they are most vulnerable. An after-tier event or renegade attack would be devastating.

It seems to me that, since time is not a concern with regards to saving lives, but /is/ a concern for getting pokémon back to their trainers, it would make most sense to prioritise the treatment of injuries that are easiest, quickest and/or most straightforward to heal to ensure that the region is brought back up to readiness (or the closest they can get to it) as quickly as possible, and save the difficult cases for later during post-tiered event response. In short, the availability of pokéball storage technology perfectly inverts the rational triage protocol of human hospitals.

This would of course require a means to quickly assessing the condition of new in-patients.
