I think this already exists. When Blue loses either the Pikachu or his Beedrill, when he scans its Pokeball, it not only says that the Pokemon is dead but also gives the cause (I think it was something like "critical brain patterns disrupted"). If the Pokeball is sophisticated enough to pinpoint cause of death then I think it could scan any injuries and potentially rank them from "critical" to "minor".
