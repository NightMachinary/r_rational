Sure, but even they may have pokémon that will have to stay for a good long while, especially if they had to take the brunt of the danger on the front lines. Is it better to get twenty badged trainers back to full complement or heal one Leader's signature pokémon? I think Surge would say the latter, especially as he can still lead them if necessary without his pokémon.
