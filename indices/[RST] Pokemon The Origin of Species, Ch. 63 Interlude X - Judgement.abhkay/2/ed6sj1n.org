I think we know why nobody's ever killed a Stormbringer now. It's never expressly stated, but there's two points in this chapter that made me think "Ah, that's what it is".

My original theory was that the Stormbringers were overwhelmingly powerful. In Chapter 61, I theorised about Zapdos's capabilities: "Two dozen lightning rods and a layer of psychic shielding might hold back the lightning from destroying every last member of the defense in a single apocalyptic blast. A barrage of type-advantaged artillery attacks might send the Zapdos dodging back into the clouds for a few seconds."

Some of this happened, some of it didn't. One Elite trainer can actually keep the Zapdos busy for a considerable period of time, so couldn't all of them together, plus a few dozen League level trainers, actually kill one, if they fought together? That's when I realised...when Zapdos came down from the clouds, it didn't really DO anything. It didn't attack anyone until it was attacked first. This makes me think that the Stormbringers aren't actually intentionally aggressive...it's the Pressure they bring that causes all the destruction. That's why they need to be lured away from the city.

The other key line was this: "And their [Stormbringers] response when truly challenged, is always to retaliate with overwhelming force."

So the Stormbringers aren't trying to destroy anything. They're just travelling, and the Pressure does its thing. When the trainers attack Zapdos, they don't go all-out. (This is why Lorelei attacks it with one beam first, then three...not six.) Because if Zapdos is legitimately hurt at all, it kills people. Trainers, civilians, anything. Nobody knows for sure if they've ever seen, in history, the full extent of the Stormbringers' powers. And even if they could win this fight, half of Vermillion would get destroyed in the meantime.

So rather than commit all their best trainers to a fight that they might not win, with enormous collateral damage, people decided on the luring strategy instead. And they've kept it up ever since, even as technology has gotten better and better over time. Perhaps they could win right now if they went all-out. But it's far too dangerous to find out.
