Karen turned right first, when she and Zapdos was getting close of Fuschia, putting their direction west - the narrative suggested they weren't going to go straight over Fuschia, but it was still advisable to veer away to minimize setting off Pokemon rampages near the city. Then she turned south-west, then south proper. Then south-east, to avoid the Sevii islands, and then she was shot down.
