More typos than usual? but great chapter as always!

...

"And the resistance has never been fiercer.": The resistance from the previous sentence is Laura's, the /urge/ is what she is fighting and has become fiercer.

"a Silph subsidiary that was /was/ in a prolonged legal conflict"

(Not a typo, but the little touch of drivers only being needed to run the car's defenses, not pilot, was super cool! Makes me wonder how cars in this universe are designed/built, and how differently they would look because of that.)

"is pretty strong stance, Daniel" needs an "a".

"...listed experiments don't replicate." Missing end quotes.

"might work against us tomor... Sam, what's wrong?". I think there should be a dash after "tomor", but that might just be a style thing.

"No fire,rock, or flying ,which means"

"co-ordinate" I... think this might be the British spelling? I can't recall the last time I've seen this word with a dash in it.

"the Elites job is to stay fresh and ready" missing apostrophe.

"Because what is there to fear, really, from the perspective" I would switch the comma after "really" to a semicolon or something

"Zap Canon" should have three "n"s, occurs three times
