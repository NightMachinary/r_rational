That's it exactly. I rented out my San Francisco apartment to someone I know for more than I was paying and less than he was paying -- win! Revenue stream in place, I went to Malaysia-- George Town in Penang. If you try it, this is where I suggest going -- nice city, everyone speaks enough English that you can get by, and you can drink the water. I also recommend staying at the Reggae House Hostel in Love Lane. It's a capsule hostel -- for USD$11 / night you get a pod in a 4-person dorm. The pod is 8' deep by 4' high by 4' wide. The bottom is a mattress, there's a socket and a light, a cabinet to put your glasses etc, a space at the head for stuff, and a blackout curtain for privacy. Very comfortable. The entire hostel has A/C. The one downside is that they kick on the reggae music at about 6pm and it's the same 6 of 7 songs on loop. You can go upstairs to get away from it, though. The hostel has good food, but it's spendy at 15-18 ringgit per meal. (About $4.50 to $5.40). If you go to one of the bao vendors you can get a couple of bao -- large fluffy dumplings, two is an excellent meal -- for 3 ringgit total.

I haven't done anything touristy here in SEA. I sit in the hostel, I write or play harp, I go out for meals. That's it. As a result I can't recommend anything to do or see, sorry.

On advice of a friend, I relocated to Chiang Mai, Thailand about six weeks ago. More or less the same as Malaysia, although the hostel I'm staying in is $6/night (200 baht), but otherwise the prices are the same, roughly, you *cannot* drink the water., and most people do not speak English. I'm at the "PM Guest House", and I strongly recommend it as a place to stay if you come to CM. Pim (male, from Holland) and Miki (female, born in Bangkok but spent so much time in the USA that she identifies more that way) both speak English fluently and are extremely friendly. They have a minimal but tasty menu (eg large bowl of muesli w/yoghurt, dragon fruit, various other fruit) for 90 baht and I often do that for dinner -- it's about what it would cost to go out and it's easy, tasty, quick.

Water in Chiang Mai runs about 18 baht / 1.5 liter. (1 baht = $0.03) There are refill stations all over the place which dispense 1L of potable water for 1B. If you end up at PMGH the nearest is right out the door, right, walk about 100' to the washing machines.
