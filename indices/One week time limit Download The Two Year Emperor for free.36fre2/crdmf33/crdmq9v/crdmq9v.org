EDIT: I had a response with specific numbers and such, but it was complicated. Let me boil it down.

Monetizing this in any way other than the one I'm using would cost me money. Either due to publishing on sites with smaller audiences, publishing under options that have much smaller royalties, or paying the fees for print on demand. The way I've done it gives me the most money and gives you the option to read it for free while I still get paid. You just need to create a KU account using the free trial link that I've provided, read 2YE, and then remember to cancel the KU account within a month, which is pretty easy if you schedule a reminder on your Google Calendar.
