It's bait and switch if I am able to /start/ reading. I can still imagine why a person might be disappointed when the link leads to an existing story but still not chapters somehow.

Anyway, thanks for doing this. The new most likely outcome is that I read it (while waiting for HPN20), like it, and then buy it.
