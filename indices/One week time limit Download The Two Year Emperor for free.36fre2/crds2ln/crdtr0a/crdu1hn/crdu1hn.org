But you can just put up 2ye fulltext somewhere else as a mirror and solve all that?

Eaglejarl is clearly not a drm nazi, he /wants/ totally open to be an option so no /moral/ qualms about upsetting him.

Amazon cannot enforce the requirement so long as eaglejarl doesn't explicitly condone it (he's /technically/ victim of piracy).

2ye community gets the fulltext, no strings attached.

Everyone wins (except amazon's bureaucracy i guess but fuck em for having this rule). Problem solved?
