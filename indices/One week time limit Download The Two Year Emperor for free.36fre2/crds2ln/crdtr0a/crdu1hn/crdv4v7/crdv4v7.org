  But you can just put up 2ye fulltext somewhere else as a mirror and solve all that?

Please do not do that.

In most cases I would not object, but this situation has pissed me off enough that I do not want it mirrored anywhere.

I burned 10-15 hours per week on this project for a year and a half; that's almost a part-time job. On multiple occasions I went through some contortions to make sure that it posted on time. I am now breaking Amazon's TOS in order to /once again/ give it away for free for an entire week, along with all of my author's notes and every other scrap of content ever generated around this project, *including the cover images that I paid money for*.

Having someone tell me that because he made a few Reddit posts he now has some degree of moral ownership in the product...hell no.
