Giving away some content is helpful as a means of advertising. Giving away all your content is bad for having the capital necessary to fund later content creation. You seem to be suggesting that eaglejarl follow Doctorow's example in giving everything away. That's obviously stupid (in a capitalist society; it's obviously great in a socialist society).

This specific case is more debatable. An unquantifiable loss of goodwill for an unknown amount of profit.
