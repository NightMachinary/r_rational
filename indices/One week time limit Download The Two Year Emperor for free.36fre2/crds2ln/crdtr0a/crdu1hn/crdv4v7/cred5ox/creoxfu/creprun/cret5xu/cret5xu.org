  If he'd packaged Worm up into a bunch of novellas that were locked into Kindle Unlimited (which eaglejarl has suggested is optimal for wildbow's revenue),

If he's going to publish on Amazon at all then yes, that is absolutely the optimal way to do it. If he's not going to publish on Amazon then my comment isn't relevant.

  How many people are going to read 2YE if they follow a link to it from ff.net and then have to manually type in a web address, sign up for Amazon's service (assuming they already have an Amazon account), download the book, then uncancel later? That seems like a ton of work to me - I wouldn't have read it if I had to do all that, which means that I wouldn't have reccomended it to anyone.

Which is why (a) I have removed that notice from the front page and (b) I will be completely removing the story from FF once this 1-week-availability thing runs out.

  Building up an audience with free content and then removing that content to make a buck, especially when much of that content was produced with community input/help/ideas, is bad capitalism. It's short-term [...] That's leaving aside the whole issue of audience goodwill, which is pretty easy to squander.

I've already said that CC-licensing it after the KU advantage wears off makes sense. What exactly do you want that I've not already made clear I'm going to do?
