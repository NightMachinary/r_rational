  Ehh, everybody who read it owns it.
#+end_quote

That is very explicitly not correct. The word 'owns' is a legal word and it does not mean what you are using it to mean.

We agree on all the moral issues, we agree on what I should do in the future and I've said that I will do it.

#+begin_quote
  Even considering you as the sole owner, the one who can specify how it's used, it doesn't really mesh that you can change how people can use it after they've already used it.
#+end_quote

Again, self-evidently not true. I can release a book as copyrighted and then later put it under CC. In this case I can put a work up under no stated license (but still under my legal ownership because that's how copyright works) and later decide that I am temporarily going to try to make money from it. I've also stated above that I intend to CC it once the KU advantage wears off. Cope and deal with the fact that you don't get to play with it for a few months.

  some of it is probably infringing on the IP of wizards of the cost,
#+end_quote

First of all, I've scrubbed the copyright materials out so no, it does not infringe.

Second, even if it somehow /were/ found to infringe, it's parody and therefore protected.

#+begin_quote
  In addition, you're tacitly supporting a platform that's using anti-competitive practices to try to capture an entire market.
#+end_quote

Like it or not, they /have/ captured the market to a large degree (about 50%) and if I want to make a living doing this then I need to go through them. Hachette can afford to not play because they have a mint. Even so, they /did/ [[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html?_r=0][decide to play once they had control of their pricing.]]

If my Patreon gets to a high enough level that I can live on it (which, given where I live, is about $5k / month allowing for taxes) then sure, I would /love/ to give away all my stuff for free. It would make my life /hella/ easier than having to deal with Amazon's crappy interface, lengthy publishing process, restrictive TOS, unclear requirements, and blah blah blah. It would also give me moral satisfaction.

Moral satisfaction is a very desirable thing, but food and rent are even more desirable.
