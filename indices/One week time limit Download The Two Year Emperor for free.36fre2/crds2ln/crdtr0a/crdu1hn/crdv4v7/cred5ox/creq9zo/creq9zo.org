Lovely. I just had to sit and listen to this internal discussion, I hope you're happy.

CommonSense: Ah crap. A reasonable request framed politely to read something by someone that we respect and know the opinions of perfectly well but didn't think about yesterday because Rage was in the driver's seat. You know what's going to happen here: we're going to have to read it and then have to admit in public that we were wrong and kinda being a jerk.

Laziness: Could we just not read it and pretend we did? We've got things to do today.

IntellectualHonesty: Read it anyway.

CS: Fine. <read, read, read> Look, I'm about a third of the way through this and it's like we thought. Can we just take the rest as understood?

Rage: But...mitdemwolftanzt!!!!

CS: Oh no, someone on the Internet is a rude, entitled, arrogant jackass! Alert the media!

Rage: Fine. <slinks off to the corner grumbling>

Spite: Do not want! Do not want! Punish rude, entitled, arrogant jackass! Do not allow product of our /extremely huge amounts of effort/ to be freely shared with the world for reasonable purposes such as linking to relevant passages!

CS: Go sit in the corner.

Spite: Fine. <slinks off to the corner grumbling>

[comes back]

Spite: Ooh, ooh, can we at least call him out and tell him in so many words that he's a rude, entitled, arrogant jackass for claiming that a few Internet posts gives him ownership of our work?

Integrity: That would be kinda small and petty. Why don't we just be the bigger man and let it go?

CS: Also, judging by the number of upvotes he's gotten, there's apparently a goodly number of people here who think that a few Reddit posts /does/ give them some sort of ownership of a product that we spent a part-time job working on for 18 months.

Integrity: Common Sense, have you been talking with Spite again?

CS: ....maybe.

Integrity: Remember that part about not being small and petty?

CS: ...yes?

Humor: Oooh, ooh, I know! We could write it up as a sort of internal-monolog piece with bits of me sprinkled in! That would hide the smallness and pettiness!

FaceSavingDesires: You know, I'm okay with that. We get to have our small, petty revenge against a jackass on the Internet and still be intellectually honest enough to admit we were wrong.

Integrity: But it's still small and...you know what, never mind. Fine.

CS: Oh, hey, let's also slide in a reference somewhere about "updating on new evidence" -- that'll signal that we're cool!

Meta: I gotcha covered, CS.

[[/u/mitdemwolftanzt]], a few things for you:

Writing a few Internet posts does not give you moral or legal ownership of something I created any more than being part of an over-coffee chat in the meatspace world does. Yes, I originally did not intend for 2YE to be a commercial work. That was when I was making six figures as a programmer and didn't have time to produce more than a single story. Now I'm trying to be a professional author where I can live on the proceeds of that work so that I can produce more stuff which I consistently /give away for free/ before publishing it.

When I look at your posts I think your goals were either: (a) to ensure that there was a publicly-available version of 2YE, (b) to hurt my feelings and elevate yourself in the process by getting people to agree with your position, or (c) both.

Your initial post was rude. I thought about it and, instead of saying "go to hell" I responded by doing the absolute best that I possibly could given that I wanted to actually make a living and had to deal with a situation that wasn't perfect. I went well above and beyond the call of what I was required to do by any reasonable standard and an acknowledgement of that would have gone a long way towards getting you what you wanted the next time you disagree with one of my decisions.

Your second post, the one in this thread, was not only rude but (assuming that your goal involved option A above) was also counterproductive. Fortunately for you, there are more polite and more reasonable people on here.

Amazon has an exclusivity requirement on its KU program and I am leaving money on the table if I don't use that program. Leaving money on the table is not something I can afford to do right now.

Amazon /does/, however, also have a non-exclusive option -- it just pays less. At some point (weeks or months, MAYBE a year) the sales/borrows of 2YE will trail off and I will have extracted the benefit of having it be temporarily not completely Richard-Stallman-perfect-world free.

Assuming your goal was to have 2YE be publicly available, you would have been much better served to have this conversation instead:

[[/u/mitdemwolftanzt]]: Hey Dave, thanks for creating something fun. Given how much work you did it's cool for you to want to choose the option that best helps you make a living. Once the sales/borrows trail off though, the KU option isn't going to give you a big marginal return. At that point, how about moving 2YE out of KU so that everyone can mirror it?

[[/u/eaglejarl]]: Ooh, I like that idea! Yes, absolutely, I'll do that. In the meantime, let me give away absolutely everything related to 2YE so that no one has to be deprived of access to it.

--------------

Final result of the above:

Dear Public: Oh noes! I cannot stop you from mirroring my work! Nor can I explicitly say in public that you should do so, since that could be seen by a large corporation as me violating their TOS and get me sued! I /can/, however, say that I have better things to do than tattle on anyone who mirrors it or write C&D letters to anyone who does so. Whatever you do, please do not allow your actions to be dictated by the well-reasoned opinions of Corey Doctorow with whom I agree.

--------------

EDIT: [[/u/traverseda]]. Just in case you think the above is inconsistent: I /do/ feel that I am the sole owner of 2YE, where "owner" means "person who is allowed to specify in what way it can be used." Saying that it's cool to mirror it or putting it out under a CC license doesn't change the fact that I am the creator and the owner, it just means that I'm cool with other people doing whatever they like with it. In point of fact, I /am/ cool with that; I don't think I can legally release it under a CC license while it's under Amazon's exclusivity rules, but that seems like a very sensible thing to do once the advantages of being in KU have run out in a few weeks or months.
