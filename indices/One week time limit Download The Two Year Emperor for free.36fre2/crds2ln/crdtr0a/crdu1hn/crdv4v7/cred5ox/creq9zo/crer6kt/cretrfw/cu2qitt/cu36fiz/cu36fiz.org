I did.

I rented the apartment and moved to Malaysia. Lived in hostels to meet interesting people and save tons of money. Worked great; I was paying all my bills with money from writing, and making a profit on the apartment which was going to savings. Then the guy who was renting it moved out and I came back to try to find another renter. I haven't found one yet and am reluctant to let the apartment to because I've had it long enough that it's way below market rate and is therefore a huge asset. If you're in the Bay Area and want to rent a really nice 1BR with a pool in lower Castro, drop me a PM.

Oh and, of course, Amazon recently changed their payout structure and the majority of authors had their income crash 80%. That didn't help either.
