  Writing a few Internet posts does not give you moral or legal ownership of something I created any more than being part of an over-coffee chat in the meatspace world does.

Ehh, everybody who read it owns it. Because it's an idea in our heads now, and anything else is claiming you own a part of us. Cultural artifacts belong to everyone, even if it's a relatively small subculture.

That's what putting your work into the public sphere means. It means giving up ownership. The most popular web serials try to give people a sense of ownership over the work. Look at homestuck as one of the bigger examples. Everything the characters do is framed as user input from a form. Or [[/u/wildbow]]'s work as another example. John Dies At The End started out that way as well.

That's not where copyright law is, but that's very much where I am, morally. You can't own an idea like you can own a sofa, and you can't dictate what other people are going to do with an idea. It's a bit different when all those idea's are shoved together into a Work, but the principle is the same.

It's culturally a different way to look at it, but as a software dev people think they own the idea's I work with every day, in the form of overly broad patents. We can't treat ownership IP like it's owning furniture.

Even considering you as the sole owner, the one who can specify how it's used, it doesn't really mesh that you can change how people can use it after they've already used it. If you sold a book, you can't change the rules after they've already purchased it. Similar concept. You did decide how it can be used, and now you're changing your mind.

I'm not convinced this is going to work long term. Not posting your stuff in public means it reaches a smaller-still audience, and it's niche as well. Also, some of it is probably infringing on the IP of wizards of the cost, which isn't a huge problem if you're not making money off it...

Even well respected authors like Peter Watts, Branden Sanderson, etc, have a large chunk of their work available for free online. More often then not novel length.

In addition, you're tacitly supporting a platform that's using anti-competitive practices to try to capture an entire market.
