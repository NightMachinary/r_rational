  If my Patreon gets to a high enough level that I can live on it (which, given where I live, is about $5k / month allowing for taxes) then sure, I would /love/ to give away all my stuff for free. It would make my life /hella/ easier than having to deal with Amazon's crappy interface, lengthy publishing process, restrictive TOS, unclear requirements, and blah blah blah. It would also give me moral satisfaction.

But why do you live there? One of the advantages of being a writer/freelancer in the era of internet is that you can write from anywhere in the world. Why not moving to a cheaper place, or even undertaking the [[/r/digitalnomad]]'s lifestyle, the second of which would also allow you to learn and experience many new things that you could then use as inspiration for your own stories?
