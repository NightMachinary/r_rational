Oh my god this entire thread involving /mitdumbwolfnazi and /travestida is mentally painful to read.

They're self-entitled asshole who just can't agree with someone trying to make money out of hundreds of hours of work.

It's like someone owning a parking lot and wanting to install a parking meter, and [[/u/meetadumbwifenaz][u/meetadumbwifenaz]] comes to complain that since he could park his car there before, the owner shouldn't do whatever the hell he want with his property.

It's like that fat snotty kid from your childhood that moans: But I want it for free!
