  Two Year Emperor was so steeped in D&D rules-as-written that to take that out seemed like it would have some far-reaching repercussions.

Yeah, it absolutely will. I'm figuring that people who DO play D&D will recognize what's going on and be able to appreciate the Munchkinism. For people who DON'T play I'll provide enough explanation as I go that hopefully it won't feel like a series of asspulls. If it does, they'll either keep reading because they find it amusing anyway, or they'll put it down, in which case they can get a refund (assuming it's within 7 days of purchase) and won't buy any further installments. All in all, it should be doable without anyone having to suffer.
