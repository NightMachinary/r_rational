    Did you systematically go through and purge the D&D references?

  Yes.

Huh. I just bought the book (or at least, part one) on Amazon, because I was really curious how that would be accomplished. /Two Year Emperor/ was so steeped in D&D rules-as-written that to take that out seemed like it would have some far-reaching repercussions. I've read through the first third, and can mostly see what changes you've had to make, but it's a little difficult because I remember how the original went, and of course I'm well-versed in D&D rules.

Let me know how it turns out - I'm very curious what someone reading it with fresh eyes would think of it, and I imagine that you'll get some of those reviews in soon. Oh, and good luck.

(Fun fact: when I first started writing /Metropolitan Man/, it didn't have Superman in it)
