Thank you for writing 2YE and making it freely available; I downloaded it.

An anecdote: When HPMOR ended, I had such a writing fever for it that I couldn't do planned writing about anything else if I tried. This was a problem, since I had multiple assigned essays to write! Then I read 2YE in a single night, and loved it, and it competed with HPMOR for my idea-generation and hilarious-thought-generation well enough that I could finally write the essays I needed to get done. :)
