You're welcome! (And thank you for the download option; lack of discretionary income is a pain.) This was indeed after it finished, and did involve several hours of reading in the one night. I stayed up rather late that night...

As for my reading speed, I started reading early and I get a lot of practice. For example, for the last month or so I've been exploring recommended Harry Potter fanfiction as field research for my HPMOR fic... at the rate of about 750k words a week counting only fics set in the Potterverse but not the Methods!verse. (So that's excluding keeping up with the continuations on [[/r/HPMOR]].) I don't read that voraciously all the time, but I do have spurts like that and it adds up.
