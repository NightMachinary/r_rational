I'd also like an epub format, by the way - raw html format is literally unreadable on my ereader [I mean like a kindle, not like a glorified Adobe Reader but for epub instead of pdf].

If there were a decent ereader that was completely open-source (like, the actual /interface/) then it likely wouldn't be as much of a problem, but no such device currently exists, and mine is damn unreliable (and probably doesn't validate files properly before opening them).
