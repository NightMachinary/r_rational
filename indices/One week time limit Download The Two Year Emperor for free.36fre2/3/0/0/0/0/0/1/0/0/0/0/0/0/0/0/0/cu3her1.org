  On another side, though, wouldn't something like Patreon be a better choice for authors who release many short stories?

Before the payout change, short stories were a GREAT way to make money on Amazon. You wanted to have as many KU titles as possible, since every title borrowed was $1.34 to the good. Plus, if you had three related stories out you could bundle them together and get another salable / borrowable work for nothing; this was good for everyone, since the readers could buy a collection for less than the cost of the individual stories and the author had something extra to make money on.

As to Patreon -- yes, it's well suited to releasing short stories, but it's quite hard to get people to pony up recurring revenue when a lot of folks aren't even willing to pay for content in the first place. Even after the payout change, I've made more money from Amazon this month than from Patreon.
