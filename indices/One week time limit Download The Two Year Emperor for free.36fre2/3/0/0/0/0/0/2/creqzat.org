[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3637qm/munchkin_the_pathfinder_rpg_raw/crclrfu][Here's my first comment on the subject:]]

  Seems like kind of a raw deal for readers, even leaving the deal with Amazon aside. There are a bunch of links to that story that now basically say "go jump through these hoops if you want to read it", which doesn't feel great. I get the desire to monetize, but I would way rather have that monetization be upfront instead of after-the-fact.

You asked me what I would rather you have done, and I told you, because that's what I thought you wanted. My first comment in this thread was made because someone asked /why/ a person would say "bait and switch", which I figured was directed at me, because you were quoting me when I said that.

I wasn't trying to make you angry. I wasn't trying to ensure 2YE was freely available. I was trying to explain what I was feeling, because I thought that had been asked of me.

I never claimed that I had a legal or moral right to 2YE.
