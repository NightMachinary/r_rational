Good on you. For what it's worth, when I made the the mirroring suggestion, I was more trying to explain why mitdemwolftanzt's concerns were invalid and to dissolve legal inconveniences than trying to step on your toes - I wouldn't have suggested it if I knew it would bother you (I do approve of the concept of you owning the work). But looks like it turned out for the best.
