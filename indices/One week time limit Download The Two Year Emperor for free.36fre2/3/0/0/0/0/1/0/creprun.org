Wildbow makes money despite giving away all his content. He has a big audience /because/ he gives away his content. If he'd packaged Worm up into a bunch of novellas that were locked into Kindle Unlimited ([[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/34e51q/q_what_do_you_dislike_about_worm/cqvm4sk][which eaglejarl has suggested is optimal for wildbow's revenue]]), it seems really doubtful that anyone would know who he is, even if Worm were the same.

Building up an audience with free content and then removing that content to make a buck, especially when much of that content was produced with community input/help/ideas, is bad capitalism. It's short-term. Lock people out of the content, and you basically kill word-of-mouth. How many people are going to read 2YE if they follow a link to it from ff.net and then have to manually type in a web address, sign up for Amazon's service (assuming they already have an Amazon account), download the book, then uncancel later? That seems like a ton of work to me - I wouldn't have read it if I had to do all that, which means that I wouldn't have reccomended it to anyone.

That's leaving aside the whole issue of audience goodwill, which is pretty easy to squander.
