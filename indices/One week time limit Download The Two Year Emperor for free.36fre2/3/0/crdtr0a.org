I'm probably one of the only people who cares, so let me see if I can explain:

Originally, 2YE was put up on ff.net. We (generally) liked it, shared it, commented on it, reviewed it, and offered suggestions for it, many of which made their way into work itself. 2YE owes much of its success to the fact that it was free online for anyone to read. 2YE owes some fractional amount of its ideas to the readers who would comment on each chapter as it was posted. There wasn't any indication that the story would be taken down and locked into Amazon's service.

There were threads like [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mdy5l/spoilers_bst_crowdsourcing_plot_points_for_the/]["Crowdsourcing plot points for Book II"]] or [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2a2vrk/q_if_you_were_jake_in_the_two_year_emperor_what/]["If you were Jake, what would you do?"]] or [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2bj6ag/q_mk_what_would_you_ask_loki_two_year_emperor/]["What would you ask Loki?"]] It was in many ways a community thing. People contributed because it was open to everyone. And now, in a week's time it's going to be locked into Amazon's service, probably indefinitely. I already have the story downloaded using Calibre, which I did a long time ago. It's not a matter of me personally not being able to read it, it's that I see/saw 2YE as being this friendly community thing, and see this move as disregarding the community in order to make a buck.

I wouldn't have had a problem with it if 2YE had been pay-to-play from the get-go, or if the stated intention was always to shut down the story on ff.net and sell it, but if that had been the case I don't think it would be as successful a story as it is today, for a number of reasons.

And that's why I think it's a bait and switch.
