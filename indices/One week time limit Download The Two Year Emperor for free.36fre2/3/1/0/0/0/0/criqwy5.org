Yeah, I think this was just one of those things where I disagree in general principle and am not really the most articulate person. I get how it felt personal, and I didn't really mean for it to be. Sorry. I do appreciate the work that you put into Two Year Emperor, and I did really like it. I look forward to the day that it's back online, and wish you good luck in your other projects.
