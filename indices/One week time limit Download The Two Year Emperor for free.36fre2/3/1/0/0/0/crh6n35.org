Okay, let's close this one down. I started off pretty heated and now I feel the heat is spreading.

[[/u/krakonfour]], thanks for stepping up to tell me that I'm not an asshole.

[[/u/mitdemwolftanzt]], I understand that you were trying to explain your position and weren't trying to be offensive; I don't think you're dumb, a nazi, snotty, or an asshole. (I can't speak to your girth, of course, so I'll just assume "built like a Greek God(dess)". ;>)

Everyone now has the story for free and once 2YE drops to a 7-digit salesrank I'll take it out of KU and CC it. At that point, I encourage y'all to do whatever you like with it -- mirror it, metafic it, quote it, whatever. (Although it would probably be a good idea to poke me about this in about 6 months lest I forget.) And, to be honest, I'm not going to object if you do any of those things now.

So, to sum up: I get to make money off my work, everyone who wants the work has it, and it will be CC'd in a few months.

I think this is a win for all of us.
