I'm dumb, a nazi, an asshole, self-entitled, fat, and snotty. Thanks for clarifying that. Clearly this is what eaglejarl meant when he said that there were more polite and reasonable people in this thead. /s

All I've tried to do in this thread is explain my position, and that's only because I was quoted in the OP and someone asked about it. I haven't said that [[/u/eaglejarl]] has no right to sell his work. I never said that I had a legal or moral right to his work. I haven't even said that I want it for free, because, as I said, I already have it. My argument is a social one.

To use your analogy, it's like this guy owns a parking lot, and invites us to come park in it. We decide to make a weekly thing of brunch at the place next door, because we like the parking lot. Some time passes, and we come in for our weekly brunch, but now a bunch of meters have been put up in the parking lot. I'm not saying that he doesn't have a right to do that, I'm saying that I think it's kind of crappy for the people who were parking there for free, because the free parking was used to create a demand, and now we either have to pay or find a new place to have brunch.

Sort of like how you have every right to hurl a bunch of insults at me, and I'm put out by it. I wish you'd think about the fact that there's someone on the other end of the keyboard, and I think you're being rude, but I'm just expressing my opinion and not trying to force you to stop or claim that you have no right to free speech.
