I expect it's difficult to deal with trying to monetize something you were previously giving away for free. You have to overcome the fan sense of entitlement, overcome their perception of ill will and greed, and then you still have to make a successful sales pitch. (and as a fan I admittedly have had to partially overcome these reactions just to write you this hopefully nice sounding message.)

Writing is a career that's difficult to succeed in under the best circumstances, and I expect this transition will compound that--especially with all the KU free trial business that I personally wouldn't find worthwhile for any book. If I were in your shoes I'd be trying to make it as a writer with a /new/ IP (or at least a sequel rather than the original) using the original as my resume, rather than trying to remove the original from the internet and then sell it back.

But I did enjoy reading 2YE over the last while, and I appreciate you at least giving people who are paying attention some warning and a chance to grab the story before the transition, so I wish you the best of luck.
