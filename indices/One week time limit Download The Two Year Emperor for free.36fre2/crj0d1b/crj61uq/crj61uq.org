  You have to overcome the fan sense of entitlement, overcome their perception of ill will and greed, and then you still have to make a successful sales pitch.

My sales pitch is not aimed at the current fans. They've already read it online and then I've given them the entire thing free, including the covers; the only reason you or any of those other people would buy/borrow it now would be as a way of tipping me. I would be very surprised if that happened.

Don't worry, it'll be back after a while. Books make most of their sales in the beginning and then trail off. Once we're into long-tail territory it seems sensible to CC it.

In any case, I acknowledge hearing your opinions, and thank you for the well-wishes.
