Wait, how is this monetizeable?

Did you systematically go through and purge the D&D references? Does that even make /sense/ from a story perspective? Wouldn't referencing a set of fictional rules not immediately established essentially make the story unpredictable from depicted events, which is a blatant violation of the Prime Rationalfic Directive?

(The solution to this, of course, is to pull a Pathfinder and release the entire d20 ruleset nearly unaltered and with minor presentation differences. For $9.95 MSRP. :) )
