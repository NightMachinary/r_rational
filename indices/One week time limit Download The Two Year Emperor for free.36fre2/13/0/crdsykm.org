I don't know what you mean "the HTML links aren't working", but I'll try:

Click this link: [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/two_year_emperor.tgz]]

It will download a .tgz file, which is a different name for a .zip file. Double click that. It should unroll into a directory containing a large number of files. If your system's archiving tool can't handle that, then rename the file to have a .zip extension and try again. If that STILL doesn't work, come back here and leave a reply to this message.

After you get it unrolled you will have a directory structure with various files littered around. If you look around in there you will find a whole series of files called 'chapter_001.html', 'chapter_027.html' and so on. These files are not interlinked, there's no "next" or "prev" links, but all the content is there.

Does that solve your problem?
