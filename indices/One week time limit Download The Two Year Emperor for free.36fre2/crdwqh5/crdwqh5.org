Aw man, thanks for this, but un-styled html is about the worst reading format that exists. I guess it's probably easy enough to convert it to epub though.

And I don't think you'd get a bad reputation even if you hadn't given it away, to be honest. Plenty of authors take down their stories for no reason at all, and the majority of readers don't get mad at the authors. But again, thank you.
