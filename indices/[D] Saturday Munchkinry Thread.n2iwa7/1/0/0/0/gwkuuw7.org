I would expect most land based societies to actively resist having their own territories become "Specialized" - keeping magic restricted to the low levels where people live cuts down on the terrifying bullshit, and anyone that needs a specific high-order spell cast, well, a ticket on a sea plane / ferry to visit the appropriate installation is not that prohibitive.
