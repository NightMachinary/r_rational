If this is a common and new power, the world will be in /severe/ future shock, as people are importing best practices in every field imaginable at a brutal pace. Lots of corporate titans falling and rising. Lots of governments falling too, since inevitably, some of those worlds will be better run, and it likely gets really hard to justify the way things are, if people know of better ways.

So.. honestly, I think the first target is going to be a me with /way better social skills/. Im going to spend a few years being a very attractive lounge singer or bartender or something until things calm down.
