There exists a vast multiverse of infinite possibilities. Your power allows you to change your body and parts of your mind for that of someone sufficiently like you in one of the other multiverses. When you make the change, your body completely changes, and you suddenly have all their memories and skills in addition to your own.

You do not have access to the entire multiverse of possible yous. The first (hard) limit is that they must be sufficiently like you, which here will be defined as having the same name, the same mother, the same father, and having been born at approximately the same time as you. The second (soft) limit is that you need to spend significant time acquiring other yous to change into, and these get harder the further you get from the central example of you (the you that you started as). A week's time will let you acquire an alternate you that's genetically identical and has hardly diverged at all. A month will let you acquire an alternate you of the other gender. A year will let you acquire the upper bounds of alternate yous, including those wildly different worlds (that nevertheless contain versions of your genetic mother and father who met and had you at approximately the same time). Once you've acquired another you, you can change in two minutes. The only limit on how many other yous are in your repertoire is time. A large chunk of acquisition is winnowing down to a single candidate, which lets you get a sense of what's available, but can't give you direct information about the other yous.

Changing into another you doesn't affect what's going on in the multiverse at all. The other yous are continuing to exist out there, and if you change into them twice in one day, you'll pick up on some of their new memories and experiences. You don't take on their injuries, nor do you get anything like e.g. filled cavities, replacement knees, or anything like that.

Given this ability, how do you best make money? How do you best leverage this power to help your community? What "yous" do you acquire to keep on standby?

How does the answer change if we assume you're not the only one with this power, and it's the domain of perhaps hundreds of thousands of others? (I think this would cut down on the rather obvious and somewhat boring 'take culture and information from other universes'.)
