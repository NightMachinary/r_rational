*Phase 1:* Do I have access to other mes that also have this power? The first few weeks I will spend playing around to get other mes that are similar and only recently-diverged and also have had this power. Then I will play around with exchanging memories with them and intentionally making our timelines diverge more (you mentioned in the 3rd paragraph that we can pick up new memories and experiences from each other). Then I will set up a schedule of exchange based on committing to memory certain times to take divergent actions. This sets the stage for phase two.

*Phase 2:* myself and my cluster of relatively similar versions in nearly identical universes that have memory exchanging schemes based on my power start hunting around for useful moderately and highly divergent selves to leverage. Each one takes year to find and then an additional year for my near alternative selves to get the divergent self. Among interesting divergent selves to look for:

- Engineer/hobbyist from more technology advanced realities who, as a hobby like to try to reconstruct advanced stuff from primitive stuff.
- Mathematicians who knows the solution to millennia prize problems (each work a million dollars)
- CEOs and Politically skilled versions of me
- Worlds with access to anything out-of-context: gods, magics, sufficiently advanced aliens, strong AIs, etc.
- Worlds that are mostly the same but off in timeline by at least a few years... this way I can get immortality by copying younger versions of myself, and predict the future by seeing how things played out in timelines similar to my own.
- World with mes that have access to other forms of multiversal communication/interaction/travel. After all, if this arbitrary power exists why not others?

For other people munchkining this p... the engineers/mathematician/scientists selves might be hard/unlikely, but I think I have a head start in that regard. At minimum though, people can look for timelines where the average IQ and thus by social pressure they ended up being a scientist/mathematician/engineer. For myself, I could look for worlds where the average Charisma is lower to find a Politician/CEO version of myself... but this might have weird effects where their intuitions for people are wrong because they are used to their world.

*Phase 3*, I start looking at hard problems and long term problems. How are all the memories affecting my personality and values? Does anyone have a set of algorithms for strong value aligned AI or for weaker but still super-intelligent limited AI (like an Oracle AI).

In the event Phase 1 fails because I am the only hardly diverged version with access to this power, my Phase 2 has different priorities, namely getting younger versions of myself, and perfecting this search process so I can know if I can effectively do so every few decades. Next on my Phase 2 is finding any version of me with any form of multiverse interaction/communication/travel. Finally, I would start looking for worlds with strong AI as a solved problem. Without a cluster of mes to also search, I need to be faster and more decisive in what I search for.

  How does the answer change if we assume you're not the only one with this power, and it's the domain of perhaps hundreds of thousands of others? (I think this would cut down on the rather obvious and somewhat boring 'take culture and information from other universes'.)

Are we assuming strong AI is harder than Eliezer and related people seem to assume it is? And do any other realities also have this power? If a bunch of people in a bunch of realities have this power and strong AI is reasonably achievable, it would be a race where various strong AI trying persuading people with good memory to bootstrap alternate version of them into existence in this reality. It would be a matter of determining which ones are properly value-aligned, which one are only mostly value-aligned (think Celestia AI from Friendship is Optimal), and which ones are only trying to seem value aligned while people implement and bootstrap them into existence and are actually plotting to paperclip everything they possibly can.

If we cut out the AI stuff, and assume that other smart people are already bootstrapping other realities technology and culture into our own... I think the finding younger versions of yourself hack is my priority.
