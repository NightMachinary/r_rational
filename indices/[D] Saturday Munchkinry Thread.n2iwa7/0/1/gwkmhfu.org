Speaking of "rather obvious and somewhat boring," find a version of yourself with the same power and more experience using it. Apply their memories and skills towards finding better choices of yous to merge with than you would think of yourself.

Does genetically identical mean the alternate self is still human? Or does the multiverse contain creatures with the same genetic code as humans, but different ribosomes, so the genes mean something completely different? There might be useful aliens out there, if that exploit is allowed.

It seems like acquiring a very athletic version of yourself would be a good thing to check off, for comfort, energy, and lifespan. Especially if shifting prevents you from having to put in the work to maintain it. If you can use your shifting to stay in a healthy, long-lived copy of yourself, then you'll gradually get access to copies of yourself with better and better information/technical skills, as multiversal yous get more time to accumulate experience.

For money, all that comes to mind is acquiring rare, valuable skills. Very niche engineering expertise pays well. On the very niche end, you could also charge for the time it takes you to find a multiversal copy with the exact right skill set. But it might be more immediately profitable to copy a you with skills at acting or sports. Any of these can be multiplied with skill at investment.

For the community, organizational skills are generically useful defaults. Hard to beat an effective mayor or union activist. But for any given community, there's probably some need pressing enough that it does beat the generics. So an important step would be getting involved and figuring out what sort of transit engineering or sanitation engineering or whatever is lacking, so you can copy that skillset from a copy of yourself.
