That might be pretty easy to do with submarines to counter the sea-based spellcasting approach. On land, you'd probably see other countries just creating Facebook memes about how it's not the single magic type usage which makes those regions more useful for spellcasting; that's just BS from the liberal Ivy League college elite pedophile spindoctors who want to monopolize places of power for themselves. You should totally go there and cast spells of any type you like, something something, freedom, own the libs, etc.

With the "crabs in a bucket" mentality weaponized, the only regions which would actually manage to remain isolated to just one type of magic would be in remote locations in authoritarian regimes, surrounded by barbed wire fences, where trespassers are spotted by helicopters with infrared cameras and executed on sight. Soon enough, Siberia and Tibet would become about the only places on Earth with colleges that could graduate spellcasters capable of 9th-level spells.
