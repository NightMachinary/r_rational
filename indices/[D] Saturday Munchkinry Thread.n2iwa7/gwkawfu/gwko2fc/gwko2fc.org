Yet another DnD spells munchkinry... this time with a large scale *coordination problem*:

An rare extra-dimensional traveler has brought the knowledge of [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/sorcererWizardSpells.htm][Spells]] to this reality. With several months or mental exercise and focus along with around a hundred dollars worth of ink and fine paper, the average person can learn and cast Level 0 cantrips. With a few year practice, a reasonably smart person can learn level 1 spells, A decade or two (depending on how smart a person is and how much they practice daily) will get them up to level 2 and 3 spells. A lifetime of studying will get you up to level 4 spells. Specializing in a single school (the schools are: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation), that is focusing on studying that school and ignoring at least two other schools will get the person studying it around 1 to 2 levels higher (1 level with the first few years of study, 2 levels with around a decade of study) in that school and one level higher in the schools they didn't ignore. Only studying and practicing a single school, with occasional dips into other schools as they directly relate will get you 3-4 levels higher (2 levels in the first few years of study and practice, 3 levels with around a decade 4 levels with a life time of study). Everyone can cast universalist school spells if they can cast any spells of that level. Preparing and casting spells is a bit like memorizing and reciting poetry, a bit like visualizing geometry, and a bit like performing mental math and requires high intelligence, with level 1 spells requiring just above average, level 4 requiring people in the upper 10% of the population in terms of memorization and mathematical ability, and level 9 requiring extreme genius and lots of practice. Limits on total amount of magic cast per day is a bit fuzzier than DnD 3.5e rules, by they are a good approximation.

So a specially focused college education in magic might manage to produce wizards with 2nd or 3rd level spells depending on how focused the education is (and how well they filter for the raw memorization and mathematical ability). Under these conditions, a pure specialist with a lifetime of dedicated study and practice might manage level 8 spells by the time they are old, while a partial specialist might only manage up to level 6 while the time they are old.

*Furthermore*... it seems that there is an oddity to magic being introduced into our reality. Spells of a single school being cast make spells in that school easier to cast and spells from other schools harder to cast. Keeping at least three schools of magic rare to nonexistent within a several hundred miles radius (500 to be absolutely sure, 100 is reasonably distant, the limits are kind of fuzzy), makes spells of the other schools easier to cast by around 1 level. Only allowing a single school of magic and frequently casting it (a small university focused on this magic would be enough) in a particular region and making all other schools nearly nonexistent makes it easier to cast by around 2-4 levels (depending on who strict the rules about casting other schools of magic are and how frequently that magic is used).

So an area that successfully banned 3 schools of magic might see the specialists coming out of college with level 3-4 spells instead of level 2-3 spells and their eventual elderly master pure specialists might manage level 9 spells. A region that only allowed a single school might see their specialists with level 4-7 spells and geniuses reaching level 9 with only a few decades of practice.

So with these constraints, what schools of magic should be banned to get the most out of magic as a whole? What clever gains from trade can be made by banning different magics in different geographical regions and specializing in particular types of magic? For the sake of simplicity, lets say our dimensional traveler knows about all the general high level stuff so scientists and would be wizards and world leaders can plan around that. The schools of magic interfering with each other is unknown to start with, but is rapidly notice because magic is so rare to start with (our extra-dimensional traveler theorizes that this effect might be unknown in his original world since all magic is used roughly equally there so no one noticed what the lack of a few schools of magic meant).

Personally... I think the mental boost available in transmutation make it the best to focus on for most regions of the world, but the unique mental effects of enchantment could rapidly advance cognitive psychology so a few regions should focus on them. And of course, the greater teleportation (and eventually gating or teleportation circle) of conjuration has strong applications to space travel that make it worth it for a few regions to specialize in that as well.
