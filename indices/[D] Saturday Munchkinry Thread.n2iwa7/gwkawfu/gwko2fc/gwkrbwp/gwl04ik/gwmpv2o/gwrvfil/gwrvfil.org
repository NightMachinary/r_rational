...I could imagine a place like North Korea going full-in on Divination. Nothing else is permitted, because their leader wants to know about any assassination attempts /before/ they happen. He /also/ wants to know about any other people trying to weaken his hold on Divination by casting other stuff before /that/ happens, so they can be stopped.

America might well turn out to be the Land of Enchantment; because if you're going to be the sort of person who uses wide-ranging mind-control to gain power over some or other country, then you're going to want to pick the one with the biggest army (and then you'll have to fight several other Enchanters to get there). Having specialised in Enchantment, though, you can then extend your mind-magic powers to make people mistrust and shun other schools of magic (so as to maintain your own magical strength).

Europe would be a mixed bag; the countries are small enough that only at the centre could you really give a powerful advantage to one type of magic, and you'd lose too much by preventing the others being cast near the borders.
