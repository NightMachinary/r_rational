Having considered this a bit further, I have another thought - when there are a lot of people who have this power, then at least /some/ of these people will be interested mainly in the question "what if I had handled that differently?"

There are a hundred little decisions that one makes every day. Turn left or right at the corner. Smile or frown at a stranger. Say 'hi' or not. And there is a sort of personality - with a lot of anxiety, perhaps - who would use this ability to ask and /answer/ the question: What would have happened had I done that differently? What would have happened had I said 'hi' to that cute girl?

And the power gives the answer. Similar? /Extremely/ similar - exactly the same, in fact, until yesterday's interaction. So it should be /remarkably/ fast to find the relevant person to merge from. Certainly no more than a week.

And then, no more than a week after the incident, he suddenly knows /exactly/ what would have happened had he said 'hi'.

...it's too late /now/, of course. He feels that missed his chance, a week ago. But what would happen if he said 'hi' /now/?

This is going to have... psychological implications.

--------------

But this sort of "one-week-delayed instant replay" is important for two other sorts of people as well. One of them is a person who has... /tastes/... that are not exactly legal. The sort of person who enjoys torture or other (potentially worse) insalubrious pursuits. He can draw on the memories of near-parallel selves who have abducted and tortured his neighbours and, without lifting the knife himself or doing anything else that can ever be traced back to him, he can effectively indulge in his... unfortunate hobbies. Or, at least, he can remember recently having indulged in them.

--------------

The /other/ sort of person that this sort of instant-replay is important for is a security professional; that is, a professional in the field of either providing or breaking security. For them, the instant-replay question is a little different... /let's find a near parallel world where I tried to break through this security - what did I learn? Where are the weaknesses?/ One side to exploit them, the other side to eliminate them, in a long-term arms race with no clear victor.
