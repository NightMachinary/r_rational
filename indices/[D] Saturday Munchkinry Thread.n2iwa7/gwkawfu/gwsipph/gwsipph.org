I think one of the first things I go looking for are things that I think might make me a happier person. First, a version (or versions) of me that has more (and more robust) techniques for managing my anxiety and depression. Second, possibly versions of me that have much more difficult or unpleasant lives in a variety of ways, to help me maintain perspective and reset my hedonic treadmill.

Third, I'd go looking for closure in sources of trauma and personal regrets, by seeing the versions of myself where particular events and decisions played out differently. All of these, so far, shouldn't be that costly in time to acquire, since many of them will be very close to me in the space of possible selves.

After these, I'd be tempted to go about trying to collect useful or powerful skills, and people have described various munchkin methods that seem pretty strong for this, so I'll try to suggest novel ones, which might end up being less optimal or more, depending on just how distance from present self is measured and how that time cost scales.

Depending on how difficult it is to integrate the "foreign" memories, I'd probably try to learn techniques for memory management/enhancement, and maybe other things to help with mental balance and cohesion, like meditation or lucid dreaming. This is the sort of thing where there are a lot of different techniques/strategies/approaches, so I'd try to leverage my power to effectively try out a bunch of different strategies and pick the one that works best for me.

I have personal pursuits wherein practice/progression is slowed by the fact that each instance of practice is a little different from the last, so you have to contend with noise in your signal as you try to learn from your experiences to improve your technique. Things like cooking, woodworking, and such. It seems silly to expend my power on this, but it would also be pretty cheap to get better at these things much more quickly by leveraging my power to gain different experiences of the same project.

There are some things which are made more time consuming because of our limited ability to parallelize things, and this power seems perfect for saving time on that. The first thing that occurs to me is getting better at chess, or particularly at preparing/learning openings and variations. But perhaps a more useful one would be languages. If I spend 4 years of intensive practice learning a language, then the alternate versions of me that spent 4 years intensively learning a different language shouldn't be too far away, and I could spend a few weeks or months picking up a lot of languages at that level of mastery. Do this enough and couple it with a field or two of technical expertise, and you could get a lot of mileage out of being a translator, especially since there's a number of fields where language barriers still slow down international cooperation significantly.

I can think of some others but this is getting really long.

I think, in summary, I'm the sort of person who would seek out personal satisfaction and happiness with this power, and optimize for living so that very nearby versions of me were unusually useful to synthesize, and try to parallelize/iterate as much as the power lets me. Maybe not the fastest way to win at the universe, but I don't feel much pressure to do that anyway, even if I'm the only one who can do this. Obviously, I'd be even less inclined if there's other people out there who can save the world.
