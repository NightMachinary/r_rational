The obvious move in the "it's only me" situation is to grab the closest "me" variant who is an amazing, prolific writer and try to get some novels published. Once I've got some seed money, a me-variant with the exact subset of skills needed to figure out a good business or political project and then a me-variant with the skills to see it to fruition will allow me to be the best possible politician or entrepreneur.

Money is power, and political influence is power; I'd put all of both behind whatever the me-variant with the best avoid-the-climate-apocalypse skillset thinks is the best way to proceed.

Also, I would absolutely indulge myself in having a me-variant of the opposite gender, a me-variant who possesses a sense of smell (which I was born without), and a me-variant who can actually draw worth a damn, even though none of those contributes in any way towards my plan.

I definitely want to keep a me-variant on standby who has top-notch emergency medicine skills, just in case.

Having hundreds of thousands of people able to do this... I really don't know, but it would certainly be a tremendous boon to anyone suffering from dysmorphia/body dysphoria. If there are that many people with the power, I doubt I'd be in a position to somehow better leverage it than anyone else, but it could certainly make my personal life easier!
