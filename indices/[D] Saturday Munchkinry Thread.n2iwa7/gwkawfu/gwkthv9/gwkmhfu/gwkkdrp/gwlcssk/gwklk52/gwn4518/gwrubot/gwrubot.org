Hmmm. I get /their/ memories and experiences, but /they/ do not get /mine/.

...well. They don't lose anything, really. Nonetheless. When I copy them over, do I have to fight to maintain my personality over theirs?

...either way, the real benefit is alternate mes with different skill sets. So, genetically the same, but took a different study path after school... that's probably less than a month, for a skill set I could have plausibly chosen going into university. Maybe a month for a skill set I could have been good at but would be unlikely to deliberately choose. Let's say two months for a skill set that I doubt I have the talent for.

This gives me /incredibly/ rapid skill gain; and with two months' warning, I can gain almost any skill I want. I'm going to be leaving my current employment and becoming a consultant, I think; the sort of person who can do /anything/ (that's not immoral) with two months' warning. I'm sure people will pay for those very wide skills...

...especially when I use some of my two-month shifts to pick up alternate selves who know the proofs of mostly intractable mathematics problems (mainly because said problems have been solved in their realities). I won't just copy the proofs out word-for-word - first, I'll make sure that all the prerequisite proofs exist...
