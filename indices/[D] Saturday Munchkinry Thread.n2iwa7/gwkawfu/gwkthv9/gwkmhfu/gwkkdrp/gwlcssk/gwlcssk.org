How specific is the search mechanism? Do you get feedback for if a version of you is within acquiring range?

This doesn't feel like the spirit of the question, but creating a bunch of Bitcoin wallets and checking if their public keys match specific existing wallets with a ton of Bitcoin and committing to memorizing the private keys of any that do match should work. Then I just have to search for a nearby version of me that's really excited about having gotten a lot of Bitcoin recently. I assume that search parameter isn't too specific.

I'm also assuming the math works out for generating keys. Infinity is large though!

Don't even really need to steal money from people for this to work: [[https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-dormant_5y-bitcoin-addresses.html][lots of Bitcoin is lost forever]].
