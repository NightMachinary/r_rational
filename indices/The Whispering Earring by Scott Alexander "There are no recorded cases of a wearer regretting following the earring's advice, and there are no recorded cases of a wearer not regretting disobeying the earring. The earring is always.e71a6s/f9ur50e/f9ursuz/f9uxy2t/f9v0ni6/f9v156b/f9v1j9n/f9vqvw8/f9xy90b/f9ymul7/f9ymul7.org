The earring solves the immediate problem it is given better than you. It advises you not to wear it. Then gives good life advice that makes giving it up harder thus leading to better odds of identity death or crippling widthdrawl later. Those aren't considered part of the problem space since they were both adequately resolved by the first piece of advice given and of no further interest to the earring.
