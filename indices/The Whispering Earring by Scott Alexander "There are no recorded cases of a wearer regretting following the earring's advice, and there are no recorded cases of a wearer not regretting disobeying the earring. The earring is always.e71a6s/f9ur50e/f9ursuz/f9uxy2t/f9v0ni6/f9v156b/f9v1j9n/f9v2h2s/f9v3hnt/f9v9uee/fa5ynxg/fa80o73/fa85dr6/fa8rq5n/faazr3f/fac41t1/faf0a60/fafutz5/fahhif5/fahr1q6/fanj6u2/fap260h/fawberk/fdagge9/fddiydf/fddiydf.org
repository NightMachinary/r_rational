  I don't think it makes sense to call electrodes that stimulate a nerve connected to the brain a brain implant. That's like two steps removed from messing with the brain. It doesn't become part of the brain or even interface directly with the brain, it interfaces with something else that does interface with the brain.

Fair point, I forgot that cochlear implants are a implant that goes on the, yknow, /Cochlea/. Not the brain.

As a alternative, might I suggest the [[https://www.wired.com/story/hippocampal-neural-prosthetic/][Hippocampal prosthesis]] Wikipedia article [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampal_prosthesis][here]]. Having recently moved to (thus far, successful) human trials, a hippocampal prosthetic functions by, essentially, trying to computationally predict the (properly functioning) behavior of the hippocampus for a given input via implanted electrodes, and then replicate its output.

This is very similar to what we've been talking about, is it not?

That link doesn't work, but the [[https://existentialcomics.com/comic/1][direct link]] still does. And that's pretty much my point in comic form. I forgot about that one, thank you for reminding me of it.
