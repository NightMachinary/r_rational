  Which is just....wrong. An accurate prediction model does not have to be the thing it is predicting. The map is not the territory.

1. Any sufficiently advanced map is indistinguishable from the territory.

2. Any map that is indistinguishably advanced can be shown to differ from the territory by inspection or interrogation.

Not /quite/. There seems to be a severe lack of ring users getting addicted to opiates and dying from an overdose. The ring respects community recognition, and it does not generate advice that causes the person to severely stand out in ways that still maximize happiness. I suspect if Eliezer put on the ring, he would not forsake AI and start taking up gardening, for instance. I think the ring does /something/ that involves maximizing your value function. So if that's right, if it fails to be an upload, it has to be because you value something about yourself that you don't value about yourself. Eeh?

I guess it could be the case that there's something about yourself that you or anyone else around you should value but don't. Then the ring would fail to preserve it. Though that's an implementation failure of the ring - it should first change you to value that thing, and then its first advice would not happen.
