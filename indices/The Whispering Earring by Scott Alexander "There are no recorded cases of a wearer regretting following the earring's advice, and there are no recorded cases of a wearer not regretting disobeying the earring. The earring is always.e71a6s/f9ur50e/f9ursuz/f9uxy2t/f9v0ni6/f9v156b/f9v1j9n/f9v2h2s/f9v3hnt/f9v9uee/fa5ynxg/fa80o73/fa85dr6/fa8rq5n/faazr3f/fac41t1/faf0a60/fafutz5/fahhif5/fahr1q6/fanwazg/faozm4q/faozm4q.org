  Well, the brain processing information follows from physics (every composite (and arguably every fundamental) physical object processes information (it transforms inputs into outputs)).
#+end_quote

The wikipedia page for information processing systems agrees with you. Probably because information processing is the predominant metaphor central to most people's worldview right now. Just above where it says stuff about a rock falling "holding information" about gravity or whatever, in the initial description, it says "information processors take information in one form and process it into another form */via algorithms/* ^{[emphasis mine]}."

This is ridiculous. I'm done with this argument. I hope [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is still around in 5 to 50 years so I can tell you "I told you so" after the "computation / information processing" metaphor is discarded.

    Because there is no "you" to do the perceiving, there is only the perceiving.

  So, what is your position? Are you your brain (as you said before), or do you not exist at all?
#+end_quote

"You" "are" "your" brain. It's a problem with semantics. Our language is built around the assumption that there /is/ a "you." There is a brain. The brain performs perception. This "feels like" Selfhood. But there is no Self. There is no "you." You are not your consciousness, your consciousness is the brain in your skull performing perception. You are not the consciousness, you /have/ consciousness.

An interesting article:

  We understand control as being UP and being subject to control as being DOWN: We say, “I have control over him,” “I am on top of the situation,” “He's at the height of his power,” and, “He ranks above me in strength,” “He is under my control,” and “His power is on the decline.” Similarly, we describe love as being a physical force: “I could feel the electricity between us,” “There were sparks,” and “They gravitated to each other immediately.” Some of their examples reflected embodied experience. For example, Happy is Up and Sad is Down, as in “I'm feeling up today,” and “I'm feel down in the dumps.” These metaphors are based on the physiology of emotions, which researchers such as Paul Eckman have discovered. It's no surprise, then, that around the world, people who are happy tend to smile and perk up while people who are sad tend to droop.

  Metaphors We Live By was a game changer. Not only did it illustrate how prevalent metaphors are in everyday language, it also suggested that a lot of the major tenets of western thought, including the idea that reason is conscious and passionless and that language is separate from the body aside from the organs of speech and hearing, were incorrect. In brief, it demonstrated that “our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature.”

Here's a PDF of the book the article talks about:

  Would you run away from a gradual brain replacement?
#+end_quote

Obviously. The consciousness performed by the replica of my brain would be exactly the same as my consciousness, right?

So that entity - my replacement - would /constantly/ be aware that I (the me currently typing this at you) was dead and did not and would never experience the experiences the entity experienced, so every wonderful experience that entity experienced would feel hollow and empty. In words you would probably use, "I" would morn "my own" death pretty much 24/7. So of course I'd run away from uploading. Not just out of a desire to continue experiencing experience, but out of a desire to not bring into existence an entity who would inherit /my/ understanding of /its/ nature. My mindclone would become neurotically obsessed with finding a way to kill itself.

  I'd like to flesh out your position before we start explaining.

  To see what you actually believe (instead of typing out that "you don't exist"), imagine if you'd try to run away from a gradual brain replacement or not.

  If you would, you probably believe it would destroy your consciousness.

  If you wouldn't, you probably believe it wouldn't do anything to you.

  It's a simple way of imagining what you really believe.
#+end_quote

Why was any of that necessary? That's an "experiment" to suss out the position of someone who hasn't already made their position clear.

It almost seems like you think you're being clever by leading me to a realization that I don't actually believe what I've professed to believe over the course of this argument. Like, "see, you /wouldn't/ run away from a gradual brain upload, so there's a discrepancy between what you /say/ you believe and what you /actually/ believe, so you must /actually/ believe the way that /I/ believe since that's the /correct/ way to believe."

I've been /crystal clear/ this entire time that destruction of the brain equals death. There's pretty much no other way to interpret anything I've been saying over /the past several days/.

Speaking of "/the past several days/", you're welcome to respond to get the last word in if you feel like you need to, but I'm done here. You're just not getting the fact that everything you're saying in support of the "information processing" premise is itself based on granting the "information processing" premise. "Of course the mind is an information processor, because it processes information." That's what this conversation feels like to me, and I'm not interested in wasting any more of my time on it.
