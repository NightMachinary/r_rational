Frankly, says you. And just you.

You reject 'philosophical musing', but what you're stating is, I would say, /also/ philosophical musing. Defining a person as "the entire chain of effect throughout the entire universe, since the beginning of time that led to them existing in that moment" sounds rather 'philosophical' to me.

If your definition of death is so strict that living causes 'death', well, okay fine. Its hard to say that it's wrong, because words that are that 'human' are very hard to get precise definitions for, and so you can't really prove that its wrong. But its not a definition that I, or many other people agree with, and I don't think you've made a very convincing argument for it.

You keep adamantly stating that /this/ is the definition of life/death, but why? This isn't purely hypothetical thought scenarios that can be 'rejected'. Uploading, gradual brain replacement, etc will almost certainly become possible if technology continues to progress. Will uploads be considered non-persons/not the original person? Maybe, maybe not. But will partial uploads? Brain replacements? Even people with brain implants, even minor ones? Because /those/ already exist, and I've yet to hear about someone mourn the death of a loved one who got a cochlear implant and became a different person.

And why do these things 'break the chain' at all? You said a chain is everything back to the big bang. How would a upload be any less a part of the chain than, say, the geological activity of primordial earth? It's not like a upload isn't part of the universe. The latter is probably even /more/ dissociated from anything brain-like than a upload. And a upload is a direct product of the 'pattern', more directly associated than the human brain is with early stellar dynamics.

You can go on believing that this counts as 'death', fine. In that case, if I'm still around when uploading is developed, I will happily 'kill myself' as you put it. Heck, with how convenient being able to copy yourself, transmit (actually copy+delete) yourself place to place, etc would be, I might end up 'killing myself' hundreds or thousands of times! If you want to hold a funeral for me, and all the other people who do that, well you do you. I'll even send a me over to participate.

But you get to foot the bill.
