  You are your brain

That wouldn't work, because then you could, in theory, achieve [[http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html][fading or suddenly disappearing qualia through a gradual brain replacement]]. (A "gradual brain replacement" is a gradual replacement of very small parts of your brain with their functional equivalents (made of something else, like a small silicon computer, (but it could be anything with the same input-output pattern)), until your entire brain is replaced by a different object implementing the same input-output pattern.) But fading and suddenly disappearing qualia are both impossible - it follows that your consciousness would stay, which means that you're not your brain.

  It just happens, it isn't controlled/directed by a mind.

That's a misunderstanding of what "software" is. Software isn't some /extra/ entity that controls the hardware. Once you specify every particle of the hardware and its properties, the software is /already there/.

A silicon computer running software "just happens" in the exact same way brain processes "just happen".
