The story actually explicitly said "the earring is always right" and that there is no case of a wearer regretting following or failing to regret not following. Yes, they are unable to do so at the end, but that's the extreme case. There would be plenty of time for them to do so in the early stages, and they never do. And they always regret it if they don't follow the instructions. The story pretty explicitly says that the following the advice of the ring will always be better / make you happier
