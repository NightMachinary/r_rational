  where the bloody hell you think algorithms are hiding in the brain
#+end_quote

Algorithms are everywhere in the brain (modulo perhaps those parts of the brain that play only the role of e.g. structural support (if there are any such parts)).

This isn't a hard question - it's like asking where are algorithms in a laptop on your table - it depends on what parts of the physical system perform the computation.

  The computational theory of mind is just modernized dualism
#+end_quote

That's a double misunderstanding of "software" /and/ "dualism". "Software" is simply those aspects of the hardware that implement the computation.

For computational theory of mind (which is both the only candidate and the correct theory to explain consciousness) to be dualistic, "software" would need to be an extra entity whose nature would be nonphysical in some way.

  If you destroy the brain then the brain has been destroyed, regardless of how gradually you destroy it and regardless of whether or not you replace it with an exact copy capable of performing consciousness in the same way that the original brain performed consciousness.
#+end_quote

So, what are you saying you'd perceive if your brain was being gradually replaced? Would you perceive your conscious experience fading out, or would it suddenly switch off for you at some point?

#+begin_quote
  Where the hell did I say anything about hardware being controlled/directed by software?
#+end_quote

You wrote

#+begin_quote
  It just happens, it isn't controlled/directed by a mind.
#+end_quote

A natural interpretation of that is that you interpreted my explanation as me saying that mind (being the software) controls/directs anything in the brain. Please rephrase if you meant something else.
