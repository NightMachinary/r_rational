Ultimately, in this context, I don't think there is a meaningful difference between "a brain performing perception", "a brain with 1 neuron replaced by identical silicon performing perception", and "a silicon brain functionally identical to the original brain performing perception".

Yes, the original brain was destroyed in the process, the new brain is not the original even if it is functionally identical. Yes, /technically/, this killed you. However, for the intents and purposes of everyone around you, the new you, the former you, and the vast majority of everything else we consider relevant, the new brain is effectively the old brain. It is only a 'death' in the most technical and meaningless of senses.

To put it another way, if replacing parts with functionally identical alternatives over a period of time causes this thing we call 'death', then eating and general homeostasis will periodically kill you over the course of your 'life'. Unless there is some significant reason that you would die if you replaced neurons with silicon neurons, but wouldn't die if you replaced all of your carbon-12 atoms with carbon-13.

I don't know if a decent method of describing brains would in the form of instantiated algorithms or not. But, most macroscale physical systems we've learned to simulate, can be simulated in a manner we consider sufficiently accurate without simulating every particle and field. The output is not (probabilistically and such) identical as it would be if we did, but our criteria for 'effectively identical' is broad enough that we don't care in the slightest which of the trillions upon trillions of different atomic configurations it is, so long as it is similar on a larger scale we consider relevant. It stands to reason that this also extends to simulating brains, as it is a macroscale physical system.

So, hypothetically, the Earring could have a simulation of the wearer's brain in it, which is not technically the brain but is functionally identical. The Earring could use this simulation to replace the physical brain, by measuring all significant inputs and relaying all significant outputs, such as neural impulses, blood hormone levels, and others. Because it most likely does not need to perfectly replicate every atom of the simulated brain, measure every atomic vibration at the surface boundary of where the simulated brain would be in the skull, etc, it's plausible that the Earring could gather and transmit the necessary information via high-frequency sound as depicted in the story, with the actual contents of the skull being modified as necessary to serve as a 'relay' and 'output'.

Now, the obvious response is, "we /don't know/ if the Earring does this". To which I say, "Would it make a difference if it doesn't?". To sum it up, we're using very human concepts like 'life', 'death', 'person', etc here. And to humans, if it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, and you cut it open and it looks like a duck, /it is a duck/. If you cut it open and it's blue for some reason, but everything else is the same? Pretty much still a duck. It has to be fairly un-ducklike to stop being a duck.

So, sure, maybe the Earring is using some other method to merely /appear/ to be simulating a brain in a manner that we would /definitely/ consider to be the same person. No one cares. It is the same person, according to the majority of the beings who defined that word and use it. You can say it's a different collection of atoms than existed in X location at Y time, you can say that it is not a collection of atoms with a continuous existence traceable from X time to Y time, etc. But it's the same person.

Now, the /caveat/ here is that the Earring does not just perfectly simulate people. It does some weird optimizing process, /or/ it predicts the future, /or/ it has a agenda of its own and it optimizes people for it, /or/...

And that is something that is unclear. But for the purposes of "can the brain move in to the earring", it doesn't matter at all if we get into the nitty gritty of how the brain works or anything. Because from the moment the question was 'is this the same person', the answer was /yes/, because that word doesn't care about the nitty gritty.
