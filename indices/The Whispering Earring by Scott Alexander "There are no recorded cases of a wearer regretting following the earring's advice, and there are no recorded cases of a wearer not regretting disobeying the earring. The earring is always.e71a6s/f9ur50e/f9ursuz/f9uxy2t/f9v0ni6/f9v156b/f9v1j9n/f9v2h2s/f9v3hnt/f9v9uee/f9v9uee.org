Your interpretation seems to rely on several things that are not directly supported in the text (most notably the uploading...that's really not implied by the text at all). That doesn't mean it's wrong (frankly, no interpretation of a text can be "wrong" per se, people take what they want form things), but it's a more complicated, less obvious interpretation, and probably not the one intended by the author (again, not that there is necessarily anything wrong in that).

-edit- just to address the implied uploading, according to your earlier comments, if I understand your logic, your argument is basically that "anything that can predict a thing, is that thing". Which is just....wrong. An accurate prediction model does not /have/ to be the thing it is predicting. The map is not the territory. Also, a VERY important distinction in what the earring is doing: it IS NOT predicting the users behavior, it is telling the user what behavior will make the user happer. That does not imply at all that the earring knows what the user /would/ do, just that it knows what outcomes will make the user happier and how to achieve those outcomes.
