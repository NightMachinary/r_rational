  There is no such thing as "structural support" in the brain. The brain is composed entirely of neurons

Okay, my qualifications can be summed up as "took highschool biology", and I know for a fact that this is untrue. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia][Glial cells]] exist. While the exact concentration is in question (if you take the Wikipedia page at face value, old studies claim 10 Glials per neuron, a new study claims 1:1 or less), it's quite clear that they /[[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=glial+cells&btnG=][exist]]/.

Secondly, yes, the brain is neurons and junk and such, with as much exquisite detail as you wish. No contest there.

And those neurons are composed of chemical compounds (and some unbound elements). Chemical compounds and elements are composed of atoms. Atoms are composed of fields and subatomic particles and other things. Fields and subatomic particles can, so far as we've discovered, be completely and entirely described by math. Which can be computed.

If I can simulate particles and fields, I can simulate the atoms which make up the compounds which make up the neurons which make up the networks which make up a brain. Actually doing so is just a matter of scope.

There are details which complicate things a little, sure, but in all /brains run on physics/, and saying that brains can't be computed is equivalent to saying that physics cannot be computed. That, or it's stating that there is a element to brains specifically that can't be computed in contrast to everything else, which sounds like dualism to me.
