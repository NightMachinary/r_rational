If the person can appear as the same person from the outside (memories/personality) modulo being more happy, it means your consciousness gets gradually uploaded to the earring, and nothing bad happens to you (except that the resulting mind keeps magically knowing what to do to achieve happiness and will always want to do it, which isn't necessarily a kind of harm), (but it's a sufficient change that I'd consider it death).

Gradually, your mind runs less and less on your brain, and more and more on the earring.
