It doens't maximize your long term goals because it gives you better ones. /The earing is always right/, as it were. The story says that if you ever deviate you regret it.

The earing is the best hedonic course of action. Taking the earing off is like pushing a nail through your hand. I get why someone might do it in the heat of a moment, in the 'people have abstract thoughts and take actions that are whatever' kind of way, but it is really odd to see someone sitting down and constructing arguments against the optimum path. Like, aren't you kind of fighting the definition?
