As far as why it doesn't tell you to remove it at stage 2, I can think of two reasons.

A) It's designed that way intentionally

or

B) For a large percentage of people, life is entirely about the pursuit of happiness, and rarely if ever about intellectual or spiritual development (especially if it comes at the cost of immediate happiness or gratification). Since the damn earring works to maximize happiness as the user understands it, it's very possible that not having to make decisions or think about things IS a form of happiness to a percentage of the population, so there would be no reason for the earring to recommend removing it again.

I think that this sort of artefact would be cursed for the general populace (cursed in the sense that it's methodology is something we would consider evil), and merely immensely dangerous for a properly prepared and intelligent user.

If you're able to reflect upon your own actions sufficiently, as well as maintain a continuous distrust of the "never wrong" voice whispering in your ear, I think it may be possible to employ this thing without necessarily losing your free will to it.

I don't think I'd personally risk wearing it for more then a few weeks, if that, but I think someone with more willpower then I would be able to put it to good, long-term use.
