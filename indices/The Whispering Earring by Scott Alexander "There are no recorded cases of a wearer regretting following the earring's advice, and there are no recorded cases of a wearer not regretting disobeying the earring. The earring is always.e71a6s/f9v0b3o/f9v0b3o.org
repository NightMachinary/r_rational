Seems like it'd be pretty easy listen to it at the first stage when it's giving major life advice, and then take it off once it starts micromanaging. Of course, that would assume you knew what would happen to you at the end.

I like that If this was an SCP it would probably fuse itself to your skull and eat your brain, but he's written it to imply that you lose higher functions naturally through disuse which is much more compelling
