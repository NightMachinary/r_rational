Suppose I have two different programs for finding the sum of integers from 1 to n. One of them uses a loop and just adds each number in turn. The other multiplies n by (n+1)/2.

The outputs of these computations are identical. If we call your definition of the word "isomorphic" as isomorphic_{DD}, then they're absolutely isomorphic_{DD}. But there is no isomorphism between the states of the computers as the programs are run - no sense in which an intermediate state of computer 1 corresponds to any state of computer 2.

This standard of "same computation" that requires a correspondence between internal states is pretty common in the computational interpretation of consciousness.
