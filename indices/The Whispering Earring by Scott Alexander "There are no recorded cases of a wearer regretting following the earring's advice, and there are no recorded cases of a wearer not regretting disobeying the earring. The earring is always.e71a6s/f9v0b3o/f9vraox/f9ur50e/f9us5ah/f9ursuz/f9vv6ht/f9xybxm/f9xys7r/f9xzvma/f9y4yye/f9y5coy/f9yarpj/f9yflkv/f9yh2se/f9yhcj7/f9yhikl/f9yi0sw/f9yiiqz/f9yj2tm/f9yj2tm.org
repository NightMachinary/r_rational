Sure, the ring could run a very thin, shell-like upload - just exactly enough to fool people, just the specific people that it was around, and nothing more. And if suddenly someone who knew that person from childhood and had access to shared information showed up, it would be screwed.

In any case, I think it's simply not that kind of story. There's a plausible horror story about the shallowness of human interaction where the ring wears your skin like a suit while maximizing its own inscrutable values. I just feel like this one is more consistent with the uploading view. The whole point of the ring is that it's a "better you."
