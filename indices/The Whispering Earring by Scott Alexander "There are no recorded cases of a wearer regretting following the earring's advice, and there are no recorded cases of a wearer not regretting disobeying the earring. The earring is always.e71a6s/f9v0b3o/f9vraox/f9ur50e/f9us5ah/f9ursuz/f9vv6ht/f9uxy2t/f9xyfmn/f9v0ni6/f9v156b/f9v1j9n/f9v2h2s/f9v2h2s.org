Don't forget, if we take as a given that the earring's advice always leads to a better long term happiness, the earring itself tells us that it's use is negative. The very first advice is "don't use it", implying that using the earring is unambiguously worse than not using it. Since outwardly, earring users /seem/ to be happy, successful people, above average, then that must imply something about the users internal state. All the rest of the advice after the first piece is "well, given that you've already decided to use the earring, here's the best you can do".
