  qualia
#+end_quote

That's a philosophy thing (sometimes used in psychology). I don't know who the hell told philosophers and psychologists that they have authority to butt their way into neuroscience, but they don't. Daniel Dennett might be literally the only philosopher qualified to say things about the mind. [EDIT: Sam Harris literally has a PhD in neuroscience, and I'm sure he /must/ have said /something/ about philosophy of the mind, but he slipped my mind since he's so heavily oriented towards religion.] "Qualia." Pfft. As if "the feeling of the experience of redness" is something distinct from "the perception of redness."

  "gradual brain replacement"
#+end_quote

Yeah I know what that is thanks. Yesterday you replied to one of my comments, which was about uploading. I think you should've assumed that I'm aware of basics.

Speaking of that reply...

  There has to be [a person preserved on the other side of the earring], because the resulting brain/earring composite is functionally isomorphic to a person, which means... that there is a person inside.

If you don't already understand how ridiculous what you've said is, I'm not going to have the time or the patience to force you to understand. I just can't.

  the computational theory of mind [is] correct
#+end_quote

You don't get to just /assert/ that the computational theory of mind is correct (it most certainly /isn't/).

I'd like you to meditate on the subject of where the bloody hell you think algorithms are hiding in the brain.

When I wrote "this idea... feels very strongly to me like a pseudo-religious belief," I started to also write things about "mind-body dualism" but I felt that that was writing too much. I'll say some of that now.

The computational theory of mind is just modernized dualism, except instead of a soul reaching into the brain and performing actions on our sensory experience you think algorithms are performing actions on our sensory experience. Sensory stimulation happens - everything after that is dominoes falling.

Dennett was right, Descartes totally poisoned people's ideas about minds.

  it follows that your consciousness would stay, which means that you're not your brain.
#+end_quote

â€‹No. Consciousness is not a thing that exists in your brain, it is a thing that your brain does. Your brain does not have consciousness inside it, your brain performs consciousness. It doesn't matter how gradually you replace the brain, even if you do it neuron by neuron. You'll have a perfect synthetic replica of your brain, and it'll perform consciousness just like yours used to.

Get up right now. Look at the nearest wall. It is 8 feet away from you. Move halfway to the wall. It is now 4 feet away from you. Then move halfway to the wall again. And again. And again. And again. Two feet. One foot. Six inches. Three inches. It must be impossible to reach the wall, because you can move halfway to the wall an infinite number of times.

That's what "gradual replacement" sounds like. A philosophical thought experiment that doesn't apply to the real world. If you destroy the brain then the brain has been destroyed, regardless of how gradually you destroy it and regardless of whether or not you replace it with an exact copy capable of performing consciousness in the same way that the original brain performed consciousness.

    It just happens, it isn't controlled/directed by a mind.
  #+end_quote

  That's a misunderstanding of what "software" is.
#+end_quote

Where the hell did I say anything about hardware being controlled/directed by software?
