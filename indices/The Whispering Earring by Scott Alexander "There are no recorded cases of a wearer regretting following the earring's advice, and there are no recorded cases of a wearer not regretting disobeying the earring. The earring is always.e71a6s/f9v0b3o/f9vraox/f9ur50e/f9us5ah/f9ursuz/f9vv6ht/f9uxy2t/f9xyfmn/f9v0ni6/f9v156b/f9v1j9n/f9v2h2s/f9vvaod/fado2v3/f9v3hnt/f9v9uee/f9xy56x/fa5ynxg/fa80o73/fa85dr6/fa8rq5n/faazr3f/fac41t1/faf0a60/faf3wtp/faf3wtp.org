I think the problem isn't that [[/u/ElizabethRobinThales][u/ElizabethRobinThales]] doesn't know that brains can be emulated, I think the problem is that they don't know that your consciousness doesn't disappear during a gradual brain replacement (and therefore don't know that it doesn't disappear in a gradual mind upload).
