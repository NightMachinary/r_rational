It doesn't need to read your mind or the future if it's a superintelligence... in fact reading your mind doesn't help it all that much in establishing a reputation for omniscience nearly as much as superintelligence. It just has to wait until by observation it sees a more optimal action for you. Sort of a pre-selection version of cherry-picking. Over time it builds a database about you that allows it to make more near-certain predictions and advise you on that basis.
