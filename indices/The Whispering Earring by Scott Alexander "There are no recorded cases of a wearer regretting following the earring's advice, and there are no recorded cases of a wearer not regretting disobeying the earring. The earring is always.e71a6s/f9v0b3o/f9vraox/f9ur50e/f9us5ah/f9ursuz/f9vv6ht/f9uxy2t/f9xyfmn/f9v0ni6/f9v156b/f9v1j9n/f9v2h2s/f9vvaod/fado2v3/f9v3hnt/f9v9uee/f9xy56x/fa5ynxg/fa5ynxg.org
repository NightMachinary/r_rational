  if I understand your logic, your argument is basically that "anything that can predict a thing, is that thing". Which is just....wrong

It's correct about minds, because minds are software, so if I can predict someone, there must be their mind running on my brain.

At the beginning, your mind runs only on your brain. As the earring micromanages you more and more, your mind gradually moves to the earring (because the composite brain+earring at the beginning contains your mind only in your brain, at the end only in the earring, and in between it's partly here, partly there (as your brain is partially atrophied) - in other words, your mind gradually moved from your brain to the earring).
