I think this story is more related to Scott's Thousand Shards of Desire and his explicit preference toward being really-real rather than a brain in a jar. This is a horror story because at the end the wearer is no longer a thinking rational actor, but is closer to the neural tissue with its pleasure sensors being electrically activated. A wirehead, passive in her own body.

I think you're correct that at some level the earring must contain a complete model of the wearer's brain (and potentially all brains). For the reasons above, I suspect most people wouldn't consider that less horrifying. Regardless of whether or not there's a copy of me in a system somewhere, atrophying the brain of current-me is still a bad thing. So the horror remains, even if there's an intact copy somewhere. (Worse, there's nothing in the story to suggest copies are retained, rather than scanned, used, and dumped.)

Also I think your interpretation is incorrect within the facts presented by the story. It can't be doing a gradual upload, because it's advice is correct immediately. The story specifies that its first advice is on major life decisions, which requires are more complete model of a person than required to move particular muscles to move around. The gradual part of the process is training the wearer to accept the commands, the earring's understanding must be complete from the beginning.

Intriguing perspective though, thank you.
