Well, the brain processing information follows from physics (every composite (and arguably every fundamental) physical object processes information (it transforms inputs into outputs)).

There is a way of discovering a symbolic representation of whatever is being processed in every object - otherwise, the physical structure of the object couldn't transform the input into an appropriate output. So given the physical state of the object, it's guaranteed that some aspects of the object will be a symbolic representation of whatever is being processed.

The only difference is that in a silicon computer, it's clear what constitutes the symbols (because humans engineered computers to be easily comprehensible), but in the brain it's harder (but you can already experimentally verify it directly - e.g. by translating a brain scan into a picture the person sees).

So it's even more general - not only the brain processes information, but every physical object processes information (except that it's usually simple/uninteresting, since most physical objects didn't evolve to be a control center of a complex organism).

  Because there is no "you" to do the perceiving, there is only the perceiving.

So, what is your position? Are you your brain (as you said before), or do you not exist at all?

The difference is obvious - if you don't exist, the earring can't hurt you. If you are your brain, the earring kills you.

So, are you your brain, or you don't exist? (The correct answer is a third one, obviously, but I'd like to flesh out your position before we start explaining.)

  If you were to replace a part of your brain with silicone neurons, this new arrangement of brain and silicone would continue to perform perception. If you were to replace the rest of your brain with silicone neurons, this new arrangement of silicone would continue to perform perception. If the replacements were done in such a way that the silicone neurons continued to make new connections in the same way that the carbon neurons used to do, then the performance of perception by the silicone brain would be indistinguishable from the performance of perception by the recently deceased organic brain.

This is correct, but that doesn't tell you how you'd perceive that happening.

To see what you actually believe (instead of typing out that "you don't exist"), imagine if you'd try to run away from a gradual brain replacement or not.

If you would, you probably believe it would destroy your consciousness.

If you wouldn't, you probably believe it wouldn't do anything to you.

It's a simple way of imagining what you really believe.

(So, would you run away from a gradual brain replacement or not?)
