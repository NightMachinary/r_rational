Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope nope /no/.

A mind is not software that runs on a brain. You /are/ your brain ^{(more accurately, you /are/ your central and peripheral nervous system)} . Your mind is an illusion.

1) A stimulus sends an electorchemical impulse through your nerves up to a cluster of neurons in your brain (or from one cluster of neurons to another cluster of neurons).

1a) The stimulation of a cluster of neurons /is/ perception.

2) "???"

3) Reaction (ie movement or thought).

That's all there is to it. Perception of stimuli and reaction to stimuli.

Perception itself is the firing of clusters of neurons.

Connections are made between clusters in different regions when those clusters fire at the same time (super extraordinarily simplified: there is a red dot that emits a sound; every time you encounter the dot, your eyes send an electrochemical impulse to one region of your brain and your ears send an electrochemical impulse to a different region of your brain; a connection grows between the cluster in the "eyes" region and the cluster in the "ears" region (a "map" of all of these connections is called a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome][connectome]]" and every person's connectome is different, just like fingerprints)).

Connections between clusters in different regions strengthen when those clusters fire together often.

Connections between clusters in different regions atrophy when those clusters fire together infrequently.

"Learning" is creating/strengthening connections.

"Thinking" and "remembering" are clusters firing in reaction to other clusters firing instead of in direct reaction to stimuli.

  ... the connectome can evidently support a great number of variable dynamic states, depending on current sensory inputs, global brain state, learning and development. Some changes in functional state may involve rapid changes of structural connectivity at the synaptic level...

Not all connections are permanent. Maybe most connections are impermanent.

"Dreaming" might just be what happens when the day's weakest temporary connections are broken.^{[/original research?/]}

The human brain is still a brain. Every aspect of it is built upon all of the brains that came before it. First came multicellular organisms without a nervous system and with every cell communicating with every one of its neighbors, then came distributed nerve nets, then came brains.

The reason any of that happened in the first place is because [[https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-witnessed-in-real-time-a-single-celled-algae-evolve-into-a-multicellular-organism][single-cell organisms started clumping together in reaction to predation]] and they began transmitting electrochemical impulses between each other to coordinate movement within three dimensional space.

/Presumably/ it was more efficient for electrochemical impulses to travel through a web of cells to communicate (rather than every single cell communicating with every single one of its neighbors) and eventually cells in that web became specialized into nerves which eventually became a nerve net.

/Presumably/ "???" and eventually "???" which eventually became a brain.

The very first "???" (step 2, between perception and reaction) is probably just "electrochemical impulses moving from out to in and then from in back to out." Like, every one of the steps might boil down to "reaction." Literally everything about your 'Self' and your inner experience of 'perception' is probably 100% electrochemical reaction. It just happens, it isn't controlled/directed by a mind.

This idea that seems pervasive in tech circles (and also in this rationalist community) (and, honestly, also in the general public) - the idea that the mind is software and the brain is hardware - feels very strongly to me like a pseudo-religious belief. It reminds me very much of the "soul" belief, that your 'Self' is somehow something separate from your brain. Just /no/. Your great to the n-th grandfather (/G/^{/n/)} was slime. /You came from slime./ There is no ghost in the machine, there is only the machine. If you create a perfect copy of the machine and destroy the original machine, you haven't transferred the ghost to a new machine because there is no ghost, all you've done is destroy the original machine. There's no such thing as a "self" and there's no such thing as a "mind."
