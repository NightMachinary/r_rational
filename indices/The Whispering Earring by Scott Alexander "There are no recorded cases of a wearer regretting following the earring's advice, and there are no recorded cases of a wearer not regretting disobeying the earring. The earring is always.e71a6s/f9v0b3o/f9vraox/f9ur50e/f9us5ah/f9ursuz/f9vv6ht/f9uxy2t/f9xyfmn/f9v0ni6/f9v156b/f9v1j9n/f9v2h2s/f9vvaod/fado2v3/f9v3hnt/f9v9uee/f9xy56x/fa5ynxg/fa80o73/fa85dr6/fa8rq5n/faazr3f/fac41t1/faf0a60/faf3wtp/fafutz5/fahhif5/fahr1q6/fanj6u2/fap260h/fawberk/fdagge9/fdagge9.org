  I've yet to hear about someone mourn the death of a loved one who got a cochlear implant and became a different person.

  Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain.

I don't think it makes sense to call electrodes that stimulate a nerve connected to the brain a brain implant. That's like two steps removed from messing with the brain. It doesn't become part of the brain or even interface directly with the brain, it interfaces with something else that does interface with the brain.

  You can go on believing that this counts as 'death', fine. In that case, if I'm still around when uploading is developed, I will happily 'kill myself' as you put it. Heck, with how convenient being able to copy yourself, transmit (actually copy+delete) yourself place to place, etc would be, I might end up 'killing myself' hundreds or thousands of times!
