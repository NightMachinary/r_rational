#+begin_quote
  is the predominant metaphor
#+end_quote

It's not a metaphor. I explained why there are symbols in every physical object (even though they're only obvious in engineered things, and somewhat less obvious (but still verifiably existing) in the brain). Look:

#+begin_quote
  There is a way of discovering a symbolic representation of whatever is being processed in every object - otherwise, the physical structure of the object couldn't transform the input into an appropriate output. So given the physical state of the object, it's guaranteed that some aspects of the object will be a symbolic representation of whatever is being processed.

  The only difference is that in a silicon computer, it's clear what constitutes the symbols (because humans engineered computers to be easily comprehensible), but in the brain it's harder (but you can already experimentally verify it directly - e.g. by translating a brain scan into a picture the person sees).
#+end_quote

If you think you see any principal difference between a brain and a computer about symbols, please respond to my explanation directly, instead of just repeating the same sentence.

  "You" "are" "your" brain.

  Would you run away from a gradual brain replacement?

#+begin_quote
  Obviously.
#+end_quote

So you are your brain, and you'd run away from a gradual brain replacement, because your brain ceases to exist, which means you ceased to exist too and were replaced by a clone. OK.

So, at the end of the gradual brain replacement, you will have blacked out forever, and in your place, there is going to be a fully conscious clone - acting like you, but still another person.

The question is, in what manner would your perception cease to exist, as felt from the inside? At the beginning, you're perceiving everything normally since the gradual brain replacement hasn't begun yet. At the end, you're blacked out forever (like after a car accident). But what do you feel in between? Does your awareness of the outside world fade out gradually, or does it stop abruptly at some point?
