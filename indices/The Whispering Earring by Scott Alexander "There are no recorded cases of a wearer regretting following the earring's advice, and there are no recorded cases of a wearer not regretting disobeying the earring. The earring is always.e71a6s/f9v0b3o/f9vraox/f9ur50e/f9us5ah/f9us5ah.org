Can you recite all of Homer from memory? Can you chase down rabbits and deer by just not stopping while they succumb to exhaustion? Your ancestors could, but now you have printing presses, and libraries, and agriculture and don't have to, so your (and my) capacity to do so has atrophied to the point where our ancestors would be horrified (or maybe very envious). Is it really horrid/non-rational to delegate to someone/something else that what "they" can do better? Does it make sense to spend extra resources preserving the capacity if it is proven it won't be needed? (I would argue that some limited skill might be a good idea in case what your relying on goes away but that doesn't negate the larger argument).
