  Wouldn't a better decision be to keep it on person, and use it either in rare and important cases, or after first coming up with a list of possible solutions yourself for each given scenario, or both?

I think the answer to the question depends on what you think about what it means to be yourself. For example [[/u/FeepingCreature][u/FeepingCreature]] makes the strong case that the earring is doing a brain upload, which has much less horrific connotations than those who are positing other negatives.
