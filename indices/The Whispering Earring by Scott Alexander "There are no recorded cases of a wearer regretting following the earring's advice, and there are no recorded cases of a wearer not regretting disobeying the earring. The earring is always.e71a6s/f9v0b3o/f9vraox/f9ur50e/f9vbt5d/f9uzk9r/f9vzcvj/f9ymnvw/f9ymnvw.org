If the ear ring truly does what you want to the fullest degree (which it might not, hence the horror, but /if/ it does), is (a version or copy of) you still alive inside the earring somehow?

I wouldn't wear the earring because it may have alien goals ...but if it doesn't have alien goals then this seems like allowing a smarter copy of /me/ to tell me what to do / wear my body
