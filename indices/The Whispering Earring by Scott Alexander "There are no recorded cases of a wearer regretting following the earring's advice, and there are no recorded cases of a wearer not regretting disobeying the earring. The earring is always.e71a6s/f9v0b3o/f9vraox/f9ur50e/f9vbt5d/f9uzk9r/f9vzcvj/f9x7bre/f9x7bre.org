You're assuming the ring doesn't cause (claimed) value drift as a side effect, but given the experimental data that seems unlikely. How many self-identified utilitarians would truly consider someone who retired to live a happy life with their SO a failure of a human being?

So far, nobody with the earring has done something noteworthy, instead they all seem to have converged on a hedonic lifestyle, which is no doubt satisfying to whatever remains of their brain's value system.

The brain is bad at math and will get far more satisfaction saving a bus full of orphans than donating a million dollars to an effective charity. As a utilitarian, you prefer the math, but you value the outcome of that math more than being able to do that math. As such the ring will give you better answers and your ability to do utilitarian considerations will atrophy. Once those considerations are sufficiently gone, what remains is "trust the earring to know what is right", which is then freed up to meet more deeply seated desires.
