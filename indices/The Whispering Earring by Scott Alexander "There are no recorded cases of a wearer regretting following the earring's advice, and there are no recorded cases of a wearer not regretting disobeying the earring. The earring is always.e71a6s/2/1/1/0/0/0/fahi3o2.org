  Computationalism != behaviorism.
#+end_quote

It does equal - something implements the same computation if and only if it acts the same way (on the appropriate level of abstraction). It's because if something behaves the same way, it implements the same computation (that's an implication in one direction) and if something implements the same computation, then it acts the same way (because you can observe the computation and comprehend it in terms of behavior of the simulated person) (that's an implication in the other direction). So since we have implication in both direction, we have equivalence between behaviorism and computationalism.

  I can predict the behavior of my dog without needing to run a simulated copy of my dog, because I am much smarter.

It might be surprising, but no, you can't. If you can predict the behavior of a system exactly, some particular subset of your brain must be (input-output) isomorphic to the system (otherwise you could never know the behavior of the system, since the behavior is the output).

If you can predict your dog imperfectly, then your brain runs an imperfect emulation of your dog on your brain, the departure of the emulation from the real dog being as big as the imperfection of your predictions.
