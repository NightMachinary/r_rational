It really /isn't/ doing a gradual upload, though. Regardless of whether you believe "the person on the other side of an upload is still the same person as the person who was uploaded" or "the uploaded person is a perfect copy of a person who is now dead" there's still a person on the other side of the upload. There's nothing in the story to suggest that there's a person preserved on the other side of the earring.
