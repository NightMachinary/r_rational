It's sort of like the argument that consciousness is the thing that makes you talk about consciousness. It's not stated that the ring-zombies are in any way lessened, partially because that would weaken the story. But being unable to perform any visible aspect of yourself-ness would be a worsening of your performance and hence equivalent to bad advice. The only scenario where the ring-zombie could /fail/ to be an upload is if what you consider your self has very little effect on your actions.

The ring is a DWIM device. Its basic function requires that "I" persists.
