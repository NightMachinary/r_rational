  However, for the intents and purposes of everyone around you, the new you, the former you, and the vast majority of everything else we consider relevant, the new brain is effectively the old brain. It is only a 'death' +in the most technical and meaningless of senses+ /in the most important sense conceivable/.

FTFY.

  To put it another way, if replacing parts with functionally identical alternatives over a period of time causes this thing we call 'death', then eating and general homeostasis will periodically kill you over the course of your 'life'.

Only sorta/kinda. I could say that I'm killing you right now. You're reading these words, and your brain is physically changing as a result. Connections between clusters of neurons are being strengthened and broken as we speak. I have changed your brain.

It's just a thought experiment. You're made of cells which are all made of molecules which are all made of atoms. What if we took literally every single carbon atom in your body and magically replaced them all with a different set of carbon atoms? Still the exact same molecules, still the exact same cells, still the exact same squishy sack of meat, perfectly biological. Is that still you? I'm not interested in that sort of thought experiment. You don't move halfway to the wall an infinite number of times, you just walk over and touch the wall. In the real world, "you" are a collection of trillions of different domino reactions all meeting in the same place. Breaking a chain and is breaking a chain that stretches literally all the way back to before the big bang.

This video is not what I want it to be, but it's what I can find with the amount of effort I'm willing to expend on this:

(doesn't actually start till the 12 second mark)

Imagine that instead of hitting the top left branch, he hit the bottom left and bottom right branches simultaneously, and when they met in the middle the top branches continued forwards. "You" are the middle of that X shape. The bottom branches are "literally everything else that happened in the universe up to this moment." If you took the middle of that X shape and destroyed it in order to figure out how to recreate it somewhere else in such a way that it would carry forward with the same momentum as the original middle of that X shape, it would not be the same domino reaction. "You" are a domino chain reaction stretching back to the beginning of Time, and no amount of philosophical musing will make an Upload be connected to that chain.
