  The very first advice is "don't use it"

  This comment made me realize the real horror of that first instruction. It /doesn't/ say, "don't use me". It says, "better for /you/ if you take me off". It's better for your values, goals, community, and the world at large if you leave it on. It's only better for "you" if you take it off, because "you" is the thing that it destroys.<
