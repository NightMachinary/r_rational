It's not a metaphor. The brain literally processes information.

#+begin_quote
  Where are the algorithms?
#+end_quote

I did answer that already:

#+begin_quote
  Algorithms are everywhere in the brain (modulo perhaps those parts of the brain that play only the role of e.g. structural support (if there are any such parts)).

  This isn't a hard question - it's like asking where are algorithms in a laptop on your table - it depends on what parts of the physical system perform the computation.

If there's anything unclear about my answer, please ask specifically about my answer instead of just repeating your question.

I also asked

#+begin_quote
  So, what are you saying you'd perceive if your brain was being gradually replaced? Would you perceive your conscious experience fading out, or would it suddenly switch off for you at some point?
#+end_quote

And you didn't respond to that.

#+begin_quote
  Why don't you go ahead and explain "consciousness" to me?
#+end_quote

Consciousness is the brain processing information about something (us being conscious of something is the brain processing information about it).
