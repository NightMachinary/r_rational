It requires some amount of information about the person be preserved. And the GAZP does not say that everything that talks about consciousness be conscious. It doesn't rule out managing to create a zombie, just argues that such a thing is nontrivial. An earring could create a similar effect by gradually uploading and improving you. Which is why not only were the brains examined, but the earring itself was talked to. And the earring said “Oh, no, actually the specific way I do this is a terrible idea. Definitely a bad plan. At least by your values.” That they no longer exist in their brain doesn't mean they met a bad end. But it also doesn't mean they met a good end. Which may or may not involve them being dead. All we actually are told is that by the values of every wearer it is a bad idea, and that after careful examination and discussion with the earring that it was suggested it be locked away. Perhaps the earring uploads you and then tortures you but leaves enough to get the information it needs. Perhaps it is some form of zombie master. It is unspecified. Just that the earring says by your values it is a bad result.
