  It's not a metaphor. The brain literally processes information.

False and false. Hitchens' Razor: That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

  I did answer that already:

    Algorithms are everywhere in the brain...

"Where is the soul/spirit?"

"Spirit is everywhere in the brain."

No, you did /not/ answer the question.

#+begin_quote
  I also asked

  #+begin_quote
    So, what are you saying you'd perceive if your brain was being gradually replaced? Would you perceive your conscious experience fading out, or would it suddenly switch off for you at some point?
  #+end_quote

  And you didn't respond to that.
#+end_quote

Because there is no "you" to do the perceiving, there is only the perceiving. You're operating so flipping far from reality that there's literally no way for me to unpack each and every individual false assumption you're making. I guess I can try...

"Juggling" is not a thing that exists independently in the world. "Juggling" is a word used to describe an action performed by a person. If "Person A" (/P^{A}/) is juggling balls and transfers the balls to /P^{B}/ and then someone else substitutes each ball for a bowling pin while /P^{B}/ is still performing the juggling, then would you say "/P^{A}/ juggling balls and /P^{B}/ juggling pins are still the same instance of juggling"? No, because "an instance of juggling" is not a /thing/ that exists.

Your brain is performing perception. "Perceiving" is the thing that the brain does. If you were to replace a part of your brain with silicone neurons, this new arrangement of brain and silicone would continue to perform perception. If you were to replace the rest of your brain with silicone neurons, this new arrangement of silicone would continue to perform perception. If the replacements were done in such a way that the silicone neurons continued to make new connections in the same way that the carbon neurons used to do, then the performance of perception by the silicone brain would be indistinguishable from the performance of perception by the recently deceased organic brain.

  Consciousness is the brain processing information about something (us being conscious of something is the brain processing information about it).

"[S]ome students wrote down 'because of how the metal conducts heat', and some students wrote down 'because of how the air moves'... The students thought they could use words like 'because of heat conduction' to explain anything, even a metal plate being cooler on the side nearer the fire."

You do not understand the words that you are using. Consciousness is simply awareness which is simply perception of perception which is simply perception which is simply multiple clusters of neurons conjointly firing as a result of being triggered by stimuli. There is no symbolic representation (ie "information") in the brain.
