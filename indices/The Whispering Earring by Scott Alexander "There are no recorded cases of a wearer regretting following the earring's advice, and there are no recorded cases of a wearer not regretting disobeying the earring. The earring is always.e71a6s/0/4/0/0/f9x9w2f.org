  The earring doesn't maximize your long-term goals because it changes them over time by atrophying the parts of the brain that think about long-term goals

That doesn't at all sounds like how I interpreted it. To me, it seemed like it took your long-term life goals, and realized them in the most effective manner possible. The implication is that the earring is better at better at being you than you are, not that it changes you into something you wouldn't have become if sufficiently motivated and knowledgeable.

The ending proverb points in that direction: "One must never take the shortest path between two points."
