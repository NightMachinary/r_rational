I think people are looking at the ring the wrong way. If it always gives the right advice, instead of hiding the earring, a utilitarian would put the earring on. Imagine a scientist unerringly guided towards correct conclusions. It would be far better for society that they put the earring on. The Nobel prizes they won would be earned by merit of their ultimate sacrifice for the good of others.
