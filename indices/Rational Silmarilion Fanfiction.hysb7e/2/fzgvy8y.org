Technically sixth in a series of thematically related snippets, but while the others are good this one is better and stands perfectly well alone - I only found the others well afterwards.

Takes place earlyish in the fourth age in Valinor, and reminds me a little of the happy ending of UNSONG. More-or-less canon-compliant, though it takes the themes in a different direction.
