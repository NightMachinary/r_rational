It depends.

Understanding why something isn't as good as it could be and then fixing it is a crucial skill for a writer - one that a lot of people, especially those that post online, never pick up (understandably, because it's often boring). I'd suggest doing an edit or rewrite just for that alone.

It's not the best thing to do if you want an increased readership - you might lose some of the people currently paying attention, and a relaunch doesn't tend to be that great for any creative endeavor, but this is variable on how much improvement you think that you can do.
