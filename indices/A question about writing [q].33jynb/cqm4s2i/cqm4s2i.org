What would definitely not be a waste is rewriting the first two chapters to your skill's maximum, to get readers.

Beyond that, only revise if you have significant plot changes to make; just repainting prose is drudgelike, and a training story isn't worth that boredom for. Plus, presumably when you finish your next arc you'll be even better?
