Seconding that (personal experience as well.)

These days, at most, I would leave an author's note on the top of the first chapter, with an "if you don't like the first few chapters, don't worry, it's not all this bad!" (sort of like HPMOR's "people say it picks up in Chapter 5.")

Or, if you're feeling particularly petulant toward your past self, maybe you could consider writing a little /outline/ for the revisions you'd like to make, and linking your readers to that. Sort of hanging a lampshade on all the problems to prove to your new readers that you're now the sort of writer who would recognize them---even if you haven't had time to do anything about them just yet.
