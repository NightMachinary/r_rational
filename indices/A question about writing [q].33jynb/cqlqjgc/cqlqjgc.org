What are your goals? Are you asking what we want as readers or what you should do to be a better writer?

(As a reader, I typically don't actually read re-writes, even of stories I enjoy, unless I was gonna read it twice anyway and re-reading/re-watching meida isn't really ever a thing I ever do as an adult. As a writer, re-writing and refining past work sounds like the sort of thing which is vaguely skill-upgrading, I think?)
