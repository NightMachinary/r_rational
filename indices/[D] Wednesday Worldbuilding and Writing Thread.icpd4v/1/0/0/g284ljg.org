I mean, yeah. There are reasons one can give to the points above that can explain their inclusion in the story. I find it, however, that, when you put them together it seems like a very /very/ odd fit of things that push SoD. So, I'm trying to think of ways one could try making the setting more rational, there are, however issues with changes you try to make.

For instance, what if the Dark Continent didn't exist, and instead Chimera Ants were aliens? As Dragonball-esque as it would be, it would also give you some wiggle room to justify chimera ants biology (thought you'd still have to do something about their remembering past life bit), and if Dark Continent exploration is Space Exploration, then you don't have to justify somehow the Dark Continent not being a well-established known fact thorough all of the known world. On the other hand though, well, how does one fit the Whale-boat arc into a spaceship? That seems quite difficult. And since you mention Alluka; we know Nanika comes from DC through WoG, how would you justify it if DC was in space? Also, Chimera Ants exist in the known world it's just that DC ones are bigger, you also need to deal with that.

The example above lays out a change that justify quite a bit of things, but also creates quite a few problems that need solving. Lets see now another change one could make: Tonpa. Instead of the Rookie Crusher, Tonpa is the Rookie Helper. This is not out of the kindness of his heart, though he pretends it is. Instead, he's just being smart. He's been in the last 35 Hunter Exams, that means almost every single Hunter in the last 30ish years has received his help, meaning he is a friendly acquaintance of some of the most powerful and dangerous people in the world.

This is more the sort of thing I'm looking for. Small changes one can make to canon that make it more rational (well, in this case it makes /Tonpa/ more rational rather than HxH more rational, but you know what I mean) without destroying the spirit of canon.
