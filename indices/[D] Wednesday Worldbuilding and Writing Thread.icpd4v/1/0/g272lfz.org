In no particular order:

Yes, a Nen user would basically autopass the combat portion of the test. The issue is that even finding the damn thing is going to make 95% of even nen users fail out.

Also, while becoming a hunter gives you lots of benefits, it also puts you on a database of the most dangerous people alive, so presumably some nen users simply choose not to become hunters. For a normal person merely becoming a hunter makes them rich and powerful, but for someone with nen all you need to become rich and powerful is the nen itself, and in fact becoming a hunter may even hinder you.

No, people can't shrug off nukes, but as we see in the auction that doesn't mean that hunters can't just kill everyone in your organization/goverment with stealth and nen-powers. So all it takes is one really strong hunter (or a bunch of more moderate ones), and they can just overthrow your government if they want. The hunters organization has 1000 superhumans including likely a dozen on the level that a single one of them would be equal in strength of the spiders all together. In that context the hunters organization being able to do what they want is much more reasonable. Like sure, you can nuke the hunter headquarters.... but then the rest of the hunters get together and murder you and your goverment.

Plus, the idea of cataloging and broadcasting the fact that these are people you really don't want to screw with casually seems like something governments would be totally on board with, if just to avoid accidently provoking them.

Presumably Heaven's arena gets money via people betting on the events, although the economics of how it makes any kind of sense to give people huge amounts of money for just winning a dozen fights in a row where superhumans exist that can win trivially is never really explained.

Alluka does break the setting, its intended. Although from what we know the human world is just a small portion of the real world, so its entirely possible that she doesn't break the setting at all, just the tiny weak human part of it.

Greed island is super odd yeah, and it is totally disconnected from the rest of the setting. I hesitate to say that it does break the setting though specifically /because/ it can't interact with the rest of the world. I suspect that the nen powers used to make it are useless in the rest of the world and only work there via intense self restrictions on the nen used by master hunters.

Looking at the Kiriko as living in the woods isolated from humanity is one way to look at them, but the other way is seeing them as highly skilled people working for the most powerful organization on the planet.

EDIT: I won't even pretend that I think the world itself is a very rational one though.
