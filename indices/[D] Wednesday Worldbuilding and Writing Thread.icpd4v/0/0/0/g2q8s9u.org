Yes. Those are all wonderful suggestions that I will most definitely look into.

My greatest fear while creating a hard magic system is making it too like another series, like Lightbringer, in terms of uses.

My original idea was having the frequency of wavelengths affecting what each color was best at. Like having faster wavelengths be "more solid" or slower ones having area of effect.

I also find myself struggling to come up with problems that the magic cannot solve if used in sufficiently clever ways. Most of the ones I think of would be social problems rather than physical ones as the magic during the pre-veil era was far more advanced than what canon deals with.
