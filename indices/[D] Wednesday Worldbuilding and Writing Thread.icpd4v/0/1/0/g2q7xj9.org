Hmm. I do like this idea quite a bit. I don't have any background in statistics but I THINK I get what you said.

Sunstone are actually charged in nets on the towers above The Veil. Which is a giant veil cast across the sky of the world to block out the sun. This was to weaken the power of spiritshadows in our world.

I believe Sunstone are grown from sunseeds taken from either Aenir or somehow naturally forming in the world. It was never properly explained.

I want the focus of my story to be on pre-veil times and the struggle to combat Spiritshadows when they were at their most powerful. How the ice carls and sunstone users of old fought a great war against the shadows and bound them in place and brought about the veil.

I'm pretty sure the stratification of the sunstone users came about after this do to a warping of tradition.

I wanted to make each wavelength of light particularly useful at one specific thing but was afraid that would be too similar to Brent Week's Light ringer series.

Do you know of any good statistic sources so I can look further into this and understand your suggestion better?
