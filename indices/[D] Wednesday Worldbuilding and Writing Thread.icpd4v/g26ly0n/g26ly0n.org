Okay, so Hunter X Hunter. Great story, great magic system, excellent characters; world is all over the place:

- The known world is in the middle of a gigantic lake. This is somehow a secret; also, people have cellphones.
- A Hunter License basically gives you free jurisdiction to do whatever the hell you want with little to no consequences. How is that possible? Is this because the Hunter Organization is just that powerful? But nukes exist and it is established no one can just shrug them off.
- A Hunter License will be given to literally the devil so long as he passes the Hunter Exam.
- Given the points above, why hasn't /every single/ nen user become a hunter?
- Supposedly, millions of people apply to the Hunter Exam every year. Of those millions somewhere between the 100s and the 1000s actually make it to the Exam location. Then, those numbers are systematically cut down until there only a dozen-or-so maybe-winners (often through death). There have been 286 Hunter Exams before the one we see in canon. There are less than 1000 licensed hunters in canon. These numbers raise questions of how many people are dying in these exams and how is it possible to get away with it.
- Supposedly, only once every 3 years someone who is doing the Hunter Exam for the first time passes. A significant number of non-hunter nen users exist; nen basically grantees passing the Exam.
- How does the Heaven's Arena work? How do they get the money to pay the fighters and how come they allow them to live in luxurious houses? Also, the audience has a chance of dying depending on the fight.
- Why isn't the Zoldyck family / Phantom Troupe already dealt with by an organized effort?
- Chimera Ants biology is really /really/ weird.
- Alluka breaks the setting.
- Greed Island also breaks the setting and feels completely disconnected from the rest of the world.
- How do people in Meteor City get so powerful?
- As the leader of a country, even if a small one, Gyro had many, /many/ options to destroy humanity. Also, how come that guy is so popular?
- Kiriko are shape sifting creatures that seemingly can assume the form of anyone they want and they... live in a cabin isolated from everyone.

Given this list that I admittedly might have gone a little overboard with, how do you think one could make the HxH setting more rational. How do you solve the contradictions? What do you change while staying true to the soul of the story? Things not mentioned are welcome too.
