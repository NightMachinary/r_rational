I haven't read the series, but in general you could:

- Come up with a harder magic system that explains and is compatible with the canon capabilities and worldbuilding. Probably a lot of work, you'd have to catalogue the uses of magic as well as when magic wasn't suitable and assemble some grand unified theory of it.
- Arrange your story to add limitations to the soft magic. Maybe the protagonists only have access to a single colour of sunstone and have to work around that, or magical predators are drawn to use of the magic
- Focus on the users rather than the magic. If two people can use the same ill-defined magic but one has exceptional reflexes and the other is incredibly stealthy, that could help keep their conflicts interesting.
- Look for problems the magic can't solve
