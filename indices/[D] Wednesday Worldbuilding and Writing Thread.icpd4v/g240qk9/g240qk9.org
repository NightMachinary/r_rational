So right now I want to write a prequel series about Garh Nix's The Seventh Tower series. As there is no fanfiction of it and my yearly rereading of the series is no longer enough for me.

The only issue is that it is a soft magic system. They use things called sunstones to project light and each color doesnt necessarily have a specific strength or weakness like light magic in Brent Week's series.

There's only a few instances where they go into the how of what the magic theyre performing is doing. So how do you build upon a magic system that is described even less than Harry Potter canon did?
