It sounded to me more like he joined an army that was already mobilized and fed them information to optimize them. He's clearly an outsider to them (given the Lich's dialogue). I doubt he has full control over them, at any rate, or anything resembling that.

True, though. If he gathers information on who went missing this loop then he /will/ find Zorian eventually, if only through a brute force search.
