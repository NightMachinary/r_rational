It sounds like guns are far less controlled than we'd expect in this universe, seeing how easily that merchant sold it to Zorian when he wouldn't sell him the better rods.

As for a male being reported as missing - how would RR distinguish that report from all other males reported as missing during the time loop? Assuming he doesn't know Zorian personally and doesn't dig deeper, anyway. I think it would take him at least one loop to find Zorian this way if he thinks of the method at all - gather who goes missing this loop, compare to who goes missing next loop.
