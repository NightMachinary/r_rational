Yeah, RR has decent chances. Zorian hasn't exactly been subtle, if Zach wasn't an idiot or otherwise distracted he would've figured it out by now (and probably did last loop, actually, which means all RR needs to do is read Zach's mind again - fortunately that's unlikely to happen since he did it so recently already, he shouldn't expect him to have any new information).

Since RR didn't figure it out already, though, that means he likely wasn't in a position to do so. So his biggest chances are the current loop (where Zorian died) and the next loop after that. I think it can go either way in the end.
