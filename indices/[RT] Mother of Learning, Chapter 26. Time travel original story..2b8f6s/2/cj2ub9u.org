Woah. That was intense. Spoilery chapter name, though, I was expecting something of the sort from the beginning of the chapter.

I'm wondering whether soulkill is dependent on the victim being a time-looper. Though, if I read it correctly, the aranea settlement was dead even before RR showed up, so that seems to be wishful thinking. Soul magic is OP in that case... Do souls exist outside of time somehow? That doesn't seem to make sense, since it's established that only the time-travelers' souls are preserved through the loops, and the rest of the world, including all the other souls, is reset. This might be a clue about the nature of the time loop, but I can't seem to follow it...

So. The current situation is pretty dire. Zorian is dead, RR is alive. Meaning that RR has time to prepare, to investigate Zorian, before the next restart. And Zorian is gonna have to leg it out of his room the second he wakes up in the next restart---RR will surely teleport to his home as soon as he'll be able to. And given his ability to permakill people, RR will be able to blackmail Zorian by threatening to kill people he cares about. So Zorian should at the very least teleport Kirielle out with him. That is, unless I missed something.

Wonder what Zorian is going to do now... Honestly, he should not have rushed to the aranea and risked the meeting with RR. It was an obvious sort of trap for another time traveller. Zorian's biggest defense was his anonymity, and now he's blown it.

Edit: On the other hand, during this reset Zach will be able to figure out that Zorian is a time-looper, based on the fact that he's dead from the very start (unless he skips school this loop as well). Maybe Zach will be able to lend a hand at the start of the next reset?

Edit2: Upon a reread, it seems obvious that the aranea are indeed permanently dead. Perhaps there will be a way to revive them somehow, but I don't think it'll happen any time soon. Also, it seems that Zorian might have managed to hide his identity during his fight with RR. Whether that's enough to remain anonymous, I don't know. I think it should be trivial for RR to investigate who is missing in this restart who shouldn't have been, unless the bullets Zorian put into RR were enough to kill him in the near future, or incapacitate him, after whatever magic RR used to patch himself up wears out.
