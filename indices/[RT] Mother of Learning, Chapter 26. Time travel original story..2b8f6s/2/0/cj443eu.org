I am confused. If there is a soulkill spell, why would the lich use soulMERGE instead during the first chapter? Is the only reason Zorian joined the loops that the lich likes to drive people insane instead of killing them? Or are the purple beams more like soulmaim, meaning that the aranea will recover after enough loops like Zach and Zorian did? That would explain why the lich didn't use it, since it would just piss off another lich.
