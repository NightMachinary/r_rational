I'm guessing that the Lich might not have known the soulkill spell. He's merely a Lich, after all, not a time-looping necromancer who has every reason to seek out and learn a spell that kills souls outside of time.

Or perhaps the spell the Lich was doing was easier, and he had no reason to believe soulkill is superior. Or perhaps he had something amusing in mind for Zach that required soulmerge as a prerequisite. Or perhaps soulmerge /is/ a prerequisite for soulkill. Or perhaps soulkill has an unknown drawback that we don't know about.

The hypothesis space is pretty big.
