It's definitely not bad, but don't expect Wildbow quality writing. Especially don't expect the high tensity situations Worm gives you. It's mostly written as comedy. Also, keep in mind these are pulled from like 20 different people, so writing style will vary drastically.

If you go in realizing that, it's pretty good.
