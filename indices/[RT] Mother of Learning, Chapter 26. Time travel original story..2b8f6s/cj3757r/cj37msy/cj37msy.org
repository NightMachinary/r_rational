  With all the Damien name dropping going on, I can't help but feel that this has happened before and Damien was the survivor from that time loop.

That's exactly what I thought as well! It also seems odd that Damien is apparently a prodigy but everyone else in the family (including the sister as we find out this chapter) has no exceptional talent. And then there's the positive comparisons of Zorian's to Damien's prowess throughout the loop..

  Especially I expect it soon, as Zorian will be avoiding the uni now that Red Robe knows about him.

I'm not sure that would be wise of Zorian. If he hid his identity successfully, then that would be a dead give-away that he's the time traveler. Zorian's best bet next restart is probably to make everything like the same as before any restarts at all, up until the point that he gets a single hint he's been compromised.
