  I think it's safe to assume that Red Robe is not someone close to the uni, else they'd already realize that Zorian was advancing in each reset

I agree, but if I recall correctly there's a couple of students in Zorian's class that don't seem to come to class this semester. It's quite possible that RR is one of those students (and wasn't one of them supposedly tied to soul magic? I genuinely can't recall, need to re-read).

If this is the case, then Zorian not coming to class is a dead giveaway if RR chooses to come to class to investigate. But if it isn't, then what you're saying makes perfect sense - make it appear that Zorian stops this semester normally, regardless of time loops, or even that he goes missing at the beginning of the time loop every time, making him indistinguishable from other missing people (in terms of searching for the time traveler).

Can't wait to see.
