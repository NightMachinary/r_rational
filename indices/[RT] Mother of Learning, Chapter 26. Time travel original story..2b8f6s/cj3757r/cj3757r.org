With all the Damien name dropping going on, I can't help but feel that this has happened before and Damien was the survivor from that time loop.

It makes sense, Zorian may not be a magic prodigy, but with all the restarts, the comparisons are being made, simply because he has more time to work with.

I predict we're going to have an Arc or at least a Chapter in which Damien tracks down Zorian and reveals something to that effect. Especially I expect it soon, as Zorian will be avoiding the uni now that Red Robe knows about him.
