If he has been in a Loop it would have been before his second year. We know that he had access to restricted spells then (in chapter three we hear Zorian reminisce about being on the receiving end of a not-so-refined Animation Spell).

Now that I think about it, a Loop would be basically the only way for a student from a town with no mages to gain access to it before having a mentor. Before the gaining a mentor you would almost only have been taught very basic stuff if Zorian is any indication, and it is likely that magical prodigies in general only really shine through somewhere around the middle of their third year because of the restrictions on spells. I don't recall any mention of outside tutors either, but if there has been I'd consider this theory a lot less likely.
