This was a thoroughly awesome chapter. How do you beat someone with orders of magnitude your experience, cunning, ruthlesness, and talent?

Probably the first thing Zorian will do next chapter is teleport someplace else. To Zach, maybe? I wouldn't be surprised if Red Robe permanently killed his family, even. So he'll take his sister with?

Also, I see two possibilities for Red Robe entering the loop. Either he started it or was a part of the start - but then why did he not start it around his own soul? And the fact that the lich thinks he's just an informant seems to suggest that the lich's organization, at the least, did not start the loop.

Or he used soul magic to join Zach's loop during one of his restarts, when he was telling every classmate that he was a time traveler. Seems very likely, given everything else.

But then why is the loop centered on Zach in the first place? Why did it start? If it's to prevent the primordial, then surely someone with the capability to repeatedly loop the whole world could just go back themselves and stop it from happening. So what the hell?

Seriously delicious stuff. It only makes the waiting for the next chapters more painful.
