Well, shit. There goes practically all the progress Zorian had made. Red Robe presumably hasn't had enough information to figure out who Zorian is, as we have another 2 arcs, and I doubt he can avoid a soulkill for so long if Red Robe knows where he lives. But he did learn a lot from this chapter. And the map seems likely to be the starting point for the next arc, giving him at least something to go on.

The Matriarch's message seems like it will be very significant later, although I have no idea why she didn't tell him outright what it said

#+begin_quote
  [Missing] ...mean things went awry. I know you think I had it coming by rushing into this but...
#+end_quote

This seems to imply that she knew her plans could go wrong, although probably not about Soulkill. I can't really conclude much more from this

#+begin_quote
  [Missing] ...simple: the time loop is degrading. I can't tell how long it will be before...
#+end_quote

Well, that's ominous. Hopefully this means that it will end and they will be released, rather than all just dying though.

#+begin_quote
  [Missing] ...can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was...
#+end_quote

This seems pretty significant. The most likely candidates are Zach or Red Robe. Leaving the Time Loop perhaps?

#+begin_quote
  [Missing] ...can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly...
#+end_quote

No idea what this line's about

#+begin_quote
  [Missing] ...hope it will be necessary, but just in case I put in a map to...
#+end_quote

This wording seems pretty odd. She hopes it /will/ be necessary? Normally it would be I hope it won't be necessary. This line will probably make more sense once Zorian goes to the places marked important on the map.

#+begin_quote
  [Missing] ...whole other continent. I didn't think it was possible, even with the help of... [Missing]
#+end_quote

Could one of the places on the map be a portal? Does this refer to another plane? Has the entire world even been mapped out? If not, this could just refer to an undiscovered continent across the ocean, where something relevant is. The source of the time loop? The primordial's resting place?
