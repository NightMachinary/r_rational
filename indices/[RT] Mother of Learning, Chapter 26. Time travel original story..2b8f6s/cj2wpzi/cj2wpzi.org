One, it's interesting to know that the Red Robed guy clearly wants what's going to happen, there's going to be no killed by his own creation.

Two, NO ONE HAS DIED FROM SOULS LOSS AT ALL? In the entire month, no where in the world, no lich took someones soul, or did anything with souls? So we have to assume there's something different about this that has literally never been done ever.

Like, if anywhere in the world killed a soul once this entire time it would be immediately noticeable, on the next restart, and it would just spiral out of the control, as people who do soul stuff would do more soul stuff to see if soul stuff really was what had killed the previous people and every time it would restart.

Three, Red Robed guy has no concept way of stopping people from falling, no ranged feather falling?

Four, Zorian is not dumb enough to travel immediately to the place not expecting the Necromancer to come there too. Also, I wonder how the Necromancer can teleport directly to places like that, must be a super good diviner or have extra abilities.

Five, the Aranea really should have considering something might kill her throughout all timelines so I wonder what she put in place for that, it just makes sense.

Six, why would Zorian reveal himself by killing the vampire to save that girl? His whole shtick is hiding himself, there was no reason to try and reveal himself, indeed I think chasing the aranea in the previous timeline was a bad idea, because if I was a time traveller I would have sat and waited for whoever else the aranea brought back with them.

Hope he didn't forget Kael's formulas.
