With Zorian avoiding uni, I was going on the fact that Red Robe has an idea of build, size and gender. Combined with Zorian's marked improvement since last year would set bells ringing, as opposed to someone above average not returning after certification to work in a mage shop maybe. He does mention that not everyone comes back after first year, and his family background is ideal.

Of course, his late withdrawal at the start of the time loop would also be a red flag. And if Red Robe has noticed him in class before, disappearing now would be a dead giveaway. If he does go back, he can't show any improvement to anyone or else it'll be too obvious, and that would make his time at uni less useful, than say travelling and learning anonymously (especially since the Aranea are dead). It also serves the purpose of setting him up to meet Damien.

I think it's safe to assume that Red Robe is not someone close to the uni, else they'd already realize that Zorian was advancing in each reset and would have come in contact with Zach much earlier, which makes him withdrawing from uni a distinct possibility. Well I guess let's see.
