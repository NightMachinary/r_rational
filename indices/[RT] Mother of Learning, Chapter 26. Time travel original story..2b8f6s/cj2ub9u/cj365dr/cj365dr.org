  Also, it seems that Zorian might have managed to hide his identity during his fight with RR. Whether that's enough to remain anonymous, I don't know. I think it should be trivial for RR to investigate who is missing in this restart who shouldn't have been

Does RR even have a clue as to who Zorian is? If he knows it's a student, he can find him very easily, but all he knows is just that it's a random male, then Zorian's virtually anonymous.

It also depends on who RR really is. If it's a student necromancer that joined the loop after Zach talked to him, then it's likely he'll find Zorian. If it's a random necromancer that joined on his own, or through other means, then Zorian's moderately safe.
