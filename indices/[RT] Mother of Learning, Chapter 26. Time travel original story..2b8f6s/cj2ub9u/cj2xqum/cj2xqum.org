  Soul magic is OP in that case

Not really, its just rather specialised. For the vast majority of cases, it really doesn't matter whether you're dead by fireball or soul kill - you aint coming back either way. If soul blasts are more mana intensive or more restricted in their range or area of effect (and the latter is almost certainly the case given how the Aranea fight went down), its a trade-off that wouldn't make sense most of the time.
