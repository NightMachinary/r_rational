  Six, why would Zorian reveal himself by killing the vampire to save that girl?
#+end_quote

I think that one is pretty clear, if slightly cliche'd. The same reason he'd protect his sister if she were to be killed, even if he knew she'd resurrect next restart?

  Four, Zorian is not dumb enough to travel immediately to the place not expecting the Necromancer to come there too. Also, I wonder how the Necromancer can teleport directly to places like that, must be a super good diviner or have extra abilities.
#+end_quote

But he explicitly expected the Necromancer to come, he wanted to come faster to give the Aranea a fighting chance. Hell, he would've succeeded had they not been utterly /dead/ already - all he needed to do was meet one of them and the information about the attack would propagate through the web.

As for Red Robe's abilities, he's apparently much closer to Zach in restart-age, and he's clearly using his time more wisely. Not particularly surprising that he'd have equal or better teleportation ability to Zorian.

  Like, if anywhere in the world killed a soul once this entire time it would be immediately noticeable [...]
#+end_quote

You're right, but to be fair we don't know exactly what soul magic /does/ - what is conventional, and what could possibly happen during the duration of the loop. If people were soul-killed during the loop, it'd be slightly noticeable - but why soul-kill when you have fireballs, in the first place? Also, a soul-kill would only be noticeable to some people. Most wouldn't even know what it looked like, Zorian certainly didn't, and he probably has more knowledge than most.

If soul modification and experimentation is commonplace somewhere, then it follows that the people doing it would /eventually/ find out about the time loop and perhaps come up with a method to join it artificially. /IF/ soul modification and experimentation are commonplace - we don't know. (That may even have been the way Red Robe did it, given that he's a necromancer. Hell - he may have soul-killed the other known necromancers to prevent them joining the loop.)
