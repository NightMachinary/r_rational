The "Spirit Realm" appears to be cut off from the main core world, which could explain this. Destroying a soul may either a) completely annihilate it, preventing it from returning during the loop, or b) attempt to send it to the Spirit Realm, where it gets stuck, unable to progress.

Regarding the Lich, I suspect his preferred method is to modify souls, rather than to destroy them outright. He mentions trapping them in gems (e.g. the D&D "Trap the Soul" spell) before deciding to do what Zorian assumes was a Soul Merge spell. Maybe he doesn't know a soul destruction spell - or, more likely - he simply prefers not to use them. Maybe they're considered low class in undead circles. =D

If the Lich's preferred method is Trap the Soul or the like, the gem might be reset with each loop, which would effectively negate the spell. I have no evidence of this, just speculation.
