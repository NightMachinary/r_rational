Thanks a lot, it feels like being given the code to a secret community that feels really really shady but isn't :P

Yeah searching for it was a nightmare, google didn't help much and all I found was extremely disjointed and all over the place.

I did understand that it was an RPG type of thing but I was completely lost, thank you so much.
