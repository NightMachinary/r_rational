[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335][Stargate Physiscs 101]] A lot of it is software development jokes applied to stargate, so if you've worked as a programmer and or know and like the Stargate franchise I recommend not drinking anything while you read it unless you like performing spit takes.

TLDR: I think [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335][this]] is hilarious!
