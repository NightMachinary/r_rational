  It doesn't seem to have worked as well as I'd hoped, though - so far, this is only marginally more popular. I've probably just created a new problem and made it kind of boring rather than overwhelming.

I think the slow-burn stuff isn't as much of a hit with the RR crowd, it's true, but you've still got readers from those of us that do enjoy it. Keep it up!
