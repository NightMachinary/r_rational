Thanks for your feedback! Don't worry if you're missing the more explicit mystery stuff - they'll be plenty of that a bit later on. I tried writing a story like this /because/ so many people said that they bounced off that kind of narrative, and wanted to make something that would be more comfortable for the average web fiction reader, hence the fantasy setting and the slow, patient establishment of the setting and the world.

It doesn't seem to have worked as well as I'd hoped, though - so far, this is only marginally more popular. I've probably just created a new problem and made it kind of boring rather than overwhelming. Maybe the only way to completely succeed in this format if you're not writing fanfic is to write stuff with initially simple, straightforward concepts that are easy to jump into?

I won't comment on your speculation for now, but I do appreciate stuff like this. It's nice to see people engaging with the story.

And yeah, that was a typo. I went back and nixed it.
