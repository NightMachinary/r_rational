(Whoops, forgot to tag the thread title.)

Posting this chapter specifically since it ended up being kind of an [[/r/rational][r/rational]]-ass part, for whatever reason. Incidentally, it's also the one that explains the title.

In addition, I've been trying to edit and trim down the first 3 chapters to make the story easier to pick up, since a lot of people upvoted the comment talking about that in the last thread, but I'm having trouble doing so in a way that doesn't cut important information. So far I've mostly just reduced excessive adjectives. One of my ideas, short of removing the prologue chapters outright and doing substantial edit work to the later ones, was to cut the initial description of the room in chapter 1, and integrate the exposition in the dialogue between the two characters into their appearance at the end of chapter 3 instead, meaning the story would start straight at Utsushikome's first person narration.

In my opinion, it would be a weaker opener, but I can't look at my writing with any degree of objectivity.
