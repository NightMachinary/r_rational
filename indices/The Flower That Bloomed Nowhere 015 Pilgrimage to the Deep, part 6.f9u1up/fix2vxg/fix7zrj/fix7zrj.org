Interesting thoughts!

I'm not too knowledgeable on the Type-Moon franchise - I watched the anime of UBW and Fate:Zero ages ago as part of a group, but I didn't retain much of it - but I was vaguely aware of the conceit of mages pursuing the Root and so on from that mystery show that came out a few seasons ago, which I tried a few episodes of. It seemed be intended to be evocative of the concept of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus_(alchemy][Magnum Opus]]) in classical alchemy, which framed the pursuit of the philosophers stone as not something strictly logical and academic, but also as a pseudo-spiritual pursuit that was personal to the alchemist. Creating the philosophers stone granted you enlightenment, and reaching enlightenment granted you the philosophers stone, with the two almost being interchangeable.

Among other reasons, this was why the kind of proto-research alchemists did was usually passed on in a very restricted manner, utilizing complex ciphers that made it incomprehensible to people outside their circle: because the journey was considered just as important as the destination.

Or, y'know, it could have just been because they were hacks who were chasing a fantasy and wanted to keep the reality of how little they understood on the down-low through elitism. Either way.

I've referenced this concept by name a couple of times in the story, I think, since the dichotomy between the "old" style of research based around secretive traditions and shrouded in mysticism, where knowledge is routinely lost forever, and the "new" style founded on everything being shared and the scientific method, is supposed to form a facet of the ideological tension in the narrative. Though of course how you want to interpret the mural in that context at this point is up to you.
