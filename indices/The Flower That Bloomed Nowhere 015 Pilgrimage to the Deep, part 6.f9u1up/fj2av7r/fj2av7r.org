Just caught up.

I'm digging the slow burn world building. Even if I'm missing the more explicit mystery and mystery-related aspects of your previous story, trying to figure out aspects of the setting like prosognostic events or the larger stuff like the meta layer are always going to keep me entertained.

I can't really offer any advice on how to change the first three chapters since I completely bought into them. In retrospect it does seem weird that Utsu has no reservations about looking at the unveiled face of a stranger, even in an extreme situation like this (especially since her freak out at the end could have been a prosognostic event). But it's still not clear exactly how they work, so maybe the caution isn't warranted, or there are other reasons for it.

Anyway, for this latest chapter, Utsu describing the mural as hateful. It seems related to the schism that Utsu's grandfather was a part of. Maybe he got kicked out of the order for being too radical? I could see being bitter about a mural that can be read as glorifying failure when you feel like the order isn't taking options you think are needed. Like, you're patting yourself on the back for creating an enduring legacy of continuing to not achieve your goal when you could have already done it. If you feel like you've cracked true immortality celebrating incremental progress like Old Yru increasing the mean lifespan by a year would make you furious.

One question, (I have lots of questions, but this is the only one where the answer isn't wait and see).

Ran says, "The final scene, which it looks like I'm at now, is about him buying her while questioning what meaning the experiences had," when talking about her romance book. That is a typo right? Should be burying?
