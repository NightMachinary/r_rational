1) Set out permanently working spell "If my reserves drop to 100 joules or below (for safety), disable all my magic IMMEDIATELY". This should overwrite any other spells.

2) Since killing people is very easy with this sort of magic, you should concentrate on researching defence first. Make a spell "I cancel all not-mine magic within X meters of my body", leave it up permanently. If it doesn't work, make a spell "If anything gets affected by magic within X meters of my body, affect it back with the same energy". If this doesn't work too, you're out of luck - any violent mage can rip your heart out in 1/8 second from VERY long range.

Btw, if it does work, you'll need bullet shield next. It can be formulated like "Stops (relative to my center-of-mass) any small (get working definition) object moving faster than (get bullet speeds) m/s when it comes within 2 meters of me". This shouldn't activate in rain and should be always active. You can try to refine this shield to be skin-tight and also melee strikes.

3) Research information magic. You SHOULD get some extra information from your magic, otherwise you won't be able to achieve much besides throwing lasers. If you know that there's your jacket in a wardrobe, and you try to summon it without knowing it's exact location - what would happen?

4) About lasers - GET THEM! Perfect lasers allow you to somewhat bypass your range, which may help you survive.

5) Start making money! If your information magic research bore fruit, game online casinos or currency markets. If it didn't, then enrolling into chemical study and doing synthesis of hard-to-get chemicals may net quick buck. Just don't overdo purity, you may rise suspicions.

6) While you're studying, learn AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE about mind-affecting chemicals. Experiment on people (synthesize it inside their brains; well rats may come first), THIS IS IMPORTANT. You want at least truth serum, but ideally find something that make a person extremely open to suggestions without damaging his brain. If you got information magic, classified CIA research can help.

7) Try to learn about computers too! Distances may be a bitch, but you can always fly to server's physical location, and changing several bytes of data may give you admin access. Actually, learning about it yourself may take too long, try to get in touch with some hackers. If your mind-affecting magic worked, it may help. Tell them some convincing lie, like you have connections, and do your magic tricks.

7.5) Magic can do math, but how fast? Can magic solve modern encryption in reasonable time? If it can, you just got free Wi-Fi and ton of other perks like money (from hacking banks), classified information from goverments and a lot of cool stuff. Your hacker friends can offer ideas, but they better be brainwashed enough.

8) Try to do some immortality/regeneration research. Will your magic allow you to patch damaged tissue without all underlying knowledge? What about halting aging? Get knowledge if you feel it helps. What about rising your dormant clone in a basement and making a spell that will transfer your consciousness into him if you suffer lethal damage?

9) Optimally with violence defence, mind-affecting spells, hacking friends and some safeguards you're ready to enter business world. Beware - your less scrupulous competitors are already there. Try to get in contact with some bio-tech start-ups, show your abilities with getting stuff done (mind-rapes, yay!). You want to get research team under your command. These people know about chemistry and biology MUCH MORE than you with your unfinished chem grad, and as a boss you get to ask stupid questions.

10) Start getting serious about immortality research. You want this done as fast as possible, because your brain is slowly dying every second! If you get any muggle-usable result, show it and get more people on the problem. If you meet other magi and can persuade them to cooperate, DO IT! You want to be able to do anti-aging spell ASAP.

11) Maybe this is time to research magic itself. What makes human a mage? Is it something in the brain? Clone yourself, would your clone be a mage? If yes, shit's too easy (you can also eat his brain). Can you make normal human into the mage? Probably not, but worth several weeks of research.

12) If You're alive, you should've made some magi friends by this time. Network among them, get to know prominent mages. Be extremely careful, they are DANGEROUS (especially if protective spells don't work. And even if they do, 4 Mj steel ball may very well be the end for you). Try to convince them that you only mean well. If you can create a perfect copy of yourself, you can offer it for interrogation (assuming you don't plan world domination).

13) Time to take over some African country! Persuade your magic-wielding allies, get there and brainwash a dictator or something. Get good political consultant so you won't do more harm. If you want, try your hand at stopping geopolitical crisis (like ISIS or Ukraine), credit may come handy.

14) Start rebuilding your country! Set up schools with magic-tests, get as much recruits as you can. Persuade your allies to teach the newbies. In several decades (assuming WW III: Magic Edition didn't destroy humanity) you'll have loyal following. You may try to opt for brainwashing army, but this may alienate your initial followers. And if they are brainwashed too... well, one of them may be faking it the whole time. Don't risk eternity for child soldier parades! Well, unless you got great safeguards.

15) Actually, one African country may be small potatoes. Spread your influence, maybe run for Presidency (there may be other mages willing, maybe join a coalition and become major supporter), maybe marry into Royal Family. Actually, with all your bio-tech research, you should be able to convincingly alter body appearances. Find adventurous friend/underling among ordinary people, kidnap Putin and make your friend look-alike Russian President. Don't forget to thoroughly interrogate Vladimir - KGB can be scary, maybe they have safeguards for this. Actually they probably already have mages on payroll, so this stuff is SERIOSLY DANGEROUS, do at your own risk.

16) Well, there are 3 scenarios after several decades. Either you're the only competent mage, and then it's time to bid for world. Or there are several, and they divided Earth between themselves and their followers. Try to mediate tensions and get magi to unite, or at least not slaughter each other. Or there is WW III: Magic Edition, and then your best option is to run as far as possible (Antarctica may be interesting, keep yourself warm with magic) and survive.

17) Assuming you can continue your research, get working nanotech, solve FAI and enjoy your Singularity! If you managed previous steps without massive screw-ups, you probably deserve it.
