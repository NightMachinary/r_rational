I am with most of these guys in needing more info. However if I understand these rules upon magically becoming a wizard I think my best tactic is to get away from everyone so that I can experiment with magic in preparation of leaving the planet after determining how to safely apply magic to sustaining my own existence.

Probably work on replacing sleep, food and breathing with "meditation".

After my own perpetual magic engine can be self sustaining I don't need to eat other people's brains. Probably I'll go build a garden on the other side of the moon or something. If some one is being uppity with magic and starts following I'll go further out.
