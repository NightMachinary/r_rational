That's what I mean. As long as you only accelerate them at a right angle, kinetic energy is constant. Also, if you accelerate them /against/ their direction of motion, they slow down and you've done negative work, but you were never clear on what happens if you do that. Do you gain magic? Do you destroy energy? Is it just impossible, and the closest you can do is convert energy to heat?
