I'd want to know more about the process of brain consumption. Is it enough for the entire mass of the brain to pass the lips? To enter the stomach? Given that it's presumably chewed or chopped up along the way, how pre-processed can it be for the magic transfer to still work? Can it be minced? Liquified? Dehydrated? Burnt? Ground into dust? Does it still count as eating if you throw it up after consumption? If you teleport it out of your stomach before it's fully digested (in any form)?

Essentially, what is the maximum number of brains you can physically strip the magic from in a given timeframe? (ie if you can dehydrate and grind them to dust, you can probably eat quite a few at once.) How many molecules or atoms can you remove before consumption? Can you use magic to speed up time for yourself (or even just speed up your metabolism), allowing you to eat an enormous number of brains in what the world would consider a short time period?

Can you extend the eight hour limit by freezing/preserving the brains? By magically putting them into a volume of slowed time? By accelerating them under thousands of gravities (see also the question about whether liquefying them makes a difference)?

In summary, if a thousand wizards all died at the same moment near you /for reasons/, how many of their brains could you salvage magic from using every loophole you could think of?
