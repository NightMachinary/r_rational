That doesn't fix it, it only makes the problem on a smaller scale.

Take "levitation" for example. Should it be costless or costly, to levitate a bunch of atoms (hold them against the force of gravity) assuming they are not currently in motion, and why? The human intuition is that it takes energy to hold something up, but it doesn't really - /we/ might get tired from keeping our arms stiff, but that's a quirk of physiology. A different physiology could stay rigid with no energy usage, like a stool. How on earth do we plan to calculate the cost of levitation?

Note that if you dis-allow costless bouncing, costless invisible walls, and so on, you'll have a fairly tough time justifying costless levitation.
