  Using magic to do a task uses exactly as many joules of energy as doing the task any other way, times a variable for distance between you and the object affected.

I can "break" this if you don't define the constraints a bit more. If you saying that the energy cost is proportional to the amount of energy I'm adding to the universe (that's what it sounds like) then breaking is pretty easy.

For example: Suppose I wanted to convert one form of energy into another (say, use magic to convert sunlight into electricity). /If I had a solar panel/, it would actually cost me zero energy to do this - just place the solar panel near the light. Does it cost me zero energy to do it with magic?

Or lets say there's a rubber ball hurtling towards me and I want to change its direction. I could exert force over the ball and expend energy... or I could say "if there was a giant slab of solid between me and the ball, the ball would just bounce away and no energy would be introduced into the system".

How do we calculate the energy cost of things like this? Obviously floating rocks or something have calculable energy costs in the form of how badly they violate conservation, but many useful actions won't.

In fact, all actions which don't actually increase entropy can be conceptualized as "free" under some interpretation. There's no distance limitation on that so....basically God already, I can put out the stars at my leisure.
