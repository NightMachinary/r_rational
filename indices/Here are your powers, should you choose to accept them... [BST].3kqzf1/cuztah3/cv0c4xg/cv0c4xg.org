  In addition to this, saying that it has computational power but no intelligence is an oxymoron, as intelligent processes are a computation, and would be achievable in this system regardless.

That's not at all an oxymoron. It just means that while magic can implement arbitrary Turing machines, it doesn't implement anything intelligent /by default/: if you want a mind, design it.
