  Magic has computational power, but no intelligence.

This needs to be quantified, along with the efficiency rate of converting other kinds of energy to magical energy (or how magic may detect variation in nonmagical energy levels, whether through conversion to magical energy or magically abstract information, as in 7), because these are the most important parts. This determines the costs of remote viewing and automatic analysis, as well as other computation in general, and replenishment of a spell's individual power or your own through ambient means.

In addition to this, saying that it has computational power but no intelligence is an oxymoron, as intelligent processes are a computation, and would be achievable in this system regardless.

You need to specify whether replenishment occurs not at all while spells are in effect, or at a reduced rate, possibly inversely related to the current energy drain. Your rules 9 and 10 seem particularly artificial in their limitations, and I would recommend a less contrived ruleset for a story based in this setting. I am wondering what is so special about the brain here as well, and this would be something my character experiments with, as upload is a very highly-rated instrumental goal.

You need to clarify how the detection of magic works. What is an "effect," and how much information do you have about the effect? Can you sense magical energy levels or detect them through magic with any amount of accuracy? This question in particular is important, as my immediate reaction to 11, despite the contradictory 8, is to always run a spell either alerting me when my energy levels approach 0 or shutting down all of my spells for me. Another possible interpretation of 8 in light of 11 is that spells are at least able to determine your own reserves, or there is the capacity to build in cost limiters into the spell itself.

An accurate form of magic detection is /necessary/ to answer any of these questions in-universe. I would require answers for these out-of-universe to know my character's capabilities, and how quickly I would be able to determine those answers in-universe through experimentation. You also don't specify how much of this information is given to the character, so I would assume the entire contradictory text is given to every wizard simultaneously. Even with these rules, there is not enough information to proceed, and an accurate form of magic detection is the largest prerequisite to even approaching breaking this universe. At the current level of information, with no other way to gain more (besides research to find a magic detector), there is very little I could do other than participate in the global cannibalistic deathmatch these rules would inspire.

Research into safely eating brains would be required regardless of answers. I want my life bar to be as large as possible.
