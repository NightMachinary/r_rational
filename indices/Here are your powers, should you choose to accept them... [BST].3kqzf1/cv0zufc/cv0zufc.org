  If you eat the brain of another wizard within eight hours of their death, the total energy they had available at the moment of their death is permanently added to your stores.

Geometric increase. Start with a thousand untrained, neophyte wizards (actually 1025 plus spares). Kill and eat the brain of one, making you (on average, and presumably you planned this) about twice as powerful as the other wizards. Use this power to either serially or in parallel arrange to pair the other wizards off, including pairing one with yourself (who will be less powerful than you). Kill half the wizards and have the other half eat their brains, /ideally without them knowing they are doing it or being aware of the brain-eating method of powering up/. You now have 512 wizards, including yourself who has approximately 3 wizard-power compared to their 2wp.

Repeat, killing half the living wizards and feeding their brains to the other half. Do this until there are only two of you left. Kill the other wizard and eat their brain.

You now have the power of a thousand wizards.

 

In all this, it would be best to be able to create/raise wizards who are unaware of their power, untrained in its use (or trained to suppress it for religious reasons etc), ignorant of both its true nature and how to increase it, and so on. It might even be a good idea to deliberately brain-damage them if that would not affect their ability to act as a magic container, so they wouldn't be able to realize their likely fate, wouldn't try and escape, and wouldn't be able to gang up on you. And use a very effective assassination method where the victim is unlikely to react in time, even when holding the power of a couple hundred wizards inside them.

(Oh, and while it would be efficient to eat the brain of a 500-wp wizard as a last step, it would be /safer/ to eat wizard brains until you were at, say, 10wp, and then only let other wizards get to perhaps one quarter or less of your power reserves before eating their brains. It means you'll be eating a lot more brains, but it also means you'll have a far less likely chance of accidentally creating a personal nemesis with the same power level as yourself.)

Really, then, your only limit will be how many wizards are born/created/evoked per year on the planet, if you end up eating /all/ their brains and magic (even by proxy).
