  First of all, we're talking about nuclear reactions, not chemical reactions.

Aye, but we have magic. Cold fusion research is an attempt to make a nuclear catalyst.

So, as a physics master student, let me tell you that I'm right, but that I'm just bad at explaining. (Or frankly didn't even bother to, because of careless assumption that people know how quantum tunnelling works).

Quantum tunnelling probability never goes to zero. It increases massively if there's less stuff to tunnel through, so giving particles higher momentum so they can get higher up the momentum bump and/or have small enough wavelength to even be capable of getting closer increases quantum tunnelling probability to macroscopically detectable levels and is one way to accelerate the reaction. But normal radioactive materials perform quantum tunnelling-assisted nuclear reaction often (though only within atoms, not between them), without requiring outside energy sources.

The kind of reaction I'm talking about - entire molecules being spanned by quantum tunnelling - wouldn't occur in all the hydrogen in the observable universe given a hundred trillion years, probably. But in a googolplex years it might.

Quantum tunnelling was just supposed to indicate that it's physically allowed (satisfying rule 6), though, not be the actual mechanism.
