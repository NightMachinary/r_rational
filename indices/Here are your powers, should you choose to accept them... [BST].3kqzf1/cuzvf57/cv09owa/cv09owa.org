  "me" being identified by having certain memories, having a certain toeprint (fingerprint on your toes)), or similarly hard-to-determine identifiers.

Or much simpler and more robust, the source of energy for the spell...

  I would also try to invent a system which allows me to incapacitate a wizard before I have to vocalise a trigger word. Most crudely this would be destroying someone's voice box if I snap my fingers while I look at them, and most sophisticatedly it would read my thoughts, pick up the "that guy is a wizard" signal, and use that as a trigger to destroy their voice box.

This would require a long-running spell. It wouldn't use any energy while it wasn't activated, but it would still block replenishment (with a naive interpretation of these rules).

  Kickstarting an exothermic reaction with a catalyst uses no joules of energy

That requires conversion of energy into magical energy, which has not been specified. You can push two nuclei together so hard they'll fuse, but that doesn't give you magical energy to replenish what you've used (which is possibly enough to kill you outright, at least on the scale of attempting to create a detonation). It's much simpler to directly convert to heat to melt their vocal cords, or kinetic energy to shred them. I'm not optimistic on their chances of survival, whether by heat, kinetics, or nuclear detonation.

It would be much simpler and safer to melt the recurrent laryngeal nerves, resulting in a complete loss of speech and difficulty respirating during physical activity. To prevent whispering, you would also want to melt the facial nerves. Then you can recognize wizards not only by reserves, but by having the appearance of double stroke victims. You might want to leave the nerves leading to the upper face intact. It's hard to communicate with no verbal articulation as well as facial. Their eyebrow game will still remain.

Ideally, you would want to do this to every wizard who enters your perimeter. However, you deal with the extra risk that every wizard who enters your perimeter will immediately want to kill you. Fortunately, difficulty respirating during physical activity will make their task exceedingly difficult. Depending on the capability of magic to detect magic reserves or magical activity, you would want to extend your perimeter of voice-killing.

  I would then go about making the world a better place. Crank up particle accelerators, make fission/miniature black hole reactors, threaten world leaders into good governance, blow up terrorists, rapists and murderers, detonate all unauthorised chemical and nuclear weaponry, burn smallpox and cocaine, threaten to destroy the entire planet with my dying breath if it ever comes, etc.

You would be exceedingly incapable of making good on destroying the Earth "in your dying breath." Your method of doing so is dependent on the unspecified conversion of natural energy to magical energy (which I doubt is intended), and with such miserably detectable tactics, you would be assassinated without ever knowing about it, and I doubt the OP intends spells to remain active after their master's death, considering rule 8.
