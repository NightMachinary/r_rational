Experiment how magic works at molecular scale, as a catalyst. Kickstarting an exothermic reaction with a catalyst uses no joules of energy, other than the creation of a catalyst and the start of the first exothermic reaction. The start of the reaction is utterly minuscule on a Joules scale, but it's the "creation of a catalyst" which is vague. Magic seems to usually act as a 99.9999999...=100% perfect thermodynamic engine, so by extrapolation it should be free.

If exothermic reactions can in fact be catalysed using magic, as the rules seem to indicate, all terrestrial matter other than Fe-56 is now susceptible to nuclear detonation, at minimal magical cost.

I'm not sure how to use this knowledge without risking global extinction. There are so many actors in this world that MAD is unsustainable. What I need is knowledge. Experiment with building an autonomous magical detection system; one which can recognise casting and some to-be-determined authorisation system. If that works, set up the following global rule, or one like it:

#+begin_quote
  (while 0) If [someone who isn't authorised] uses magic^{1} , trigger a small nuclear explosion in their voice box (disabling their ability to cast magic while hopefully keeping them alive).
#+end_quote

This should serve to keep me anonymous while eliminating all threats other than non-exploded wizards who happen to see me in person. Since any magic is invariably suicidal, it is hopefully almost impossible that someone would stumble on a functional magical machine capable of significant damage within this system.

I would also try to invent a system which allows me to incapacitate a wizard before I have to vocalise a trigger word. Most crudely this would be destroying someone's voice box if I snap my fingers while I look at them, and most sophisticatedly it would read my^{2} thoughts, pick up the "that guy is a wizard" signal, and use that as a trigger to destroy their voice box.

So, /GM volente/, this would serve to make me and people I authorise the only people capable of magic. It would leave me anonymous, except perhaps in the distribution of wizard fatalities which may be higher in my wake (solution: stay indoors until the number of people whose throats mysteriously explode starts dropping).

I would then go about making the world a better place. Crank up particle accelerators, make fission/miniature black hole reactors, threaten world leaders into good governance, blow up terrorists, rapists and murderers, detonate all unauthorised chemical and nuclear weaponry, burn smallpox and cocaine, threaten to destroy the entire planet with my dying breath if it ever comes, etc.

*edit: magic as a nuclear catalyst*

Quantum tunnelling is a phenomenon by which an atom can 'hop' from one side of a potential barrier to another. This relies on the quantum wave-function being spread out over space, and not actually being blocked by potential barriers higher than the amount of energy available to the particle (which is in an energy eigenstate for purposes of this explanation), only decreasing at an exponential rate, going from "likely" to "pretty much impossible" in the span of femtometers. Quantum tunnelling is the key mechanism for all particle physics reactions, particles jumping from one energy eigenstate to another at nearly the speed of light and then staying there again for a much longer timescale.

Important for my idea is that the probability of quantum tunnelling never quite goes to zero. It's an exponential decay, but those never reach zero. Nuclear reactions are exothermal, so the quantum tunnelling probability is non-zero, so without adding extra energy it is possible for the hydrogen in water to spontaneously react in accordance to typical solar fission reactions, though the probability means it probably hasn't ever happened at room temperature in the history in the universe.

However, it can happen, therefore it constitutes "any other way" under rule 6. Since quantum tunnelling doesn't require outside energy, the magical reaction doesn't require energy either. Therefore you can catalyse nuclear reactions for free.
