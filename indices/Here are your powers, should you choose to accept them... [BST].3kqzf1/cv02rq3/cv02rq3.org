Alright, let's see what a Bad Guy could do to break this.

At what point does a magician gain the magic storage? Is it at birth? Before that? During adolescence? Because if they get it at birth or earlier, sooner or later you will get a sociopath or military research panel setting up a rape dungeon with normal women continually impregnated by magic users who then devour the children.

Less nightmarishly, there are plenty of women willing to be surrogate mothers in poorer countries. The military of some country could easily set up magician agents to pose as couples looking for surrogate mothers. If even a small portion of those pregnancies result in magicians, some military or cult or business is going to do it, either to devour the children or raise them in isolation and indoctrinate them.

There are diminishing returns in that the rate of mana recovery does not seem to increase when your maximum reserve does, but still, a few magicians with a thousand times the base reserves would be incredibly powerful for a variety of purposes.
