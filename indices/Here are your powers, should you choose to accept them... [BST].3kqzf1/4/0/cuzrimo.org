It would still take energy to accelerate the atoms, and you'd lose energy overall because you wouldn't get a perfect conversion of energy into some other format.

  How much magical energy does it take to levitate something? Theoretically, it should be zero (as you aren't adding any energy to the system) but that seems incredibly broken.

It would take energy to levitate an object up to a certain level. You probably don't lose energy for just holding something in place (assuming you can base magic off a planetary reference plane) though.
