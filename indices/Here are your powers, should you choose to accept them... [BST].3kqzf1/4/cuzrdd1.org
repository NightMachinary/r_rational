  Magic has computational power, but no intelligence. It can do math, but cannot create solutions to problems on its own.
#+end_quote

Does the computation cost anything? If not, you can get a lot more power out of it by telling your magic to do something like "push all the colder atoms to the right, and all the hotter atoms to the left," making a temperature gradient, and getting power from that.

  You make the magic work by concentrating on what you want it to do,
#+end_quote

How precise and detailed do you have to be? Can I say "produce photons that act like a television screen tuned to channel 10" or would you have to specify each and every transistor and pixel in order to do that?

  You start with four million joules of magical energy
#+end_quote

How much magical energy does it take to levitate something? Theoretically, it should be zero (as you aren't adding any energy to the system) but that seems incredibly broken.

EDIT to add:

What kinds of sensory powers does magic intrinsically have? Can it follow normal human definitions of what an "object" is? Can it take inputs within the 1/4 mile (eg. "produce photons going away from this sphere, as if all of the incoming photons had reflected off of a perfect mirror.")? Can it take inputs from outside the 1/4 mile for free (eg. produce photons coming out of this surface that are identical to the ones passing through that distant object/location.")?

Killing people is obviously very easy within a few miles, so I won't go into too much detail there.
