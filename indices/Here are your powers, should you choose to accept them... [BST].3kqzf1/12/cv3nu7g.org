"Information revolution". Computation is a physical process, this energy /and efficiency/ level will let me run.. seriously good computer architectures purely in magic using buggerall of my overall budget.. The energy limits don't matter, because any violent conflict ends with magically induced grand-mal in whoever had the longest triggerword on their attack spell, but mostly fighting other mages is a terrible idea. Dangerous, and no real gain. If the local mages are actually using the eat brains strategy, that means the culture is horrifyingly dysfunctional. Should probably do something about that.
