It occurs to me that with number 2, you can probably get telepathy with other wizards. Cast a spell to re-arrange atoms as text--will they be able to sense the effect of the spell and read subatomic text? How about if I shift the velocity of an atom near a wizard friend on the other side of the globe, by an infinitesimal amount? If they know Morse code, we can communicate that way.

Or, I could shift every atom on Earth by an infinitesimal amount. Every wizard on Earth knows I did it, at the speed of light--with sufficient wizards, a predictable result is that many will immediately replicate the experiment. If thousands of wizards do this, every wizard on Earth will momentarily be severely distracted by the sheer volume of spells. I could use this opportunity to have a few normal friends incapacitate wizards I previously identified, for example. Maybe that is how I'd get my first few brains.
