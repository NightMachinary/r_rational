That is also a possibility. As a wizard wanting to be the last in the chain, however, it is risky to allow other wizards to snowball before you. Also, you gain the same benefit if you eat them individually after they meditated, but only if they can eat a small fraction of a brain to become a wizard. If the whole brain must be eaten, then the chain method you describe does the most with a single wizard brain (and a bunch of normals). The chain method also minimizes your exposure to diseases, assuming it takes more than fifteen minutes for a person's brain to become diseased after they eat a diseased brain. You'd only have to worry about the single person you ate, not the entirety of the people they ate. At that point, you have to decide which is the bigger risk--trying to kill and eat a single powerful wizard, or exposing yourself to many brains.

Actually, with force-feeding and consciousness-sundering drugs... you could expose one wizard to all of the brain-eating risk, and eat just the person you convince to eat him. This discussion is exceeding morbid, isn't it?

EDIT: I was mistaken about the chain method.
