Well, now we know why no such culture exists. Prion diseases are nasty enough when you don't have access to cosmic powers beyond mortal ken.

In all honesty, though, that's probably pretty easily solvable- if you know the structure of a prion, it wouldn't be incredibly hard to eliminate them with this magic system.
