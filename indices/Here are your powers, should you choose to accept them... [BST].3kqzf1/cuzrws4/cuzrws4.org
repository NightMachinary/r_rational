1. Gain more power. This means eating the brains of other wizards. There's some aspect of diminishing returns here, because the recharge rate doesn't scale with the size of the the energy store, but that's alright; getting more power is a good first step to breaking the universe.

   If possible, get into friendly cooperation with other wizards. Brain-eating is just "after death", the only reason to kill other wizards is if you want it /immediately/. So we can have a culture of ritual consumption of other wizards brains post-mortem, if other wizards are amenable to that.

   Assuming other wizards /aren't/ amenable to that (for example, if wizardkind has descended into an irrevocable war with each other) then I start killing some wizards. The biggest problem is finding them, and not being found in return. Experiment with other ways of "looking". Figure out why photographs and video don't work. Try to make some sort of outfit that would disguise me.

2. Investigate how magic triggers work. Can I make them conditional? For example, "at 4:00PM do =X="? If they can do computation, I might be able to rig a counter of some kind, even if it won't respond to a strict time. Conditionals are really powerful; they would allow for shields, for example, by saying "expend energy to counteract energy over a certain threshold that passes through this shield". If I can set up conditionals so that I never go over my energy store, causing spells to fail instead of killing me, all the better.

3. Investigate computation. How much energy does computation use? How fast is computation? Can I make a magical interface with a computer somehow in order to make a supercomputer? If possible, I interface my magic with my smartphone. There are lots of potential applications I'd like to run if I'm relatively unbounded by the need for computing power.

4. Start running a bunch of low-energy spells. 4 MJ isn't all that much; the handy [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)][orders of magnitude (energy)]] page on Wikipedia informs me that it's about four thousand bullets, which is a good starting point. Magic bullets (or their equivalent) don't seem like the way to go; instead, I would go with things like remote viewing (extremely powerful even if restricted to a quarter-mile, for stealing things like passwords or grabbing sensitive information). It would probably be possible to make a whole bunch of money really quickly with just that, until I get to the point where money doesn't matter.
