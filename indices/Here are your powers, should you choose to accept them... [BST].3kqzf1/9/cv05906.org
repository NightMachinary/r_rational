Actually, number 5 is not true, strictly speaking. The spell would just be horribly complex, or rather would eventually become very complex if you are building an evolving system. Might end up with magic AI, in fact. By the way, the fact that magic has a natural language understanding is fascinating. That's probably exploitable to hell and back. The Sparrow in Wiz Biz is a good example of what happens if your magic has computational power and are an expert in comp science.
