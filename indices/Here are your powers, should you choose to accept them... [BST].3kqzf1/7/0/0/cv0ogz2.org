It sounds like you don't know what a catalyst is. It's a *non-reactive* component of chemical reactions which shapes the structure of potential fields to allow circumvention of energy barriers. You're not pushing an proton through the electrical repulsion barrier, you're tunneling through it, like quantum mechanics occasionally has happen for free. (E.g. beta decay).

Fair enough.

Damn, didn't catch that. Oh well, just have the system work most of the time. The whole point of having it be a catalyst is that they're pretty much energetically free.

Limiting yourself to wizards inside your perimiter will quickly get you eliminated in one of various non-wizarding ways, when the police and/or military triangulates your position. I would try to make my autonomous magical network capable of recognising spellcasting (using its free computations) without relying on my mage-dar.

Using the magical general rules I keep on almost all the time, set up the following rules: "If my heart ceases pumping OR the oxygen content of my prefrontal cortex drops below so-and-so OR over 0.01 grams of brain matter is not attached to my body OR my voice box is blown up OR etc., catalyse the nuclear detonation of all hydrogen in the solar system.

Unless the very first definition of "death" included in this rule satisfied by the assassination attempt is the one magic uses, kaboom.

Meh, what I said so far doesn't seem to really identify me. You've got a fair point, though: my priorities do increasingly narrow it down. There's definite room for improvement.
