  It sounds like you don't know what a catalyst is. It's a non-reactive component of chemical reactions which shapes the structure of potential fields to allow circumvention of energy barriers. You're not pushing an proton through the electrical repulsion barrier, you're tunneling through it, like quantum mechanics occasionally has happen for free. (E.g. beta decay).

First of all, we're talking about nuclear reactions, not chemical reactions. I'll admit I don't know anything about nuclear physics, but cursory research reveals that quantum tunneling happens by /default,/ lowering the energy required to overcome the Coulomb barrier from classical predictions to what is predicted by the Gamow factor, which /still/ requires high relative velocities to overcome the barrier, meaning you're /still accelerating body-temperature atoms at each other./ If you're talking about muon-catalyzed fusion, you still need to create muons, and muon-catalyzed fusion does not represent a return on investment even given natural to magical energy conversion. None of these methods represent zero cost on your magical energy reserves, and it is not at all clear that this means you will be able to create a sustained nuclear reaction with only four megajoules. You are massively overrepresenting your capabilities.
