  More importantly, how would it do so without any energy loss?

Rule 6.

  And how is this classically-defined source of manipulation supposed to help shape quantum fields?

It isn't classically defined. You might tend to read it classically, but that's because intuition is classical, not because the rules don't make sense in quantum mechanics.

I did talk about "experiment with catalysts" because I'm not sure this would work. The rules do seem written without regard for quantum mechanics, so if I can't explode the entire universe I'l have to come up with something else.

For example: if I had a lens or parabolic mirror in space, I could use it to focus light on a single point on earth. There would be some absorption losses in the intensity of the beam, but the lensing itself wouldn't cost outside energy (again, other than having to exist, which isn't a problem for normal magic). Therefore I can make an orbital kill sat which can strike anywhere on the planet for free.
