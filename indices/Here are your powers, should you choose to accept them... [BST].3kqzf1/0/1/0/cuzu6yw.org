I didn't do any math, so I'm not surprised. The wiki page is giving the numbers for a specific type of bullet fired from an M16, which I just wily-nily adjusted down because I thought it would probably be a bit high for what I think of as "the destructive power of a bullet". (An actual list of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy#Typical_muzzle_energies_of_common_firearms_and_cartridges][muzzle energies]] can be found here if you want to do an actual comparison. But you'd pretty much never use the wizard power for firing bullets in the first place, so it's just for the purposes of concretely visualizing the abstract numbers.)

I worry that this would be too conspicuous, though I'd have to look into how anonymous you can be when you win the lottery. Winning the lottery seems to be the sort of thing that draws a lot of attention even if you're not a wizard?
