The lottery varies across states (and States). Some allow you to claim it through a representative or trust and not pose for the big-ass check...some don't.

So you have to either be in luck or willing to travel. Being lucky is preferable I imagine, you don't want fly into a state, win the lottery and fly out soon after, if you're the paranoid type.
