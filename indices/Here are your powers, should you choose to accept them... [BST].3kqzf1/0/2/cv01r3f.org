Regarding 1:

I can only assume that in this universe, any obvious way of killing wizards will be known--wizards have presumably been around for a while. So, there goes my plan for capturing wizards with partially-lobotomized other wizards, cans of chloroform, and insubstantial spell effects to catch attention. If wizards have been around for a while then any living wizard will be good at avoiding such traps.

I might experiment with sharing brains with other wizards, or even normals. If I can make a new wizard by feeding a normal some wizard brain, things get interesting. It might be possible to trick a normal into becoming a wizard, teach them to meditate, then kill them and have a larger store as a result. Again, it depends on how well wizards are known in this world.

It would be useful to turn friends and family. With a group of people, any solitary wizard can be confined, rendered unconscious, and consumed. With five people, my group's recharge rate is 5x. We can rotate as needed.

The thing I really find troubling is, what if others have been using these tactics? It is easy to imagine a world with a few very powerful wizards, who can incapacitate any wizard they encounter with their massive stores. How would you fight a wizard with 50 times your power and plenty of practice eating other wizards?
