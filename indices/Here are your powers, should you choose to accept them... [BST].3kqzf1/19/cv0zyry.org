Assume you have enormous magical power because you've eaten the brains of a zillion wizards. Given that power, is it possible to increase the number of wizards in the population, either by having more born per thousand births, or turning existing non-wizards into wizards?

Is magic stored or accessed in the brain? i.e. If a wizard was reduced (even if temporarily) to a brain in a jar, would they still have access to their magic pool? Would it still replenish at the normal rate?

Would it be possible for a powerful wizard to detect when someone had become a wizard anywhere within a large radius (either born or ascended), kidnap them and erase their existence from the memories of anyone who knew them, reduce them to a brain and stomach in a jar, feed the jars' contents to each other until they reach a certain level of magic storage, and then spend their days killing and snacking on the most powerful jarred brains?
