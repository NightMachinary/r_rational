How do you figure? Nanotech is /really/ complicated. There's a big difference between knowing exactly what chemical reactions need to be done and knowing what arrangements of atoms would fold up in such a way as to do that on its own. Nanotech isn't like macrotech. You have quantum physics to deal with.
