Because magic is dependent on your life force and has to be shut off to allow replenishment of your stores. Meanwhile, I want nanotech such as respirocytes in my body, which, if done with magic, would leave a fatal amount of air in my bloodstream upon deactivation.

As for the feasibility of mechanical nanotech, I respectfully disagree. Vibration is not a categorical problem in mechanical components of hundreds to thousands of atoms, and you're assuming it isn't running in vacuum in the first place, which is very possible for devices external the body. There are additional options for cooling as well, through laser and through the thermoelectric effect. Mechanical catalysis is very different from organic catalysis.
