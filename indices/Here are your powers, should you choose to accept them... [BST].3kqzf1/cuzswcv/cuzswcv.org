  Your store of magic refills if less than full at a rate of one million joules every six hours, except while you are actively using magic.

That works out to 46 watts. A human uses about 100 watts on average. It's possible that you're a perpetual motion machine, but it's not clear that that's the case.

  After fifteen minutes of meditation (no benefits for more or less time spent), you will gain an additional two million joules

That's over 2 kW. Much more than a human consumes. Now you can be a perpetual motion machine. You can cause a population explosion that never ends since you can support yourself on magic. And you can levitate for free, so physical area isn't much of a problem either.
