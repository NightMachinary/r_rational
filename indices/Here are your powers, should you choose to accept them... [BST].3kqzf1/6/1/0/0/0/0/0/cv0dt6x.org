I don't think mechanical nanotech is possible. Mechanical systems require a certain assumption of precision that simply stops being possible. It's going to be bombarded by air or water molecules constantly. Whenever it absorbs energy, it will start vibrating and have no good way to stop. It can't just convert the energy to heat. It already is heat.

If you can make spells that run off of data given through USB, why do you even need nanotech? You could make the spells do whatever it is you wanted the nanotech to do.
