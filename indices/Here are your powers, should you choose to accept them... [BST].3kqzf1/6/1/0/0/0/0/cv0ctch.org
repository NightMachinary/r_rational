That's organic nanotech. I'm talking about Drexler's mechanical nanotech, which is more desirable in the first place. I'm not saying it's not an extended research project, it's just an avenue /that is very desirable./

Consider the capability of magic to read instructions and adhere to protocols and data formats. You could make spells that run off of data given through USB! You don't have to hold precise nanoscale designs in your head, you have a computer that can do it for you. Even with the complexities of those protocols and data formats, you can simply build a bootstrapping spell.
