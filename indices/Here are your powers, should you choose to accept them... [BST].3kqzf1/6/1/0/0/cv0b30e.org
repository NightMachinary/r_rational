Back into sugar, but man cannot live on sugar alone. Sugar is only food for plants. To become self-sustaining, you'd need to find all the chemical reactions that turn your shit into food, and catalyze those with magic. You'd need to capture your sweat and piss, and all of those particles leaving your body when you exhale.

It's possible that you can use spells like nanotechnology. I would definitely work that angle, but only after I had researched all of the ways to gain and lose magical energy, since "spells work until they run out of energy" yet "if your store of magic drops to zero, you die." See my comment below yours.

With a nanotech angle, I would work not on self-sufficiency, but efficiency of digestion. I couldn't in good faith mimic respirocytes with spells due to my own requirement of complete shut-off when nearing zero energy, and I would most definitely die a fizzy death with that many bubbles in my bloodstream. Using magic to construct nanotechnology, however, is a much better way to go about things.
