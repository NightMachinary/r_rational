Can you use external energy to preform magical effects? For instance, could you steal some of the kinetic energy from a waterfall, and use it to push a turbine? The theoretical energy usage for this should be near zero, and so this can increase your effective power immensely.

Given the ability to violate Newton's third law of motion, I can't help but think you'll be able to do something game-breaking with that. Reaction-less drives are the first thing that come to mind, making spacecraft powered by wizards far more efficient than normal. Hovercraft might work, but then can you create immovable objects for free? As you can apparently create infinite force as long as it doesn't change energy. The question is, does the magic exertion depend on the energy exerted /on/ an object, or the change in energy in the entire universe due to the magic? Hm.

Also 4 million joules is about two pounds of tnt, which is more than enough to execute unstoppable assassinations from a terrifying range, even assuming you use your energy inefficiently. You can cook a human brain with 48kj. Or just impart the kinetic energy of a bullet directly to a portion of the human skull for 500-6,000 joules. Unless wizards have been around long enough, and are populous enough to have established protection procedures, radical political manipulation, and industrial espionage, would be trivial. Standard wizard wards should be pretty straightforwards to overpower, if you have more energy, which means the largest collection of power (in either one, or multiple wizards), will be able to kill whomever they want untraceably. They could make a killing shorting the stock market (pun intended).

If magic works faster than light, you can get FTL signaling, which can lead to time travel.

You may be able to transmute neutrons to protons for 1 x 10^-13 J. So move roughly 1-10 milligrams of a substance up one atomic number. Which doesn't seem super useful. Though you could make some exotic isotopes.

6 Sv of radiation (About 360 J for an average person) should be fatal if dosed all at once. 20 Sv (1,200 J) should create a nearly 100% risk of cancer (an untraceable killer), though you would have to dose over time, to prevent massive organ failure.

Alter a cell to become a malignant cancer. Energy should be nearly negligible.

Relatedly, you have a tremendous advantage in chemistry and materials science. You can probably construct nanowire and carbon nanotubes fairly easily from graphene. Nanobots are also viable, provided you have the designs for them. Nanobots in turn give you nearly unlimited manufacturing capabilities, chemical alteration of the human body (No need to eat, sleep, or catch a disease, possible intelligence upgrade and brain-machine interfaces), grey goo, genetically tailored nano-plagues, pollution control, etc, etc.

TL;DR World's best assassin. Nanobots.
