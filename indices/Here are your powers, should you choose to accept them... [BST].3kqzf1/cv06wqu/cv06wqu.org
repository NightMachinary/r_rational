Is it possible to convert regular energy back into magic somehow, or is it a strictly one way process?

If its one way, I would probably start by draining away a certain amount of magic each day to charge a battery to run all my stuff off of. If I can somehow store pure magical energy then I would do that as well to start accumulating a larger buffer.

I would probably not heavily use my own magic pool to do anything, I would just convert it into some other sort of energy pool and use /that/ for everything.

I would definitely be interested in identifying what magic actually is and where it actually comes from. The mere fact that magic exists opens the potential to exploit it outside of the conditions people have naturally. The best way isn't to break the universe, its to carefully dismantle it and reassemble it to suit your desires.
