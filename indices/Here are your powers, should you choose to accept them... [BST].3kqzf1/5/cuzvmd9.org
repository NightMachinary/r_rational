How do people become wizards? Maybe start some sort of wizard-generating farm, and quickly absorb the 4 million joules per person as soon as possible after their initiation as a wizard (I'm assuming you immediately start with the 4 million joules). Which should be easy, given that brand-new wizards shouldn't normally be able to skilfully control their magic.

Also, given enough time, magical computers, and then a magical Internet. Although I imagine the interface would be a pain to use, since you'd have to manipulate individual bits.
