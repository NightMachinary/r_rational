I'd start with stuff that takes 0 work.

Cast, "hold rope" a bunch of times, and you've got a space elevator. Follow the rope up, cast "hold air bubble" and you've got a space station.

Magic can do math, so it should be possible to cast a "pull on object, tangent to its velocity" spell that uses 0 energy and do asteroid mining. (+ infinite energy if magic doesn't have a preferred reference frame)

At that point, you've got arbitrary money. You're out of other mages range, and have the ability to drop orbital-velocity rocks on anyone you don't like.

The other end of the scale would use very, very tiny amounts of energy to move precise things. Destructive stuff is easy if you can directly mess with chemical bonds.

For non-destructive things, it would be cool to make perfectly pure diamonds. If you're paying the chemical binding cost for c-c bonds, you can get diamond for 57 kJ/g. It's cheaper if you're transmuting hydrocarbons with some existing bonds.

Desalinization would be really cheap (exact numbers depend on how close magic can get to Maxwell's demon), and surgery would be amazing.
