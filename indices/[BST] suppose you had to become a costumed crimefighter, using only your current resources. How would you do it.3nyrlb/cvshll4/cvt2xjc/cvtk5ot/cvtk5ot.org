That's only the case if you suffer from high time preference. I don't, so as far (no pun intended) as I'm concerned, supporting contraception and abortions is just as harmful in the long term as supporting any other activities traditionally thought of as criminal. I would much rather offer free sterilisation to anyone who doesn't want children and anyone I believe shouldn't have any, than provide them contraceptives, abortions or "sex education" of the kind that only discusses the mechanics of sex while entirely neglecting its moral justification.
