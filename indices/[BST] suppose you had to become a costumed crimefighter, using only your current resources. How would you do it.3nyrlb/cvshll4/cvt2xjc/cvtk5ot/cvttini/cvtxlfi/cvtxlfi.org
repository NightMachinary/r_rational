  Are you including all such things as condoms, the pill, male contraception, IUDs, and hormonal implants? Why?
#+end_quote

Yes, because they all exist for the sole purpose of enabling sexual contact without its natural consequences - in other words, they enable high time preference behaviour without the accompanying selection pressure that would ordinarily result from such behaviour.

  please explain why you think sex requires moral justification
#+end_quote

The selection pressure for enjoying sexual contact stems from the obvious fact that normally, sexual contact results in reproduction. When the two are decoupled, you get a perverse incentive to enjoy yourself to no end. Hedonism, wireheading, call it whatever you want, there are sound rational reasons to detest such behaviour and those who fall victim to it due to their high time preference.

  And then please explain how sterilizing people is better than birth control, because it kind of is birth control.
#+end_quote

Sterilisation prevents them from reproducing at all (barring a reversal surgery that will, hopefully, remain beyond their means for the rest of their lives), while birth control allows them high time preference hedonism in the short term without preventing them from passing on the disposition towards it. If you want to be an unproductive, degenerate hedonist, not passing on your genes seems like a sensible admission price to me. I would add a prohibition against passing on the memes as well - eg, a sodomite agitation and propaganda ban such as currently exists in Russia - but that's a different topic.
