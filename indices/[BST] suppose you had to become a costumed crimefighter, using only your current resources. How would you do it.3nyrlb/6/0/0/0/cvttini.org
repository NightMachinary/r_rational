  supporting contraception and abortions is just as harmful in the long term as supporting any other activities traditionally thought of as criminal
#+end_quote

Are you including all such things as condoms, the pill, male contraception, IUDs, and hormonal implants? Why? Because they encourage sex that is immoral from your point of view? How is that worse than the benefit gained from lower crime rates and consolidation of wealth?

#+begin_quote
  only discusses the mechanics of sex while entirely neglecting its moral justification
#+end_quote

The only moralizing sex education I've heard of is abstinence-only, which you can't claim has done any good for birth rates, crime, poverty, or disease in any poor population anywhere. I'm not the one downvoting you, so please explain why you think sex requires moral justification, and why that means birth control is harmful in the long term or should be thought of as criminal. And then please explain how sterilizing people is better than birth control, because it kind of /is/ birth control.
