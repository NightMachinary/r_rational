  The Minion Master is a wannabe supervillain whose plan consists of rallying enough minions to him so he can take over the world through sheer numbers. He has the capability to completely erase anyone's history and give them a new life as a minion . This is implied to be the only thing he is good at. He sends out his minions to steal technology from other supervillains, earning their enmity. The Minion Master is always seen wearing a purple shirt, black pants, a cape, and a helmet which mimics his facial expressions. He seems content to leave the finer details of operations to his minions, allowing Torg and company to plan and execute the steps of their tech-stealing raids without consulting him. Even when one of their earlier raids doesn't go as planned, he is satisfied by their phrasing of what they did get . He is also not opposed to playing Karaoke Band Hero . His real name is Anthony and his sister is [[https://sluggy.wikia.com/wiki/Izzy][Izzy]].
