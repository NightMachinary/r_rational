Hearthstone is pretty sweet. I play it as well, and well, one of the reasons I am hung up on this whole game thing is because I am the technical director for a company that broadcasts Esports competitions, including Hearthstone.

But if you really want to get into a deep, competitive card game, you gotta go to Magic the Gathering, at least until they add more cards/abilities/mechanics to Hearthstone.
