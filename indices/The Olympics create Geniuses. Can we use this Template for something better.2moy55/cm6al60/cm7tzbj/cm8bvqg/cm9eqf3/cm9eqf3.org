I think you actually meant the guy named Alexander, but in case you didn't here is my farthest along fanfic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8658792/1/Steel-and-Gold]]

And if you wanted Alexander's, who is really great, here is one of his: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man]]

He has several, and they are all great and wonderful.
