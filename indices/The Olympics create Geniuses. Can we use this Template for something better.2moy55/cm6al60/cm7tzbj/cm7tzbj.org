First, love your fanfictions.

Second, I think one of the things that is becoming more clear, is that Video Games are going to be able to do some pretty neat stuff, especially with the advent of Procedurally Generated content.

I feel like Video Games might be the way to get people to buy into the competition, and I think Starcraft might be the smallest, newly birthed example of what it could one day be.

But it would be extremely difficult. I was more just wondering: is this a good idea? If we had the resources, ability, right game, etc would it be worth implementing.

I do, however, think your first point is a little lacking. I don't see how the inability for the "sport" or "esport" to transfer to other areas is such a problem. Certainly it isn't a problem for any other sport, where their abilities (namely putting a ball of some sort into a certain place) are pretty much useless in any other given context.

And the idea isn't to have a game that teaches geography, instead it would be something more akin to teaching creative or critical thinking, good utilization of resources, performing under pressure, and more, with the main thrust to be that the physical aspects of such challenges are downplayed in subservience to the mental acrobatics.

Does that make sense?
