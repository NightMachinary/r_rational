Ah, the crux of trying to compare dissimilar categories against each other. What do we mean by genius anyways - what's the membership test to be counted as one?

If by genius, we mean people whose ability in some field is so many standard deviations above the average practitioner, then I think Olympians and PhD are comparable. Thankfully, this excludes flying - since I don't think any human will do much better than the average flying animal. (Unless we have some other criterion for this camp, in which case why call it flying?)

But the point OP brought up is that, given enough incentive (a la the Olymics), can we foster a culture where intellectuals is a widely popular aspiration? (through video games, or otherwise)

If we ask whether incentivizing video gaming will produce geniuses at video games, the answer is trivial; but if we ask whether incentivizing video gaming will produce geniuses in the more traditional sense, I must admit my reservations. Sure, some skills might be transferable (e.g. heightened awareness, better object manipulation), but why not just incentivize those skills directly? A good marksman will still be a much better shot than a great FPS player; so marksmanship itself is a much more direct thing to promote /if you want people to be crack-shots/. We're certainly not training the next George Patton by making them play Starcraft.

(No disrespect to video-gaming. The point is equally valid if I substitute topics such as meditation, good nutrition, or getting enough sleep.)

So how do we incentivize being smart? I argue that the incentive to be smart is there already. People with PhDs (and MDs, JDs, etc) are more likely to have better financial security and job satisfaction than those who don't. There's also a good deal of prestige - some people consider adding to the sum-total knowledge of mankind a more impressive feat than swimming really fast. In fact, if you consider how many PhDs there are compared to Olympiads, I'd say our incentives for 'smarts' are working quite well. On an absolute scale over the lifetime of our race, the average man today is the smartest he has ever been.
