The number of Olympiads (~thousands/occurrence), compared to the general populace (~billions), is vanishingly small. In comparison, the number of PhD (~ten thousands/year) compared to the general populace is relatively small, but still much larger than the number of Olympiads.

By that metric, the human race is doing much better on its +int than its +str.

However, if we only count Gold medalist (~hundreds/occurence) as geniuses, then compared to Nobel Prizes winners (~tens/year), academics have much catching up to do.
