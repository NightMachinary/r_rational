As to what genius means, I think your definition of "people whose ability in some field many standard deviations above the average" is a good one.

I would like to point out that the subject is more on whether or not producing a video game that did actually focus on transferrable skills is a good idea, like the multi-tasking boost you get from playing Starcraft, not whether or not one right now exists. Specifically I was thinking along the lines of critical thinking, performing under pressure, and creative solving of simple problems.

I don't think incentivizing the skills directly works very well in the society we are in. Because of the capitalistic nature of our government, economics, and culture, being good at something just for the sake of it is not widely considered to be a "good" idea. Deciding to spend all your time drawing beautiful portraits without the accompanying thought of how to sell, market, and make a profit off those portraits is, sadly, something considered to be "stupid".

Hence, the idea of taking the Olympics and other Sports template and creating something that deviously turns people into smarty-pants. Now, what kind of smarts is definitely up to debate, but I think your proposal regarding the economic incentives of being a PHD holder gets a bit crushed when you consider that if you asked 100 kids, age 6-12, what they wanted to be when they grew up, you would probably get a lot more "Basketball Player" than "PHD holder in Physics".

In part, the reasoning for this thought is to try and get them young! With something flashy, that grabs immediate attention, is broadcasted on Television or the Internet, and that seems feasible for making money.

Also, to add to that last thought, you end with "how many PhDs there are compared to Olympiads", but that number starts to really look a lot worse when you consider the number of PhDs in comparison to every professional athlete, especially if you are conflating PhD as a professional in their field to a Professional Athlete being a professional in their field. In that sense, I feel like "jocks" are winning the number game, and much more importantly, are winning the cultural "cool" game.
