I think, again, you can look to Starcraft for a glimmer of what could be. Starcraft, ultimately, is about raising an army to crush your foe, and that, is very easy for the layman to grasp. The first part of explaining Starcraft is very simple and just about everyone grasps it: Destroy your opponent with your army.

Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your perspective, the game is set in the far future with alien races, and stops being super intuitive, although Blizzard, I will say, did a great job of making it so the more powerful a unit gets (mostly in terms of cost / amount of damage it does per minute) the bigger and more impressive it looks.

Obviously, there isn't a game out there right now that does the things that would make it an "Olympian" sport, but I do feel like the potential could be there.
