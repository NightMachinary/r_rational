I've been watching Hearthstone (an online collectible card game) lately, and I think that it does a lot right in terms of being understandable to the layman. It's filled with lots of neat animations that make it clear what's going on, and the tournaments feature commentators that discuss the possible plays (and the reasoning behind the plays). And when some brilliant play is made, it's fairly easy for the viewer to see it after the fact, even if they didn't get there on their own. Other than the random elements involved, I think it offers a very good model for how an intellectual game can/should be designed.
