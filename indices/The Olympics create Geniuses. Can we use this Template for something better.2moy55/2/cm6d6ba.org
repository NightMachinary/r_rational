What intellectual exercises are easy to watch?

Most Olympic events are some form of race, either literally or in the form of a score. Which player is in front, and how close they are to one another is immediately apparent with even the most rudimentary understanding of what sport /is/. The events which aren't races are typically based on distance or accuracy, relatively easy to explain the goal and then grade without much explanation.

A tiny, but popular remainder are graded on difficulty and mastery. These are usually aesthetically pleasing in their own right, and who happens to win is secondary to the enjoyment of just watching experts play.

In short, anybody can sit down and watch the Olympics and basically understand what the Olympians are trying to do. Ditto the vast majority of sports out there. That low barrier to entry inspires people to devote their attention long enough to start asking questions about specific rules, techniques, scoring conventions, and whatever else is required to understand a sport well.

Unless these intellectual competitions are immediately, understandably fun to watch, they're not going to attract the sort or size of audience that supports the money and prestige of conventional sport.
