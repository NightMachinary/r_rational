I think I disagree with you on the idea that our world has enough incentive to be intelligent.

I feel like if that was true, less people would be inclined to think Global Warming is a hoax, or that vaccinations cause autism, or any number of other things. I feel like people think intelligence is good, but very few people define intelligence well.

And regardless, even if we hit the minimum of "liking to be intelligent" I'd still like to walk up to kids, ask them what they want to be, and receive an overwhelming chorus of things like: "astrophysicists, neuroscientist, artist, writer, astronaut, molecular biologist" rather than, "Play for the Packers, get into the NBA, Pop sensation, etc".

Yah dig?
