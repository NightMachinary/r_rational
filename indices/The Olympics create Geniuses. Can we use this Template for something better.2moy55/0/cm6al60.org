There have certainly been attempts at creating competitions for intelligence-based pursuits. In high school I was in academic decathlon, debate, mock trial, chess club, and every recreational mathematics program (not bragging here - the barrier for entry in most of those is very low, and many of them I wasn't terribly good at). In college, I did programming competitions and robotics competitions, and I have on occasion helped out with the current high school programs for the same thing.

I think you're right that adding incentives on top of the already fairly high incentives for academics would increase interest. However, I also think that there are two big problems:

1. Specialization is a killer. If you look at chess, Scrabble, trivia shows, etc. the biggest thing that you can do to increase your ability is /not/ to get smarter, but to - for example - memorize the common openings, or memorize the two letter word list. There's a lot of cognitive effort involved, but also a lot of stuff that just doesn't transfer to other domains. This is going to be the case with almost any game you invent for people to play, and represents a problem if you want to push people towards a general increase in intelligence.

2. Money. The Olympics are, so far as I know, revenue positive, in that it makes money for people (hosting the Olympics doesn't always work out for the host country, since it can leave a lot of dead stadiums and other problems, but that's a fixable problem). If you want a cognitive sport, you need to make sure that it too is revenue positive (or at least neutral). You /could/ fund it with tax dollars or private donations, but that's a losing proposition unless you have a lot of support - and that money can probably be spent in better ways. The whole reason to do a sport is that the sport can make money and pour that money back into itself.

So essentially, all you need to do is create a game that:

- Increases general intelligence when played/practiced
- Is entertaining to watch

And if you can do that, then you can create your own Olympics organically. However, there have been attempts to do this, and none of them have been terribly successful, if only because cognitive effort is almost always internal, and cognitive sports /mostly/ involve people thinking quietly to themselves with a furrowed brow.
