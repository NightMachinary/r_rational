Note: Chess isn't all about memorizing openings, though that is something most players do, rather than it is about just playing a lot and getting better at pattern-matching situations to other times you've played the position. Though, you were correct that it isn't about being more intelligent, and that it isn't quite useful for other cognitive tasks.
