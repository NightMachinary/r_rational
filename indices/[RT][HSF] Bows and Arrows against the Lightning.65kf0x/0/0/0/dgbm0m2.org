Vacuum energy drive - what is it? How does it work? Why does it sometimes yield a boom a few orders of magnitude off the right end of the scale? Why hasn't that been deliberately weaponized? What does it cost?

Monopole enrichment - what? How? I'm not a physicist, but this smells of "this one neat trick violates the laws of thermodynamics!". Reading between the lines, it sounds like the ships work by converting vacuum energy and waste heat from all the other systems into hot dark matter somehow and using it as a propellant, maybe? It's very confusing to me. I'm also confused as to why there's a squishy biological person in those ships at all - to document it, to experience it? But then, the story suggests that the Utilitaria is running so close to capacity that /human minds/ can detect gaps in thinking. That's suspicious.

...wait.

Is the Apathy designed by the Utilitaria to take the part of "terrifying outsider alien force to band against", giving humanity as a whole a purpose and a common enemy? With the short term losses of planets to human life not important compared to the utility of having a whole planet to totally exploit.
