  ...wait.

  Is the Apathy designed by the Utilitaria to take the part of "terrifying outsider alien force to band against", giving humanity as a whole a purpose and a common enemy? With the short term losses of planets to human life not important compared to the utility of having a whole planet to totally exploit.

That's a good answer, and if I ever do get a chance to finish that big story I can promise a full answer to why the apathy are omnicidal maniacs, and why they are out to wipe out humanity in particular ;)

You can get a better idea of the Utilitaria's motivations, and why they seem to want to involve people at the cost of efficiency, by seeing where they came from: [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8uwt93t2p92itr/The%20Utilitaria.pdf][The Utilitaria]]
