That is a very in-depth reply. Out of curiosity - keeping in mind that I don't have any formal education in physics, so sorry if I have a dramatically flawed understanding of some concepts - if the vacuum drive gets energy from allowing the Higgs field to tunnel to a lower energy state at GUT energies, the conditions that allow that to happen involve ludicrously high energy densities, and the energy is released at the same point as the tunneling event, then why doesn't the reaction cause a spontaneous collapse of the Higgs field travelling outwards at lightspeed? What would the effect of a lower value for the Higgs field even be - particles would be constrained less, so lower effective masses for particles? - if so, why doesn't using a vacuum drive completely scramble anything more complex than plasma in its general vicinity, as the details of particle interactions rapidly adjust? Even if the reaction is constrained, for whatever reason, what happens to the region it's constrained to - is that where the frameshift drives get the negative energy-density field they need, squeezing the necessary energy out of spacetime?

I just spent four hours trying to figure out what magnetic monopoles are and how they might be created. Unfortunately, your summary is still about all I understand. Is there any particular reason why a monopole crystal would have those material properties, do you think, or is it just cool and convenient?
