Was a bit too wordy for me. It may be my lack of physics knowledge hindering me but this felt very infodumpy. It's possible this would've come off better to me if it had been the climax of a book, where we would've learnt what all of those fancy sci-fi words mean in context.

It was cool, and I finished it, but I came away from it distinctly feeling as if it didn't engage me as much as it could. It felt kind of like a "Look here at this cool scenario and all of the cool tech I worldbuilt" passage. Which, again, wouldn't be an issue if this was a climactic battle scene at the end of a book wherein we learnt what exactly all of those terms meant.

TL;DR: Was entertaining enough to make me finish it but didn't feel very engaging. Very wordy and infodumpy, not organic (pun intended) enough.

EDIT: And just to clarify, I don't mean wordy as in it was too long. I mean wordy in that there was a little too much words I couldn't understand in context.
