You've got quite a lot of Clarketech for a supposedly 'hard sci-fi' story. That said, we liked it a lot, though as Kishoto said, it's very infodumpy. If you were writing a larger piece where you could spread the infodumps out more, it'd work, but as it stands, you're spending a lot of time explaining for a fairly small amount of 'stuff actually happening' which a shame because the battle scenes were actually pretty epic.
