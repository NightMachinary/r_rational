  Vacuum energy drive - what is it? How does it work? Why does it sometimes yield a boom a few orders of magnitude off the right end of the scale? Why hasn't that been deliberately weaponized? What does it cost?

The Vacuum-drive /has/ been weaponised. The Destructor bombs work by briefly initiating an uncontrolled release of vacuum energy, and are described as detonating with energies in the range of hundreds of thousands of gigatons. The release is so unstable and depends very sensitively on initial energy input and occurs on such small timescales that the uncertainty in blast yield ranges over orders of magnitude.

The drive and destructor bombs work by using explosive magnetic rams to compress a plasma down to grand unified theory energies, providing enough initial energy to overcome the potential barrier needed for some quantum vacuum field (the best guess by human scientists is the higgs field, which has an average value of 246 GeV) to tunnel to a lower energy state, releasing the difference as a burst of energy. The drive directs that energy using a magnetic bottle and taps some of the release to feed back into powering the magnetic rams, making the reaction self-sustaining. Destructor bombs use an antimatter explosion to briefly power a short-term release of the energy. The trick of converting the drive into a bomb works by pumping extra energy from antimatter power reserves, making the energy release grow exponentially.

  Monopole enrichment - what? How? I'm not a physicist, but this smells of "this one neat trick violates the laws of thermodynamics!". Reading between the lines, it sounds like the ships work by converting vacuum energy and waste heat from all the other systems into hot dark matter somehow and using it as a propellant, maybe? It's very confusing to me. I'm also confused as to why there's a squishy biological person in those ships at all - to document it, to experience it? But then, the story suggests that the Utilitaria is running so close to capacity that human minds can detect gaps in thinking. That's suspicious.

There's actually two systems at work here - 'monopole enrichment' is a way of making materials stronger than conventional covalent or metallic bombs allow for. The strongest useful substance made out of baryonic matter is hyperdiamond - a lattice of Carbyne chains and graphene that's harder than diamond and has a higher tensile strength than graphene. For a ship that has a drive power of petawatts and needs to absorb megaton nuclear explosions that's not good enough. Monopoles are a byproduct of the vacuum reaction - they are a side effect of the high energy Grand-unified environment, mass a few *10^{18} GeV and come in north or south varieties. With immense difficulty the Utilitaria can produce a trickle of monopoles, trap them and cool them until they condense into lattices. These lattices can then be used to buttress ordinary material, giving it heat capacities, boiling points and tensile strengths far above what should be possible.

Exchange systems are the least worked out aspect of this whole thing, but you're more or less right about converting waste heat into hot dark matter. It's another application of different quantum vacuum states - at high energies (not high compared to GUT, but similar to what can be attained at CERN), the bosons that carry the weak force increase their range to the extent that the weak force acts as if it is much stronger than we are used to. The exchange matrix is a monopole construct with weird high energy plasma inside - the charged particles from the ship's waste heat management systems and the exhaust beam from the reactor enter the matrix and start to rapidly radiate their energy away, not as high-energy photons but as high energy WIMPS and neutrinos. Momentum is conserved, so the ship is pushed along just the same. This makes all but a tiny fraction of the ship's radiant heat and exhaust emissions non-interacting except within the tiny area of the exchange matrix.

The Utilitaria is a superintelligence that can do almost anything for humans better than humans can. But the A-spheres were built by humans for humans using Utilitaria technology. The pilot in the story is augmented to the extent that his perception works a lot faster than ours, but the Utilitaria is running flat out trying to micromanage the evacuation of about a hundred billion people simultaneously.

Finally its worth pointing out the frameshift engine is an alcubierre drive, but it only works at STL speeds.

This is all speculative, of course. I don't know if any of this will ever actually be possible - I'm currently midway through a physics degree and I can be fairly sure there's no gross violation of the laws of thermodynamics or any other conservation law, but I'd like to be corrected on that now rather than later if anyone can.
