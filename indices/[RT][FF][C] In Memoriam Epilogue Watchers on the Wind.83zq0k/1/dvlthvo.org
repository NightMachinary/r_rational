I was really excited to see Othinus... with the way some of the odder/zanier elements of canon had been downplayed or removed (Maika going to maid school or Imagine Breaker being labeled level 0 by academy city or Imagine Breaker having ambiguous or changing limits or Kuroko being harassement levels of clingy), I was worried Othinus might be cut out in the name of world building. I am looking forward to seeing a rational take Othinus!
