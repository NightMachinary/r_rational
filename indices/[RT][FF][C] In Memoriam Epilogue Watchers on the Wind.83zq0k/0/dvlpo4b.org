Hey, all; I recently discovered this sub and noticed that my story had been posted here (a couple times in fact!), so I figured I'd let you all know that it's now complete. I wouldn't have posted it here, or tagged it as "rational" or "rationalist" myself--I don't really consider myself part of the rationalist community per se--but since it was posted with that tag last time, hey, who am I to disagree? Please enjoy, and look forward to the sequel, /A Thousand Shattered Mirrors/, coming soon!
