Nope, in most situations the author has not showed us how Cat understands the stories, at best she comes to the understanding closer to culmination points, probably to take readers by surprise. But Black does, and it looks really impressive. I do love to see more characters openly showing their understanding on the matter, more story politics and manipulation. Unfortunately, it mostly reserved for rare moments...
