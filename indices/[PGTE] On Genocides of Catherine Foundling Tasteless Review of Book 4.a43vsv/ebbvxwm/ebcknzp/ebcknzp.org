And did Catherine come by her aptitude with stories honestly? Does she work on it ahead of time, does she practice, does she plan to set up advantageous narratives? No, she tries to win by mundane means first, by training a professional army, by setting up Masego with that scrying McGuffin and so on. Let's not pretend mundane (and magical) power means nothing in that world. Oh, there is a pretence she is paying attention to it, with archer remarking on how she constantly thinks in narrative terms and Catherine ruminating on narrative of her invasion from time to time, but it's ultimately inconsequential to her strategy. It's just that whatever she's at the end of her rope and her mundane abilities aren't enough due to her being shit at exploiting them, she /happens/ to know what the right thing to do and say to exploit the narrative is by natural talent.

It's set in an interesting enough universe, don't get me wrong, but Catherine is just a bumbling fool who happens to win by luck and author fiat vast majority of the time, which doesn't do my enjoyment any favours. Not to mention that her character arc amounts to endless whingeing about how she's not good/human enough any more with almost no actual development of character (yes, I remember that there is an excuse of winter-did-it for it, doesn't make the lack of development magically interesting).
