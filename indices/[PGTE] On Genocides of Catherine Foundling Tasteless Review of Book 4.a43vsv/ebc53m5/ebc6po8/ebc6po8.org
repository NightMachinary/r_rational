well... why do you keep up with it if you've found it boring since book 2?, I'll understand reading on a little bit and hoping it change but for that long you're either overly stubborn or way too optimistic.

I can agree with that some things are a bit samey, but personally i don't mind too much i expect competent writing not masterful one, and the aqua spiel is a bit old with "shes good, but i cant trust her" it's true but should be omitted at this point.

your complaint is in general good, it's mainly about opinion and everyone have a right to one of those, so feel free to think that it's boring, everyone's taste differ and that is great!

the OP however state many things as facts rather then opinions, and many of those things makes me wonder if he've even read the novel or just glanced at it just reading the fights since he don't seem to understand the universe at all since many of his complaints are addressed in universe, like why she don't absorb all the night, "oh free experiences from other people will totally come with no mental repercussions at all......" not to mention it feels very much like a trap, akin to drugs.

so if you're gonna write a a4 of rants about why you hate something you better make sure it's correct and twist and turn it so your arguments for it holds water now his post grate my nerves.
