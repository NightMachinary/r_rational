Most rational people have already countered this... "rant", but I'll try to bring some in-story explanations for things where others haven't.

  There is no good reason for Catherine to have remained utterly ignorant of magic for all this time.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/02/court-i/][You]] [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/court-ii/][missed]] [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/07/02/court-iii/][these]] it seems.

Also, time is a thing you know. At the end of Book 3, she was a newly crowned Queen of a country which just had its second biggest city turned into Walking Dead. Economic and military problems exist, refugees need to be rehabilitated, decisions need to be made, dependance on Malicia should be reduced before ultimately being stamped out, a war machine must be started, heroic incursions must be stopped, armies must be recruited, trained, and fitted for - oh it's the start of Book 4 already.

  She had a small army of borderline fanatical folowers at her disposal. One call for volunteers to accept titles would have given her hundrends if not thousands of willing title holders, boosting her alienation resistance levels up to what she had after absorbing her first few sigils.

Making her just a "monster on the Callowan throne" that must be eliminated at all cost, destroying pretty much ANY chance of negotiation (which are growing slim already, even with the little Winter she's used), ensuring that two of the /OLDEST HEROES ON THE CONTINENT/ have a narrative advantage by fighting with a monster and not having the whole "invading a sovereign nation" devil on their back.

Bonus: Might allow Winter to spread roots in creation, specifically Callow, turning it into a wasteland, thus fucking up her own country AND Praes. And if you had paid just a little bit of attention to the story, Cat knows this and has mentioned it multiple times in-story.

Best example.

/“Ah, but do you rule it as Sovereign of Moonless Nights?” she said. “Hardly. Even the Wild Hunt are merely in your service, not true vassals. You bound neither the Woe nor the realm to your mantle.”/

/“Making Arcadia but worse out of my home isn't exactly in the works, yes,” I flatly replied./

/“And so you have not grown roots,” Diabolist said. “An apotheosis incomplete, so to speak. Did you not wonder why the Grey Pilgrim and his ilk are so desperate to remove you from the throne?”/

/“I'm a villain ruling Callow,” I said. “I don't believe we need to revisit the whole Calernian balance of power argument, Gods know I'm tired of hearing about it.”/

/“The Carrion Lord ruled it for decades,” Akua said. “And, to be frank, the legitimacy of your rule is only marginally better.”/

/“Roots,” I said. “That's what you're implying. The Peregrine worries about me growing roots in Callow.”/

/“It is one thing to slay a villainous queen of Callow,” Diabolist said. “Quite another to seek the destruction of the immortal Black Queen, the wintry personification of centuries of her people's grudges. The first is a threat. The second is another Dead King, one whose armies can march through the realm of the fae.”/

/“He knows,” I said, then hesitated. “Or at least suspects that I intend to abdicate.”/

/“And so you were handled with gloves,” Akua said. “Deals and stories, marching armies instead of a Choir unleashed. You ascribe this to the man being reasonable, but he is a hero. If that decision was made, it was made because he feared that cornering you would see you tumbling through the threshold of apotheosis complete.”/ - [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/11/16/chapter-72-outflow/][B4C72]]

  Catherine. Remind me, for how long did you discuss your goals with Malicia once you became queen of Callow? Did you, mayhaps, attempt to settle on a good old-fashioned compromise? Callow gets independence, Praes gets food, with terms enforced by oaths? Or did you decide that virtue signaling about how terrible Malicia was for funding Liesse was more important than lives of your own subjects?
#+end_quote

/"I had my plan. It'd taken me months and more people brought in to put it together than I was truly comfortable with, but I had the the skeleton of the Liesse Accords on parchment. Malicia, I knew, never would agree. That meant Malicia had to go, sooner or later."/ - [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/04/23/chapter-5-interests/][B4C5]]

Also this -

/"Asked," I repeated in a murmur./

/Hypocrite to end, was I? Demanding what I would not offer. Was compromise on my own terms even compromise at all, or just victory by another name? For all I'd said tonight, one thing had not changed: I had not learned to lose./

/"Hear me, Sve Noc," I said. "Whatever claim I yet hold to Winter, I pass to you. My crown of Moonless Night, I lay at your feet. I stand before you without power or right to my name, mortal at your mercy."/

/'Help me,' I asked, begged, prayed. 'Please.'"/ - [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/12/07/chapter-81-only-to-the-just/][B4C81]]

How do you not get this?

The entire point of this dumpster fire seems to be that you want to read a completely different story instead of this one, one where the protagonist is a rational munchkin of any and all powers that (s)he gets, and isn't really constrained by shackles like narrative or morality.

Maybe... read a different story? There are plenty of power fantasies out there that focus on munchkining. You would probably enjoy those a lot more instead of wasting your time hoping every story you read fits one archetype.
