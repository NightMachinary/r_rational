Black's method is /not enough/. It is a way to prevent defeat, not a way to achieve victory and as we see with the loss of Captain and capture of Black, now that the true powers of the continent have taken notice of him it has stopped working entirely.

Turning herself into a lesser version of Black would accomplish nothing, even he didn't want that.

You are also dramatically oversimplifying Cat's narrative manipulations while failing to mention the many times it has been invaluable for her.
