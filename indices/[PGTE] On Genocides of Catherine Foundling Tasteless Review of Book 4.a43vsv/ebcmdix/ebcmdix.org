Long form of my grievances with the story:

The entire point of Black's philosophy is that the way to win as a villain is avoid stories to minimise their narrative impact and just rely on pragmatism and rationality instead of stories. This method WORKING is proven time and time again early on in the story, for example with Cat shooting that one hero with a crossbow bolt in the throat in book 2.

Moreover, early on, the story says multiple times that being a Villain and trying to lean into Hero tropes is signing your own death warrant as the Gods Below won't stand for it. For example, during the battle of Marchford, Cat tries to act like a Hero, ignoring Masego's warnings that that is a bad idea, and ends up horrifically mangling her soul by letting a demon inside it.

And both of those things just end up being thrown aside later on, seemingly simply forgotten by the author. Catherine doesn't act rationally, she constantly leans into Hero stories, and then despite being a Villain she still constantly ends up being rewarded by the universe and wins, which makes no sense.

That is just extremely aggravating and shows the author has a complete disregard for internal consistency in the work.
