And that's totally the way I expect this to go, but my problem with that plot's direction is that it flies completely counter to the picture that we have of Drow society. Drow don't have a government, they don't have trust, and they solve their problems with violence. That does not equal mass exodus, that does not even equal retreat.

If there's an easy answer, if Winterized Sve Noc can just power through those fundamental problems with Drow society, and spirit them away to Arcadia to live in relative peace, then my response is: Why isn't that level of power sufficient to deal with the Dwarves directly?
