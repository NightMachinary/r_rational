The main focus of the above rant appears to be :its the stuff of stories: . Yes, that has been lampshaded all through the story. The world is -canonically- based on tropes! All of the characters who are trying to manipulate events in their own favour /explicitly/ plan around making the trope they desire the one which occurs. Eg: cat takes the side of "good" against the winter king to get the upper narrative hand.
