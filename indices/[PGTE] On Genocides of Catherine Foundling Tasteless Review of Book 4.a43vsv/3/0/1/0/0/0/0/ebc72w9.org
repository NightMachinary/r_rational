I agree on that she's a realistic character who sometimes makes rational choices. I don't think she's rational herself, though, because she makes too many irrational choices that were too important. She doesn't bail herself out of her terrible decision-making with careful planning and rational thinking, usually. She puts herself instead into high conflict, risky, reckless situations that she can fight her way out of.
