Your final sentence is kind of indicative of your whole argument. Spoiler tags aren't hard, just bracket a paragraph with these >!!< .

Taylor is rational with in reasonable expectation, she makes the rational choices that someone in her situation, with her personality would make, her self delusion may not be perfectly rational thinking on her part, but it is rational that such a conflicted character would need to delude themselves in order to commit the acts they felt were necessary. The actions of Taylor cannot be divorced from her character, so she can only be as rational as her character permits, and I think she does a pretty decent job by that standard, using rational thinking to get out of hugely dangerous situations, and to win against impossible odds.
