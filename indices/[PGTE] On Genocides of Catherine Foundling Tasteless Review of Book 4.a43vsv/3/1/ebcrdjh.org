  It's often fun how PTGE recognizes these tropes [...] but at the end of the day if you find these tropes unsatisfying then a fair bit of PTGE is going to be irksome

Yeah, that's my main problem with the story.

The way I see it, PGtE emphasizes concepts like "character gets instantaneous powerup at the last minute for a boss fight and then never uses it again" because they're well-known story conventions, but the story never seems to quite realize that they're /bad/ story conventions, that people either dislike or tolerate.

I mean, I guess you can say the story isn't for me, and I should just read something else instead of complaining... but I feel that's a little unfair. The serial is being advertised on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. The story itself constantly makes fun of "heroes" for doing things pretty close to Cat's own behavior, like expecting to automatically win against more experienced enemies because their cause is righteous. The summary says "Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she has a plan", no "Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she's going to win because she deserves to (but she'll keep complaining about how the universe never lets her catch a break)".

And, really, the potential's there. Book 4 starts with Catherine building an administration, raising an army, accumulating trump cards, planning for future encounters, trying to learn from her past mistakes, and she even sounds like she's reaching some level of self-actualization. It just goes completely out the window once the Battle of the Camps is over.
