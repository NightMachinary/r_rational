Pretty much, yes. It's established quite a few times that planning is necessary and relying on story tropes, wherever hero or villain, will get you killed. Blacks entire strategy consists of minimising story-reliant factors whenever possible and maximising effect of mundane planning, quality and numbers. There was that Prince that got shot in the neck because he thought that challenging a villain to single combat was a good idea. But Catherine apparently doesn't think that planning around her own power is even necessary.
