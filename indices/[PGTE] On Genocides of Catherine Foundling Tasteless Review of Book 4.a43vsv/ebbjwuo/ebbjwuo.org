Um, PGTE has never been very good or very rational? The very premise of narrative potency is hard to write into a good story, let alone a good rational one. The idea that the law of narrative is the only unbroken law, as another comment here put it, is just a diversion to distract you from the lack of style and to mask the qualities this shares with a wuxia power trip like Child of Light.

A small aside-i don't think that any stories where you get the sense the player has an 'Inventory' are going to be more than rational adjacent. I feel like rational fics are supposed to have fully realised characters with their own thoughts, desires, and goals, as opposed to having PC'S and NPC'S that are getting minmaxed so they can 'win.'

Also, I only read the first two or three books of a PGTE, but I am not under the impression that Catherine ever commits to rational thought. I'm not sure that she makes a habit of questioning what she knows and how she knows it, she doesn't go through rational education with her friends.

I know this fic is popular, and I don't know a lot about Reddit and subreddit guidelines, but I'm still not convinced this is the right place for that fic to hang out.
