I've seen this opinion that the Drow staying where they are and only sometimes harrassing people is non-rational when it's been established in story why they have been forced to stay in the everdark. I'm not sure if it's been explicitly stated but the narrative has been hammering home on the fact that the Drow can't leave the everdark because of the night. They can survive outside of the night which is why they made raids, but due to the curse of Sve Noc and the night they can not survive up there.

They can't make massive raids on the surface because there is no night there. The Dead King is held in his kingdom unless someone offers him a way out, it's the same thing with the Drow. They can't leave the everdark because they are shackled there by the curse of immortality that Sve Noc brought them. Why is it so hard to imagine that the Drow are held in the night due to the curse that Sve Noc brought them when the Dead King can be withheld due to the shackles of his immortality in the exact same way. The only difference is that the Dead King was smart about it and was successful in his ascension.
