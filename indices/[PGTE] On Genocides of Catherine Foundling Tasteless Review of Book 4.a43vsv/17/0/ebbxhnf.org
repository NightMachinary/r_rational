You are confusing rational in our world with rational in her world, rationality isn't some universal constant that is unchanging and imubtable, learning about stories and their tropes and how those stories affect other named and herself /is/ the rational part of PGTE. Just because that isn't a rational thing to do in our world, or any other story, doesn't mean it isn't rational, and just being rational doesn't mean you are correct, just that you are using reason to parse your problems and decided on actions.

The idea that PGTE has anything to do with it or in common with 'Child of light' border on being nonsensical, as child of light is one of the worst pieces of fiction I have ever read, PGTE has better prose, better characters (by a landslide), better theme (CoL doesn't have themes at all, besides maybe 'BE A GOOD GUY!), and better world building (as the main character doesn't immediately get a teleportation spell and still walk everywhere).
