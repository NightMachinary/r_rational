Masaego wouldn't though, and you are venturing into the realm of contrivance for rationalities sake, in the end PGTE is still a story and has to be an enjoyable one, if Cat could learn everything she does in non-threatening and easy ways, the story would be boring as hell, as she would just be horribly over powered.

Cat /does/ work out how to use her mantle to great effect with Masaego, that's what absolute positioning is, you know, the ability to drop a 100 tons of water and ice on her enemies from the comfort of her home?
