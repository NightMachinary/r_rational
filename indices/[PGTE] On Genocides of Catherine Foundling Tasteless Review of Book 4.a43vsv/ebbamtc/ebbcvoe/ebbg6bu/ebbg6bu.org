She frequently takes bigger risks in combat, when she has few other, or at least better, options that she would not take otherwise. This is certainly not her first instance of leaning into risks in combat.

In addition, a great deal of her increasingly large uses of power were enabled by the addition of lots of expendables to offload alienation unto. Your premise that she could have just as well used Callowans ignore the story problems of doing so. By using her own people as expendables to further empower herself, she'd be leaning into the sorts of stories of Empresses past, and heading down a path that will inevitably lead to failure.

Giving Akua any leash at all comes with dangers. So far, she's been gradually accepting more and more of that danger in return for the utility granted. This is already pretty risky, but it's not as if better options exist. It's also been explicitly stated that going to full on mindrape levels with Akua would initiate the kind of monster-abuse story that results in the monster breaking its chain and destroying her.

So in both cases, we have remarkably good reasons in terms of story/name lore why doing as you suggest would be straight up suicide.
