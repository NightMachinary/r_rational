  Who said anything about trust? Rip knowledge out of her mind, you don't need consent. She started using her for negotiations with Procer pretty early, no reason to be coy about it.

Yeah, the story really should have defined the limitations on that power.

I can kind of imagine explanations for why it's totally safe to extract an entire language from Akua's mind, but extracting her strategic, arcane, diplomatic and historical acumen from it isn't and Cat instead has to give Akua increasing amounts of independence and leverage (like, maybe she could only extract the language knowledge because it was recently learned, or maybe Akua's political skills are deeply tied to her philosophical outlook and you can't have one without the other), but it's still pretty odd that nobody seems to even consider it.

I mean, "extract every useful skill from Akua's soul, while she feels it happening, without her consent, and leave only a sentient husk behind that's just smart enough to understand how much it lost" is a pretty straightforward way to fulfill Catherine's promises to Akua and Vivienne; everyone who hears of it would spread the story of /Akua's Folly, and the Woe that came from it/.

(also, that's personal bias, but I really wish the story would outgrow Akua already; my opinion of her matches Assassin-disguised-as-Black's)
