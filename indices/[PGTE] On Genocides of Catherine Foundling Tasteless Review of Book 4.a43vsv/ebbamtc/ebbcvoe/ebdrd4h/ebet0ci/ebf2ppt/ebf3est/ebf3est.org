  Then why is it safe to extract a language from her mind?
#+end_quote

Because it is a single instance, rather then being repeated. Because it is information freshly learned, not something foundational to Akua's identity. Because it is only a language, not something as complicated as magic or intimate as her innermost thoughts.

Notice Cat didn't hesitate to make use of William's sword in the battle where she claimed it, but made sure to shatter it afterwards. There is a difference between making use of something before moving on and trying to keep using it regularly, becoming reliant on it in the process.

  And how is it safe to use that knowledge and experience by having Akua manage her own drow army?

  Especially since "get the chained monster to rebel against her master" is how Cat defeated Akua in the first place.

It absolutely isn't. Using Akua is a gamble, but it is one she has prepared contingencies and countermeasures for, unlike becoming the Villainous Mind Leech.
