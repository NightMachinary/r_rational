I try to hold back from criticizing PGTE when I can, because it's clear a lot of people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] enjoy it. But when a criticism thread comes along, I consider it enough of an excuse to point out that in my opinion, it's not only not particularly rational, it's not that good. As it's progressed, its flaws have only grown while its strengths wither. I don't even care to debate over whether Cat's actions/character/narrative arcs make sense anymore because I flat-out don't care about them. The story is boring. I've been bored since book 2. The demon fights were boring. Battling fairies was boring. Akua's rebellion was boring. The crusade was almost not boring, but got boring. Keter was nonsensical and boring. The underdark is somehow the most boring arc yet.

Chapter after chapter after chapter of slogging through dozens of samey, meaningless action sequences glued together with chapters that can sometimes be ONE SINGLE CONVERSATION in which the same point is reiterated over and over, the same growth points rehashed.

And the banter - I know I've used the word "boring" a lot this post, so I'll just say it feels like a crutch EE leans on far too heavily, to the point where it feels awfully -- not gonna say it -- /repetitive/, to the point where by trying to differentiate characters through their different banters, he ends up flanderizing them because the percentage of their dialogue/thoughts that /is/ banter is turned up far too high.

Of course, the plot is a mess, the characters inconsistent, and the world fundamentally broken, to the point that the entire story is basically running on Rule of Cool. Which is great, until the cool parts stop being cool and start being tedious.
