You are viewing the story from such a narrow perspective as to miss the whole point.

From my perspective PGTE is a story about exploring the significance of stories, by making stories the /most significant/ thing in existence, Cat is the lense that we view this world through for the most part, and she is a fucking fantastic one because she /understands/. Cat understands the meta level at which her world operates, and gives us the perfect viewpoint from which to watch this world unfold, she gives us a biased view of it, but that is also the point, as it gives us baseline assumptions and expectations that can be subverted later on.

PGTE could be renamed 'A practical guide to Stories' and still have a completely accurate title, this is a story about a character that has to breakdown stories to understand them and then build them up in her own way in order to win, thus teaching us of the components of the story we are reading and still surprising us with the direction that Cat takes because she (and of course EE) understands the story much better than we do.

PGTE is so much more than the story of a 16 year-old girl trying to save her country, it is a story about stories, of hero's and villains and how they interact, of protagonists and antagonists and their place in the narrative and the world, of morality and it's ability to be bent to fit a story and how in a world and society so vastly different from our own, we should not expect morality to be viewed and judged in the same way as we do.

PGTE is one of those stories that I consider near perfect, and calling it bad because the MC isn't Munchkining her powers into oblivion is missing the point entirely.
