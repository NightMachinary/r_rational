The one thing this "review" reminds me of above all else is when Wildbow criticized the rational community as having people who will get outraged that your characters aren't computers dedicated solely to maximizing combat functionality.

#+begin_quote
  In every single confrontation she achieves her most important goal perfectly, and only "loses" in ones that are third or lower in her preference ranking.
#+end_quote

Since when? She routinely fails at her objective and settles for a hasty pyrrhic victory through self mutilation.

#+begin_quote
  She keeps being granted enormous advantages
#+end_quote

Not really.

#+begin_quote
  (Winter mantle, being friends with dead king, having access to thousands of drow), barely uses any of them
#+end_quote

Minter Mantle? Now lost, was never a good thing.

Friends with the Dead King? This is an absolutely laughable interpretation. The Hidden Horror does not have /friends/. He treated her relatively well when she showed up in his kingdom. That isn't friendship, it is /manners/. Most importantly, she failed to secure an alliance.

A drow army was what she went to the Everdark to /get/. What would be the point if she used it up in the attempt to claim it? If she recruits half the drow, then sends them into a deathmatch with the other half she accomplishes exactly nothing. Of course she tries to spare the drow.

#+begin_quote
  proceeds to not lose her next confrontation anyways.
#+end_quote

She got her ass kiicked /pretty goddamn hard/. Just like at Second Liesse.

#+begin_quote
  To make things worse, her character is stuck on the same bloody arc for the past two books (get into fight, get hurt, angst about not being human anymore, reject humanity for the last time pinkie promise, get powerup) with no end in sight.
#+end_quote

Have you even paid attention to the last few chapters? Cat broke that pattern and rejected power at the cost of mortality. She literally outright said

#+begin_quote
  “Mortal,” I whispered. “To the end, whatever that may be.”
#+end_quote

That's pretty unambigious.

#+begin_quote
  Book started out pretty well too. Catherine was getting to kill some heroes, her being stronger than before was clearly demonstrated, it was implied she was collecting dead heroes for some sort of doomsday plan - perhaps raising them as undead, Dead King style.
#+end_quote

No, she was turning them into single use artifacts. She literally says that the hero's will make good artifacts while deep in alienation. Trying to be Dead King Jr would backfire pretty hard. She is just borrowing an aspect here and there.

#+begin_quote
  Cat was using her powers creatively enough, which all culminated with the Battle of the Camps where Cat dropped a lake onto an army. In a move seemingly stronger than what any fey below the level of Kings and Queens have pulled in the last book, it was clearly demonstrated that Cat did, in fact, have a huge reservoir of power to tap into, even if you could guess she wasn't using it to the full capacity (like Ubua).
#+end_quote

After extensive planning and co-ordination with Heirophant, and even then the backlash nearly killed them.

#+begin_quote
  First warning bell actually went off a little before the party arrived in Keter, when Catherine was arbitrarily reshaping Ubua's body image. All that it took for her to learn the trick was for someone else to suggest the possibility, and that was that. It already suggested a whole new dimension of possible tactical uses of Winter - could Catherine make her arms longer mid-swing, or just make herself 3 feet taller at all times for extra reach? Could she change the appearance of other fey, and make them look like mortals for infiltration purposes? But that was all relatively minor, up until the point where Catherine up and turned to mist.

  Wait, wait, hold the fuck up. Mist? She can just do that?

  Well, okay. Did it at least take something time or resource intensive, like jacking into a bigger well of power, having her soul hacked to improve her finesse with magic, stealing memories of a lifetime of wielding magic from a mage, or something similarily difficult?

  No, not really. She just, like, tries it. It works immediately, no training or experimentation necessary. In the middle of combat, no less, where she would be maximaly distracted, so it can't take all that much focus and concentration either.

  And yet she did not have this trick for the crusader fight, where it would have been really useful. Meaning that neither she, nor any of her close friends, so much as suggested she try anything of the sort in the months between Liesse and crusader army arriving. Juniper "First thing I ask when I find out you are half fey is how well your winter powers can help preserve our supply train" Hellhound did not suggest Cat experiment with possibly the strongest weapon their side has to see where it's limits are. Masego did not try to poke at the limitations of her body. Cat herself didn't try increasing her height by sheer accident during one of her angsty rants about how short she is.

  Cat had ability to arbitrarily reshape her form(she also grows wings later) and function at any time for months, but just was too blindingly stupid to realise it.
#+end_quote

Cat's new situation is literally completely unprecedented. Neither it nor anything like it has ever happened before. It taking some time before she discovers and grows comfortable with her new capabilities is to be expected.

Cat's ability to change her form required her /abandoning her image of herself/. She literally had a mental block where she had to be tormented into giving up more of her humanity before she could access this power.

Most importantly, the Keter arc was the Dead King, the great Apotheosis success story, putting Cat through her paces to both discover her capabilities and explore her resourcefulness. It was this books version of a training sequence.

#+begin_quote
  Fine, fine. At least she realises this now. Does she learn the general lesson of "Your power is not fully explored, and you desperately need extra functionality because your kingdom is on fire"?
#+end_quote

All the power in the world won't save Callow. Literal gods are trying to have it destroyed, there is no minmaxing your way out of that.

#+begin_quote
  Nope. She needs to go to the drow and again start trying things mid combat with agonising slowness to figure anything new out. Instead of jumping from "I can make wings" to "I wonder what are the limits of modifying the topology of my body" she just... stops at wings and regrowing limbs. Can she turn herself into a dust speck, while preserving speed and power (She constantly mentions how those don't rely on muscles), and just shoot herself through the heads of enemies, impossible to hit or hurt? Can she grow 20 tentacles 40 meters long and smash people from far away instead of relying on measly two hands and a sharp piece of iron? If her body is just an avatar for Winter power, can she make a second one, hand it to a minion, and effectively "teleport" across the battlefield by shifting her awareness from one body to another? Hell, can she use multiple bodies at once? Who the hell knows. Certainly not Catherine.
#+end_quote

Huh, it's almost like fundamentally altering your form and identity isn't something to be casually done on a whim but at a measured pace when required by necessity.

#+begin_quote
  With how badly she is using her power, it's honestly a wonder she didn't get killed by a passing kitten.
#+end_quote

Can someone pass me an eyeroll emoji?

#+begin_quote
  This is all just body manipulation. Now let's talk Gates. Back during Battle of The Camps, Catherine opens one (1) gate above the army, with special help from Masego in order to make it allign with the lake. It is heavily implied this is incredibly difficult to achieve, takes a minute to do and flat out impossible without an assisting mage. Then, in the recent fight this happens:

  #+begin_quote
    The first gate opened in front of the Night construct, and it slowed by a fraction as it prepared to leap over it. That was enough. Another two, caging it in a triangle. Another two, above and below. All of them leading to the bottom of the Fields of Wend, that depthless glacier lake at the very heart of Winter.
  #+end_quote

  I count five gates, simultaneously, to the same lake, opened in less time than what it would have took for the supernaturally fast panther drow to get out of dodge. With zero power growth in between. This leaves two possibilities:

  Catherine had the power to do it back then, but it would have dunked her into alienation like a cookie into milk, and trick with Masego was meant to prevent that. Now she can dump alienation onto drow, and thus can pull this off.

  Catherine, in her sheer blinding stupidity, honestly believed it was supposed to be "hard" to do this, because she still thought she was a mortal and not a damn Queen of Winter. Sadly, this alligns far too well with her character "growth" for me to dismiss this.

  That's number and speed of Gates. In another chapter she opens a Gate through a stone column, implying Gates can cut things. Would sure have been nice to know this during the battle of the camps, where you could have opened the big gate five meters underground beneath the enemy army, making it much harder to target by enemies, leaving them less time to react, and leaving behind much more mud and water (water under enough pressure to squish drow into mush would have broken through mere five meters of earth easily, leaving behind a five meter deep lake of mud, definitely drowning anyone that was left there).
#+end_quote

Huh, it's almost like Cat got better at something the more she did it. Almost like the pace of her experimentation pays off. No, that can't be right.

Also, something you seem to miss is that she had Akua as accompanying mage standing in for Masego.

More to follow
