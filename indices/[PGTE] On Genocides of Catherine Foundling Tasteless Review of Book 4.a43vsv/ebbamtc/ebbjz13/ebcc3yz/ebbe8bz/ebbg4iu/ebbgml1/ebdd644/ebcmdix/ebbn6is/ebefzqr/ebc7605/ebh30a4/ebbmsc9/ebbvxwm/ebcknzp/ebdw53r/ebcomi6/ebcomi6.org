She /absolutely/ thinks and plans ahead using narrative terms, the entire conflict with the faeries was won entirely through her planning how she was going to turn the story against them, she hasn't been as good at it of late as she has had a rather dominant and corrupting entity influencing her thoughts, but she is still very good at it, in both short and long term situations, she doesn't win everytime and she isn't infallible, if she did and was then the story would be boring.

Catherine's character has indeed progressed significantly throughout the narrative (someday I need to do a write up on my differentiation of character development and character progression), her learning her aptitude for stories is one of those serious progressions, she is certainly more proud as the series goes on and she isn't nearly as naive as she was in the begging, and that isn't even considering the most recent chapters, which have shown in /immense/ character growth on her part, now that she isn't held quite so stagnant by the mantle of winter.

The idea that Catherine is 'Whiney' is honestly odd to me, how often does she actually /whine/, not often, she is certainly an introspective character with a heavy conscience that dislikes some of the choices she has had to make, it's almost as if deep down she doesn't agree with a lot of those choices and she is having a harder time justfying them to herself, thus making her more introspective over time. Go read Savage Divinity if you want to see whiney, that Main character has the /woe is me/ track playing in his head every chapter.
