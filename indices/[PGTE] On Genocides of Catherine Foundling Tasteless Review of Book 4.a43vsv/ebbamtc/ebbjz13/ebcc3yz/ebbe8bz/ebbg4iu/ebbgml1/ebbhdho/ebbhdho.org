  What about other things planar travel can do? In yet another chapter, this happens:

  My Lord of Silent Steps moved with unnatural agility, waiting until the bone trident had struck out before... moving. The description failed to convey what had taken place, though. One moment it'd been standing in the way of the weapon, the next it'd been behind the Mighty and striking with its own glass staff. Afterimages followed a heartbeat later, revealing how it had moved and the whole affair reeked of Winter.

  It'd skimmed the edge of Arcadia, I realized with a start.

  Well what do you know, you don't even need proper gates if you try using the power properly.

Huh, it's almost like Ivah is a veteran with decades of experience shaping mystical power while Cat is a twenty year old scrabbling to play catch up.

  "But melmonella", I hear you say, "maybe she tried all the various tricks, but couldn't do any of them because she lacks education in magic and couldn't dump alienation onto a small army. With limitations like that, how can you blame her?"

  Well, a flat metal plate on a door can be pushed, and a handle on a door can be pulled, and limitations usually can be overcome. So let's see if there were any easy, obvious tricks Catherine could have done to overcome one or both of these drawbacks.

  Oh look, she can tear memories out of people, and uses that to learn Corpuscular from Ubua. She knew about this trick way back then too, as she used it during her assault on the Procer camp with the Wild hunt to sift through the memories of her soldier and locate the officer tent. And she had an incredibly talented disposable mage tied to her collar. Meaning she could have ripped all that knowledge out of Ubua's mind at any time. Ubua mentions that her experience with Diabolism lets her handle winter alienation better than Catherine, so Catherine's usable powerset would have flatly expanded.

I am honestly in awe that you managed to get this far into /A Practical guide to Evil/ and still think that in this setting routinely stealing people's knowledge and relying on it as your own will not ensure your horrific and unpleasant downfall. That is narrative bait of the highest order. Cat was trained not to rely on stolen magical /swords/ and you want her to constantly rely on taking stolen magical knowledge into her mind and soul?

/Have you paid literally no attention/?

#+begin_quote
  There is no good reason for Catherine to have remained utterly ignorant of magic for all this time. That ignorance lead to her underutilising her power during the battle of the camps, leading to thousands of her soldiers being utterly slaughtered.
#+end_quote

CXatherine taking the time to study magic before becoming Monarch of Winter would have been criminally irresponsible. Ones magic ability is inborn, it cannot be raised or decreased. One cannot "become" a mage. So, outside of this impossible to predict occurrence that has even the Dead King giddy with surprise there is absolutely no reason for Cat study magic.

Once she became Monarch of Winter she only had a few months, during which she had endless demands on her time.

#+begin_quote
  But what about alienation? Surely she couldn't have figured out a way to deal with that?

  Well, no, she totally could have. She had a small army of borderline fanatical folowers at her disposal. One call for volunteers to accept titles would have given her hundrends if not thousands of willing title holders, boosting her alienation resistance levels up to what she had after absorbing her first few sigils. Them being volunteers would have also neatly sidestepped any "villain forces people into magic slavery" storylines. Oh, and she'd get a fey analogue to the Watch out of the deal too, again boosting the power of her army by the time Battle of The Camps rolled around, and again preventing thousands of unnecesary casualties. Which would have been a good idea regardless of wherever or not alienation could be dumped on them, but I digress.
#+end_quote

Oh, all Catherine would have to do is sacrifice thousands of Callowan souls.

Pffft, who cares about silly things like characterisation and the actual story, she /could be more effective in combat!/

#+begin_quote
  But surely she didn't know that she could dump alienation onto others before she did it with Ubua by sheer accident?

  And that is why you experiment with all your new powers, instead of just assuming what they do in advance.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is /definitely/ a setting where randomly fucking around with unprecedented magic nobody understands will go well for you. Won't be a problem at allllllll.

#+begin_quote
  Granting a title to just several experimental subjects (not to mention a thousand volunteers)
#+end_quote

Would have allowed Above to intervene. It took going to a place consecrated to Below for millenia, where Above has no stake in the fight, for Cat to be willing to grant titles.

#+begin_quote
  would have allowed her( if she tore sorcery knowledge out of Ubua's mind, or, alternatively, Masego) to notice the dump of alienation onto other title holders as soon as she tried exerting herself, instead of waiting for Dead King and Ubua to metaphorically beat her on the head with the idea.
#+end_quote

Oh yes, when you have a loyal and loving follower who is an unparalleled asset and whose greatest passion is acquiring knowledge you should definitely start forcefully and torturously ripping knowledge out of their minds.

Also, Aragorn should have raped all the hobbits. The decrease in stress from sexual gratification would have made him more ready and capable for combat.

#+begin_quote
  Practically every personal trick she discovered in this book could have been researched before the Battle of The Camps rolled around.
#+end_quote

Every scientific discovery could have been figured out before it was. But, alas, figuring shit out is a lot harder without hindsight.

#+begin_quote
  Given that Catherine was making easy pickings of the heroes on display there, and that she was at least close enough to Saint in the power level to not immediately die, it's not unfeasible that she could have soloed the whole army herself if she was more powerful. You could even say that every single Callowan death in Battle of The Camps has been caused by Catherine deciding that using her powers effectively was for boring people.
#+end_quote

This literally goes against the entire foundation of the story. Trying to solo an army is one of the leading causes of death for Named. Saint couldn't manage it. Amadeus' predecessor was said to be an unstoppable juggernaut with horrific power.....and even he couldn't solo armies.

This is another point that leaves me honestly shaking my head and wondering if you have actually been paying attention while reading this story.

#+begin_quote
  I'd mention exploits you could do with vows, memory manipulation, domains or other things Catherine is apparently natively capable of, but this thing is already getting too long.
#+end_quote

Yeah Cat should have done all these things she didn't know how to do. She should also build a fighter jet. Someone is bound to figure one out eventually, that means Cat should be making use of one /now/.

#+begin_quote
  Let's see what we know up to the moment where Cat loses Winter.

  Catherine is an incompetent buffoon when it comes to magic in general and utilising her own power specifically.

  Sve Noc has centuries of knowledge and experience at using magic in general and Night specifically

  Sve Noc is blatantly more powerful than Catheirne in what she can throw around, if only because Catherine is jobbing so much.

  Sve Noc has such control over magic, that while inside Catherine's domain(where, presumably, Cat would be natively stronger) and losing a magic fight she manages to cut Catherine's soul up to the point where Cat loses all Winter.

  Now let's see what happens after Catherine becomes mortal again:

  Catherine gets a mortal body. Somehow. If her previous one was made entirely of Winter, where did this one come from? Was it conveniently stored somewhere, ready to pop out and catch Cat's soul in the event of catastrophic winter failure? Does Winter, if it fails, always reconstruct your mortal body just before exploding?

  Catherine gets into a "metaphorical" fight inside Sve Noc's soul (where, presumably, Sve Noc would be natively stronger) and wins. Let me repeat, Catherine, with little to no experience at magic, wins in a magic-based fight against an immortal millenia old goddess. After she lost a similar fight inside her own domain. And after losing whatever power she had availible to her. And with no gain of knowledge in the meantime.
#+end_quote

/This was not a magic fight/. It was a /metaphor/ fight. A /narrative/ struggle. It has more in common with a riddle then a magefight.

#+begin_quote
  Let me quote some things from that fight:

  #+begin_quote
    Smoke was inhaled by gaping maw, the maw escaped by a scuttling rat, the rat crushed by boot only for mud to stick at the bottom of the sole.
  #+end_quote

  How does Cat know that becoming a rat helps against maws? How is she holding her own against a bloody goddess? Where is she suddenly getting all this knowledge for how to wage a fight inside someone else's soul? I dunno, it just works, I guess. Whole fight is Hollywood hacking perosnified as far as our understanding how any of this funcitons, and Cat essentially wins because of plot armor. This is even worse than turning into mist, since here she doesn't even have Winter to guide her actions. Frankly, instead of reading that paragraph, you'd be better off just watching this.
#+end_quote

Yeah, given your repeated failure to notice the most basic thematic and factual rules of the setting as well as basically all characterisation it isn't a surprise you completely failed to understand this.

Put down the strategy guide and pick up a fairy tale book.
