Black felt so strongly that he could never integrate Callow into Praes that he created Catherine. His entire goal was stasis. Stall until he could shape a Callowan into someone who would bring Callow into the fold fully. And even then that stasis was only possible because the oppositions real champions, The Saint of Swords, the Grey Pilgrim and The Wandering Bard, were all occupied elsewhere. Now that they have turned their attention to the Calamities what has happened? The Calamaties have started dying off. First Captain, then Warlock. With him captured and ranger having fucked off that leaves only one Calamity active on the board.

Black had a unique approach which served him well, but there is a /reason/ he has been pondering how to live in the world Catherine is going to create, and not the other way around. Black can dodge stories. Cat can co-opt them.
