I second this in that, what drew me to the story initially, was Black's belief in the power of institutions and subversion of story logic.

Cat in the last arc has been leaning ever harder on being a powerful fighter, faerie queen, evil lady. It's very lone hero/named character.

The story of how Black turned Praes into professional clockwork brutality is a more interesting story than Cat's current arc.
