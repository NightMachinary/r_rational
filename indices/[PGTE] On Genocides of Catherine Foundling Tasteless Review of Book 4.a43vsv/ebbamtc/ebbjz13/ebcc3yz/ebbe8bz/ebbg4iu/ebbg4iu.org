Ugh.

​

UGH.

​

I don't even want to respond to this rant, because you're so tied up in your base assumptions that you can't even see the trees, much less the forest. But here goes:

​

Cat has told you, over and over and over, that she's not really /that/ special. That she has some fancy tricks that put her way over the heads of humans and even most Named, but that she is /absolutely nothing/ compared to the top-tier Named. That people like Sve Noc or the Dead King or even the Empress could squash her like a bug if they really wanted to in a straight up fight.

She has also told you, over and over and over, that she has one very, very large advantage. To such an extent that it's the primary thing that she relies on, even when winter frankly drove her completely nuts. (I hope she doesn't get it back, she's been much more fun these last chapters). Do you remember what it is? Hint: it's literally the primary motif of the entire story. I suspect you don't remember, going by the above rant about how she's not optimizing her powers to become a clever badass who maximizes her abilities and curb-stomps ancient inhuman deities.

​

/Cat understands stories and tropes on an intuitive level./ And she understands intuitively how those stories intersect and accentuate her own narrative arc.

​

That's it. That's all she really has going for her. And in a world that is /clearly/, 200% manipulated and shaped by the gods above and below to be a endless parade of overlapping stories, where the /only/ rule or physical law that isn't broken whenever narratively convenient is the law of narrative itself? That's the strongest power there is. So no, she hasn't acted like a crazy automaton who works out the cleverest ways she can use portals and body-shifting to kill things and take power, an unstoppable scourge of death and inhumanity. Because that is an incredibly dumb thing to do, because even though all Earth logic says she'd achieve her aims, what would actually happen is some plucky farmboy (who has an angel on one shoulder and a chip on the other from how her own actions ruined his life) would kill her in some improbable way, because he would be the underdog to her evil queen. So, she's explicitly not the evil queen, never the likely winner- she's the perpetual underdog, always striving, always sacrificing herself and pushing herself to defeat some awful threat even though, yes, some rational forethought should lead her to have better magic skills/weapons and maybe not almost die in literally every fight like it's a narrative trope or something. Because she /is/ rational, and knows that being the strongest and most deadly is very much not the way to win in this world.
