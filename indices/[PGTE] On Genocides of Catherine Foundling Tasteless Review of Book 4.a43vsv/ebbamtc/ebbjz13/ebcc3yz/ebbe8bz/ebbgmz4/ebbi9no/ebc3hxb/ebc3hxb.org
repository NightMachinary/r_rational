I would disagree in saying that Worm has a very rational protagonist.

WORM SPOILERS

Taylor constantly justifies her actions to herself after she does them (threatening hostages to do the bank job to infiltrate the Undersiders to get that information to Armsmaster to build up her rep as a hero, never mind that she's burning her bridges), or lies to herself about her own intentions because she's uncomfortable with intersection (thinking she's infiltrating the Undersiders to arrest them, not to have friends for the first time in years). There was even a 50% chance she would have changed her mind about Dinah to keep her the same way Coil did, even after all that trouble to kill him, because she's useful.

These aren't the developments of a rational character.

You could argue that she's rational in that she munchkinned her power a lot. She did do that, I guess.
