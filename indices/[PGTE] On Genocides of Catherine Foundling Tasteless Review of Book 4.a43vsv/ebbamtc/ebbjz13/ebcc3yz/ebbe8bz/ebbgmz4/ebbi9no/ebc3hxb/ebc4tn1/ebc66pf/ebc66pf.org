These are immoral things, but I'm arguing that she's being irrational when she lies to herself do as not to make herself uncomfortable, or when she convinces herself her morals are one way but she acts in another.

Also, she makes plenty of irrational decisions. When she dismisses the Wards as more high school drama without collecting more data, when she disregards Armsmaster's valid points because he's rude, when she compromises her morals not to do the rational thing, but to fit in with her friends, when she puts off giving Coil's relation to the Undersiders to the PRT for no reason, and a lot more. It's not rare, most important decisions are driven by her conscience and emotions.

I also think it's unreasonable to think that keeping Dinah would be rational. She would look wishy washy if she spent all that time since around Leviathan protesting Dinah's treatment, she would have made killing Coil pointless since he handled things better, aside from Dinah, and she would have known it would weigh down her conscience and decrease her performance. She can't turn off her emotions, so she had to work around them.
