You are confusing rational thinking and ethical thinking, Taylor is very rational, but her ethics and Morals are all over the place. The whole Dinah thing is the perfect example, Taylor had to actively resist doing the Rational thing, keeping Dinah, over the moral thing, taking her home. Taylor makes plenty of incredibly sketchy moral decisions, but she never makes any entirely irrational ones unless she is specifically bending to her conscience. This works to her advantage in some ways and against her in others, but in the end, the world just doesn't care.
