Worm has a very rational protagonist in a world that gives 0 shits about her, I would say that PGTE has a few rather rational individuals and a world that is /explicitly/ built against them.

Cat is rational in a very different way to Black. Black is all about following the path of most resistance in order to turn the story on its head, and just being so good at it that he is terrifying. Cat is almost instinctively aware of the story layer, and instead of banging her head on a brick wall like Black does, she tries to manipulate the story in the direction she chooses, and is very good at it.
