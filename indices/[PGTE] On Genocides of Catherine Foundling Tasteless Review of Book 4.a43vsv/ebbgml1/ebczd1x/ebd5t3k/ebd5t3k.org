#+begin_quote
  That doesnt mean that your interpretation as many others in the thread was extremaly uncharitable to OP
#+end_quote

OP is the one who set the tone. He labelled the protagonist stupid in literally his second sentence and only got harsher from there, all the while demonstrating that he was often simply not paying attention.

Frankly there is a /reason/ so many people here have been "uncharitable" to OP. And it's not like this is even the Guide's sub.

#+begin_quote
  The underlaying themes of the guide arent complicated and you ridicule his arguments without giving them a fair trial.
#+end_quote

I ridicule his arguments because they are ridiculous. He repeatedly fails to understand the basic rules of the setting.

#+begin_quote
  All in all even if you call Caths wins as pyrric victotories she had a pretty good run as far as it goes. Even if she mutilated her own soul in the process her achievments cannot be waved away. Maybe it was scraping by but still.
#+end_quote

Agreed.

#+begin_quote
  She had advantages from the start tho. Being the squire to black and having the help of malicia and calamities behind her. The training they gave her and the influence she got because of it. Especially so compared to your usual dime z dozen heroes she defeated prior to this arc.
#+end_quote

Oh absolutely, she had people in her own corner from the start, but that mentorship had a price and no shortage of strings attached. Like how Malicia leaned on Black to lean on Catherine to go easy on Akua.

It was also something she was forced to earn in blood. Even with Black's pick she had to kill off the other claimants to get the Name.

#+begin_quote
  Getting an apotheosis even which is kinda ridiciolous in power. You can shout that it was never any good all you want but it was pretty damn useful anyways. Creation is not arcadia and still has an element of physicality to it meaning that crops still grow at the normal speed and the narrative wont save the callowans from emptying their reserves. The same goes for armies. Didnt one of the princes get shot in the head because he was stupid?
#+end_quote

Apotheosis is fundamentally incompatible with Catherine's approach as taught by Black. The reason behind Black and Malicia's success is that in defiance of thousands of years of Praesi tradition they relegate power as being a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself. Winter changed the way Cat thought and acted, which inherently compromises her goals. Power she cannot use to accomplish her goals is worse then nothing. Just like that prince who pranced around as if power was all that mattered and got a crossbow bolt in the throat. If the power makes you too stupid to do anything with it, it was never worth having.

Yes, the power the mantle offered was instrumental in fighting off the Crusade. But it was also the main reason the Crusade wouldn't back down when she tried to negotiate.

In /A Practical Guide to Evil/ power itself is a trap, so being handed a great big blob of it is no blessing.

It's really telling that upon having the power of a god torn away from her Cat's reactions is /"Oh god, finally!"/

#+begin_quote
  She did finally break the patern by giving away winter, all of it. Why do you think its a pattern in the first place.
#+end_quote

Because it is one of the most frequently used storytelling techniques. If you listen to the podcast discussing Wildbow's works, they refer to it regularly. Good old three beat.

It's even directly referenced in universe withinin the context of Named interpersonal conflicts (the rule/pattern of 3).

#+begin_quote
  As OP said she had been on the same character point atleast 4 times which was pretty damn repetitive in the long run and rather annoying. Rejecting her humanity/recognizing that she no longer is human atleast 4 times. I can get excited only so many times for the same character arc all the time. It shouldnt have been repeated at all. By repeating it it cheapens the previous instances of it. We got it, she isnt human and has problems with that, what else??? In the end she rejected winter alltogether and thats why the pattern was broken and not because she gained real character growth.
#+end_quote

Op conflated several points. It is actually three occurrences, the final one of which was just subverted (after being stretched rather far).

#+begin_quote
  Cats situation isnt unprecedented, we just learned that there are other guys in the immortals club and sure, maybe she didnt know that at the time.
#+end_quote

No, Cat's situation is 100% completely unprecedented. Immortality has been claimed.

But never before has a mortal become fae.

Never before has a fae court been reduced to one individual.

Never before has there been a fae ruler in Creation.

When Cat became Sovereign of Moonless Nights she became the intersection of at least three completely unprecedented magical phenomena /as well as/ achieving apotheosis.

#+begin_quote
  Sure, its expected to take some times but although she governed a kingdom in decline she had made plans for heroes and had a bit of time to think over her new powers. It is a rather glaring flaw considering that thinking of the powers winter is capable of is rather simple.
#+end_quote

It /seems/ simple, in retrospect, once she has figured some things out. But things always do with hindsight. Gravity existed for the entirety of human civilisation. How long did it take for us to develop a true understanding of it?

#+begin_quote
  And sure, she had to abandon the image of herself with the mental block and all of that but whats after that. SHe had to do it 4 times. How many mental blocks are we talking about here. we are repeating that character arc with the mental block constantly and its tedious while reading this.
#+end_quote

No, she didn't. The earlier times she contemplated her humanity were unrelated to Winter.

Once she abandoned her view of her body she didn't need to do so again, she just needed time to mull it over and reasons to experiment and she did more with her body.

#+begin_quote
  The Dead King thingy was a test but it was just another desperate situation, it didnt have anything really that unique to it besides cath needing a sudden power up.
#+end_quote

It was a desperate situation deliberately designed by someone with a greater understanding of the apotheosis transition then anyone else in the world. It took the Dead King more then a decade to plan his apotheosis and millenia since to fully leverage it. Cat has had less then a year after having had no preparation.

#+begin_quote
  The OP straight up adresses this thing. Cat just doesnt learn and its frustrating when reading the story.
#+end_quote

No, she very clearly /does/ learn or people wouldn't be able to point to the things she learns and ask why she wasn't doing that from the start.

What people take issue with is that they feel Cat is learning too slowly, which I disagree with.

#+begin_quote
  Its not a diffifuclt realization to have that winter maybe could be capable of more things than just healing your body and growing wings. SHe could ask other mages etc.
#+end_quote

She /did/ realize that and she /did/ ask other mages. What do you think Absolute Positioning was? Cat and Masego spent months plotting out how to use her new nature offensively in battle and when the situation called on it they applied it to kill more then ten thousand enemy soldiers in five minutes.

But people /completely ignore that/ and insist Cat should also have spent all her time figuring out her other powers despite the demands on her time.

#+begin_quote
  And sure, maybe no amount of power will save callow and pilgrim is against her but there are more subtle ways of winning that fight, she could learn from the dead king and do something with all the heroes she has been hunting ? idk
#+end_quote

/She has/. When she kills a hero she turns their corpse into a single use artefact. She wasn't using them because she wanted to keep her trump cards and avoid escalation.

#+begin_quote
  Why cant she alter her form tho. After the whole "wow winter is capable of so much more than i thought thingy" and turning into mist and whatever its not hard to go, wait what if? Its not a great leap to make after learning that she isnt human.
#+end_quote

She began altering her form pretty regularly. It's hardly a surprise that becoming an entirely new kind of creature that has never existed before requires an adjustment period.

Babies are so damn lazy, look at how long it takes them to learn to walk. Don't they know they had legs the whole time?

#+begin_quote
  Cat is learning but its at such a slow and agonizing pace that its pretty meaningles. She has enormous innate capabilities in vows and domain things yet somehow its too hard or she didnt have the realization to do the things.
#+end_quote

There are /enormous/ drawbacks to using vow and domains, which the story doesn't hesitate to point out.

Notice how using her domain /lost Cat the fight/?

#+begin_quote
  In general although i do not agree with everything OP has said you make it as if the story has no flaws at all
#+end_quote

That wasn't the intention in the slightest. Book 4 has been very uneven and is in need of a critical eye.

#+begin_quote
  going on a damn crusade against OP over disagreement about the story.
#+end_quote

Just because criticism is needed, doesn't mean all criticism is automatically right. If my /response/ to OP (where I simply quote them and reply with a usually shorter counterpoint) is a crusade, then what is his post? A megacrusade?

It isn't that the story has no flaws. It's that OP couldn't find them with both hands and an aspect designed for it. Making complaints isn't enough, people need to find the /right/ complaints or it is just shit flinging.

"This ice cream doesn't taste like a ham sandwich" is not a valid complaint. And neither is what OP rants about.

Looks look at his hypocrisy rant again:

He complains about Cat coming off as hypocritical when literally seconds after his quote ends she is so struck by her own hypocrisy that she literally fucking kills herself. She even lists out all the examples of her hypocrisy. Then OP completely ignores all of these perfectly made examples and lists a bunch of stuff that is just wrong.

#+begin_quote
  The snarky tone also doesnt help.
#+end_quote

My tone is a direct response to OP's.

#+begin_quote
  It reeks of fanboism.
#+end_quote

What was that about tone?
