There are other mages who could educate her a bit in general. It is deeply unlikely that there are other mages in her entire kingdom that can tell her what Winter can do in full. If it's at the level of Masego/Akua/Warlock not fully understanding it, then random mage on the street is deeply unlikely to be helpful.

You're missing the point that it's a fundamental aspect of the story that Stories have power, and both of your suggestions run afoul of that, and are called out as doing so in the book itself.

Merely minimizing it as "just temporarily makes them think a bit differently" isn't addressing the problem with your ideas.

A Cat who treated Callowans as she did the Drow, volunteerism or not, would be following a story that is guaranteed to end in death. Even for the Drow, it was kinda pushing fate towards risking her own death, but there's a lot more latitude in behavior when dealing with evil opposition than stripping the free will from one's own followers. The latter is the sort of capital E evil that gets you on a fast track towards being Akua. Loads of power, right up until your heart gets ripped out.
