Keter is in a fundamentally different position from Callow. He took the long, ridiculous slow, safe path to get to where he is now. Just jumping ahead to the end of that with magical shortcuts is the approach favored by Praes. Historically, this has not worked out well.

It is theoretically possible that if Cat's position is secure, she could work out a system similar to the Dead King's(and would need to have in place the crusade-stopping ability he does first to forestall the inevitible). Her position is not that secure, ever. She's typically about one big mistake away from the house of cards collapsing.

However, Cat probably doesn't want that. Her goals are not to enslave Callow, really. She's also learned that increasing power comes with accepting chains. For all his power, the Dead King still is limited in unique ways that mortals are not. That was also true of Winter's power, and Night's....simply trying to accrue as much power as possible, even when done intelligently, carries huge costs.

It's a setup in which attempting to utilize vastly more non-physical power than you need to accomplish something is foolish. Doing so often attracts opposition and narrative weight.
