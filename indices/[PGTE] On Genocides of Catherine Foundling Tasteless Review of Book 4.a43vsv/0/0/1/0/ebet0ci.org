This is a series that went to great pains to tell the protagonist and audience that it is a terrible idea to use a magic sword stolen from the previous owner, but people need an explanation for why the protagonist is hesitant to rely on /knowledge and experiences/ forcefully stolen from someone else's mind?

Now there is an idea that might as well have "backfire" blazoned across it in glowing letters.
