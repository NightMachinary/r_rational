She has most of the rulership outsourced to competent people, like Hakram, Vivienne, Kendall, Juniper and etc already. All she actually does is make broad decisions about the direction of the country, which does not take 16 hours a day. She can perfectly well sit in a large hall experimenting with her powers and wait for people who need her input to come to her. Didn't she also stop sleeping? That's an extra 8 hours a day right there. Given that at the higher levels of her power it's ridiculously strong, and how little invested time is necessary to get those returns, you can argue that her prioritising (say) gathering an army over experimentation is a foolish choice.
