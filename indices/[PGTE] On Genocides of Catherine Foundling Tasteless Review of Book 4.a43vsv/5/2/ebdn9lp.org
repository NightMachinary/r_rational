What makes PGtE different from typical fantasy novels? The world built on the tropes, the characters made aware of the tropes, weaponizing the tropes. But what percentage of PGtE is actually about the characters doing nice trope-magic and what percentage is just good typical fantasy story? The author had stated in the text that "Catherine thinks with her fists" and obviously there are readers who got tired when she still thinks with her fists in Book 4.
