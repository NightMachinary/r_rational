And i agree with wildbow, atleast partially. This community tends to fixate on those things a lot. One of the more annoying things you can see are the many fix fics where some SI with meta knowledge gets thrown in as one of the main characters and solves everything going counter to the famous advice of "if you give frodo a lightsaber then you need to give sauron the deathstar". That doesnt mean that your interpretation as many others in the thread was extremaly uncharitable to OP. The underlaying themes of the guide arent complicated and you ridicule his arguments without giving them a fair trial.

All in all even if you call Caths wins as pyrric victotories she had a pretty good run as far as it goes. Even if she mutilated her own soul in the process her achievments cannot be waved away. Maybe it was scraping by but still. She had advantages from the start tho. Being the squire to black and having the help of malicia and calamities behind her. The training they gave her and the influence she got because of it. Especially so compared to your usual dime z dozen heroes she defeated prior to this arc. Getting an apotheosis even which is kinda ridiciolous in power. You can shout that it was never any good all you want but it was pretty damn useful anyways. Creation is not arcadia and still has an element of physicality to it meaning that crops still grow at the normal speed and the narrative wont save the callowans from emptying their reserves. The same goes for armies. Didnt one of the princes get shot in the head because he was stupid ?

She did finally break the patern by giving away winter, all of it. Why do you think its a pattern in the first place. As OP said she had been on the same character point atleast 4 times which was pretty damn repetitive in the long run and rather annoying. Rejecting her humanity/recognizing that she no longer is human atleast 4 times. I can get excited only so many times for the same character arc all the time. It shouldnt have been repeated at all. By repeating it it cheapens the previous instances of it. We got it, she isnt human and has problems with that, what else??? In the end she rejected winter alltogether and thats why the pattern was broken and not because she gained real character growth.

Cats situation isnt unprecedented, we just learned that there are other guys in the immortals club and sure, maybe she didnt know that at the time. Sure, its expected to take some times but although she governed a kingdom in decline she had made plans for heroes and had a bit of time to think over her new powers. It is a rather glaring flaw considering that thinking of the powers winter is capable of is rather simple. And sure, she had to abandon the image of herself with the mental block and all of that but whats after that. SHe had to do it 4 times. How many mental blocks are we talking about here. we are repeating that character arc with the mental block constantly and its tedious while reading this. The Dead King thingy was a test but it was just another desperate situation, it didnt have anything really that unique to it besides cath needing a sudden power up. The OP straight up adresses this thing. Cat just doesnt learn and its frustrating when reading the story. Its not a diffifuclt realization to have that winter maybe could be capable of more things than just healing your body and growing wings. SHe could ask other mages etc. And sure, maybe no amount of power will save callow and pilgrim is against her but there are more subtle ways of winning that fight, she could learn from the dead king and do something with all the heroes she has been hunting ? idk

Why cant she alter her form tho. After the whole "wow winter is capable of so much more than i thought thingy" and turning into mist and whatever its not hard to go, wait what if? Its not a great leap to make after learning that she isnt human.

Cat is learning but its at such a slow and agonizing pace that its pretty meaningles. She has enormous innate capabilities in vows and domain things yet somehow its too hard or she didnt have the realization to do the things.

In general although i do not agree with everything OP has said you make it as if the story has no flaws at all, going on a damn crusade against OP over disagreement about the story. The snarky tone also doesnt help. It reeks of fanboism.
