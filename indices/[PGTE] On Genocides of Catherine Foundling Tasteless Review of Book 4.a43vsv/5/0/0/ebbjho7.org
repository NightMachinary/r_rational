  What were Cat's strategic objectives in Battle of The Camps? Get crusaders out of Callow, get Callow a breather for a while, ensure her army doesn't get completely obliterated, survive. What did she achieve? Exactly that. Where did she lose? Well, she lost a bit too many troops, and Pilgrim maybe possibly set a vague redemption story arc that might kill her in a year or more.
#+end_quote

Not quite. Cat's objective was to repel the Crusade in a way that would lead to a lasting peace while maintaining Callow's war capability.

She repelled the Crusade but was unable to achieve a lasting peace, only a ceasefire, and at the cost of Callow's ability to wage war (which left her defenseless to Malicia's interference).

She got a third of what she set out for.

#+begin_quote
  What were Cat's strategic objectives in coming to Keter? Ensure Procer gets backstabbed so it doesn't even look in Callow's direction for a while, figure out what Dead King wants with her, survive and not lose any Woe. All of them, achieved. Cat even got an unintended powerup out of the deal. Where did she lose? Well, she didn't sign the treaty with DK, and instead Malicia did so, for slightly more brutal terms. Which is arguably another win, since now Malicia and not Cat has a "Let DK out of the box" damocles story sword over her head. And that deal might turn out to be negative to Cat in the long term if Malicia turns DK against Cat. Again, full win in short term, vague possibly negative consequences in long term.
#+end_quote

Again, incorrect. She wanted Procer /occupied/ by an incursion from the Dead King, not utterly devastated by an apocalypse set to sweep the world. The Dead King's antics are going to create hero's by the hundred and give Above plenty of excuses to not just put a finger on the scale but to fucking hammer it.

#+begin_quote
  Catherine always gets exactly what she wants while putting in the minimum amount of effort. Screams of thousands of innocents dying for no reason can be heard in the background. I have no doubt that she would get Sve noc on her side with liberal application of Friendship No Jutsu too, and would continue to angst about sacrificing oh so very much while actually doing oh so very little.
#+end_quote

You have repeatedly failed to understand both Catherine's goals and motivations.

#+begin_quote
  But enough about her objectives. Let's talk about her character.
#+end_quote

At the beginning I would have been delighted to get to this. Now I am extremely apprehensive.

#+begin_quote
  Who is Catherine Foundling, really? Well, let's see what her positive and negative qualities are. In Book 1, she was a brutish pit fighter with a snarky streak, who was inexperienced at all the various magical and esoteric stuff, and was willing to make tough choices if that got her what she wanted, which was safety and independance for Callow.
#+end_quote

You completely fail to mention her greatest assets, literally the things that define her as a character, in order to focus on surface level observations.

#+begin_quote
  Now we are three books later, so she is a budding professional at dealing with magic, and has accquired a wealth of combat experience, thus ra -

  Wait, sorry, give me a second, I have a call on another line. Yes, melmonella speaking. What is it? She is what? What do you mean no desire to learn? Oh my. Alright, thank you for your call.

  Well what do you know. Catherine still has not the foggiest idea about what magic is. Indeed, she jokes about her lack of knowledge in various fields constantly, which would be endearng if it wasn't so bloody aggravating because it shows her total inability to prioritise her learning (and thus, her personal power, and thus, the safety of her kingdom) over short-term fun. How many people intensely dislike, say, Philosophy, yet manage to keep attention in university class enough to pass the required course? Well, all those people have a better attention span than Catherine, who could not keep herself awake through various characters (as far as I remember, at least Killian and Masego attempted, and possibly Archer) giving her lectures on magic, which could literally be a difference between life and death in her line of work.

  Best as I can tell, only skill of Catherines that grew throughout the books was her ability to kill things with a piece of metal, which brings her to the level of ability of an average rifle. Not rifleman, rifle.
#+end_quote

Cat has had a few years to work against plans decades in the making put in place by the continents greatest minds. Oh no wait, one of the masterminds she is working against can't be dated because she /predates record keeping/.

Cat outright states at one point that she is working against someone so entrenched that they could have arranged for her grandparents to die before her parents were born if she thought Catherine would one day be a threat.

She is working on an impossible schedule and doesn't have /time/ to master every esoteric subject which may be relevant. What she /can/ do is win over experts in various fields and use them as advisors. And that is exactly what she fucking did.

Cat cannot learn to become a mage. And so magic will always be an academic subject for her. And so Masego and Killian are enough.

#+end_quote

So long as you ignore her ability to manipulate the most important fundamental power in her universe, her ability win people to her cause, her ability to plan ahead. So yeah if you put a lot of work into ignoring her improvements she hasn't made much of an improvement.

#+begin_quote
  And let's mention her continuing arc of rejecting her humanity for power. (I bloody well hope it's completed now that she is mortal again, though with how conservative Catherine tends to be I can just see her picking up another source of immortality and starting on the same arc again.) To my counting, it happened at least four times by now. First somewhere around Liesse, where Catherine ripped at her soul to murder Ubua. Second, during the Battle of The Camps, if memory serves, when she got back from her magic coma. Third, in Keter, when she learned to turn to Mist and such. And several more times in the Underdark. Every single time she goes through the same motions - she needs more magical power, so she rejects her humanity
#+end_quote

It's......it's almost like important themes repeat themselves in a story. Wow, that couldn't possibly be. It's almost like Cat making this her worst habit was setting it up for the ultimate subversion recently where she rejected that practice wholesale and clung to her mortality whatever the cost.

#+begin_quote
  (with much angsting about how good it must be to be mortal and full of lice, and ignoring that she has a bloody country to look after), which allows her to go over one conceptual block or another and allows her to use her powers more efficiently. And each time Catherine treats it like this grand revelation even if it already happened before. Girl, get it over with already.
#+end_quote

Yes, the leader of a nation having their decisionmaking process compromised aint no thang but a chicken wang.

#+begin_quote
  Of course, what would Catherine be without a dash of hypocrisy. Let's take the most recent chapter:

  #+begin_quote
    I forgive her for it. And Akua, well, she was raised in a bucket even more vicious than this one. She's still learning to let go of those blinders. You, though? I'm disappointed that at no point you figured out you could simply ask.

    How much could we have avoided if instead of clawing at each other we'd sat down and talked?
  #+end_quote

  Kettles who live in glass houses should not throw bricks at pots for being black, Catherine. Remind me, for how long did you discuss your goals with Malicia once you became queen of Callow? Did you, mayhaps, attempt to settle on a good old-fashioned compromise? Callow gets independence, Praes gets food, with terms enforced by oaths? Or did you decide that virtue signaling about how terrible Malicia was for funding Liesse was more important than lives of your own subjects?

  Those assassinations Malicia performed? Yeah, your fault. Should have visited a marriage councelor before that relationship broke down that far.

  In Keter, did you talk to Malicia, and arrange a deal where you agree to not fight so that Dead King can't bring down your prices by playing one of you against another? You literally had the same general goal of "get Dead King to attack procer", it's hard to pick an easier spot for compromise. Or did you jump straight to assassination as first responce policy?

  "But that was my mantle, it totally controlled my thoughts and made me uncreative and stuff!"
#+end_quote

For fucks sake, Cat was so struck by the hypocrisy of not having lived up to what she was asking that she immediately fucking killed herself afterwards.

And you don't even use the right fucking examples. Cat already provided them!

In point of fact, Cat /did/ negotiate with Malicia regularly. Malicia betrayed her because she is fundamentally incapable of trusting anyone.

#+begin_quote
  "But that was my mantle, it totally controlled my thoughts and made me uncreative and stuff!"

  No, sorry, Catherine. Stupid was in you all along. Komena said it best:

  You could, at least, attempt a believable lie. â€˜Nike, she's not even held her half of the Garden for a decade. The drift would be negligible. It was still her. The only difference was that she had power enough to cow her foes.

  I do wonder what would be the stupidest thing Catherine does in this book. Currently she is up to tens of thousands of innocent deaths. At least Diabolist was going somewhere with her own genocide, instead of making it happen due to sheer bloody obliviousness.
#+end_quote

Yes, I am sure Komena is a perfectly rational and unbiased perspective.

You have fundamentally failed to understand not only the character you are continually insulting but even the world she inhabits.
