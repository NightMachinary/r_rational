I think EE's recent chapters have been angling for a *"Winter inhibited rationality"* argument, what with how Cat basically amended her victory conditions to "No Winter Immortality" after losing it and her quips about Winter insulating her from Creation or being drunk on the ability to walk off lost limbs. That tact basically writes off EE's need to justify anything post-Winter as rational. Which was this entire book.

Hell, maybe Winter made Cat go to the Drow in the first place, because story reasons. So I won't even fault her for that incredibly poor decision, or the fact that Cat didn't pull out of the Battle of Great Strycht with her perfectly sufficient army of demigods when it became clear she was heading for a pivot and potential complete loss over a /BATTLE THAT DOES NOT EVEN MATTER/. Loot & leave would have been perfectly sufficient, but let's chalk that decision making process up to Winter logic.

What *really* bothers me, is Cat angling for an alliance with Sve Noc AFTER she's divested of Winter and presumably back in her right mind. I mean for fuck's sake, joining the Drow in Jolly Cooperationâ„¢ to solve her 1) Crusade, 2) Dead King, 3) Praes problems is a fantasy /when the first issue the alliance would have to address would be the Dwarves/. The Dwarves who would have the earth swallow Callow out of spite if she crossed them, the Dwarves she entered into a contract with to kill Sve Noc, the Dwarves who she needs to save Callow's budget crisis, the Dwarves who plan to exterminate any Drow remaining underground. All while her allies would be a goddess of unknown ability, competency, or sanity, and the isolated but murderous herds of cats that make up what's left of Drow society.

But I guess those are 'later' problems, because Cat has bigger issues to worry about--like not dying.

It's hard to write a rational character's loss.
