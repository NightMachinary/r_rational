Unlikely and implausible stuff happening because the plot demands it, rather than because of forethought or logic, is kind of a main theme of PGTE. E.g. Iast minute power ups during boss fights despite a character having arguably not earned them are par for the course.

It's often fun how PTGE recognizes these tropes (and even has the characters go so far as to plan around such things, like with the "rule of three") but at the end of the day if you find these tropes unsatisfying then a fair bit of PTGE is going to be irksome. The Black Knight was the most rational actor IMO, and now that he's stepped off the stage other characters are going to lean on more "rule of cool" and "literary railroading" style methods. (For the former see Thief being used to "Steal" a miniature sun, and using this improbability as the lynchpin for a battle plan.)

PTGE is a pretty good story all told but not one where you should expect the protag to inventory their tools/goals, put together an optimized plan given said resources, and then execute the plan to the best of their ability, a la The Waves Arisen. At least not in real time in a way that is transparent to readers.

TLDR: Someone on this sub once commented that Worm wasn't rational fiction but was at least firmly "rationally adjacent", and I think the same is true of PTGE.
