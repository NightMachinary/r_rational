OK, After much frustration dealing with text formatting and size limits, I just decided to post the most recent version of (hopefully) rational universe backstory on the back end of my last project. (which was not rational!) That's not a really big deal, since my readers there know I'm going to be starting two new projects soon. Stop by and take a look if you want. Feel free to comment either there or here, if you like. I have been tremendously happy with the community insightfulness so far!

Oh, drat, I forgot the computer/AI thing. I'll go jump on that now.
