In order to offer some suggestions for changing things around to get the desired result:

The robot/industry ship /did/ go first, it just failed when it got there. Probably due to something that a human might have been able to compensate for but the autonomous systems couldn't, information about the system that just wasn't available when the mission was launched, or maybe just from plain bad luck - a serious meteor strike in just the right place that was outside the extremely generous engineering requirements for the project. Since it takes centuries to get to the planet, it makes sense that the generation ship would be in transit at the same time, since humans aren't patient enough to wait for phase one success over that time span, especially if there are concerns about existential threats and the colony was envisioned as a back up. Maybe both ships are launched at the same time, and the industrial ship was supposed to make it there sooner because it could accelerate faster with no living souls on board - and it was in contact with the generation ship the whole time anyway through radio.

The generation ship not being able to build a copy of itself isn't that unbelievable. It can be built with dozens of redundant systems, fabrication capabilities for 99% of its internals, and still not be able to build a second copy of itself, at least not without supplies. It can simply be a case of the engineers planning for some very bad scenarios and things happening that are even worse than that (whether they're outside of scope or simply considered too improbable to engineer for).

I think that patches most of it. The second ship can (and does) complete the mission even though the first ship is toast, so you can't fault the engineers for that. Space elevators or shuttles is more a matter of what's practical given their engineering and the planet in question. Maybe space elevators are just really hard to do, or the planet has too much debris orbiting it to make that practical (maybe because the first ship's malfunction or accident left something like Kessler syndrome around the planet). I think I would actually make most of the shuttles one way only, so the generation ship would be carving off portions of itself after they had run from Plan A all the way down to Plan Y.

And if not for the mites, it /still/ would have worked. Airlocks are over-engineering if the atmosphere is breathable, mosquito nets aren't really necessary if every lifeform on the planet is known to the colonists, so it's believable (to me) that they wouldn't have much of a defense. Or maybe they had all those defenses in place, and the mites still got in (riding on clothes, for example) and played havoc with their systems and put them in a state that was beyond recovery.

I guess I'm picturing a civilization where genetic engineering has outpaced most other technologies, and the space travel (and fabrication) technologies are only about at the level that you'd need to build a generation ship. No AI, no nanoassemblers.
