Are you saying that rational and rationalist fiction are the same thing? It seems to me that all rationalist fiction should be rational fiction, but not the other way around.

Rational fiction is internally consistent, and generally there's an understandable reason why things happened the way they did.

Rationalist fiction is all this, but espouses rationalist tenets as well.
