I'd recommend reading /7th Sigma/ by Stephen Gould (whose most famous book is /Jumper/). It takes place in a section of the world where nanobots eat metals, and everyone has to use ceramics or plastics instead. It's a lot different from the setting you're talking about, but the lack of metals means there are some similarities.
