While I definitely second Anakiri's narrated remarks, I do want to say you had me at the locusts. That's mostly brilliant, and I would really love to see more of the culture and society that works with that ecology.

Your source problem, I think, is that you're sticking to the initial premise you wanted: A metal-poor cargo cult. This was clearly a great inspiration for the initial world-building iteration, but now you should drop it until you can find a reasonable way to get what you wanted. But right now, reasonable people plus your original setup don't get you a metal-poor cargo cult.

The solution is really easy: Iterate some more! Now to subject you all to an attempt at narration -

--------------

"And here we have the results from the first stage of the Drake Extrasolar Planetary Survey. We focused on G-type main-sequence stars within XX lightyears, in order to keep the ark-ship travel time to under XX centuries. We restricted our survey to systems with Earth-sized planets in the so-called Goldilocks zone, and have ranked the results based upon system resources, planetary atmosphere, and planetary water. There was some initial debate about whether to target or avoid planets with signs of life, but the question was rendered moot when none were found in any candidate systems.

Note that we are NOT considering systems with promising system resources but WITHOUT an appropriate planet - while the o'Neal cyclinders and other orbital colonies are both effective, and serve to demonstrate the viability of Arkships (after all, an Ark is basically an orbital with an engine), it is this project's specific goal to create new Earths. If you're interested in purely spreading humanity, that's two doors down with our friends at the Lagrange Survey.

With that, let's go over the results...

..which brings us to the second system on the list, the proposed target for the /Leviathan/ and the /Prometheus/. Currently dubbed simply "Secundus", it was originally number eight on the list (and thus beyond the scope of the first wave), but a Dr Moore at GMO Genetics proposed an absolutely ingenious terraforming plan utilizing gene modifications from heavy metal extremophiles, allowing human surface habitation in /under a century/ - I see some you realizing that this would means the terraforming could be done before any human saw the planet, and indeed, that's what we're aiming for!

If you'll look at page X of the report, you'll see a summary of the upsides and downsides to the system and the planet. As you can see, there's some concern about the overall heavy metal content in the system and the specific distribution on the planet, but as you'll also note, it's got a truly astounding quantity of orbital water, and the medium-sized gas giant shows a high likelihood of being able to supply the necessary fusion fuels for, well, to be frank, that /second/ wave of colonization we're all hoping for... While this system isn't likely to reach Earth's industrial capability as quickly as our number one choice, we do think that this wealth of orbital fuel will allow the Secundus colony to beat the rest on fueling a return trip.

You'll also note that while Secundus as an overall lack of surface metals, its oceans are surprisingly oxygen rich - indeed, that's a critical part of Dr Moore's plan, and what alerted him to the system in the first place... You see, it seems as though most of Secundus' surface metals are bound up in oxides suspended in it's ample oceans... making them rather similar to the industrial sites GMO Genetics has been cleaning up for the past few decades.

Furthermore, with the exception of the undesirable distribution (and lack) of surface metals, Secundus has the most important trait of all: dullness. There's no weather to speak of, very little tectonic activity, and nothing that'll hit you while in orbit - you may or may not know, but the original system the Diaspora project was founded to examine was eventually disqualified due to system meteorites. There simply wasn't an orbit for the Ark that wouldn't see it hole within a century by a passing shower - a problem this system resolutely does not have.

In short: dull enough that the dullness is /almost/ problematic, which makes it perfect."

Basically - Given the problems of the system, what else is true there to make colonization worth while? Work that out some more and come back - the stage after that is the shopping list to outfit the colonists with what they need to deal with the problems and capitalize on the benefits. Include things that might be true but that you won't know until you're half way there.
