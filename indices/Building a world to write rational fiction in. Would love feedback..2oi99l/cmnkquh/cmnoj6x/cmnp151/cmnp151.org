This is what's causing you your problem. You know the end result you want, and you're willing to make your people dumber in order to get it. That's not going to make the greatest scifi, and it's not going to make rational fiction at all.

Ideally, instead of making Frodo dumber when you give him the lightsaber, you give Sauron a death star, but then you just wouldn't have tried to colonize /this/ system in the first place.

Edit: ...but that just means that when /do/ find the problems to throw at them to get where you're aiming, they'll fill in all kinds of amazing details in your setting.

Edit 2: Go check out Eliezer's "Optimize Literally Everything" post (in this reddit under "Inexploitability"). The central take away (IMHO) is that in rationalist fiction, /first/ you write a reasonable setting, and /then/ you see what narrative comes from it when you add thinking characters. If you want this set in our universe, your setting is already written, so you really only get to do the latter.

If you want a specific tech and material base for your setting... why have it be modern-Earth descended at all?
