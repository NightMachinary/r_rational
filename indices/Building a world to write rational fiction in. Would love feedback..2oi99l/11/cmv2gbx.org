On Ai: Several hundred tons of infrastructure on a several hundred million ton spaceship? Just built two hundred AI. Shut down each one after a year, long before it can possible turn unstable. Switch on the second one with no prior knowledge of the first one's operation. Continue for 200 years. Select, from that sample of 200, the one with the least signs of instability, and copy its pre-launch configuration to half the AI. Repeat the process until you get a bunch of AI you can trust, then copy all of them over. You can go on for 774 years before you have to copy the same configuration twice.
