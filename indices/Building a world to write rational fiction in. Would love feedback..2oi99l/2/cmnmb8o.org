It looks great, but if you want us to be able to criticize it based on rational aspects, we wouldn't be able to do very much. It seems like all of the colonists were smart enough to willingly cooperate together and leveraged their resources (intelligent people, bio-manipulation, components of their ships) near optimally. The most I can do is to be given a direct problem to help resolve or be given more details about the present day society to suggest actions for the main character.

The only thing I can think of to help is the part about computers. Computers are so useful that I can't imagine humanity not trying to recreate it. If you look up 'computer' in Wikipedia, you'll see that the oldest computers were made of stone or wood. Recently, there has been research into making a chemical computer. In addition, it states that any computer which is Turing-complete, can stimulate any other computer given sufficient time and space. I would expect there to be attempts in making computers out of chemicals, stone, wood, biology, or even diamonds if you want to go crazy. Metals (or more specifically metalloids like silicon) were the best choice of materials for computing, but not the only one.

There's even a joke about making a computer out of billiard balls as a thought experiment in the wiki article. Thank you for giving me a fascinating prompt on recreating computers without any modern materials.
