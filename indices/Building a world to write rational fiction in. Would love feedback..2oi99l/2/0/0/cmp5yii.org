Modern knowledge makes abaci basically obsolete, even with only stone age technology. Writing our numbers in decimal notation makes pencil and paper faster than an abacus for most things. Physical calculation aids are more likely to be slide rules and books filled with tables of logarithms and nomograms; that's what people actually used before computers. And that's if you're being cheap. A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curta][Curta calculator]] can be made entirely out of plastic (or anything else), and is nearly as powerful as a basic electronic calculator.

And that's just handheld stuff. Appliance-sized mechanical computers can do things that [[http://youtu.be/s1i-dnAH9Y4][might astound you]]. They'd be hurt by a lack of metal, but they can in principle be made out of anything.

Of course, metal isn't really necessary for electronic computers anyway. You can have a computer made with carbon wires and [[http://www.ceramicindustry.com/articles/86378-ceramics-in-the-semiconductor-industry][ceramic semiconductors]]. In fact, machines made like that could be better than modern computers. Our reliance on metal for computer parts may be temporary. I'd also expect these people to have neural net machines made out of real neurons.

Losing metal would hurt their ability for precision machining, but hard work and innovation should cover that gap pretty quick. If nothing else, they can use stone tools to whittle under a microscope.
