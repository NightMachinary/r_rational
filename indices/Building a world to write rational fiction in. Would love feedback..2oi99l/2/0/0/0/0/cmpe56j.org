That's the thing. Your humans are going to be fighting tooth and nail to never /become/ an agrarian society, and you're a few disasters short of stopping them.

For example, how do they not have rugged, low-effort, high-yield GMO crops? Did they want farming to be difficult? What did they eat on the trip over? The loss of tractors and combines and irrigation systems would hurt them, but a minority of farmers and ranchers should still be able to feed everyone. This frees up everyone else to work on maintaining their way of life.

Mechanical computers aren't actually that stressful to their components, since they don't really /do/ anything. They're also not terribly complicated once you understand the basics. Consider a watch. It continuously adds a fixed quantity onto a dial, and also scales that quantity to add onto another dial. It's a basic adding and multiplying machine that easily fits in the palm of your hand. [[http://danevych.com/en/][Here]]'s an guy with no training in clockwork who carves them out of wood, making several a year. Any half-competent fool with some diagrams could carve a larger, less elegant one. When humans first started making watches, we didn't have the information theory to generalize the concepts. Now we do, and that's not going away. Simple calculators will never again be the size of refrigerators.

The information age is lost to them, no doubt. Making a /programmable/ computer is probably infeasible. But they should be able to salvage most of their societal infrastructure, they can have calculators to help them design everything they need and keep track of stuff, and they should have a whole bunch of GMOs they prepared earlier to relieve the burden. I'd expect them to regress to a kind of schizo-tech 1910s until they concoct a working pesticide.
