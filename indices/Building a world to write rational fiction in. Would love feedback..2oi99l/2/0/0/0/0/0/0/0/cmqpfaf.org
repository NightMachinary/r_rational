Hypercritical is fine, as long as you are civil, and you have been!!

If you are simply talking about increasing yields, that can be done without genetic modifications, through simple breeding programs. We've been doing it for centuries already, and that process continued even while humanity left frankenfoods behind. There is no roundup-resistant corn on Secundus, for example.

If you consider breeding programs to simply be a slow method of GMO, then we will have to agree to disagree. To me, breeding programs are controlled evolution. GMO is build your own organism. They can both lead to unexpected results, but breeding programs almost never lead to unexpected results quickly.

The colony wanted a rock solid Earthlike ecology, as close to the original Earth as possible. The only genetic level modifications made were to change how Earth life dealt with metabolizing metals.

Breeding programs for larger crops, healthier plants, etc. never ended. 500 years in a slow boat gave plenty of people plenty of time to play with breeding programs, though the lean times after Prometheus were mostly devoted to planting the highest yield crops possible and ignoring other research.

After the loss of Prometheus, when the crew was too large in Leviathan, the animal population was turned into meat, everyone became vegetarian, there was a whole lot of vat-grown food being eaten, and a lot of cropland inside Leviathan was not being rotated sustainably. As the population was reduced, the crop rotations were made more sustainable first, and then food animals were re-introduced before the vat-grown foods went away.

On the planet itself, large crop pests like worms, grasshoppers, etc. were controlled by automated machines in the fields. Imagine large mechanical spiders and flying drone-like machines that hunted pest insects mercilessly, with no regard to hunger. These mechanical insect-killing machines would be programmed to ignore pollinators. Harmful insect corpses would be dropped to the ground to fertilize fields as the machines killed them. Crop-eating birds would be chased off by drones, insect eating birds would be left alone. Roomba-like drones would destroy weeds in the fields and monitor soil conditions. All agricultural machines would monitor crops for fungal or disease infections, and chemical treatments for those conditions could be deployed with pinpoint accuracy.

There was no need for frankenfoods, they had technology to protect their foods with minimal human labor cost. Humans were not needed in the fields at all, except in rare circumstances.

As for eliminating the mites, as far as I'm aware, there have been no instances of humanity being able to intentionally eliminate any pest insect, with the exception of a couple cases on islands. There have been some cases of accidental elimination due to environmental changes.

Eliminating mites would be a nightmare to contemplate for a society in the middle of technical system collapse that had grown dependent on their ability to deal with everything using technology. Mites are absurdly tiny, and they are everywhere. There are mites that live in the soil, eating detritus, mites that eat plants, and mites that live on birds and rodents. They connect to almost every food chain. Some mites can even reproduce without breeding, females simply lay eggs and the eggs can hatch into clones of the female.

This discussion has just given me an idea. I have decided that there will be an almost church-like organization devoted to an ongoing breeding program to develop mites that do not consume metals, but are more successful in the wild than metal-mites. (Note that metal mites so not consume metal for energy, they consume organics for that, they ingest metals which are then used during the growth of their carapaces to make them tougher.) The colonists do not have machines to create targeted genetic modifications, they have to do it the hard way, through selective breeding, with limited technology.

Everyone on the entire planet understands that the mites keep them from having metal tools. Everyone supports the breeders, but they have not succeeded yet. Some people might believe the breeders will never succeed because then they will no longer be needed. Others are less jaded and support them strongly.

This would create a class of person on the planet strongly reminiscent of churchmen, without requiring the creation of a religion in a rational world. It would also make a great deal of sense for the breeders to keep track of the genetic relationships of humans and domestic animals.

The church might even have large numbers of high tech tools which were preserved by various methods, then sealed in glass and stored in some sort of insect-toxic substance that would neither rot, nor damage it's environment or damage the glass. The substance would not be a hazard to humans. An extremely concentrated salt-slurry would probably work, I don't think even water mites can survive in a salt slurry.

Thank you!
