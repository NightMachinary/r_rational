What does that even mean? If I am modifying a plant to make more viable for colonizing other planets why wouldn't I make it all around more viable and nourishing too? If the society is still capitalistic then they will look at what is /cheaper/, especially when it comes to fill limited space in a way that maximizes chances of survival and economic development of a colony. And I'm pretty sure that spraying every field with tiny farmbots is not the most efficient way to do that. Especially not in the long term.

The only reason I could think of them doing that instead in your story is if they somehow discovered that /all/ ways of increasing a crop's viability and nutrition values through genetic manipulation have highly adverse effects on human health or something. But similar changes to increase iron retention don't. Which would be weird.

Also, I'm curious why you think that GMOs are so risky /in general/. When plants are modified to produce additional substances like pesticides (which is something done nowadays sometimes) or something I get it. But in the far future where we can /safely/ make metal harvesting crabs and guided locusts I can't imagine that a simple increase in yield value will be much harder.

Anyway, I'll go look at your modified version now.
