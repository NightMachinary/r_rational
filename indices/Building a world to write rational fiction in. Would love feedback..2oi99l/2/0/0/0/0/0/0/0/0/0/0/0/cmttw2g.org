A lot of the modifications have not made it into an additional rewrite yet. A lot of ideas have been presented below the linked post and I haven't made a new post yet.

As for GM foods, there was a thirty year report generated recently where it was shown that GM crops, while they outperform in areas that they are designed to do well in, they fail worse than normal crops when problems occur that they are not modified to deal with. On average over the long term, in varied conditions one might expect in nature, GM crops do not out-produce non-GM crops.

The colonists could certainly create slightly better crops, but there's no driving need for them to do so. The farms were communal, the labor to work the fields was mechanical. Nobody had any sweat equity or commercial interest in improving the crops, and the geneticists were firmly of the opinion that if it's not broke, don't fix it. If, for some reason, they felt they needed to create dinner-plate diameter tomatoes, they surely could have, even if they ended up with something that had an outer skin like a cantaloupe. They had no desire to go fiddling about with genetics and risk what might be the last few thousand human lives in the galaxy. They had lots of ways to deal with the demon Murphy if he stuck his head in, but they were not fond of attracting him without reason. Besides, they were concentrating on planetary infrastructure, preparing to build the industrial complex required to build the tools required to build the next tier industrial complex, etc. as they prepared to start replacing what was lost in Prometheus.

They had the technology where people could pretty much do the work they wanted to do, though everyone was required to help with community projects.
