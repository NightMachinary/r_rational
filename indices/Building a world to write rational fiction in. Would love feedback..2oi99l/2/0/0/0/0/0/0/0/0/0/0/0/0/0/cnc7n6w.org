I find it funny that people are so fixated on GM crops.

Part of the attraction for GM crops in industrialized nations is the density of production and the reduction of manpower requirements. If you don't have to remove weeds by hand, you can plant crop rows closer together, and need fewer farm employees. If you can grow more crops on less land, you pay less property taxes. Intensive farming also requires much more aggressive soil management as the crops pull more nutrients from every given acre of land, every growing season.

On the one side, people in favor of GM crops here are probably imagining small, extremely dense, privately managed, for-profit GM farms that require a great deal of fertilization every year. On the other side, perhaps people are imagining extremely low tech, uneducated farmers with limited access to technology to move water or fertilizer.

The colonists aren't living in either of those scenarios. They have a whole world with a small population, so availability of land is not a concern at all, and will not be a concern for centuries, if not millennia. In fact the long term plans will be for a substantial part of cropland to be in orbital farms, after the colonists re-establish themselves in space.

Labor is a complete non-issue. Even the early colonists have more than enough industry and resources to create autonomous machines to clear land, plant, tend and harvest crops.

What I am imagining are large, less densely packed, communal, non-profit, mostly-natural farms that can be perpetually managed with crop rotation and modest soil inputs like organic wastes. That's not to say that the farms would be strictly organic. The soil might need to be balanced with chemicals from time to time.

The only GM crop-improving efforts that I can say will definitely have occurred would be that crops would be engineered to better retain metals, and store them in such a way that the stored metals are easier to absorb by digestive processes.

As for the overall rationality of GM crops in this setting, part of good resource management is avoiding wasting resources. With an entire planetary biosphere to monitor after terraforming and tinkering with practically everything's genes in order to address metal scarcity in the environment, the genetic scientists are not going to tinker with things that already work, trying to solve problems that don't exist.

Saying that they didn't have access to GM crops at need is not true. The colonists had databases full of different strains of crops that would work well in different environments, courtesy of the history of human farming in various climates. Some of these electronically stored crops might be distantly related to GM crops of today.

If someone wanted to start a farm to grow a new crop <x> at <y> location, they would take some soil samples, gather climate data from the weather database, plug the variables into a agriculture science application, and then get a list of crops that might be suitable for the land and climate. The genetic material would then be formulated from electronic records and seeds would be 3D printed and delivered by drone to the farmer.

At the end of the day, the colonists expected to be able to tinker with crops at will, if there was a need. They had sustainable agriculture with near-zero human interaction. Low-intensity, large-land-area agriculture with near-zero human labor was working fine until the colony's technology base collapsed.
