Somehow I didn't respond to this earlier. Abaci will definitely exist. I can probably get a couple ideas by looking for dwarf fortress !science! projects where they built working computers.

Something like this would be moderately insane to build in the real world. But I suppose it would be possible.

The world does have pottery and ceramics, water power, wind power, and even steam power to some limited degree. Functional mechanical computers are certainly possible.
