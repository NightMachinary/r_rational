I've always felt that the definitions on the sidebar are a "featherless biped" kinda thing. I prefer to think of rational(ist) (fan)fiction as the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/nl/the_cluster_structure_of_thingspace/][empirical cluster]] of fiction which is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics][cladistically]] descended from /HPMOR/ and the broader LW memeplex. That's what /Friendship is Optimal/, /Luminosity/, and /Myou've Gotta be Kidding Me/ have in common.
