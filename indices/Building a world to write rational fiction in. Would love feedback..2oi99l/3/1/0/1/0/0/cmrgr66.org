  *Cladistics* (from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language][Greek]] κλάδος, /klados/, i.e. "branch") is an approach to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification][biological classification]] in which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism][organisms]] are grouped together based on whether or not they have one or more shared unique characteristics that come from the group's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_common_ancestor][last common ancestor]] and are not present in more distant ancestors. Therefore, members of the same group are thought to share a common history and are considered to be more closely related.

  The original methods used in cladistic analysis and the school of taxonomy derived from it originated in the work of the German [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomologist][entomologist]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_Hennig][Willi Hennig]], who referred to it as *phylogenetic systematics* (also the title of his 1966 book); the terms "cladistics" and "clade" were popularized by other researchers. Cladistics in the original sense refers to a particular set of methods used in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics][phylogenetic analysis]], although it is now sometimes used to refer to the whole field.

  The techniques of cladistics, and sometimes the terminology, have been successfully applied to other disciplines: for example, to determine the relationships between the surviving manuscripts of the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Tales][Canterbury Tales]]/, or also between 53 manuscripts of the Sanskrit /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charaka_Samhita][Charaka Samhita]]/.
