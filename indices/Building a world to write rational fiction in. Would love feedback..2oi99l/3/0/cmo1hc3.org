In regards to the Fair Play insight, the things discussed in this worldbuilding is more ancient history than anything applicable to the characters in the first book.

I'm hoping that I'll be able to interest the readers with at least a few fair play insights regarding the combinations of stone age technology with some ceramics technologies, water power, and perhaps even some steam power. These people were driven into the stone age, they didn't fall. They kept educating their children and writing their books to preserve knowledge as best they could. A great deal was lost, but not everything.
