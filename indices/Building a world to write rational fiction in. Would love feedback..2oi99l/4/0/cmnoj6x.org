"Crabs Walk on the Island" was a very good short story, and thought provoking. Thank You.

The purpose of the biology background setting is to create a scenario where I can have a rational reason for humans to combine stone age technology with water power, and some limited steam power. I needed to move it off-Earth, because there's simply too much metal available on Earth. I'd have to completely erase all education from every human for metalworking knowledge to disappear, and then water-power and steam-power would also be gone from collective knowledge.

I also needed to isolate the community, prevent it from getting outside help. So Earth and the Sol system had to be taken out of the picture.

I could design it as some sort of contrived alien experiment, but that's potentially a LOT darker than anything I want to do, if I wanted to write about it in a rational manner.
