Horray! Anyway, in my experience with world-building-to-target, it's a looped iteration. You make your first guess as to the initial conditions that may result in what you want, then you completely forget about what it is you want and try to figure out where those conditions will go, then you remember where you wanted to go and revise the initial conditions and/or add happenstance events.
