There may be some confusion as to what it is that I have written. This is not the story arc, it's the backstory. The first thing I am doing is writing a reasonable setting. I have very little of the main story planned, other than a few personalities and details. I'm specifically avoiding more than that until after I have a rational back story to build on. Most of this information will be completely unknown to the characters. It's for me, though I will probably include it in the foreward of the book in much the same way that Flint does in 1632 and it's spinoff books (Speaking of which, I'm curious as to the rational fiction assessment of the 1632 book and it's offshoots. Off the top of my head, it seems to be very rational alternate history fiction.)

Back to this thread though. So far, none of the comments have created insurmountable obstacles. I am currently revising, as we speak. Once I have a solid, rational back story, then I will move forward with more detailed planning of the first book.
