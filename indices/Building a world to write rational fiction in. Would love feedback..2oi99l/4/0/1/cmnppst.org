Honestly, if this is just the backdrop for a setting, then you don't actually need any of this - especially if no one knows it. When I was reading the setting details, I was trying to fit it into the story that I assumed was there somewhere - an intrepid band of people in a world without metal, a legend of a ship high in the sky, and eventually they'd find some hidden secret, get the coordinates to a sealed off vault, find one of the lost shuttles, pilot it to the moon, restart the /Leviathan/, and so on and so forth.

But if the /Leviathan/ is never going to feature in the story, then it doesn't matter. The time you spend figuring out details that aren't going to feature in the story could be better spent writing the actual story. And if you're setting the story long after all this stuff has gone down, when immense amounts of knowledge have been lost and computers are a legend that the protagonist's grandparents were told by their grandparents, then it probably doesn't belong in the story, because you'll just end up sidetracking everything to explain it to the reader. I'm one of those people who's big on cutting as much exposition as possible, especially if it doesn't serve to tell the story. If there are metal-poor people living in the stone age, then just let us know that and don't even pay lip service to how that came to be - just leave some hints, and let the reader draw their own conclusions.
