The more I think about this, the more problems come up.

Why did they abandon space?

Space is terrifically useful if you are on dealing on very long time scales. Especially on a metal-poor planet.

- Asteroids provide all the metal you could ever want, both for building space stations, solar power satellites, weather satellites, etc and for shipping down to the planet to fill their needs.
- Comets provide water for reaction mass, breathable atmosphere, washing, drinking, radiation shielding, etc etc etc.
- There are almost certainly gas giants in the system. There's your source of He3 for fusion reactors.
- If you want to send Leviathan home again you need to refuel it. You're going to do that from space, not haul it up the gravity well.

Once the sand mites show up, Leviathan provides an unbreachable point where industry, computers, and serious bioengineering work can be maintained. Shuttles go down with metals, ceramic tools / machines / etc and go up empty via remote control. On the way you open them to vacuum / irradiate the hell out of the interior to kill the sand mites. If you say they need to be piloted manually, then I say "they land only on floating platforms that are carefully maintained sandmite-free, all people and goods go through obsessive decon chambers, and the shuttles don't actually dock with Leviathan."

I mentioned solar power satellites -- why devote land and industry to power generation when you can get it from orbit for cheap? Especially on a planet where there isn't much land. That should be a thing that the colonists wanted, so they wouldn't have abandoned space. If nothing else, they would have wanted weather satellites and communication satellites, so they would not have abandoned space.

Why are there no floating ecologies? If there's a shortage of land and people are getting a lot of their minerals from the ocean, there should be offshore arcologies (or, at least, mining platforms that can be converted to arcologies) to refine the metals. When the sand mites show up, at least some of these platforms will survive and maintain their industry. They provide the aforementioned safe places for the shuttles to land and transship advanced products.

In the meantime, the metals that the sandmites eat are still in their shells, and the sandmites are wherever the metals were that they ate. Can't you set up at least some cleanrooms, then bring in dead sandmites and recover the metals from their shells in order to build computers that are stored in very-limited-access-and-only-with-full-decon cleanrooms?

You now have at least one and probably multiple points where full industry and bioengineering is still usable for the foreseeable future. Given the level of bioengineering already shown, it seems unlikely that they can't find a solution for the sand mites. Even if they can't, they can abandon the land and move to a Waterworld style of life. (Again, appropriate decon measures to avoid bringing the sandmites to the floating arcologies.)
