  -No need to mass-shield everything against radiation.
#+end_quote

People are the main thing you need to build rad-shielding for in space. They have a generation ship; this isn't an issue.

  -Less energy and resources devoted to transport and thermal regulation. You can just let something sit on land. In space, absolutely everything must have remass and an energy source to move around.
#+end_quote

I'll point out that you need to have an energy source to move around on land, too. </snark> ;>

You can just let things sit in orbit too; in general, they stay where you put them. Yes, low orbits are unstable and will eventually degrade, meaning they will need small amounts of boost to avoid destabilizing. This is a very manageable amount of energy.

As to solar panels -- they work /enormously/ better in space than on the planet. Here are some of the advantages solar in space has as opposed to on a planet:

- No atmosphere. This boosts available power levels [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation#mediaviewer/File:Insolation.png][substantially]]
- No nighttime (assuming correct orbit so as to avoid planet's shadow)
- No dust to cover the panels
- No wind to move / break the panels, or scour them with dust
- No gravity, so you can make /huge/ arrays without worrying about them collapsing of their own weight
- No clouds to get in the way
- Panels are always at 90 degrees to the sun -- harder to maintain on earth

Earth-based solar isn't really a viable option for civilization-level power. SBSP absolutely /is/ a viable option.

  -Appropriate decon might not be available after the sandmite catastrophe has passed.
#+end_quote

That's the point; you do the decon /before/ the sandmite catastrophe has happened. People should be doing this level of decon every time they walk in or out of a genetics lab where you are working on new / modified life forms -- you don't want any of the specimens escaping, or to bring in anything that would distort the experiments.
