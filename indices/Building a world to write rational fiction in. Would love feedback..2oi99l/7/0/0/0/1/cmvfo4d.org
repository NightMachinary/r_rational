Mass shielding: it's for the long term prospect, once they arrive at Secundus. It is important they move everything planetside.

You are correct about the advantages of solar power in space... but consider this: you have a situation where industrial capacity is lacking, and you want to select the most robust technologies when you start building. Solar panels on the ground have no overhead costs. All you need to collect power is an electric wire, not a fancy beam emitter device. They can be cleaned, and most importantly, repaired on the ground by picking up your tools and walking over there. Remember the Hubble repair mission? Imagine you have to do that for several orbiting solar panels.

Initially, the power requirements for the colony will be miniscule. As it grows, solar panels won't be the answer, but not for the reason you'd think. Today, on Earth, solar panels are expensive to build because they contain rare metals. On Secundus, they would be prohibitively expensive.

The best solution for the Secundus colony is a solar steam cycle, where mirrors focus sunlight onto a boiler to superheat steam and run it over turbines. This of course, is best done on the ground. Afterwards, once they have gathered resources and manpower, they'll build damns for hydroelectric power. There's no nuclear elements or fossil fuels, but there's a lot of water lying around.
