Inland waterways wouldn't be a concern from a transportation point of view. I was thinking environmental. As for tidal generators, it's very possible you are right. In fact it makes sense that you are right. I was thinking in terms of physical forces available for generating power, not in terms of repair and maintenance.

If the colony had sufficient power and dedicated industry, they could manufacture absurdly damage-resistant components for tidal power generation (Graphene and carbon nanofiber shells for components, Buckyballs for lubricants), but once they had enough power available to create a worldwide tidal power generation system, they would be back in space, and beaming power down to the planet from solar arrays in orbit.

So yea, Tidal power generation is a no-go for the colonists, even theoretically :)
