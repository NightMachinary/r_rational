That still doesn't address why they chose not to build weather satellites and communication satellites. The utility of doing so is so high that not doing it seems to require serious explanation.

As to the resource-poor system...you can certainly do it, but it really starts to feel like you're forcing the issue, purpose-building an entire solar system. I don't know how common the system you describe would be and some quick googling hasnt answered the question, but it feels unlikely. Also, why would humanity send an ark ship THERE? It can't possibly be the best (or even one of the four best) options, surely?

I suppose that part doesn't matter though -- it's the world you want as the author and anthropic bias can take care of the rest. Still, the satellite thing needs an answer.
