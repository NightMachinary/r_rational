The primary thing that bothered me: I find it impossible to believe that a generation ship would ever be built without the capability to build heavy industry, absent some very unlikely catastrophic restriction. That right there wrecks the whole setting for me; you need to find a justification if you want it to be believable.

Perhaps the ship was sent early and only half complete because the Earth was in the process of dying? In that case, people should know what happened back on Earth, and it would have impacted the abilities of the ship -- the genetic samples likely would not have been put aboard until the ship itself was complete.
