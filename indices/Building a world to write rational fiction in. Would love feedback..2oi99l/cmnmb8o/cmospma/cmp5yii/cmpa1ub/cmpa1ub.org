I tend to be a little conservative when it comes to the idea of nonmetallic computing. Yes, it's possible, but it seems to me that without some pretty amazing breakthroughs, metallic CPU computers are just too efficient to be displaced by non-metallic CPU computers. Even though the mechanical limits of metallic manufacturing are being pushed, what we're doing today is barely scratching the surface of what might be possible in truly parallel computing. My personal machine has eight CPU processors and two GPU processors, but very few pieces of software are designed to efficiently use all ten processors as a single computing entity. Don't get me wrong, it's very possible I am mistaken, but I can't write too far outside what I know, and I'm not prepared to spend years writing this! :)

That being said, definitely some interesting thoughts here. My concern with the idea of precision machining without metals isn't the tools used to inscribe or form the end products, it's with the durability of the end products. You could make a lathe entirely of ceramics, wood and stone and then give it a ceramic bit (ceramic bits are already used today, we can make a questionable statement saying that this world has ceramics nearly as good as that of the real world). With centrifuges and simple chemistry it would certainly be possible to isolate materials for high quality ceramics.

For the colonists to manufacture handheld mechanical computers like the Curta might have been possible for a while after they first lost computers. For future generations, hundreds, thousands of years later, I don't think so. For anyone to maintain technology at an electronic age level without electronics would be highly questionable. To manufacture Curta-sized mechanical computers requires levels of fine machining that would be extremely difficult without electronics and metal tools. I will not say impossible. It was done with metal tools and no electronics back in the early 1900's, certainly.

A refrigerator-sized Curta-type device may well fit into the universe, but how many humans living in an advanced agrarian society are required to support such a device? Without metallic tools or computers, a lot of people would be spending a great deal of effort to farm/fish/hunt.

I'm imagining a society that's going to be a lot like ancient Greece in many ways. There WERE mechanical computers back then, Google up the Antikythera mechanism if you want to see the oldest known portable mechanical computer, but they would have been horribly expensive.
