Modifying plants to absorb and collect metals is extremely unnatural and a difficult thing to implement. Plus, 'metals'. There are dozens of them and the plant would need thousands of genes to handle the different biological pathways for all the metals. Plus, metal metabolisms are very energy-intensive, so if your plan on them to survive in the wild, they're be useless for anything else, such as being food (essentially collecting energy for you to eat).

Producing more nutritional food is child's play in comparison. Duplicating a gene that expresses the starch-forming signal in a plant is basically all you need sometimes.

The only real reason GMOs are considered dangerous are because:

-We cannot contain them once they are exposed to their wild versions. Cross-pollination can create unexpected mutations that are harmful to humans... but just generally inferior products.

-We are not accurate enough in our genetic manipulations. Our current techniques are more akin to shotgunning than scapel work. We could inadvertently create a mutation that has negative impacts on human health. However, these unexpected mutations have to pass through rounds and rounds of tests and trials that last for up to a decade. Regular beef doesn't stand up to this, and we eat it without hesitation.
