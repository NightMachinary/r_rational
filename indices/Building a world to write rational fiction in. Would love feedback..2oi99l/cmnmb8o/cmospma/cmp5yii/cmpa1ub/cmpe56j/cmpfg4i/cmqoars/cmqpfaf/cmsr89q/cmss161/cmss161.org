I don't think we know enough about genetics to do GMO safely today, but you are probably right that the colonists probably could have if they wanted to. But they didn't need to, other than to modify how the plants dealt with metals. With all the mechanical devices they had to protect their crops, the colonists simply didn't need GMO. Selective breeding, sure, you really can't stop farmers and biologists from finding something to tinker with, but they did it with biology, not gene splicing.

Just like we won't need antibiotics or chemotherapy drugs at some point in the future if/when we have full spectrum medical nanobots.

And if you see the most recent comment in the blog post, you will see that there has been a modification to the mite story :)
