If we are reasonable, during the early stages of terraformation... the colonists will have absolutely no regard for recreating the Earth ecosystem until they are in a stable situation. This involves having a stable food supply that you do not have to devote a majority of your time and resources into collecting.You are right, they will never return to an agrarian society.

They'll grow Spirulina.

If they're good with GMo, good enough to force an energy intensive process such as iron-gathering into a species like mites, then they can easily create a sort of chlorophyll bacteria that converts sunlight and carbohydrates into glucose.

This glucose can be used to feed more complex lifeforms that produce proteins.

All you's need to feed the colony for any amount of time is a chemical cracker that produces carbohydrates at the bottom, a vat of bacteria in the middle, and proteins coming off the top. Why bacteria? Minimal nucleic acid.

And please, no bad-mouthing 'frankenfoods'. Just look at the corn that goes into your chips.

I also think you're making your colonists a bit too wishy-washy dreamers. If the population becomes too large, the elderly will be left to die (no life-prolonging techniques) and the reproduction rates enforced to become lower. Food animals have no place at all on a colony ship. Meat in it's fibrous, animal form is just too inefficient. The culture vats should be used in the colony ships themselves instead of wasting space and resources recreating an agrarian environment inside a spaceship.

If you are planning on growing crops on the target planet, isn't it easier to grow them in closed environments instead of creating insect and weed hunting machines? Also, you are worried about your 100% genetically engineered species evolving into pests? Wouldn't those same genetic engineering techniques have been used to implement a kill-switch gene into the species? A kill-switch gene could be tied to the naturally undesirable traits you have forced into the species at their inception. If they evolve to discard their function, the kill-switch gene would be the first to be disrupted, removing their ability to process an arbitrary compound such as sulphur dioxide or alcohol. You spray that substance on the crops, the mutated species absorb to and die from it.

Mites cannot be 'everywhere'. They are less efficient that bacteria. If they grow into a rogue species, they can easily be kept out of clean rooms. They also need an energy source, and a pretty energy-dense one at that. Pure sugar? Whatever it is, you have control of all biological matter on the planet. If you lock it up, it will die. Bacteria are more efficient that mites. The bacteria will cause said energy source to be consumed, and between the rotting and their energy-intensive task, the mites will die very quickly because there is absolutely nothing to eat on the planet outside of your colony.

And in the end, even if everything goes to shit on the planet... you were careful enough to bring any mites from the planet up into the ship, right? Bah. Doesn't matter. Even if mites do reach the Leviathan, they have nothing to eat. It's not like the biomatter they were designed to eat is just lying in large quantities in the spaceship... My point is, even if everything becomes a mess on the planet, the spaceship is your key to repairing everything, bringing new genetic machines online or even restarting from scratch.
