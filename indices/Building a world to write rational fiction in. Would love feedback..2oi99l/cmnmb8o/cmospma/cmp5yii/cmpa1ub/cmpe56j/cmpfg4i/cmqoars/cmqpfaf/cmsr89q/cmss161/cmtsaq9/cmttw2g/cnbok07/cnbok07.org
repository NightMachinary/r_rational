Actually, GM crops have shown substantial benefit in varied situations. If you mean things like this [[http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/failure-to-yield.pdf]]

They only refer to studies in the USA. In developing countries they've shown much larger successes. Likely because in the USA they already have various methods to handle pests and increase yields, in developing countries they have less.

They also don't mention a large benefit of GM crops- responding to disasters like droughts.

The 2012 yield in a drought was similar to the good yields of the 1990s. GM crops provide stability against pests and droughts.

The underlying traits, established through selective breeding, help boost the yield while genetic engineering provides protection against factors that might reduce it. You can theoretically get the same yield with organic crops, you just need huge amounts of irrigation, tilling, weed removal, insect removal and such.

Plus, the scientific consensus on genetic engineering is that it is safe and reliable, not that it's a mysterious danger that we cannot comprehend. We insert genes. Sometimes these genes do some damage to the genome, we can monitor these things. Likewise, selective breeding shuffles around genes and has mutations. Sometimes these things do damage to the genome too.

A lot in this world people aren't being very rational. GM crops are useful in lots of situations. They provide much higher resistance to frost, drought, disease, insects, they make colonies a lot cheaper to manage. A major expedition is going to have a number of GM crops and tools to make them in case there is some messed up environment because they are disaster averse, unlike most of the people in your world.
