The metal springs actually aren't that critical. I mean, for a watch, yeah, they keep it wound and running - and Mr. Danevych uses bamboo springs for that too. But if you were generalizing it into a calculator, those are the first things you'd get rid of, since you want all the inputs to be manual.

I don't see how your people could /not/ have extreme crop variants. Did they devote huge tracts of /Leviathan/ to fields for growing food? Even with vertical hydroponic farms, why would you not increase your yield, basically for free? Even if they weren't that way originally, they'd definitely consider it when they suddenly double their population. Then they grow the plants from the ship on the land, and engineer them to tolerate the transition. These people clearly are not as squeamish as modern people are about toying with their food, or they would not have made it hold iron better. If they're willing to do that, why would they not be willing to make everything better for everybody by making their rice bigger? That seems like an extremely arbitrary line to draw. Even so, I can understand it taking more than half of the population farming, so they're agrarian-ish. I personally wouldn't expect it, but I haven't done the math and it's reasonable enough that I can accept it as authorial fiat.

My point with the pesticides is that the mites are going to die. A significant fraction of the population is going to be devoted entirely to the task of killing them, and they will never, ever stop until the mites are dead. They will bathe their tools in arsenic and acid, and run enough electricity through them to pop any mites that touch them. They will breed Phytoseiulus into a hideous super-predator that kills metal mites for fun. They will burn down hundreds of square kilometers of land just to have a safe place to build a laboratory. They will build masers, mostly made of glass, and wave them over everything to teach the mites why you don't put aluminium foil in the microwave. Historically, it's not common for humans to take thousands of years to fail to kill something, once they really put their minds to it.

Hmm, I think I might be coming off as a bit hyper-critical. It's a bad habit of mine, and I can never tell. I only poke at it because I like your idea!
