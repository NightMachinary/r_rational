  If you consider breeding programs to simply be a slow method of GMO, then we will have to *agree to disagree*.

Why would anyone ever have to do on a clearly scientific subject. Clearly one of you is wrong, no?

The only repercussions of GMO crops I can think of is their effect on the environment for being more durable and such. But that shouldn't matter to a civilization that essentially /created/ an environment from scratch, taking Earth's as a template and modifying it with stuff like targeted locust swarms that still need to be viable enough to survive, crabs that are suddenly more durable but also more heavy and that all need to stay viable despite large variations in said durability and weight and probably large amounts of trying /not/ to introduce viruses or bacteria that can become harmful to humans within a few mutations. Not to mention how highly efficient robots targeting specific species is probably going to mess with the environment too.

I'd be curious to hear about other possible problems with GMOs though.

  To me, breeding programs are controlled evolution. GMO is build your own organism. They can both lead to unexpected results, but breeding programs almost never lead to unexpected results quickly.

What makes "controlled evolution" more special than other modifications, other than being slow? The first vibe I get is that you believe evolution to be "good" for some reason and its controlled form to be somehow better than not using it at all. I hope that is not the case and you had something different in mind when you said that.

  There are mites that live in the soil, eating detritus, mites that eat plants, and mites that live on birds and rodents. They connect to almost every food chain. Some mites can even reproduce without breeding, females simply lay eggs and the eggs can hatch into clones of the female.

Aren't all of those different species though? If the metal devouring trait appeared purely through evolution (no clue how that could happen, especially within just a few generations) then one would expect that to happen to only one mite species. If it was because of a lab mistake (only simple way I can think of that a sand mite gets traits from modified fiddler crabs) it should still be only that one species. Honestly, I would expect sabotage of the most insidious kind if mites of all kinds became metal devourers.

Anyway, I'm really curious how this setting will evolve with all the input you're getting. Good luck!
