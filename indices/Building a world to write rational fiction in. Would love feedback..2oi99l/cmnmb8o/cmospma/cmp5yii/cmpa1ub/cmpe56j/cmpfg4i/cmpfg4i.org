Indeed, they will be fighting tooth and nail to avoid becoming an agrarian society. A vast array of science and math that the ancients never had will be available to them.

At the same time, it's difficult to truly appreciate what the lack of metal would mean. Those wooden watches made by Valerii Danevych? They have metal springs. That's the only metal part, but it's a critical part.

Even agriculture of the 1900's was heavily metal dependent. Various plants and animals could supply oils and fats useful for simple industrial purposes. Manufacturing alcohol for fuel would be trivial. Even if modern fertilization methods were impossible, simply using fish for fertilizer would help a great deal. Crude, very inefficient tractors of some sort might be conceivable, but I doubt that they would be much more efficient that animal-powered labor. Even if they are moderately more efficient than animal power, the industries to support them would also be non-metallic industries.

I certainly need to look a bit closer at what the Amish do with non-metallic crafts, but even they are heavily metal dependent.

They will definitely have books, and that will certainly allow them to maintain a society that is far saner than any other agrarian society of the past, but I do not think that, even with GMO crops, the colony would be able to devote less than half of their population to growing, gathering, hunting, and fishing for food.

The colony never envisioned needing GMO crops that were extreme variants of natural crops. They learned the lesson we are still learning today about playing with our food too much. Most of the genetic modifications to heritage Earth crops would have been for better iron and metals retention.

The original colonists' pest and weed control would probably have been handled by machines much like today's drones and Roombas. Disease and fungal infections could be treated with chemicals.

Harvesting crops is a very energy intensive task as well, though most of the population is coastal, or by major waterways.

Again, I need to examine Amish agriculture to see how they perform, and how much metal they use.

Thank you very much by the way for helping me consider the world :)
