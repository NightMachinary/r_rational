A few quick thoughts before I move onto the comments and your updated version:

-Unless you're planning on crash-landing Leviathan on the planet at orbital velocities, it would be unlikely that it changes the planet's surface characteristics significantly.

-Genetically-engineered mites are very unlikely to evolve into a ravenous grey-goo analogue. Artificial alterations that make it gather conductive metals provide /negative/ selection bias. It's an energy-intensive task that does nothing directly for the specie's survival. Sure, they'll obtain impenetrable carapaces, but what predators do they have? A more likely scenario is that the colonists can't make the genetic trait stick.... the mites keep evolving away from it, and the new species pressure the iron-burdened mites into extinction again and again.

-Even if the replicator mites cause a catastrophic event, they won't survive for hundreds of years. If they don't die off on their own, other species without the iron-gathering burden push them into extinction. Finally, just where do the mites get the energy to attack iron directly from?!

-Iron-poor planets are usually lacking in plenty of other heavy metals. Their oceans won't be very salty.

-Huge amounts of water and little land mass means that the land masses are like the northern rocks of scotland: Cold, hot, always wet and with no topsoil.

-The hard thing is to put things back into orbit, not drop them down. Dropping resources and robots is as simple as strapping an appropriate heat shield on something and launching it with a parachute attached. Putting empty shuttles back into space is counter-productive. It is much more efficient to create one-way dropships instead of shuttles in a resource-strapped situation.... unless you have shuttles that can go up at no cost at all.
