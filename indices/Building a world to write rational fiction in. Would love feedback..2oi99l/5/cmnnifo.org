First, good start on a solid sci-fi idea. That should butter you up for some constructive criticism, right?

--------------

#+begin_quote
  The generation ships received many messages, and monitored many transmissions during the course of the horrific war which lasted several months, but eventually, the Sol system went completely silent. It is unknown if any of humanity survived in the Sol system, but there were no radio transmissions, for hundreds of years.

Make sure to get your sublight travel speeds right. Hundreds of years at what speed? Months to which reference frame? Any significant time dilation while listening to the messages?

  The energy of the initial acceleration of a generation ship would have been impossible to miss.
#+end_quote

What does this mean? What kind of energy, detected by what? If you're doing hard sci-fi, I'd avoid using "energy" to mean anything generic. That way lies Star Wars and, at "best", Star Trek.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Leviathan was large enough to pose a threat to life on Secundus if it de-orbited, so it was landed on the moon of Secundus, in a crater.
#+end_quote

Is this a Luna-sized moon? Those sorts of huge, paired sub-planets are basically non-existent elsewhere in the Sol system. Need to nail this down for things like tides. This seems to be suggesting a single moon, but Luna-like can't be assumed.

I think you need at least a lampshade for why this wasn't supported by robotic missions. Send in the robots first just makes sense. It might be the distance, the cost, or a fear they wouldn't be adaptive enough. But apparently humanity has already spent hundreds of years on this -- no FTL at all, and centuries away for the generation ship, right? The slow trip out for the probes, and the return reports at (one assumes) light speed. So why not send robots and wait a generation or two? Or just send them out even a little before the ships.

Also, why didn't the industry ship go first if they were going to (or could) hang in orbit for a century without apparent issues? They might not have known about the metal issues on the planet, but why would the long-term terraforming ship go first if it wasn't about some rush project? If there wasn't war brewing before they left (and maybe this is an issue) why not just float around in-system until the entire mission is under way together? Ten years waiting shouldn't be an issue for a ship which holds people who know they are going to die in deep space anyway.

Also, as in any rational fiction, you need to answer the computer information systems complexity question. Why isn't strong (if not super-human) AI a thing? It can be a single sentence that says, "it doesn't work" in so many words, but I think it needs to at least be answered when complicated genetic engineering is possible. What kind of computer systems can manage this, but not direct neural mapping of human brain-like systems (at the clunkiest)?
