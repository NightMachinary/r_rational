The mass of a single AI isn't a problem. The cost for a single AI wouldn't be a deal-killer either, even though it would be expensive. Having to duplicate the systems /many times/ would become a problem cost wise first, and mass-wise second. I'm painting a picture of AI as an emerging technology. It wouldn't have a place on ships going off to start a colony, away from the few experts in the Sol system who really understand the new technology. The next generation colony ships might well have had AI systems integrated, if the next generation colony ships had ever been built.
