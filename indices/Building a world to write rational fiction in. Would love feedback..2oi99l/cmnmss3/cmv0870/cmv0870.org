The best proposal is actually a metallic asteroid, slap on a few kilometers of ice in front, drives in the back and a robotic factory in the center. The robotic factory does nothing during the centuries-long crossing, this minimizes damage.

Near the end of the journey, the factory eats from the masses surrounding it to create the space-station-creating robots.

Once the ship has decelerated into the target planet's orbit, the robots dig their way to the surface and create an orbital workshop. The orbital workshop create the colony-creating robots.

These robots are dropped onto the planet along with lumps of iron and metals. They create land-based colony-creating robots, which move onto creating the actual colony.

Only then is the genetic material hidden behind kilometers of ice and rock finally used. They create humans first. Resource-gathering genetically engineered species are the last thing on their mind. Why? They can order more iron they can ever need to be dropped next door in a matter of hours.
