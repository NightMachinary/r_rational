I'd be quite happy to be mistaken, but this article doesn't sell me on the idea. It talks about mosquitoes eating and being eaten and pollinating, and they're not useful for all of that. Then it says this:

  “The ecological effect of eliminating harmful mosquitoes is that you have more people. That's the consequence,” says Strickman. Many lives would be saved; many more would no longer be sapped by disease.

More healthy people. And more healthy /caribou/, who leave fewer caribou carcasses, and they're all harder for wolves to catch. The wolves will get by going for young and old caribou, which there will be more of. But with less disease to act as a force multiplier for them, wolves become a weaker check on the caribou, and both wolf and caribou populations /can/ have a massive effect of the environment at large.

If mosquitoes have any value, it's /because/ they're a disease vector. If you want to convince me it's safe to get rid of them, that's what you have to look at.
