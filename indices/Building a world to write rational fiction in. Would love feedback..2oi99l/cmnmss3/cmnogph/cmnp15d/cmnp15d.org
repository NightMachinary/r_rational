I mostly agree, most of it isn't that hard to fix. I just wanted to emphasize the point that, in a rational universe, smart people see probable failures coming. Whatever your first thought is, they've thought it also, and they don't like it.

I would quibble with one point, though. Airlocks are over-engineering if the atmosphere is breathable, but there should be some ground stations from before then. You can't monitor everything from orbit, after all. The shuttles should definitely have airlocks, and should be nearly impenetrable. Genetic engineering labs should have clean rooms. There are all sorts of isolated areas that should be really hard for the mites to get in to, especially once the characters figure out their technology is being eaten. As for mosquito nets, I'd expect them to have some because mosquitoes are necessary for healthy ecosystems. You can't just bring the organisms you like.

Of course, human failure is the weak point. A single lapse in procedure could contaminate the isolated areas, and over a long enough time they'll be destroyed one by one. So I'm not really disputing anything, I guess. Just that it should take longer than a single season to lose /everything/.
