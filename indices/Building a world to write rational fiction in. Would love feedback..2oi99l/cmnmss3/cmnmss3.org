"And that, Mr. Moore," concluded the head of the review committee, "is why we will not be approving these /ridiculous deathtraps/ of yours."

"With respect, sir, that all sounds rather farfetched-"

"Do you deny that the loss of either of the vessels will damn the other, and doom the mission to failure without rapid improvisation from the survivors?"

"Well, that's true, but-"

"That alone throws your credentials into question! If we are already sending two ships to a system /known to be poor in certain resources/, then the first city-sized ship shall be a /giant robotic supply crate/ and whatever autonomous asteroid mining equipment we have available. The star system should lack nothing by the time the first living soul arrives, and then /Leviathan/ will have its own industrial equipment /anyway/, because having a generation ship that is not self-sufficient is /lunacy/."

"Actually, sir, that can't be done," said Mr. Moore. He had run the numbers on this. "With the population we have to support, we're already close to the mass limit of the-"

"So lower the population! Or are you already so near the population viability limit that a single sector hull breach could kill the mission? Even if it were so close - which would get your proposal denied all on its own - there's a genetic engineering suite onboard. God's sakes, man, you're growing deer in test tubes! Include human DNA - genetic colonists - and we can maintain an /arbitrarily large/ genetic population for an arbitrarily small headcount. Genetic viability is not a concern.

"/Furthermore/," the head continued as Mr. Moore flinched, "What is this nonsense about being unable to build a space colony? Generation ships /are/ space colonies! And this contraption had /better/ be able to build a copy of /every single part of itself/, or else it will already be doomed by centuries of compounding minor mechanical problems."

"But the-"

"Granted," the man waved him off before he could even speak the obvious objection. "The main drive system and fuel are not so easily replaced. But onboard repair mechanisms alone ought to be able to build a fully functional space colony given adequate resources, if not an interstellar ship. And as an engineer, a lack of resources would be /your fault,/ because /everything/ is your fault. Thinking of it, /Leviathan/ itself would serve as a quite serviceable counterweight for a space elevator, don't you think? That's cheaper, easier, and safer than messing with shuttles, and the mass of a carbon nanotube cable is practically negligible to a city-ship, even if it isn't built in to the solar sails. Hell, you could genetically engineer spiders to build more on-site, as a backup, and have your shuttles as a backup for /that/."

Mr. Moore gulped. He hadn't thought of that.

The head of the review committee sighed, and some of the venom left him. "Look, Mr. Moore, I applaud your terraforming plans. It took cyanobacteria two hundred million years to terraform Earth. Even with intelligent oversight, getting it down to a single century is as impressive as anything I've seen. But I must advise you to include basic knowledge of /mosquito nets/ into all future documentation, and I urge you to recognize how extremely useful /airlocks/ are on a barely habitable rock. That's the least of it. Your plan could fail in a /dozen/ places, in a /dozen/ ways, with /no/ backup. You could /get thousands of people killed/. We are engineers. Imagining the worst case scenario and stopping it from ever coming about /is our job/. I'm sorry, Mr. Moore. I am placing you on administrative leave pending investigation for continued employment."
