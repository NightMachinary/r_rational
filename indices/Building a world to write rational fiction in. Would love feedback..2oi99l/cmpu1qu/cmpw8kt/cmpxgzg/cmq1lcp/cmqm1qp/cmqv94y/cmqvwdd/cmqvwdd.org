I see no reason why they wouldn't have placed weather and communication satellites. If fact I'd guarantee they did. Unfortunately, after a couple thousand years, they've de-orbited and burned up in atmosphere.

Earth sent one pair of colony ships to all four known lifeless rocky worlds with significant quantities of liquid water around single, stable stars.

As for the resource-poor system, yes, it was done intentionally. There are three gas giants and a single rocky planet in orbit around this star. The gas giants have, over the billions of years, either collected almost every bit of matter in the star system, or perturbed the orbit of other masses in the solar system sufficiently to cause them to enter a solar-intersecting orbit, or a system departure orbit. (That's why I put three gas giants in the system.) From what I know about solar system formation (not an expert, just enough to be dangerous to myself!!) The question of how the planet Secundus managed to survive solar system formation without being torn apart is probably more appropriate!
