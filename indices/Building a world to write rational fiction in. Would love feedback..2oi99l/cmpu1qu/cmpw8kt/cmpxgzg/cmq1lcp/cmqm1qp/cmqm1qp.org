Thank you for looking at the idea, and forcing me to think about things from a different angle. As for the Orion system, that's a straightforward science thing. Nuclear Salt Water Rockets are like a continuously operating Orion system rather than a pulse power system. It's literally a nuclear rocket, not a chemical one.

As for the decision to leave space temporarily. The colonists did not feel rushed. They were developing the planet, which had no alien life forms, just Earth life forms. After so much time had passed, and everything seemed to be doing exactly what it was supposed to, they consolidated to the planet.

They prioritized. With the status of humanity unknown, they put 100% effort into building a stable, solid planetary base. They had the technology to build the tools to build the tools to get themselves off planet again, and that was what they were doing, building a foundation.

There was no significant concern about the planet itself somehow becoming a problem. To the community of the Leviathan, a few hundred years on the planet was just a bump in the road, part of the plan to make certain their community had what it needed, before it went back into space.

Living in space is all well and good, but space is inherently dangerous, and the star system they found themselves in was terribly poor in accessible materials. There were a couple small moons around gas giants, and the large moon of Secundus. No vast belt of mineral richness between Mars and Jupiter like the Sol system boasted.

Another Lindsay scenario (however unlikely) could doom the human race. On the planet, after the population was high enough and sufficiently spread around, ending the human race would be a completely different story. Especially with no way to drop projectiles from space. Again, racial survival trumped. The highest probability of survival with the lowest possibility of catastrophe or sabotage led them to put every human on the planet and keep them there for a while.

The development of the mites into metallivores was something that nobody considered. Genetic mutation was being watched for, and a few minor tweaks over time needed to be made, but the genetic alterations made on the planet had, in general, been stable for a very long time. The metallivore trait was not even imagined as a possible genetic mutation.

I'll need to adjust the history to clarify the decisions, I see.
