Nope, didn't read the blog version at first. The original was enough of a wall'o'text that I wasn't willing to invest more time, and I expected it to be a reasonable summary -- so, my bad. Anyway, I've now skimmed through the blog and caught the answers to some of what I asked, but not most of it.

I still don't buy it.

#+begin_quote
  The total mass of each ship was 1.85e+10kg.
#+end_quote

Assuming I'm doing my math correctly, that works out to over nine million tons, the size of one of the largest Orion drive ships that were speculated about back in the 1950s. (Which begs the question "why weren't they using an Orion drive?" but that can be handwaved as "no one was willing to weaponize space to that degree")

This mass most definitely includes machine shops, electronics labs, etc in order to maintain the ship itself. Adding whatever else you need to make a fully functional tech base should end up being a rounding error. The one thing that they /might/ plausibly not have had would be a chipfab; I don't know how mass intensive those are. If they didn't have one, though, they would have had a crapton of spare chips for maintaining the ship. Why would you send two ships that were both single points of failure?

A simpler solution would be to say that there was only one ship and it /was/ self-sufficient, but it was stratified -- all of the industry was in the back part, the genetic stock and equipment in the middle, and the living spaces in the front. (Or whatever other arrangement you prefer.) Lindsay blew up or otherwise crippled the industrial segment.

Sticking with your original design, however, I then have the following other issues:

#+begin_quote
  It took a hundred years of lean times before the population of Leviathan became stable at the capacity it was recommended for.
#+end_quote

When they arrived, Leviathan was capable of sustaining the existing population base, and they had the industrial equipment and spare parts to maintain the ship and the shuttles -- in other words, they had everything required to build a tech base.

Since they had plenty of time left on the life support, there was no rush to go down to the planet. They spent a hundred years terraforming before anyone actually landed, then another hundred years getting established, having kids, and stripping Leviathan. They had plenty of time before the sand mites hit, and there's no sign that Leviathan was running out of carrying capacity at that point.

So, they weren't short on time, machines, or parts. They also had multiple shuttles and a BOATLOAD of fuel for them. (They were making multiple round trips into a (near)Earth-normal gravity field -- they had to have had a huge amount of fuel.) So, their in-system mobility wasn't limited.

Why not spend a few decades -- or, shoot, a century or two -- establishing space infrastructure before landing? The alternative is that they landed heavy construction machinery, powerplants, and fuel in order to build the first settlement -- I pretty much guarantee that a bunch of interstellar settlers did not clear land and build houses with axes and shovels, then light their homes with candles. No, they had full electrical systems from the get-go, and generators are heavy. Why land a generator when you could put all the energy-supply systems in orbit and beam the power down?

Sure, maybe they couldn't make a space elevator with what they had onboard or could easily build, but they could make all the other sorts of space infrastructure I mentioned.

But, ok, let's say they didn't do that for some reason. So, they had no sand-mite-free zones in orbit.

Then you have the geography problem. They were on the ground for a hundred years before the sand mites hit. People would have been spread out -- there would have been multiple genetic labs, biological study stations, small communities that had their own machine shops, etc.

Since this is a small-continents-and-multiple-islands world, there would have been people living and working on various islands and other isolated communities (doing scientific research, extracting particular biological or mineral resources, etc), as well as possibly the floating arcologies I already mentioned. The sand mites would not have evolved all over the planet simultaneously, they would have hit one place. Yes, as you said, all the genetic labs in that place were wiped out before they knew what was going on, but it's not plausible that every genetic lab on the planet was wiped out simultaneously.

#+begin_quote
  Some of the last equipment to come from the Leviathan had been the computers and equipment used for genetic engineering.
#+end_quote

They were living on the planet, and continuing to terraform it, for a hundred years and there were no computers or genetic engineering labs on the planet? That's hard to believe.

Again, the stonepunk idea is pretty interesting, but I'm not sure how you're going to get there if people had to take a generation ship. An alternative might be to set it on Earth instead -- the generation ships were launched, this led to a massive war and civilization collapsed. Your metallivore sand mites were a bioweapon deployed as part of the war; it was intended that all the ones that were deployed would be sterile so that no one had to worry about them spreading but, unfortunately, a few breeding pairs slipped through and they spread world-wide, carried on all the shipping and airplanes so they were everywhere before anyone knew what was going on.

An X years later, people are trying to rebuild civilization, but all of the on-land metals have been eaten. All of the easily accessible metals on Earth were mined out centuries ago and current level of civilization does not support the machinery necessary to do the necessary deep mining.

Setting it somewhere in Polynesia or possibly Australia would give you pretty much the scenario you're looking for -- low population, no nearby metals, the only accessible land is a couple of small continents (AU and NZ) and a bunch of islands.

Doing it this way would take out all of your cool backstory, but I don't think that part is necessary for the story you're trying to tell -- as you said, all of the generation ship stuff is ancient history by the time of your story, since you are setting it "nearly two thousand years after the mites consumed the [metals]".
