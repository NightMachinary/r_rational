Well, ok. Stonepunk is an interesting idea and the stories you write will probably be interesting. I don't buy your backstory, but that's not critical to enjoying the story itself. I will point out that you are relying on the following chain of events:

1. Only four eligible planets were found
2. A colony effort was sent to a terrible candidate planet instead of sending the resources to a better choice
3. Two ships were sent, both of which were specialized to the point that they could not replace each other's functions
4. On the way, someone went crazy and destroyed one of the ships
5. When they got there, the colonists decided to abandon space (even if they intended to go back later) instead of using it as a source of metals, power, etc
6. After they got there, someone went crazy and destroyed all the technology using bioweapons
7. After 100 years on the surface, the planetary population was still concentrated enough that this was feasible
8. All of the industrial base and genetics labs had low enough security / decon practices that this was feasible

Looking at it, I'm not actually sure why the existence and/or destruction of the Prometheus matters...even if it /had/ arrived safely and they /had/ had a good industrial base, wouldn't the mites still have destroyed it all?

Anyway, doesn't matter. I'll look forward to whatever you write. Stonepunk isn't something I've seen before.
