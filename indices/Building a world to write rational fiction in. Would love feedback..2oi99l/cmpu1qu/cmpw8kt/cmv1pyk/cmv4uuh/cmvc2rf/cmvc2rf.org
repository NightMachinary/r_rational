The generation ship only holds so many people. While this is also the case with a planet, the upper limit is much lower.

The specialized equipment meant to be the "seed stock" of the industrial base required for a low iron / low mineral planet and a solar system with sparse resources was contained in Prometheus. Leviathan was the biological powerhouse. Prometheus was the industrial powerhouse. Either could have survived and created a colony without the other, because they both had all the knowledge required to rebuild human technology stored in absurd redundancy, but each of them had specialized equipment designed to make their half of the work easier.

I think I have said at some point that if Leviathan had been lost, the colony wouldn't have survived. I need to back off from that, because it would be irrational to design the ships that way. Prometheus would have started a colony on Secundus' moon. They would then begin building an industrial base. After a while, they would have the spare industry to terraform the planet, using equipment and techniques drawn from their knowledge base. Chemicals and elements required for organics would be retrieved from planetary atmospheres.

Remember that even without the Prometheus, the colonists were extremely technically advanced, and more than capable of small to medium sized projects. Earth based solar power is not the most efficient way to do it, but it was easy. Just like cropland, the humans were not required to do all the dirty work. Solar arrays were tended by machine.

Before the technology crash, most of the sweating humans did was during exercise to stay in shape, or sports for the fun of it, rarely for actual labor. Everyone got the calories they needed to survive, basic shelter, and basic clothing and household supplies no matter what they did. More than that required that they contribute something to society.

Your statement about the decon is something I struggled with too, at first I wanted it to be a mistake, but later I realized that would be pretty absurd. Not only that, but an accidental release of a few mites or a natural outbreak would probably not have the impact I want, so I have decided that one of the lead geneticists will actually have neo-luddite tendencies. This is not a belief they have always held, it is an outgrowth of worry about the future of the colony and the past of Earth. After the ecology is self correcting, he is going to sabotage the tech base, using organisms. In order to break down technology to start with, he will have to use more than just mites, I think, but the other biological elements of his attack on technology would be short term, unable to breed. The mites, or something like them, would be long term, to keep technology from re-developing.

As mentioned elsewhere, Lots of really good comments and observations folks, thank you all very much.
