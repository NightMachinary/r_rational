Consider the advantages of a planet:

-No need to mass-shield everything against radiation.

-Less energy and resources devoted to transport and thermal regulation. You can just let something sit on land. In space, absolutely everything must have remass and an energy source to move around.

-Solar power satellites are interesting... but the energy produced is directly proportional to surface area of solar panel you have. You can just lay them out on grids on a planet's surface, you know...

-Floating ecologies have more points of failure than a land-based colony. Rust, wear-and tear, floatability, sinking... you can do away with all that, and you'd want your options to be as secure as possible during your initial stages of colonization. Plus, they have incentive for off-shore ecologies until the sandmites show up. Harvesters for sea-iron would start on seabed deposits, which could be operated from the shorelines.

-Appropriate decon might not be available after the sandmite catastrophe has passed. the correct procedure is to starve out the sand mites, then melt them into slabs of metal.
