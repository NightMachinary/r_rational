Why would a machine virus 'chill out'? The very idea that the hancers can relent kind of ruins the whole... relentless thing which was what made them kind of scary in the first place. It's weak- like if a paperclipper paperclipped a third of the Milky Way and went 'alright, yeah, I'm good'. I feel like the author just wanted an excuse to put in a bunch of uninfected dudes so alien machine viruses could infect them for artificial existential horror, rather than buckling down and committing to the logical consequences of all factors involved.

Tl;dr: I don't feel like this satisfies the sane/consistency check for rational fiction or the 'nothing happens because of the plot' requirement.
