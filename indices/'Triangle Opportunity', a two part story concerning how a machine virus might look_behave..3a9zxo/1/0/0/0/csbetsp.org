You're right that the E-Hancer is too simple to make a decision like that. It doesn't. The human brain it's controlling does. Hard concept to articulate.

Imagine a complex intelligence completely under the control of an extremely simple one. The complex intelligence is not in the driver's seat, it's just a tool. Whatever the rudimentary intelligence wants, the complex one then devises the best way to achieve it. The simple controller doesn't have to be smart, because it's got the whip hand over something that is.
