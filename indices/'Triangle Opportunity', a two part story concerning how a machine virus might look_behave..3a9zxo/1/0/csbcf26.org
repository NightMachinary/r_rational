Shortages of E-hancers due to war with the C-Hanced. That particular part is intended to be a metaphor for how religions chill out as they grow older, no longer torturing or killing heretics/apostates. The in-story reasoning is that they'll abide the existence of the dehanced long enough to manufacture enough E-hancers to bring them back into the fold, rather than killing them all.
