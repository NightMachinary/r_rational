I seem to be in the minority of people who didn't like Twig that much. Don't get me wrong, it's clear Wildbow's skill as a writer has improved /a lot/; the dialogue feels much more organic than Worm or Pact, he seems to have gotten over his discomfort of writing romance and the pacing is well-managed. The characters are also very well-written, but imo Wildbow has always done that well. That said, for the strengths in writing at a fine-scale I think the storytelling wasn't as good. It felt disjointed and many of the arcs didn't serve much of a purpose. A lot of them are just 'The characters go go the next city and defeat a new enemy there'. I think Twig is less about what the characters do and more about how they change, and I get that some people like that but I felt like it was less entertaining. I'm still glad it exists because Wildbow has gained some great experience and I really want to see how he applies that to the Worm universe.
