Pact is around 950,000 words; Worm is a little less than 1,700,000 words; and Twig is a bit less than 1,600,000 words (now, but I imagine there's enough left that it'll break that number). Unless the epilogue arc is really long, it won't surpass Worm, but it's definitely a lot closer than Pact is.

I binged it up until 19.4, and then read it as it was published for the 34 chapters since that (so, 17 weeks). It was fantastic both ways, but I preferred reading it as it was published, because it meant I could take part in the discussion threads on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]]. I'm not sure if the same would be true for something like Worm 2, though, since Twig has a lot more mysteries for the reader to solve than Wildbow's other works did.

Twig is probably my favorite of Wildbow's works. The other two do certain things better, but I didn't get as attached to the characters in Worm or Pact as I did in Twig, and I've seen a lot of people voice a similar sentiment.
