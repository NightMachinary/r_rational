No epub, as Wilberblow wishes to publish his books eventually and having copies of his works online downloadable makes publishers less likely to want his books. But, compiling Twig into your own epub is fine (as long as you don't share it with others) so feel free to do that if you wish~ source: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/6cusa0/wildbow_ebook_scraper_question/dhxi3jf/]]
