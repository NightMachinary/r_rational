It's "rational" but not "rationalist", in the sense that the characters are do things that a real-life person would think to do in their circumstances, and think about their problems in genuinely effective ways.

So, to give an example, when a white hole pops out of their spell for /finding a lost pen/ that accidentally transported them to some kind of freaky other dimension and gave them a vision, and the white hole says that a named artifact of some sort has gone missing... what do our two young wizards do? That's right: they go find some +Senior+ Advisory Wizards and ask for their help and expertise.
