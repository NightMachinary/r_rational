This is one of my favorite young adult fantasy series. Its not strictly rational fiction of course, but few fictions recommended on this sub truly are. Its also one of the few settings that has entropy as the big bad and a pretty awesome afterlife.

If you like interesting magic systems with interewting world building you should defiently check it it out.
