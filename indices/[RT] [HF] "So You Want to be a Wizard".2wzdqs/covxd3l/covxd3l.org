[Spoiler-ish, but not really]

I loved the series as a kid, though EY's reference to it didn't quite make sense to me. Unless I'm misremembering, the book was notable for its LACK of traditional big, powerful, magic (ex: wish granting). Wizard spells didn't just come from thin air, they needed components and work, and they weren't that powerful. They were just more tools for the protagonists, which is one of the things I most liked about it.

Can someone elucidate?
