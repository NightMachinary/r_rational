What I mean is that quite a bit of young adult writing is written at a much lower writing level than I'm comfortable reading, not just in terms of vocabulary, but also required reading comprehension. Characters show their emotions on their sleeves, plots get laid out three times over so the young adult never misses anything, there's no complexity to the sentence structure, all subtlety is thrown out the window, etc. That might be fine for young adults, but as a full-grown adult (with an English degree no less) I find that style a little maddening to read.
