I've read Golden Compass. I highly reccomend it. It's part of the [[http://www.amazon.com/Materials-Omnibus-Golden-Compass-Spyglass/dp/0375847227][His Dark Materials]] trilogy. The most non-spoiler version of it I can give is that it takes place in an alternate universe Oxford where people have a personal animal companion that acts as a physical manifestation of their soul. And if you're worried about religious themes ruining a good time, read this quote from the author:

  I suppose technically, you'd have to put me down as an agnostic. But if there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against.
