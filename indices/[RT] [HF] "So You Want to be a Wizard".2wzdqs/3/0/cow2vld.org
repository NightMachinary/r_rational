Examples of the big stuff below - but note that everything has a cost, and for the most impressive stuff it's often someone's life. Or there are special circumstances... but even then, someone will probably die of it.

In the first book Nita casts a spell to permanently separate a volume of space from creation, rendering it immune to everything up to interdimensional travel or retroactive changes to history - at the cost of an unspecified portion of her lifespan.

In the third, various people travel more than ten trillion lightyears - they're trying to escape their pursuer by getting outside the observable universe... and it works for almost 24 hours.

Book four features the Four Treasures of Ireland, weapons or devices that embody the ideal of a classical element. The Spear (Luin, fire) is reforged using iron portalled in from the heart of a first-generation star - any newer iron has lost too much of it's potency to survive the forging.

Five includes lessons in finding and commanding the "kernel" of a planet or universe, which grants control over the fundamental rules of that place - from gravity to possible topics of conversation.

Later we see management of stars, creation of universes, halting the expansion of space, moving civilisations millions of years through time, and more.
