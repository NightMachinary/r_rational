As far as we know, the phrase is as meaningless as "next December 32nd". We can try to extrapolate ways in which the statement could have meaning: in case of December 32nd, you could say that it's the day after December 31st, so it's January 1st. Or maybe it's an odd calendar which used December instead of February as the leap month, in which case it would be December 31st of the next leap year. Or something else still.

Looking into the blind spot may involve looking at the physical blind spot of the retina inside your eye, or it may involve the optical lobe not having the standard human method of filling in the blind spot, but instead (optionally?) having it show an image of the verification text. Or something else entirely.
