Jesus was born of a virgin birth, and He was the Earthly form of His father, God.

Jalaketu West was born of a virgin birth, and he was named for his father (according to a comment on the chapter site).

Theory: just as Jesus was God in Earthly form, Jalaketu West is Comet West in Earthly form. They're both technically the Comet King.
