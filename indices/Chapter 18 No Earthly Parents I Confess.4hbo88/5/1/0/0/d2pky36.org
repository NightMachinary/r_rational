To be fair... every single chapter has been posted on this subreddit, as they've been written. The majority of people reading it because of this subreddit are not reading ab initio, but have been following the story for some time, and are using these threads to discuss the ongoing work. Pretty much every single thread in this subreddit where people include "chapter X" in the title are used more for discussing the specific chapter than for introducing the work as a whole, and only extremely rarely do these 'chapter notification threads' include a description of the work as a whole.
