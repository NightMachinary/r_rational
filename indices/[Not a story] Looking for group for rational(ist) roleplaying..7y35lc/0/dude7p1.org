I'd be interested; it's been a while since I've done play-by-post, and I'm missing it.

That being said, reddit isn't the best platform for it. Maybe we could gather players here, then move to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/][sufficientvelocity]] or [[https://forums.spacebattles.com][spacebattles]] instead for the actual RP? I know there's a lot of overlap between [[/r/rational]] users and people in the SB/SV/AH/^{^{^{^{QQ}}}} crowd.
