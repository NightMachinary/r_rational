It's something I'd be interested in: the story I'm writing at the moment is based on OC freeform roleplaying that I've been doing /basically/ for the last 15 years, previously over MSN and more recently over google docs. Problem is I might have a hard time with immersion given the setting (i.e. I'm really fussy), and I tend to prefer character-based stories than munchkining-based stories.
