I occasionally run a play-by-post murder mystery roleplay in a futuristic setting with a few of its own "rules," in that certain fictional technologies are available. In terms of rationality, I did my best to write a "smart" killer, and to set up the clues in such a way that the players can systematically eliminate suspects and solve the mystery through careful observation and deduction (or, in the case of the killer's player, manipulate and mislead everyone to their advantage). The game lasts for two IRL weeks and players can post at their leisure. It's not exactly what you described, but is that something you (or anyone else here) would be interested in?
