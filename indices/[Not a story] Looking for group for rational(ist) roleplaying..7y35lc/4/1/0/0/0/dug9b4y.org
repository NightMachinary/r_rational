Yeah, it's the same mystery every time with a different player group. It's pretty complicated (comprehensive timelines for each player, a map, shitload of clues, etc), so it would be prohibitively time-consuming to write a new one each time.

If you'd like, I can PM you the main game document. That should give you a sense of what it's like without spoiling anything.
