QQ is [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/][Questionable Questing]].

It split off from SB before SV did. There is an overlap in the userbases of the these three sites, but QQ's is definitely the smallest.

Most significantly, there is a distinct lack of a puritan administration, so a lot of NSFW or boderline-NSFW content that would go to SB or SV, if it were allowed, gets posted on QQ instead. (You need to be logged-in to access QQ's NSFW sections).
