I'd be interested, though it's already becoming apparent there's probably too many people interested in being players for this to work as any normal game. So maybe set up a discord or something and hopefully there will be a 1:4/5 ratio of people who want to GM to those who want to play and people can split off into groups of manageable sizes.
