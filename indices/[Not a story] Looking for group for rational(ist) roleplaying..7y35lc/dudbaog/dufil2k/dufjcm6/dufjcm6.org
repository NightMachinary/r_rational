Not sure I'd be interested in /running/ a game, I mean I /could/, but the only game I'd be interested in /running/ would be a very self-centered one concerning my urban fantasy setting, and that's not nearly well-developed to allow character creation or proper munchkinry: really you need a fanfic setting. I /suppose/ I could do Stargate...

That said, I do have experience GMing nWoD and a couple of "single session pickup systems" IRL and I like to think I do quite well at it. I'm not sure how much of the GM role transfers to a play-by-post setting?

Really I'm not sure I have time to run anything. If anyone wants to invite me to one of theirs feel free. (And thus, inertia reigned supreme)
