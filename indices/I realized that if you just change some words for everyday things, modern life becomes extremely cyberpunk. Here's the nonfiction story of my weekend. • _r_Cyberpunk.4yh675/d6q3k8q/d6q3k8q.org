Your story sounds awesome, and while it sounds like your life is more cyberpunk than the average person, it makes me feel a real joy and curiosity about your "setting" that I am indescribably happy to know I can sate by educating myself. It brings the escape of fiction to the grounding of nonfiction, and vice-versa. Congradulations, this is the best piece of creative non-fiction I've read this year.
