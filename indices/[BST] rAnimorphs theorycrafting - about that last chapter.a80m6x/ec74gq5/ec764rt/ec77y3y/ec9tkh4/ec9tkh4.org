  The whole tech-curve thing is actually kind of interesting. The Andalites don't have any AI; and yet the Chee exist, so the technology is possible in universe.

I imagine that one thing that both the Ellimist and Crayak agree upon is squashing any kind of self-improving AI. They have phenomenal cosmic powers but even running a given person through thousands of simulations appears to take up /some/ kind of resource, so it may not be worth the effort for either of them to take the capabilities of an AI into account.
