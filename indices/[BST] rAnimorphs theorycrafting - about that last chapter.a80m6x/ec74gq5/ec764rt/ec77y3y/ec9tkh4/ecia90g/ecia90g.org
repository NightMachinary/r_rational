I think one of the rules of the game is that the Arbiter keeps an absolute monopoly on sentient AI; and the players can only give lesser species limited access to it, for technology like the /iscafil/ device and the Chee. (That could explain how the interlude about Rachel being a rounding error the players failed to predict connects with the Chee's blindspot around her.)

Meanwhile, the Arbiter is the only true self-improving AGI in the universe, and its utility function is something like, "Enforce the rules of the game, then update my values to exactly match those of the winning player"
