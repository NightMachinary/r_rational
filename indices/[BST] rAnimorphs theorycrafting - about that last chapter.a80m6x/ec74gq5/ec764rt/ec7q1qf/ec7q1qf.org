  Yeerks are even better at going up the tech curve.

It's not clear that canon yeerks invented many things though, it may basically /all/ be stolen or mildly tinkered tech from Andelites. Canon yeerks are also each unique individuals, grow up in constant sensory deprivation, and unable to communicate even with each other without a host. On top of that, their psychology is basically human, and their evil alignment is cultural and shaped by the unfortunate circumstances of their biology. It does makes a sort of sense for yeerks to be stupid.
