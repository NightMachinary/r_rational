  Realistically, Andalites should be so far ahead that a single Andalite Battleship should be able to take on every single ship the Yeerks manage to scrape together, yet Yeerks seem to be able to pull win after win through superior tactics and numbers, which kiiiiind of doesn't make sense?

My personal theory about this is that the Yeerks have had basically infinite good luck against the Andalites because they are important to both the Ellimist and Crayak's endgames. Cassie and the Ellimist foreshadow this a bit at the Yeerk pool when Cassie talks about how "two" is an unstable equilibrium, and conflicting values have to get resolved somehow or they destroy everything, and Ellimist mentions that Unity versus Harmony is one of the core value disagreements the game is designed to resolve.

I think Crayak's value is Unity, and he wins if Visser Three wins: every other mind in the universe except the Arn and the dogs is either enslaved by or absorbed into a single, omnipresent entity.

And Ellimist's value is Harmony: a universe of many different minds and voices that are independent enough to have their own identities and values, yet cooperative enough to not destroy each other. He wins if the Terra + Humanity symbiosis succeeds in finding that balance, and the Collaborator model spreads to the rest of the Yeerk empire and then the rest of the universe. (Remember all the way back when Ax and Temrash joined, they discovered that Yeerks only care about experiences, not having control, and there's no reason they couldn't all be "passengers".)

Some evidence for this:

- When V3 learns about the Ax-and-Temrash symbiosis he immediately identifies them as a critical threat, an alternative way the universe could end up at a stable equilibrium besides him dominating everything

    /THERE IS ANOTHER ONE?/

    Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill and Temrash three-one-three, they were back on the mesa, Tom and Jake and Tobias and Garrett and Rachel and Marco and Ax, and the Visser was with them, climbed inside with them, saw---

    He saw---

    The beginning of a new ending, a possibility to match his own, not one but two---

    That possibility, he must end at once.

    The challenger, the interloper, the upstart, the harbinger of doom, the Andalites must not know, the Yeerks must not know, it was obvious but they were all so stupid, none of them could see if he could just keep their eyes away for a little while longer---

- In the last interlude, Crayak notes Terra as one of the enemy's pieces (that seems like really strong evidence that Terra is actually a Good Guy), and "the further momentum toward cooperative symbiosis" as part of the enormously high cost of giving V3 the Howler blueprints.
