  but I do feel like it takes place in a setting where humans seem so completely out-gunned [...] mentally, that humans actually winning this story in any way [...] seems very unlikely.

Yeah, I had the same problem with canon Animorphs.

Like, you guys can enhance humans and give them better memory, exploit all /their/ knowledge, and become instant experts in anything by kidnapping people with the right background. Why do you keep acting like James Bong mooks and being outsmarted by a band of impulsive teenagers?

  Unless the fic expands on some way the human mind is actually better than the other two in some, important way

In canon there was:

- Humans are more creative and invent tech faster than Andalites (eg interval between "first heavier-than-year-aircraft" and "first space flight" was three times longer for Andalites). Though given what we see in the Chronicles, Yeerks are even better at going up the tech curve.

- Humans are Winston Churchill and they will keep fighting until there's nothing left but blood and ashes everywhere.

- There's a crapton of humans, and they outnumber every other species thousands-to-one.

  It might be that human minds aren't even clever enough to design the technology needed to defend themselves against Yeerks and Andalites in the future, even if they do manage to 'catch up' by reverse engineering stolen tech. Or at the very least, it might be that human minds aren't clever enough to design the tech fast enough to stay 'caught up'.

It's not really clear how the tech curve works in the Reckoningverse (there, I named it). It kind of seems to go up until hits a ceiling. Eg the Andalites and the Naharans have hyperspace travel and youth serums, but no AI or nanomachines for some reason. Realistically, Andalites should be so far ahead that a single Andalite Battleship should be able to take on every single ship the Yeerks manage to scrape together, yet Yeerks seem to be able to pull win after win through superior tactics and numbers, which kiiiiind of doesn't make sense?

Anyway, since the premise is that the one who wins the war is the one with the biggest fleet of space fighter jets, humanity does have a fair shot at securing its independence short-term. The problem is how we deal with Terra without it getting its hooks in.
