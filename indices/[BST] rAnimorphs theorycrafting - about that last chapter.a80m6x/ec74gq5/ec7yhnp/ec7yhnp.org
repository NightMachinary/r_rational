It doesn't depend on humanity really. It depends on the Ellimist, Crayak, and where their respective endgames leave us. I'd be surprised if humans "win" via coming out on top of a power struggle like in canon, we win by subtly nudging the final balance towards something we like. That might mean shifting Yeerk politics, Andelite politics, etc.

I should also note that this author really likes the idea of victory won by small nudges and scraps (which the Ellimist character is perfectly made to provide, since his whole game is victory via very minor intervention at key points)
