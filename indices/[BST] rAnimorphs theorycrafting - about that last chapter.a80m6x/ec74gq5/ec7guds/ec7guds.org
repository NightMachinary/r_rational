  For all we know, they might have an addictive biology. It would make sense evolutionarily, to give out some sort of drug that make their host want to get back and get infested again (it might also explain why Tobias couldn't quite tell why he wanted to become a Collaborator).

Disagree, Tom has so far shown no desire at all to become a Collaborator, and he had Temrash in his head for a much longer time.

  A big theme of the story so far has been trust.

I think Tobias' decision is to do with this. He feels that Garett's trust in him is misplaced, and by becoming a Collaborator he can maybe...split the burden of responsibility?

  Most humans have become vulnerable to being Controlled for arbitrary periods of time. Yeerks can't be forced out of them by 3-day quarantine anymore.

So if you drag a suspected Controller over to Terra and say 'hey Terra, ya mind sticking a rope of yourself into this person's ear?', I think that could forcefully remove a Yeerk. This is a kinder method too, by their standards.

One thing that hasn't been tested yet - the group has tried to morph shards (unsuccessfully) but now they have a coalescion that might agree to be morphed. Assuming E/C doesn't interfere of course. I hope the group realizes that after the David fiasco they should probably morph check more than once, or on a regular basis. It would also force the influencing party to do a bigger trade as I'd imagine that influencing more parties frequently to block a morph check would require more effort from E/C.
