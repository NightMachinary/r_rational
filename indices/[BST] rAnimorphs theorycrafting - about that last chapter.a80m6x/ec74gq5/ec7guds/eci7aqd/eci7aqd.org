Does anyone else think it's time for The Reckoning to have its own subreddit? I've had a lot of thought/questions about this and past chapters, and not posted them because they're not organized enough for one big post; and I don't want to spam the subreddit (or worse, come off as pressuring the author to write faster) by making lots of smaller ones.
