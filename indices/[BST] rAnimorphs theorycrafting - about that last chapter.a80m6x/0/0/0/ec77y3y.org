Very nice points. Though I now feel compelled to be a bit more fair to Reckoning, and point out that the premise; the idea of humanity getting kicked off its usual pedestal in fiction and getting involved in an interstellar in which they were more of a natural resource to be fought over than an actual player, was what got me into the story in the first place.

Anyways, I do hope the fic does go deeper into the whole creativity thing. I vaguely remember something from canon about the human brain having two hemispheres actually being unique in the universe, and that other species simply weren't capable of the same kind of self-reflection humans were. Though, judging from the Ax chapters in this fic, that doesn't seem to be the case in Reckoning: though again I think I remember reading something about the Andalite telepathy (either in the comments, or in the story itself) actually slowing down Andalite scientific/cultural progress, because its much harder to get rid of bad ideas when everybody is constantly reinforcing them with what could be literal, telepathically enforced group-think.

One of the things I liked most about canon, was how much effort it put into showing diversity of thought. Canon really fleshed out how different species thought, and that gave it a distinctive feel that other Sci-Fi stories lacked. Reckoning has taken that a bit further, by actually having individual characters morph each other, and see how each other think; something I found, and still find, really, really cool. I just wish it would 'zoom back out' a bit, and really highlight what makes humans different. My experience reading the Eragon series back in school has really soured me against reading books where certain groups just seem increasingly, objectively better than others.

Though again, part of what makes the Yeerks such scary villains, is precisely how much of an existential threat they are. In a world without functional, general AI, Yeerk Pools really are the closest thing the universe has to a super-intelligence; and that's terrifying.

The whole tech-curve thing is actually kind of interesting. The Andalites don't have any AI; and yet the Chee exist, so the technology is possible in universe. Maybe they just have an embargo against it? I mean, they still do make advances; Seerow did invent morphing after all, and it was a novel creation. Though, then again, Ax does say that if the other Andalites (or even Seerow) himself truly understood what morphing meant, they never would have made it (cuz it deviates too much from The Path), so maybe their culture greatly restricts the progress of their science? Though if the Reckoning verse follows Moore's Law of Mad Science, that might be a pretty realistic image of a hyper-advanced society.
