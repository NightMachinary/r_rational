/The Hork Bajir Chronicles/ explain that Bug Fighters, Dracon beams and the Blade Ship were reverse-engineered from Andalite tech:

#+begin_quote
  We suspect that they have built fourteen fighter craft, based on a new design but similar in capabilities to your own Andalite fighters. These fighters are armed with two Dracon beam weapons, a blending of Andalite shredder technology with some Ongachic particle-wave technology.

So these fighters are based on scavenged technology, yet a dozen of them is enough to give the Andalite military pause, which lends credence to the idea in /The Reckoning/ that "a hundred fighter jets could make a real dent in the war".
