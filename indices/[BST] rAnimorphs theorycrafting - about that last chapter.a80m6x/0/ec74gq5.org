I do love Animorphs the Reckoning, but I do feel like it takes place in a setting where humans seem so completely, and outrageously out-gunned, not just technologically, but mentally, that humans actually winning this story in any way, as opposed to 'not losing', seems very unlikely.

The Andalites are super genius telepaths. The Chee are immortal, super strong, hyper advanced androids. The Yeerk Pools are actual, literal super-intelligences, hampered only by their need for hosts, and the lag inherent in their perspective, caused by how hosts need to physically report back. All of the above (if I remember correctly) have access to technology that means that, if they decided to wage war on the planet Earth, they could probably win.

And, to go even further, in this scenario, the entire human species seems outmatched, on a purely biological level. Individual humans can't compete with individual Andalites. Groups of humans can't even begin to compete with the efficiency and intellect of a Yeerk pool. Unless the fic expands on some way the human mind is actually better than the other two in some, important way, there might not actually be a way for Earth to ever actually compete/be a truly sovereign state. Sovereignty to me, in this setting, means being able to defend yourself, and it might not be that Earth doesn't have the technology to defend itself from the aliens. It might be that human minds aren't even clever enough to design the technology needed to defend themselves against Yeerks and Andalites in the future, even if they do manage to 'catch up' by reverse engineering stolen tech. Or at the very least, it might be that human minds aren't clever enough to design the tech fast enough to stay 'caught up'.

(Note: I haven't gone back over Reckoning in a while, so my ideas of how smart Andalites are might be biased by canon; I can't remember for certain if Andalites are still super geniuses in this fic)

Its weird to say, but the best, most independent future for humanity, in this setting, might be to become voluntary extensions of the Terran Yeerk Pool; to basically become an entire species of Collaborators. In canon, it was the Yeerks that were forced to accept 'species death', and live out the rest of their lives in new forms. It would be interesting for a fic to flip that on its head, and have it be humanity that has to accept a sort of 'species death', and turn into something else instead, just to survive.
