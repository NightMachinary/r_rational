I might participate in something like that, especially if there was some sort of compelling idea that formed the core of it. I am not a great writer, and have difficulty creating original characters and settings which are compelling - perhaps some sort of fanfiction type of thing might be easiest to persuade people to write?

Ideas, in no particular order - Maybe limit to a single setting for each contest so another setting can be used for a similar idea at a later date?

- Immanentize the Eschaton. Write up a fic where a protagonist brings about the end of the world by singularity, on purpose or by accident. Good end (utopia) or bad end (paperclips) or mediocre end (something stops it) all accepted.
- Munchkinism. Write up a fic where a protagonist tries to win at a setting by exploiting something. Both good ends (winning) and bad ends (defeat) accepted. Distinct from above because more likely trying to defeat a BBEG or whatever rather than revolutionize the world.
- Deconstructionism. How would a setting really look like or be? Subideas - a 'man in the street' fic where the events from HP or Worm or something are viewed from someone not central to them.
- Mystery story - with hints that make it solvable before the end, then the solution in spoilers. Puzzles that are solvable by very close reading and have solutions based on people acting like people and things happening as they likely would.

I am not super enthusiastic about the Frozen story, as I think the core characters of Anna and Elsa are basically not good choices for interacting or understanding a singularity-type story, and further there's nowhere for the singularity to go laid out, and the whole writing prompt starts with what feels like very OOC actions from a Frozen protagonist. Also, the 'reward' in that thread would likely require sufficient effort in setting up/learning software and interacting with exchanges and third parties to ultimately make actually extracting like $10 or whatever totally not worth the time.
