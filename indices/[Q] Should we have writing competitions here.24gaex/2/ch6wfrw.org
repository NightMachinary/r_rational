To me, one main barrier to this appears. Rationalist stories take significant more time to write than other stories. If you're not already close familiar with, say, network security, you need to do some serious research to write a rationalist story about a hacker. With regular fiction you can get away with glossing over certain aspects or just invent concepts so you can techno-babble your way out of it.

Other time-sinks are working out your clever plots, munchkining, working out character motivations...

Maybe this comes very easy for others, but I'd lose a lot of time from weekly contests :-)
