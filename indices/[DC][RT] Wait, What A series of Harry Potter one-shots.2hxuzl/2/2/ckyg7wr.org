I can't imagine that JK Rowling intended everything that the fanfic's author kept pointing out, and felt a bit sorry for JK the way the author eviscerates her, but I really enjoyed reading the one-shots. I didn't read them as bashing the original fics, but as looking at what would have been real world if one took the implications to their logical conclusion.

I for one never thought through (the honestly terrifying) implications of the resurrection stone, Ginny's mentality (and this is the first fic that makes me think that Ginny and Harry are actually well suited for each other), Ron's wavering, Muggle baiting etc. I really enjoyed these thought-experiments and I was never able to read between the lines like the author was.
