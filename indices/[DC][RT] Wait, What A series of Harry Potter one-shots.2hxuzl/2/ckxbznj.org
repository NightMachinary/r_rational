Okay, I haven't yet read every chapter, but this whole thing seems to be mostly a long series of rants about how horrible the actions of characters in the canon are.

I've encountered this sort of things lots of times, but I don't know if it has a name. Is there a word like "bashfic" or something?

Either way I've always hated the genre. Even when the story is absolutely right that the sort of thing described would be horrible in real life (see Harry being raised by evil stepparents, see Neville dangled from a window by an uncle)... what is there to get from the fic in stating such obviousness? Yes, no sane school would ever send 11-year old students to the Forbidden Forest to track down the killers of unicorns. We know.

I feel that it's one thing to make a story which /includes/ challenging the nonsense like HPMoR does, but that it's another thing altogether to just have characters shout "You're evil people, all of you." time and again.

Mind you, there are a few good ideas there (like Chapter 14), and a few places where it slightly diverges from the formula (like chapter 6)
