Some of these are fairly clever, although as others have stated, a lot of this critisism isn't that meaningful.

Harry Potter clearly exists in a tradition of childrens literature set in boarding schools. It borrows liberally from the ideas of books from centuries ago, which is why it ends up with ludicrously unfair teachers and incredibly unpleasant parents. Obviously one could tear apart Roald Dahl using a similar critique, but that would be missing the point.

I like rational fiction, because it is lots of fun to see what happens when you try to build a logically coherent world. But you do need to actually have an emotional arc for the story to work well. For me the clearest demonstration of the contrast between simulationist and narrativist story telling are the light sabre fights in star wars as opposed to those in the prequels. The fights in the original trilogy are unshowy, and victory isn't really determined by swordplay: it's determined by emotional strength, particularly the fight in Return of the Jedi. Luke's technique there is terrible, and unshowy, but it really really works. In the prequels the sword fighting is more technically interesting, but emotionally unfufilling.

Obviously if you can succeed at story telling and having a logical world, I think you can get something pretty special. I think Metropolitan Man succeeds remarkably well on his front, managing to have a clear emotional arc for all its characters, while still managing to make a world that makes sense. The character's victory are emotional ones, but they are also ones that make sense.
