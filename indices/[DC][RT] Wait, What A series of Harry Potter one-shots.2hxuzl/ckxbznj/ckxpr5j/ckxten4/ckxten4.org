  And yes, I hate it too - I much prefer for authors to take the things that make no sense and do their best to either justify them or excuse them

It bothers me that you're wording it like these are exclusive things.

You can have a fic bashing things, it doesn't take away or lower the amount of fics were the things bashed are fixed. Half the things that people bash very well might not have even been considered by a lot of people, I know myself I didn't give a second thought to the burn hole through the tongue comment, so a handy list of "unexplained or clearly stupid things" might make for a lot more of the fics that you're looking for in any case as prospective authors read fics like these and take notes.
