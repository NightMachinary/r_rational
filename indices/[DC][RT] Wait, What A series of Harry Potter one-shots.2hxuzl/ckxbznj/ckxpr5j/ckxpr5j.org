The proper trope is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateFic][Hate Fic]]. And yes, I hate it too - I much prefer for authors to take the things that make no sense and do their best to either justify them or excuse them. Same with HPMOR actually. I would much rather have someone talk about how Quidditch came to be the way it was, or why people actually like it in spite of its flaws as a game, than just have Quidditch be repeatedly bashed as stupid.
