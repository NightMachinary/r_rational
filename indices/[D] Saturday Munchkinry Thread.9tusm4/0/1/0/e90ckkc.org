At the very least, if you can live past the singularity and get immortality, you can try to avert the heat death of the universe. A 5x5x5 inch cube of iron should be about 16 kg, which if completely annihilated is equivalent to 1.4 x 10^{18} Joules per day, or 1.7 Ã— 10^{13} watts, which is very close to the total amount of electricity used over the whole earth currently. So at the very least you could power a large colony forever, though whether it ended up housing thousands or trillions of people would depend on whether you have people walking around and needed to use power to grow food since you don't have stars anymore, or if everyone is uploaded into hyper-efficient computers.
