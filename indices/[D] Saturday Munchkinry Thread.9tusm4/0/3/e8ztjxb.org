Hmm, this is a good one. Simply having the iron doesn't seem to give you that much of an advantage. Iron's too common and it's too small of an amount to sell for anything useful, the scrap value of saving it up for a year only comes to about $600 through cursory Googling. Honestly whatever you could do with the iron itself seems to be a bit boring because you could probably end up with more iron by working a regular job and buying it.

So what you're left with is the interesting side effect of the power, namely:

#+begin_quote
  The cube will completely replace whatever fluids existed in its space prior, gas or liquid, including air. Any solids would block the power without "wasting" its use, but particles smaller than a millimetre are ignored.
#+end_quote

So as a starting point if something is gas, liquid, or you can shred it up into fine enough particles (I'm assuming this works on all fine powders?) you can completely remove it from existence. Next step is to figure out the most useful thing to remove given those conditions. For that though, I'd probably ask a material physicist or chemist. I personally can't figure out how to take over the world with this power, but what I'd probably do with it is help remove hazardous byproducts of chemical processes or experiments. I'm sure there has to be something small enough that being able to remove 25 cubic inches of it a day would be incredibly useful.

I'm also sure there has to be some kind of physics exploit if you can replace something extremely hot, cold, or maybe under pressure with a room temperature iron cube that's not.
