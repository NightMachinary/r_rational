  I can, with similar validity, assume that the power is being mediated by some god monitoring and modifying your three pounds of head meat. And if that's the case, major changes could mean the loss of the ability entirely.

That doesn't really work as an explanation since saying it's just mediated by a god would basically mean that how the power worked would be purely a matter matter of that god's whims and thus make the entire exercise of trying to figure out what this power could do utterly pointless.\\
Whereas if the power is following some self consistent internal logic then you run into the fact that every function of your brain is being brought into the timestop despite many of them changing dramatically over time (plus it never suggests if you had brain damage or weren't fully neurologically developed you would lose your power later). This means unless you make massive unfounded assumption about the power (such as it either stopping working pretty easily if your brain changes slightly, or those new parts of your mind being excluded from the timestop) it has to use a different standard than just only working if your minds substrate is similar enough to what it was when you got the power. And virtually every self consistent standard it /could/ be using easily allows one to ensure the power keeps working even with drastic changes to your mental substrate.

  My point is that you are trying to apply known-universe reasoning to deduce the under-the-hood mechanics of an ability that cannot function under known-universe reasoning. Anything you conclude about these mechanics will be the result of begging the question.

This isn't a matter of applying real world physics on the power, but on expecting the power to just work in a self consistent way, since otherwise this whole thread is an exercise in futility.
