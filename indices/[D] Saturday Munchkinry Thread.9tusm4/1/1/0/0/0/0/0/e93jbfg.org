  Except no this ability can't actually be a function of your body in any way.

You have no way of knowing this! There's no way for the ability to exist in the first place - why are you assuming that something impossible would use the logic of the possible? It's like saying "No, clearly Superman can't fly- he can just jump really high because he's strong." Yes, that would make sense given his powers - but there's no in-context reason that proves it to be the case, and when he eventually started flying there was a minimum of fuss.
