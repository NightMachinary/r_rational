The issue here I see mainly is that I've thought about this a fair bit and I can't come up with any possible self consistent way the power could work which would disallow you to change your mind dramatically. Without /also/ disallowing non-transhumans from keeping their powers in many circumstances that one should really expect to have been mentioned.
