It seems like there's two different benefits here, one short term one post-singularity. In the short term you could get quite wealthy from the fame associated with having the only documented supernatural ability, plus you could use the ability to massively assist in art. Since for instance you could make people who see a given sheet through a proxy see it as a perfect 3D screen with them just viewing the page through a display which wraps around their entire field of vision. This means that you can use this ability to create perfect visual VR movies with graphics and special effects all being indistinguishable from reality.\\
So by making people pay to see these VR movies (since you can only have one playing at a time) you could easily become one of the wealthiest people alive. After all as many people can pay to see these movies as currently spend money in the global film industry and people would probably be willing to pay far more for this, so overtaking Jeff Bezos in wealth seems possible for you.

The time stop power could also be used to beat the heat death of the universe if you live until anti-aging tech/a singularity. Since after all free computation is fundamentally equivalent to free energy and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon][can be turned into free energy]]. Notably since you can gain potentially infinite amounts of subjective time during this (so long as it's in /some/ way related to altering an A4 page's appearance) there's no limits on your potential energy outputs. Additionally in the far future when you would be a digital superintelligence, you could basically act as a hypercomputer. Able to run entire universes lasting for arbitrary subjective time.\\
So once heat death started to be a concern, in all likelihood it might just make sense to have the entire rest of digital civilization switched to being run by you. That way you could have everybody switch to existing in a timeless hypercomputer and thus not even worry about the physical/computational constraints of reality. Basically this would mean you could become a benevolent god running an entire multiverse of infinite universes full of utopian worlds for infinite time.
