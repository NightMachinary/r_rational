I suppose you could kill someone with this.

Just wait until they enter a water drinking contest, drink as much water as they can stand and win the first place prize, and have the cube appear in their bladder replacing the urine as you hoist them in the air by their hips out of "joy" for them winning.

Since bladders can inflate up to six inches in size, the cube should just fit in their body killing them.

EDIT: Nevermind. I just reread the requirements. I thought the cube could just appear between your hands no matter how wide the distance between your hands. I missed the part about having the hands in position to "hug" the corners.
