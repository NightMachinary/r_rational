Well if you live long enough to see anti-aging tech or a singularity developed then you could use this power to push back the heat death of the universe indefinitely. Since [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ][the mass energy in an iron cube of this size could power a digital civilization of truly stupendous size in the degenerate era]].

Plus in all likelihood since the 24 hours is probably based on your own subjective time you could generate vastly more energy output: Simply having your mind running extremely quickly (this is extremely effective but may not work if the power is only concerned with your relativistic reference frame), and by having the rest of your digital civilization orbiting extremely close to small black holes. This would effectively mean as far as they were concerned you are accelerated in time and producing energy much faster (with you being a digital lifeform at this point as well, so you could offset the time dilation with a faster clock speed).

In the short term however you could use this power to become extremely famous on the grounds of being the only documented supernatural phenomenon. This level of fame would automatically afford you enough wealth to live very comfortable without needing to work. Plus since your iron blocks are created magically people will probably be willing to pay a lot of money for them, even if there's nothing actually remarkable about them other than their method of creation.
