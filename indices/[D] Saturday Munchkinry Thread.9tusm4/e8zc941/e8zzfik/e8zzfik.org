Erase quantum information (e.g. replace some liquid/gaseous qbit with your cube). Example: prepare qbits in the state 1/sqrt(2)/(|01>-|00>), erase the second qbit: => 1/sqrt(2)/(|0x>-|0x>)=0 => universe destroyed. If you can't prepare your qbits in exactly that state (which should be the case) you merely made your own reality more "improbable" on a multiversal scale. Could still allow for weird trade and blackmail.

Fix 1: Automatically re-scale the amplitude to 1. As the quantum states are imperfect you will end up with a bigger-than-expected probability for the state |1x>. Might be useful for quantum computing.

Fix 2 (which is rather sensible): Make the cube interact with the matter it replaces, absorbing its information. No more quantum-information-sorcery.

Fix 3: Simply assume that quantum multiverse-theory is wrong (replaced by Bohmian mechanics or something else). Quantum mechanics as we know it wouldn't work without fix 2 anyway, as information ought to be preserved.
