You can create a cube of iron with a 5 inch side once in 24 hours.

The iron is elementally pure, and the surface of the cube is smooth (but not perfectly smooth). It is otherwise unremarkable and indistinguishable from any other iron cube.

It will be created at will between your hands held in a specific way to "hug" the cube at the opposite corners, no millimetre precision required.

The cube will completely replace whatever fluids existed in its space prior, gas or liquid, including air. Any solids would block the power without "wasting" its use, but particles smaller than a millimetre are ignored.

You must be conscious and intend to do it, you cannot be tricked or made to do it involuntarily (but it's possible to threaten, bribe or blackmail). You won't accidentally use this power while asleep, drunk or drugged.

You can't "save up" and make a bigger cube by waiting longer than 24 hours.

The cube will have zero velocity in your own reference frame.

*Edit:* none of the measurable aspects of this power are consistent enough to be used as a precise measurement sample and have a slight amount of variation (i.e. the size of the cube is not exactly 5.00000.... inches, the waiting period varies by a few nanoseconds and so on).
