Think of the universe as consisting of exactly two qbits. Then reality is just a state

a|00>+b|01>+c|10>+d|11> with coefficients a,b,c,d whose square means something like "probability to find the universe in that state".

Now by destroying the second qbit in a universe like my post described, you end up with the state

0=0|0x> + 0|1x> where x symbolises destroyed qbits. In reality x stands for "many electrons and quarks arranged in the shape of an iron cube", which actually are many qbits. It's just replacing text and adding more summands with coefficients that are all 0. Similarly the real universe is a collection of many qbits and produces thus many coefficients that are 0 as well.

Important is: the probability to find the universe in /any/ state is now 0. Which practically means non-existence.
