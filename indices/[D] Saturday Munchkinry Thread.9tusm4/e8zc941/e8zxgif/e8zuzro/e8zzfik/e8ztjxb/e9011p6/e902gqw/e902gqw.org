Yes, i actually made the "incantations" required to make the cube appear very specific to ensure you need physical access to both sides, which rules out obvious exploits like breaking through walls of any strength or destroying locks. It's the best attempt I could do to enforce the "spirit" of the idea, I suppose in a regular sci-fi or fantasy setting it would be simply described as the ability to get a lump of iron out of thin air as if by magic. In such regular fiction there seem to be a few "feel by" rules which such magic obeys that are hard to define - that's why classic Flash does not set anything including himself on fire with air friction, and time machines know exactly "when" and "where" it is, so you don't end up in space by merely travelling a second to the past or future.
