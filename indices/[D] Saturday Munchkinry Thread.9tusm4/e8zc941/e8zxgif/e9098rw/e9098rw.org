  Turn nuclear waste into sand and overwrite it with iron.

Wouldn't that mean you have to TOUCH the nuclear waste with your bare hands? Or at least get within 2.5 inches of it without any kind of radiation shielding, since any shield that small would need to be solid. That seems pretty suicidal, especially if you are going to do it every day.
