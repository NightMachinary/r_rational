The time freezing aspect is more interesting than the trap aspect.

You want to do some writing. So you look at a sheet and then have your transcriber look at it. You have infinitely long to come up with a story, then they type it into your word processor so everyone can view it. You'd finish nanowrimo in a day.

But more realistically, you'd earn the big bucks by repeating the same trick as a computer programmer. You wouldn't even need to have someone transcribe it, since once you've thought up the answer, reproducing it is trivial on your side. You would legitimately be a 100x productive programmer, and could single-handedly build startups (well, plus someone to trigger it).
