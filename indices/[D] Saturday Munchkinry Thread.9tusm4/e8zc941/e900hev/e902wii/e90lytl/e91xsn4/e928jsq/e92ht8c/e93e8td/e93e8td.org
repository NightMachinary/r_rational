  However, stuff like this is almost always from superhero fiction, where abilities are usually a function of the body/brain rather than a function of the being. So it seems like a very generous assumption to make that the ability will still be usable by a computational megacomplex that is somehow derived from you (and, more importantly, that the entire megacomplex will be pulled into the thinking space).

Except no this ability can't actually be a function of your body in any way. Since the time stop function requires that it be able to somehow run your mind on something other than your brain while time is frozen. Rather the power must be either recognizing some very vague (so it doesn't stop working for you as you get older and your brain changes somewhat) pattern in your brain, or more likely it is just granting access to the power to the same pattern of mental activity that it initially gave the power to. Either way you could exploit either of those interpretations to keep the powers after having altered yourself to be scarcely human.

Given the lack of any limits on how much energy this power can use (even if you couldn't bring it back to the regular world doing any amount of processing for infinite time still means infinite energy was somehow expended) there's no reason to think there would be any safeguards preventing the entirety of your superhuman mind from "piggybacking" along with whichever specific parts of your mind the power recognizes. Though of course as said before it's not literally bringing physical matter with it, but rather somehow running your mind on some timeless substrate while active. Additionally as suggested earlier while it may recognize only a portion of your mind (since otherwise it would stop working given normal aging) if it instead it recognizes your mind based on continuity of experience or the like then that could easily be extended to cover a mind of arbitrary size.
