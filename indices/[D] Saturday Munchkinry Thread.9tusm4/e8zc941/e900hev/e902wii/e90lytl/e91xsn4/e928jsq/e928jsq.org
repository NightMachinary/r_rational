  The Maxwell's Demon example relies on atomic-level effects to get anything usable. It seems like turning that into real-world power would require something directly hooked up to you to derive a miniscule amount of power from the difference created by changes in thought in the physical/chemical brain. I'm skeptical that such an apparatus could be efficient enough to get any power at all, and whether it could exist without killing you.

Maxwell's Demon is only really an example, the larger point is that you can get free computation from free energy. The maxwell's demon example itself could work but you'd need a very cold universe (to take advantage of landauer limit) and very high energy particles to make that specific idea practical. Assuming you would have anything even approaching a biological brain seems unwarranted as well given I said you would be a superintelligence.

  Second, infinite computation time is only theoretically equivalent to infinite computation when memory is unlimited; even if we ignore the problems of willpower where you are able to simulate everything forever without going insane, you would first have to massively upgrade your brain to even simulate a small town accurately. For that to be possible, you also have to assume that however the ability works is not tied to your 3 pounds of head-meat but rather to some greater self.

Firstly as said before I'm definitely assuming you're a superintelligence running on a cosmic scale megastructure here. Assuming the power would be linked to some specific physical structure just isn't tenable given your bodies replacement of cells and atoms after all. Your point about non-infinite memory is good though dependant on how the power actually works. After all since you still form memories while "timeless" your memories have to be getting stored temporarily within this abilities power since it can't make any changes to your brain in lieu of time. So there's no real reason to expect the temporary memory bank alloted to you by the power to actually be equal to the capacity of your memory.\\
Should your memory be limited however then while that would require you cut corners in your simulations (not running anything beyond the bare minimum required to be apparently realistic or at least nice seeming for its inhabitants, plus probably not really storing memory of anything beyond people's memories) and do things through methods that minimized memory at the cost of run time and (normal) energy costs. Still with a massive megastructure and a degenerate era digital civilization the amount of processing you could do would still be truly unfathomable.
