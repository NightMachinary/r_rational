I guess my real objection here is that wherever there's even a little ambiguity, you're interpreting it in the most favorable way possible. The power specifies "you", so you're assuming that it applies even if you're entirely uploaded (and probably even if there are multiple copies of you, which opens up another can of worms).

However, stuff like this is almost always from superhero fiction, where abilities are usually a function of the body/brain rather than a function of the being. So it seems like a very generous assumption to make that the ability will still be usable by a computational megacomplex that is somehow derived from you (and, more importantly, that the entire megacomplex will be pulled into the thinking space).
