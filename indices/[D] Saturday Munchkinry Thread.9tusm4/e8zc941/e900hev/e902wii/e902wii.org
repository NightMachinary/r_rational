  Whenever you notice someone looking at an instance of your sheet, "time freezes" while your conscious may freely create any physically possible appearance of that sheet.

Time FREEZES?! As in, you have unlimited time to think of an appearance for the sheet?

Can you use that time to think about things other than the sheet? There's plenty of stuff I need to think about and nowhere enough time for me to do so, so this time freeze would be super awesome. You can spend an eternity working out new mathematical/logical theorems in your head, writing songs and novels and poems, etc etc. The only limit would be how much you can keep in your head at the same time, which is again something you can train using unlimited time, or just brute force memorize through endless repetition.
