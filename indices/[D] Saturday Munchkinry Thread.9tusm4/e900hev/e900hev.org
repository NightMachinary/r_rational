You are able to chose any DIN A4 sheet of paper you can see and make it the target of your ability. Only one such target may exist at any given time, so doing so while another sheet is affected will remove your ability from that (previous) sheet. The ability furthermore wears of on its own if the sheet ceases to be in a state in which it would be a valid target of this ability.

As for the effect of the ability, you are able to perceive when someone else looks at one of the surfaces of this sheet of paper. This applies even if the surface is only partially seen.

It also applies if it is seen via proxy (a photo, video, etc.) while the ability is still active on that specific sheet, in this case however at least one of the surfaces must fully be visible and the depicted sheet must still be DIN A4 - photoshopping it to be green would not undo the ability, but altering its dimensions would.

Whenever you notice someone looking at an instance of your sheet, "time freezes" such that (and ONLY such that) your conscious may freely create any physically possible appearance of that sheet. To their perception, the sheet (in all of its instances) will from then on have that appearance, so long as this ability remains active on that sheet, and they will no longer trigger the ability.

You are ONLY informed of the fact that someone perceived the sheet, nothing else (at least not by means of this ability). Not who, not which instance, not where.... just the fact that it happened. You can make the sheet appear transparent or reflective.
