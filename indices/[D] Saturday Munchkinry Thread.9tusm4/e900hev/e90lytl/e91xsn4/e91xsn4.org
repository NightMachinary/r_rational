The Maxwell's Demon example relies on atomic-level effects to get anything usable. It seems like turning that into real-world power would require something directly hooked up to you to derive a miniscule amount of power from the difference created by changes in thought in the physical/chemical brain. I'm skeptical that such an apparatus could be efficient enough to get any power at all, and whether it could exist without killing you.

Second, infinite computation time is only theoretically equivalent to infinite computation when memory is unlimited; even if we ignore the problems of willpower where you are able to simulate everything forever without going insane, you would first have to massively upgrade your brain to even simulate a small town accurately. For that to be possible, you also have to assume that however the ability works is not tied to your 3 pounds of head-meat but rather to some greater self.
