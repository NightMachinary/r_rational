I usually interpret the call to munchkinry as "What can are the unintuitive ways that this could be exploited," looking at the applications of whatever is being described. It's usually safe to make secondary assumptions about most-likely ways that a power should also function (see the other threads, mentioning using the sheet as scratch space for arbitrary thinking), but the whole point of supernatural abilities is that they defy the usual paradigms.

As an example of the stretch I think you're making, the munchkin response to gaining super endurance shouldn't be "route deoxygenated, sugar-low blood through my body for free energy" because there are too many ways for the power to work.

I wouldn't be objecting so strenuously if you had said "This is one way the power might work; here's how to test whether it does, and if so, then here's what you can do." But you didn't; you've been assuming that what you see as self-consistent is the only possible way for it to work.
