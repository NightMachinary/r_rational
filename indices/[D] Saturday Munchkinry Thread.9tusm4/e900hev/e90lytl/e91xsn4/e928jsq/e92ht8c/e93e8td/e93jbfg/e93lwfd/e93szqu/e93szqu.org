Thinking with something other than your brain is not the same thing as the power not being tied to your body.

I can, with similar validity, assume that the power is being mediated by some god monitoring and modifying your three pounds of head meat. And if that's the case, major changes could mean the loss of the ability entirely.

My point is that you are trying to apply known-universe reasoning to deduce the under-the-hood mechanics of an ability that /cannot/ function under known-universe reasoning. Anything you conclude about these mechanics will be the result of begging the question.
