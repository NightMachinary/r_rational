While I would argue that it is only for the purpose of designing the appearance of the sheet, so long as you're thinking of applying information obtained through attempting to figure out mathematical theorems to the sheet (even if only in the sense of "writing down" related data), that could effectively be bypased. So yes, this is an ability that grants you infinite thinking time, repeatedly. Do note however that only your conscious will still function, and the ability does not come with a prevention against the insanity that would likely be caused by being completely shut of from all of your senses for prolonged periods of time. That's only minor though since you can just stop and continue in the next instance, once you've recovered. Still, I believe this would somewhat limit the extend to which this aspect of the ability could be used.
