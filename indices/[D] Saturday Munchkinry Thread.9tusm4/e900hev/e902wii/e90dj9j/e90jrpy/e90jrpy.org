Being trapped in a void in which you can do nothing but think is utterly terrifying.

Being in a void in which you can do nothing but think but have complete certainty that you can leave any time is merely boring. Heck lots of people already try to enter such voids by using sensory deprivation chambers. This is just a much better version of one since you can stay in it indefinitely while no time passes outside.
