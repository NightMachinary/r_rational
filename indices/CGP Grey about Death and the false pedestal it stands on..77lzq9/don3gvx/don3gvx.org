  misery doesn't give happiness meaning

But if someone is kept happy from the moment they are born, how will they know what happiness is? Isn't that how people become spoiled, because they redefine their happiness as a neutral baseline and keep looking for the "real" happiness?

Also, right now, death is a guarantee that no matter how despicable and powerful and therefore protected someone is, they will eventually be gone. Like, there is a chance once the latest Kim in North Korea dies, whoever replaces him will look for a peaceful solution to the crisis. I'm kind of concerned about what will happen if some asshole with a lot of power becomes deathless and makes people miserable from a nuclear bunker for all eternity.
