The sperm is an extreme example, but if we treat potential people as actual people then where does potential end? Killing a single person is killing his or hers potentially /millions/ of descendants as well. Taking a "day after" pill ends an /actual/ pregnancy and, again, kills millions of potential people.

Letting trillions die of old age to get rid of Kim is a horribly inefficient solution to the NK problem - or any problem, really - so I think nuking the planet is a fair comparison.
