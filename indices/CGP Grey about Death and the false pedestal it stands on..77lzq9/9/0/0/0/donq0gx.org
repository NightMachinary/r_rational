So, if you didn't die or didn't age... you wouldn't pursue goals?

I can't say for others (though your posts' scores seem to indicate that others agree with me) that you don't appear to be defending your position very strongly. As specific advice, posting videos of some person (and then very long transcripts of those same videos) isn't very persuasive, especially with no explanation for why it is relevant.
