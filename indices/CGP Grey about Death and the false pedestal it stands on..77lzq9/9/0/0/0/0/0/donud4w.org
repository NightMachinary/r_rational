Does my computer require suffering to satisfy my request to load a response from [[http://www.reddit.com][www.reddit.com]]? Chrome is still effectively "pursuing a goal" of fetching that data for me, but I don't imagine that it is even meaningful to attribute suffering of any sort to my browser.

As for the video posting... it definitely comes across as explicitly spammy, given that every one has been by the same person. Feels less like something to support your position, and more like you're making arguments solely to promote this person's videos, which is... weird?
