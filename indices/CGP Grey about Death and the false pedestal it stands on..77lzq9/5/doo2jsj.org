One idea that the video mentions, and that I've seen elsewhere, is that people think ending death would be bad because of sour grapes. Like the truncheon analogy: people are hit over the head with a truncheon so they invent reasons why that's a good thing.

I think that's partially true (people accept death in a way they don't accept epidemics or war tyranny, because all of those feel avoidable), but there's another factor: people suck at visualizing transhumanist worlds.

I'm making a very general statement with not much evidence to back it up except my own experience, but every description of the world by futurist as felt off to me; whether it was "everyone merges into a single super-intelligence" or "people all virtualize themselves and live in VR Second Life" or others like that. The most sensible future prediction I've seen is Three Worlds Collide, and even then author said it was "the future of the past".

tl;dr: We're not very good at hard sci-fi.
