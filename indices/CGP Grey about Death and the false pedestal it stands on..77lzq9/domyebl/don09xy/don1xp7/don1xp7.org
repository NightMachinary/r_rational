  In the most literal sense, death is painless to you, but if old age and illnesses didn't exist, would you want to die?

Not to be the Debbie Downer around here, but [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/6vq/on_the_unpopularity_of_cryonics_life_sucks_but_at/][we seriously need to solve life before we solve death]].

Which isn't to say, don't go and fight old-age. Fighting to make getting older less sucky is an important part of "solving life" (hahaha, as if you "solve" life, right?). It's just also to say, even if there was no such thing as old age or age-related illness, you'd still get a lot of people /choosing/ to die at a certain point. Life /wears on you/ as you get older. My parents described it to me once, and I've been experiencing it a lot these past... three to five years.

That's not actually physical aging, because (stochastically) I've been getting /healthier/ over this time. It's more the feeling of different possibilities closing down while actuality turns out a lot different than you worked for, and just reproducing ordinary life from day to day turns out to take a lot of energy.

Basically, to really make immortality worth it, we /still/ kinda need the low challenge of daily life (as contrasted with the "high challenge" of capital-L Life) significantly reduced.
