I always kinda wanted to get regeneration like Time Lords have. One persona "ends", but really the "core" of you stays basically the same while your accumulated "incidentals" get thrown around and "re-randomized" into a new outer persona. It's like saying, "I'm willing to throw out some of my accumulated treasure and feats in order to re-roll some parts of my character sheet."

Like, one of the things that makes me feel "old" is just the weight of existing expectations. My wife came home the other night and found me eating "baby" carrots. She said, "Are you the same [[/u/eaturbrainz]]? You don't eat carrots!" I had to actually explain to her, complete with getting another item out of the fridge, that carrots were in fact my first "crunchy" solid food, possibly my second or third solid food /period/, and I'd been eating them that way since I had teeth.

But somehow I managed to have an expected persona, in the eyes of the person closest to me, as a non-carrot-eater.

What happens when that kind of expectation has accumulated about /everything/, in /every/ major aspect or relationship that defines my life? It feels trapping.

Besides which, to deal with age rising arbitrarily high into the positive reals, we're gonna have to rearrange our life-cycle. Currently we've got:

- Get born
- Infancy
- Early education
- Secondary education
- Early adulthood and/or higher education (if any)
- Actual adulthood
- Middle age
- Late adulthood
- Retirement (if any)
- Die.

The big defining trend is: the more adult you are, the greater the responsibility you take on for reproducing the world that produced you. If you're lucky, your society may support you in /advancing/ or helping to actually direct the world that produced you. Also if you're lucky, at some point you may be deemed to have made sufficient contributions that you can actually ramp down further contributions of reproductive effort (ie: retire).

The big problem is: even assuming we get rid of the need to do continuous economic /work/, then you're talking about an unbounded linear accumulation of other expectations, responsibilities, moral duties, authority over others, etc. For an unbounded lifespan, we need some way for retirement, or even an unsuccessful adulthood, to cycle back around to social "youth": a reset of expectations, responsibilities, and power. You need some way for the elder statesman to turn back into the young jackass, instead of ever-growing commitments turning into a noose that hangs the soul.

/Huh/. Funny thought. Maybe that's what it's all about when old gits take young lovers.
