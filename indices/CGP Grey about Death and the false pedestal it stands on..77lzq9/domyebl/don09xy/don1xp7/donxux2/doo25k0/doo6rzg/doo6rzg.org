Common sense says that Net Neutraility is a policy that should be preserved for the protection of the consumer from overreaching power of the ISPs, yet it is being tested because the FCC is being headed by a chairperson appointed by a president whose both political ideology revolves around the idea that less regulation means more trickle down. Common sense alone doesn't mean anything when the person in power could have a different, and more personally motivated, one. You and I can't easily /imagine/ a counter-scenario because politics is complicated, economy is complicated, and people have different ideas of what's obviously right.

Now, I think I understand what you're trying to say in that there are anti-trust and consumer protection organization in the US government such as the FDA. But can we really say that there couldn't be a lobbying against regulation on market of genuine anti-aging medicine that would hold heavily sway? They could argue that force-buying the patent would deincentivise more efficient advancement of the drug by private sectors. They could argue that it would be better for the economy to relieve the companies of "unnecessary" regulations. What else could they argue? Whatever they argue, it would certainly be heavily backed financially because we're talking about an inelastic demanded product over everyone.
