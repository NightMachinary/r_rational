I have begun saving for when I'm old. I wouldn't need to save as much if I had more time, both to contribute and for my contributions to accrue investment gains. Even more so if being older didn't come with senescence. I could spend some of that money now.

I suppose I should have maybe said risks become more manageable. If something could set your career back by twenty years as things stand, would you try it? And if you had a century to get things back on track? Two centuries? Do you even need a career two centuries from now?

You don't have to worry about /later/ as much when making decisions about /now/, becuase when later comes around you've lost fewer options.
