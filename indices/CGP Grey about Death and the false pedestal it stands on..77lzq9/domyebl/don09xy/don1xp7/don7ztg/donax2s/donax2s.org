That doesn't feel very /true/, though. If you told me, today, that my lifespan was 200 - because you came from the future in a time-machine and knew 200-year-old me - I wouldn't feel like I had that many more possibilities.

I think it has to do with the fact that as an adult, my life doesn't really run on potential or possibilities any more. Those aren't really deemed to matter so much. What matters is track-record, the /fait accompli/ of my life.

The longer I live, the more it feels like the "already did" matters more to how my life proceeds than any judgement of "could do".

That might be depression, though, but it's at least partially not.
