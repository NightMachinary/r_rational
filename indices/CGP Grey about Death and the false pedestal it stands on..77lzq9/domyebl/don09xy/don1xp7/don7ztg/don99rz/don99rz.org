A lot of closed possibilities involve things you can't control no matter your resources, like the choices of others (for those of us who value autonomy, at least)

A large portion of my ongoing clinical depression ostensibly stems from past failed friendships that I do not have the social acumen or support base to evaluate, understand, and correct. That is to say, anyone who understands why a given person has cut me out of their life is, by definition, no longer speaking to me. Perhaps, given an arbitrarily long life, I could improve my capabilities, or reach an equilibrium with my faults, but, all else being equal, it may simply become a cycle I cannot endure indefinitely.
