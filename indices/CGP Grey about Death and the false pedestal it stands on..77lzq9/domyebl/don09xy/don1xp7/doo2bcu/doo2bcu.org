I've had very close experiences with death (near death experience, or rather lack thereof. no tunnels and lights, no bliss and out-of-body, just a complete void in space and time). I also have a lot of beef with the monotony and crap aspects of life like the ones discussed in the above link.

Having truly 'seen' both things, I definitively can say that I completely prefer living to the alternative, and would choose to live forever even if the fundamental situation I face would never change. Do I wish it would change? Of course. But just because something isn't the best doesn't mean that the alternatives can't be much, much worse.

The most salient part of the article to me was this (combined for clairty).

  You were raised with a very limited repertoire of interests, ambitions, and capabilities. Most people have a very limited range of interests and possibilities for gratification. This problem cannot be fixed for most by giving them more money, or even more money and autonomy. Do that, and they will drown themselves in what they already have, or kill themselves with drugs. How many cars, planes, and pairs of shoes or houses can you really gain joy from?

This was really meaningful to me because maybe this is a manner in which I differ from others. The above is completely untrue for me; I have a huge amount of interests and I keep finding new ones all the time. To me the main source of frustration is that all the monotony and junk keeps me from being able to come close to doing all the things I want, and that's why I don't like that stuff. I thought everyone else was the same, and that's why they didn't like the drudgery. Maybe that's not true, I don't know.

But on the other hand I think people would develop more interests if they were given the time and opportunity to do so.
