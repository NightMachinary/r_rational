...I wrote up a much longer post originally, but it probably got into tl;dr, so basically, I see your point, and while I disagree on some points (and agree on some others but disagree on their importance), this is coming from somebody who's pretty familiar with bipolar and suicidal ideation, so I can't really claim to be a representative example. On balance I usually lean toward a preference for life, but even in my most satisfied moments I can't say that I'd definitely reject the opportunity to die as part of some weird performance art piece. It'd really just come down to the details.
