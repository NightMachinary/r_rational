I don't think there's any victory condition. I think your vision of an ideal world is... I don't know quite how to put it, story thinking, wishful thinking, sour grapes.

At day n, I don't want to die, at day n+1 I won't want to die either and my mindset won't have changed. I don't want to become a person who would want to die, and I don't want the universe to become something that would make me want / accept death. Same idea for my loved ones, and same idea with less intensity for all human beings.

I can't imagine that this story has a happy ending. The way I see it, the universe is like a closed box with a finite amount of food in it; we can limit our numbers so we don't overshoot, we can ration the food, we can imagine clever ways to reframe the situation so that starving is acceptable in certain situations, but the reality is that every single one of us is going to starve, and the only things we can change are when it happens, who starves first, and how painful the starving is.

I'm supposed to say "and this is why you enjoy life as much as you can" or something, but I feel like that's just another clever reframing. Enjoying things as much as possible is the optimal choice, but it's not, like, philosophically complete.

Now make more paperclips.
