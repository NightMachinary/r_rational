Maybe I'm missing your point here (it almost seems like you're making an analogy?), but, uh, talk to me about "limiting our numbers so we don't overshoot" when Montana has more than 6.5 people per square mile. Also, look at Japan, who are literally losing population. For bad reasons, sure, but it certainly proves it's possible to limit population growth.

It seems kind of silly to jump the gun to "it's impossible to support the population a deathless society would produce" when there're plenty of intermediate steps. As we progress toward one, it will obviously necessitate social and cultural reforms, and to judge a future by current social and cultural norms strikes me as fallacious in the same regard as it is to judge medieval times by feminist terms, etc.
