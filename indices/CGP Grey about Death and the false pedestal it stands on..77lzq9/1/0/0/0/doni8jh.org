  It's just also to say, even if there was no such thing as old age or age-related illness, you'd still get a lot of people choosing to die at a certain point. Life wears on you as you get older.

Absolutely. Given physics and all that, actual immortality is out of the question, so I think that our victory condition here is not an actually death-less world, but a world where people choose the time and manner of their deaths, and do so for reasons that have nothing to do with health (physical or otherwise), economic distress, or the like.
