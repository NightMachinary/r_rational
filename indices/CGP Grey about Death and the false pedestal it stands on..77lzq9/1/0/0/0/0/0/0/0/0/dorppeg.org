Well, I'm not saying I'm confident it's impossible, buuuuuut... I kind of think it's impossible, wishful thinking aside. Like, it's easy for us to imagine an afterlife, or hyperspace, or time travel, but there's no fundamental reason to expect these things to exist except that we can imagine them. Same thing for escaping to other dimensions.

But my original point was, assuming that we do live in a universe with a limited quantity of matter and exploitable energy, then there's no good ending.
