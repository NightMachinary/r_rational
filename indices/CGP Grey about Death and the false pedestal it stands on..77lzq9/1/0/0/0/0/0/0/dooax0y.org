Sure. I was thinking more on a "heat death of the universe" scale.

My point is, we can definitely do better than now. We can live to 200 years old, which will be better than what we have now; we can live to 1.000 years old, which will be even better, or 10.000 years, etc.

But in any case, whether I live 100 or 100.000 years, when I die, it will always be too soon. If I ever change my mind, it's because I've lowered my standards, and that's ugly too. In other words, I don't think the victory condition callmesalticidae referred to exist. In a fundamental way, all we can do is lose /less/, and not think about it too much.

  It seems kind of silly to jump the gun to "it's impossible to support the population a deathless society would produce" when there're plenty of intermediate steps.

Oh yeah, preach.
