I don't think that's the right way to think. Like, sure, if there's a solution, and this solution is deductible from available data (as opposed to "input the Konami Kode of the universe through black holes"), then eventually people will find it.

But as I was saying, there is no fundamental reason a solution should exist, just like there's no fundamental reason an afterlife should exist.
