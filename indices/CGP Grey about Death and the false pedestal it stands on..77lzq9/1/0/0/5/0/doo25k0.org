I think you're grasping at straws. Your same argument could used against developing cancer medicine, for instance.

I think for every scenario you imagine when an evil medicorp takes over the world, you can easily imagine counter-scenarios where this doesn't happen for common sense reasons (ex: the US government puts its foot down and force-buys the life medicine patent or whatever).
