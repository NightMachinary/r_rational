  Now, I think I understand what you're trying to say in that there are anti-trust and consumer protection organization in the US government such as the FDA.

No. What I'm saying is that:

- The world doesn't revolve around the USA. Even if the US government was okay with evil corporations holding the population hostage through an immortality drug, at some point other countries would say "Fuck it", violate the patent, and start producing the immortality drug themselves.

- Lobbying and regulatory capture only go so far. Corporations get away with it when the effects concern a small population, or when the dynamics are complicated enough that it's hard to link the corpo's actions to its negative effects. If our evil corporation with the immortality serum monopoly that "working for it for extra life is untenable or just not worth it", and people started dying because of that, there would be enough popular outrage for the government to put its foot down and say "Screw future research, release the not-dying serum now".

But more generally, what I mean by "common sense reasons" is: Would there be corruption? Yes. Would the company sell the immortality juice higher than altruism would require? Probably. Would the world be transformed into a cyberpunk dystopia where everyone around the world is held hostage by Evil Corp and its corporate monopoly on the immortality juice? Probably not.

This is what I mean when I say that people are bad at imagining a transhumanist future. The idea that inventing an immortality drug would make people's lives /worse/ is ridiculous.

(well, unless we start talking about overshooting, but that's another type of problem)
