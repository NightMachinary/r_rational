What makes me personally very hesitant about developing medicine to stop aging is the possibility that it might actually make living worse. For example, if a company were to make a monopoly over this medicine, then they would essentially have the power that cancer medicine held over cancer patients over literally everyone. The economic incentive by inelastic demand could lead to raising the price just before working for it for extra life is untenable or just not worth it. A short brutish life is bad, but what's worse is a /long/ brutish life.
