  but we seriously need to solve life before we solve death

But on the other hand, solving death means the world's smartest scientists and humanitarians would get potentially many times more productive time on this earth to fix all the other ways the world is shitty, before old age or illness incapacitates them.

In fact, having just one (lifetime-devoted-to-one-problem) scientist or humanitarian, working on your favourite problem, live just twice as long, is actually /more/ valuable than having two such people working on that problem. Because they both had to spend some of their lives just being children, and another part of their lives learning how to be scientists or humanitarians, and another part gaining the experience to tackle this particular problem. In the end, you only get ~20 productive years at most out of a (lifetime-devoted-to-one-problem) scientist/humanitarian currently. If they lived just twice as long (120 instead of 60) before suffering any age-related degeneration of capability, you might get ~80 such years.
