Ah, but there would be possibilities! Decades more to embark on any course of study, to engage in any hobby, to change careers. You'd take a hit in the short run, but you've got over a century to build back up. Risks become smaller, intertemporal budgeting less stringent. It'd be harder to run out of time, and easier to come back to things.
