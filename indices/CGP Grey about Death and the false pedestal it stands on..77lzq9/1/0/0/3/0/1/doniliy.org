From personal experience, I think that it's partly depression, but I agree that we would need some sort of socially accepted mechanism for switching tracks without looking like you've wasted part of your life. Something like what you talk about with re-rolling yourself, but combined with an expectation that you will re-roll yourself at some point and that doing so isn't weird or wasteful.
