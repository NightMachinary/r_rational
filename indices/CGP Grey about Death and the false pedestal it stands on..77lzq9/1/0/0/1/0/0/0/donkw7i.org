The only stories I've seen do something like you describe are ones that specifically focus on [transformation]() as a reoccurring element, though ones that emphasize psychological changes tend to be more fetishistic than not and so usually don't explore such ideas intellectually.

The only two stories I can think of that come close to exploring the idea are the webcomics El Goonish Shive and The Dragon Doctors. Both feature characters with access to magic that can alter their bodies and explore how that effects their identities, as well as backstories for some characters who effectively regenerated.

I've heard the anime Kaiba does some interesting stuff with uploads trading memories, but I haven't seen it yet. I would love to read a serious sci-fi story about people choosing to temporarily alter their personality and the world built around that idea. I'd be really cool to present the idea that “self” doesn't exist or matter in a non-horrific way.
