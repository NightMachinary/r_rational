Finding your existing relationships and social constraints burdensome is definitely a thing, but you can always just not do those things. You can quit your job and move and just not have those responsibilities and expectations.

There's definitely an aspect of 'wherever you go, there you are', but I've seen a lot of people more held back by the perception that these little burdens and rituals are more necessary and make life more meaningful than they do.

There's a long literary and philosophical history of wrestling with this dichotomy and Kundera's 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' as an example has a really nice treatment in the opening pages of the question of whether the weight of these accumulated expectations makes life ultimately more of less fulfilling.
