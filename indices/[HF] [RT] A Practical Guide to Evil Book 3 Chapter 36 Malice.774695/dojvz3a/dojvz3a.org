Malicia's advice in this chapter seems sound, but I'm not sure if considering your goals before you begin building a strategy is the very first thing you should do. It's also important to understand yourself and your resources, as well as those of your opponent. While it's important to keep you end goal in mind, I'm not sure if it's the optimal place to start the process of making your plans at.
