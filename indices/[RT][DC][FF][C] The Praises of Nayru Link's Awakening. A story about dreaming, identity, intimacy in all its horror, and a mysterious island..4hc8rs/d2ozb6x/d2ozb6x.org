A note about the worldbuilding/worldfixing: I have tried very hard to draw as much as possible from the act of rationalizing canon and as far as I can tell(?), I've remained consistent with it (respecting the letter, at least. Forgive me if I violated the spirit, it's my first time). This isn't always going to be clear, even for people who've played the original game through multiple times. There isn't always a reasonable opportunity to have a primary character look at the premises of the source material and prove valid the inferences the author built on top of it.

For instance, one thing you might not know is that it takes place immediately after the Oracle games. This struck me as a little absurd. Link is usually just a vessel for the player, empty, or at least simple enough that roleplaying is very easy, yet, in LA there was apparently this whole episode in his past that wasn't even hinted at to the player? It's kind of like having the DM come back a few years after a session to tell you that you played your character wrong because /acktueallly/ there was a lot you didn't know them (because the DM is a really lackadaisical storyteller).

At least, that would have been absurd if I did it. Nintendo gets away with it, because in their Labrynna, nothing really happened to Link. Sure, he has an adventure, but it doesn't change him. He becomes the person he was always supposed to be. The person we all expect to find in a zelda game.

In the timeline of the rat, things go a little differently. I reduce my point of divergence to Nayru, the (former?)goddess of wisdom, deciding that she couldn't content herself to being alone in her understanding of creation. She took a succession of close companions and taught them, uplifted them, and when Link's turn came around, that was something his fated role as the legendary hero had not prepared him for.

So, anyway, I invite anyone who disagrees with my interpretation of canon to start an argument about it. I'd love that.
