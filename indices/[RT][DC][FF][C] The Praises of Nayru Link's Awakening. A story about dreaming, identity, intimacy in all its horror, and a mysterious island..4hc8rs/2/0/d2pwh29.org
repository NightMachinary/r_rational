I'm curious what led you to writing this and I'd love some more information about your inspiration and the ultimate message your work sends.

I have to admit I read it all last night and it inspired a healthy discussion between myself and a friend about morality, reality, and identity, so if that was the objective mission accomplished.

Spoilers for the work below:

When we play Link's Awakening as players, we ultimately have two major choices (aside from collecting the seashells, doing other sidequests, and stealing or not): to either set the game down, electing to allow the world to continue as it is, or to finish it and wake the Windfish. (Maintain status quo versus betray / compete with Nightmares) I must admit that for many years I chose the former, partially out of a desire to keep exploring the world that would be destroyed if I woke the Windfish, mostly because I couldn't figure out the ball puzzles in the 7th dungeon. I think that an earlier Link, one from the village of OoT for example, who hadn't tasted adventure, would probably choose the status quo, while naturally a Link who had just finished the story of OoS/OoA who thirsted enough for adventure to set sail would want to wake the fish and continue his journey.

Your Link, being "uplifted" or "enlightened" enough to reject the standard hero's narrative, is in a funny place. Correct me if I'm wrong but this Link is a sort of flawed or imperfect rationalist. He has learned to doubt enough that the standard narrative doesn't fit him well, and he has room to squirm, but he isn't quite knowledgeable or enlightened enough to fit into a different narrative. Perhaps a Link who had a true desire for transhumanism or had a better understanding of the nature of reality would have received a totally different mission from the Windfish and never would have questioned his mission to uplift the island or create immortality or whatever other MacGuffin would have awakened that narrative's fish.

As for constructive criticism, the beginning was a little rough as you were still finding your voice, complete with some anachronisms. Smoothing out Link's word choice especially could lead to a Link who clearly has a higher understanding of the nature of reality and of rational thought without creating a Link who appears to be from the modern era or who is a modern scientist. The ending was appropriately sudden, but it would have helped to have some foreshadowing (more conflict with the Nightmare prior to the end) or have it be deserved a bit more (make more mention of Link leaving himself vulnerable prior to the end).

Overall, kudos on an interesting read and thank you for giving me something to think about as well as reminding me of the GB/GBC Zelda games, which were very important to me years ago.
