  For instance, one thing you might not know is that it takes place immediately after the Oracle games. This struck me as a little absurd. Link is usually just a vessel for the player, empty, or at least simple enough that roleplaying is very easy, yet, in LA there was apparently this whole episode in his past that wasn't even hinted at to the player? It's kind of like having the DM come back a few years after a session to tell you that you played your character wrong because acktueallly there was a lot you didn't know them (because the DM is a really lackadaisical storyteller).

That's a little unfair to Nintendo, considering the Oracle games were produced /years/ after Link's Awakening.
