Well, the shadows on Koholint wouldn't have much of a reason to maintain speakable names for the latest revision of their decision theory, they have no mathematicians to discuss it with. I'd guess it's far more developed than our own. But we might assume it's superrational. Superrationality is nice but if a superrational agent is not recognized by its peers as superrational, superrational cooperation ceases to make sense. It sort of requires mutual common knowledge of reciprocal reasoning to work.

In more emotive words: If you regard a shadow with more distrust than is warranted, if you fail to see the decency in it, from then on it will think of you as an obstacle rather than a kindred spirit worthy of kindness.
