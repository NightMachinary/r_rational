Thank you for taking the time to write this.

To an extent, that is how I really feel about Koholint when I go through the original black and white version of Link's Awakening. [[#s][Mild but extremely illustrative spoiler]]

I was going to place a content warning for [[#s][a few particular kinds of meaningful death]], concerned that it comes on so abruptly and without warning(and to some extent, without explanation) that for people who arn't able to disconnect themselves from that kind of thing it might be a bit of a slap in the face. [[#s][Though admittedly]]

Edit: Yeah, you're right about the content warning. There was a point where it wasn't entirely redundant, but it crossed that point in the third edit when I clarified the part about [[#s][]] .
