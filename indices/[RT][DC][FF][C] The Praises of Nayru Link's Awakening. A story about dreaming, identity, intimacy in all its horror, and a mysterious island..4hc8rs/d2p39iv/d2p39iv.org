This is very strange and dark and cold and beautiful. Link truly feels like a man a thousand years old, inhumanly cold and deeply impersonal. The story is set in a dream, and it feels like a thing of dream as well, full of unexpected twists and strangeness (I've never played the game this is set in, so that adds a great deal to the strangeness). It is uncompromising, brutally so, but that makes the depth and meaning in every interaction more clear.

Reading this felt like walking through a dark forest buried in snow, with the moon bright overhead. I love it, and would recommend that everyone give it a shot. Thank you.

If you are looking for advice, I would recommend removing the content warning. The tone of the story itself is more than enough of a warning.
