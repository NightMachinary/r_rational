Extremely good. I recommend it to everyone here.

I have to say though, the penultimate dialogue is a bit confusing from my point of view. I feel like I only get what is being said because I have some relevant memories of decision theory discussions on LW, which most people will likely not have. In any case, I don't feel confident that I've correctly interpreted the messages being exchanged.

I'm almost sure that the order of speakers is messed up somewhere in that dialogue as well, although that may have been a deliberate stylistic choice, given what's happening at that moment in the story.
