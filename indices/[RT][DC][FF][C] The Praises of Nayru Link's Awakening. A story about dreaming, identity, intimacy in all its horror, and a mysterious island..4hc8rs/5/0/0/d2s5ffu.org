In that case I think the biggest problem with this story is that it did not at all make it clear that there exist a set of circumstances where the shadow would have cooperated. It reads as if Link is playing as CooperateBot and the shadow is playing as DefectBot. Afterwards the shadow is bragging about how much better his decision theory is. Of course DefectBot beats CooperateBot, but that's not really an interesting observation.

Dragging superrationality into this seems unnecessary since any decent decision theory would defect against CooperateBot.
