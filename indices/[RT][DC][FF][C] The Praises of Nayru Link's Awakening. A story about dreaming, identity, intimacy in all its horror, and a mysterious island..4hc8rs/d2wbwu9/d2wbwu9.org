I'm finding this really hard to read. I'm starting to get lost at chapter two. Things I could not quite make sense of, and correction suggestions:

"unlikely that this forest was large enough for inter-species trade to be sustainable." I thought the humans did not live in the forest?

"they were longer real to me" probably wished to say "no longer real". There's also a "forseen", which should be "foreseen".

It would also help to put "said the Witch" and "said Link" in the conversation, sometimes it's hard to follow. I had to read the bit after "A conversation of looks proceeded..." three or four times. (damn prevention of selecting text and copy-pasting)
