  "unlikely that this forest was large enough for inter-species trade to be sustainable." I thought the humans did not live in the forest?

Yes? Hmm. I'm not really trying to make Link's thought process transparent here but, the reason is, there's only so much trade that can go on. If the moblin population is small trade will occur so rarely that, for instance, it wouldn't be possible for the moblins to produce an ambassador witch for facilitating interspecies exchanges, or it wouldn't be politically or culturally viable for said witch to forbid moblin hunting parties from coming too close to the trading site, losing their heads and killing humans.

Ah, that's actually breaking the alternation pattern, thanks, and sorry about that.
