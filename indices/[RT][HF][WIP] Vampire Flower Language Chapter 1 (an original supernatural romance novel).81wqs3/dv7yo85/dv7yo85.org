I like it so far. I'm looking forward to seeing more details on the vampires' culture. Honestly, I think it promises to be interesting, I particularly like the influence of immortality on opera length. The romance so far seems good enough to me(Also, the way I'm imagining this makes it look incredibly cute). I don't usually read romance, but this seems like a familiar pattern. Shy, cute, awkward meets rich, powerful, confident.
