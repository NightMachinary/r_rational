/In 1944, American deserter named Red falls for a powerful vampire named William - and the feelings seem to be mutual./

/However, Red soon finds that vampires have a complex society with inscrutable rules that must be followed - or else./

/Will they be able to make it work, with their relationship at the fringes of both vampire and human society? Or will Red be caught up in the wrong part of William's many rivalries?/

This story was written as a direct result of discussions on the Wednesday Worldbuilding and Saturday Munchkinry threads and, while it seems like a shallow romance novel, has a very deep and detailed worldbuilding behind it - and hopefully you'll enjoy how it pays off.

You won't find any "but let me explain, honey!" moments in here, and we've strived for historical accuracy (it's set in 1944).

So, you might remember me from posts I've made about this on my main account: I've been working on this supernatural romance novel for the last year and a bit, and I've finally been able to post the first chapter!

I'm using an author account because this is actually written by me and a very good friend, so I'm posting this story under our combined pseudonym.
