  I'm looking forward to seeing more details on the vampires' culture.

The upcoming interlude will have some of that!

  I don't usually read romance, but this seems like a familiar pattern

Yep, the romance itself is very in line with established tropes: I remember when I was in high school we studied /Pride and Prejudice/, and this is what my teacher said the defining elements of a romance story were:

1. Hero is more rich/status/etc than the heroine

2. Conflict to break them apart

3. Happy ending

aside: the teacher also said that a romance novel that met all the criteria but was not heterosexual didn't count. 17-year-old me, of course, wrote a 20 page romance short story that included all the necessary elements but was two men. It was set in ancient egypt. I gave it to her to prove her wrong; she of course never read it. I posted it on deviantart and I think fictionpress at the time so I could probably rustle it up, I haven't read it in 10+ years but I can't imagine it would be very good
