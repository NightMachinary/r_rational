I was military, voluntarily. The concept of serving something larger than yourself, even if it absolutely sucked, was and still is a big deal. To have deserted, something had to have gone really really wrong on a lot of levels.

Like, you're in, right? You are in a unit. You interact with the other people in your unit, with your leadership, and with the mission you are given. Those are the big three.

If you desert you are deserting all three of those things. It means you abandoned friends, or absolutely failed to make friends - or lost the ones you did make. It means you deserted your commander (not as big a deal most times, since most commander are only average. If you desert a good commander, man, wow. A bad one though makes it more likely.)

And you deserted the mission. Even if you're barely alive you are a part of that, of the group struggle to survive. To leave isn't to just betray your country, but to betray all the core values you've been living and working for the entire time you were in the military, voluntary or not. It's a slap at the people- good, bad, and indifferent- who stay and try.

Sometimes it's justified- but rarely. There's usually another way, and often the situation that you're in is temporary. Most folks cope with it by enduring or slacking off or trying to make it better somehow.

To desert is a big deal. You can never go back. It's a sort of self exile, a social isolation.
