With a userscript or userstyle extension this can be done easily. I use [[https://greasyfork.org/scripts/3337-fanfiction-tools][Fanfiction Tools]] with TamperMonkey, which does a number of things including text selection, loading every chapter in one page, color hinting for things like update frequency, word to chapter ratio, and some other things I'm probably forgetting.

Not super-simple, though. It's a five-minute solution, the benefits of which I've been reaping ever since.
