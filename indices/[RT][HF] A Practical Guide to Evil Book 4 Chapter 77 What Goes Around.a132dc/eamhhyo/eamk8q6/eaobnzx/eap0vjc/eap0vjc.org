Well, I suppose. I feel that's more because Catherine's the protagonist though and we don't get too much focus on interaction between heroes themselves.

Also, William is too grim and White Knight too serious to joke. All the "Lovable Rogue" characters that would normally be heroes in other stories are now under Catherine's banner, except maybe Bard?
