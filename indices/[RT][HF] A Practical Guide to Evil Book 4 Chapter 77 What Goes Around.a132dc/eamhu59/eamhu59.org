Err, so that was awesome and all... but I can't parse whether Ubua is actually trying to help or just murdering Cat, like friends do. Though murdering Cat is probably helpful in that it will throw a wrench in whatever plans Sve Noc has to perpetuate her usurpation of Cat's mantle.

Also, is there any chance there's tatters of Squire hanging about, now that she's all mortal again? I wasn't clear on the exact mechanics of her losing it in the first place.
