  Also, is there any chance there's tatters of Squire hanging about, now that she's all mortal again? I wasn't clear on the exact mechanics of her losing it in the first place.

Her mantle basically subsumed the Name of Squire. She still had it, technically, but we've had a lot of lines like:

#+begin_quote
  My mantle and my Name woke, intertwined beyond separation
#+end_quote

and

  It would have been a lie, though, to still call myself the Squire. No one did anymore. I could still feel the bare bones of that Name, some days, but the flesh and muscle over them was Winter's. Whatever I'd done in Liesse, when I had broken Masego's scaffolding, it had ended my tenure. I had no aspects anymore, only the power that my mantle lent me.

Combine that with how she's spoken about having lost any and all power, and no mention of anything like a Name or Name abilities, and she's almost certainly just a plain old human at this point.
