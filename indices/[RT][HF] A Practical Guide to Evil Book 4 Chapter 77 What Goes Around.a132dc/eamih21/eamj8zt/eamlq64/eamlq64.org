  So her Mantle remaining may be necessary to the Sacrifice thing Sve Noc is trying to achieve.
#+end_quote

This is speculation with nothing to back it up, and requires another few layers of assumption to be added in for it to make sense.

I think it's much more likley that Rumena just made a mistake.

  Sve's behavior isn't rational
#+end_quote

I'll say it isn't. She has two goals here, apparently, kill Cat and to "break [her] down"and she's very bad at following through on either of those tasks. She's making no progress on the murder front - which, fair enough, monologuing is a time-old tradition - but her actions on the breaking Cat front don't add up to anything after a single, failed attempt at torture and gathering up minions who are counterproductive to the actual goal.

  This is even called out in the current chapter concerning the mismatch of "Drow madness" and "Winter madness"
#+end_quote

You quotes "Drow madness" and "Winter madness", but those words never actually appeared in the chapter. Hell, I don't think they've ever appeared in the /series/.

What the chapter /did/ say was that Winter alienation means nothing to Sve, because she's so far gone into whatever it is the Night has done to her. What this means for her mental state, there's no way to know.

But none of this explains what Sve is doing. She's not just /sub optimal/, she's /inconsistent/. Which is weird when she was called out as "static". Again, she tortures Cat for backchat, then stands around while she snarkily requests a smoke and wipes vomit on the Mighty.

EDIT: The closet I can come to an explanation here is that Sve gave up on this goal of breaking Cat after her failed attempt.

  Cat aims to "tell a story" in front of an audience. The bluff of a plan in front of witnesses inclined for treason is merely a first brush at painting something.

  The Archer - Cat dialogue earlier highlighted this rare trait of Catherine: Her true superpower is being a literal main character:

  She always acts as if the universe is an audience, paying attention to her. Inside an universe running heavily on narrative logic, this offers her incredible agency. Why?

  Because by "entertaining" the readers, she gains plot armor and the entire story itself will bend to ensure her continued existence (through whatever setbacks and "penultimate" failures) there might be.
#+end_quote

Sorry, but I'm not sure what this point is meant to address. I take it that you raised this up in response to something specific I said, but I can't tell what that was.

I don't dispute that Cat tries to focus on the narrative (Even if she's made some questionable decisions as of late - see also, the entire Sve-Cat conflict thus far), but I also don't see how it ties what's happening here or my comment?

In general, though, I think there's a couple of thing to keep in mind here:

One is Cat seemingly no longer has a Name - it got ripped out with her soul and the mantle. She's an ordinary human without a Role to fulfil, at the moment. This makes it kind of hard for her to leverage her Role for story purposes.

The second is that there's a limit to what stories can do: we had the example of Will vs Urulan, and the sort of story it would take for Will to have even a chance in a fight, given to us earlier and the gap between Cat and Sve right now is exponentially larger.

  Catherine seems like a surprisingly talented "brawler" at story-fu: She intuits certain narrative laws & trends
#+end_quote

Reminder that Cat apparently didn't realise that there were any stories going on in the Everdark at all, until Archer pointed out all the obvious coincidences to her. It doesn't help that she's quite unfamiliar with Drow stories, unless she's been having Ivah tell them to her offscreen. And Black just recently showed us all the danger of that.
