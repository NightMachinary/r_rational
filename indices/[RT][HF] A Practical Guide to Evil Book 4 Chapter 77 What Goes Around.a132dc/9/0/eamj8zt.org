Narrative Logic applies here:

- Cat has been stripped of nearly anything that marks her identity. The readers can ignore that because she is the viewpoint character, but in-universe, the Mantle of Woe is one of the last things clearly pointing at Cat and signifying "This is Catherine Foundling, the Queen of Winter". So her Mantle remaining may be necessary to the Sacrifice thing Sve Noc is trying to achieve.

- Sve's behavior isn't rational - her long use of her domain has warped her mind into certain habits and perspectives that offer her little flexibility and even less lateral thinking. *This is even called out in the current chapter concerning the mismatch of "Drow madness" and "Winter madness"*

- Cat aims to "tell a story" in front of an audience. The bluff of a plan in front of witnesses inclined for treason is merely a first brush at painting something.

The Archer - Cat dialogue earlier highlighted this rare trait of Catherine: Her true superpower is being a literal main character:

She always acts as if the universe is an audience, paying attention to her. Inside an universe running heavily on narrative logic, this offers her incredible agency. Why?

Because by "entertaining" the readers, she gains plot armor and the entire story itself will bend to ensure her continued existence (through whatever setbacks and "penultimate" failures) there might be.

Catherine seems like a surprisingly talented "brawler" at story-fu: She intuits certain narrative laws & trends, then outplays her opponents on a meta-level that is often one or several tiers higher than they can imagine.
