A few definitions of slave for you:

From the oxford dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  1 a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.

  1.1 A person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation.

  1.2 A person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something.
#+end_quote

From the Collins dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  1 countable noun A slave is someone who is the property of another person and has to work for that person.

  2 countable noun You can describe someone as a slave when they are completely under the control of another person or of a powerful influence.
#+end_quote

From the Merrian-Webster dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  1 : a person held in servitude as the chattel of another

  2 : one that is completely subservient to a dominating influence
#+end_quote

Whereas servant is defined as:

#+begin_quote
  1 A person who performs duties for others, especially a person employed in a house on domestic duties or as a personal attendant.
#+end_quote

,

#+begin_quote
  1 countable noun A servant is someone who is employed to work at another person's home, for example as a cleaner or a gardener.

  2 countable noun You can use servant to refer to someone or something that provides a service for people or can be used by them.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  one that serves others
#+end_quote

respectively.

The definitions for slave are much more fitting. The Drow are controlled absolutely by Cat, and are allowed only as much freedom as she gives them. Remember, one of the oaths is:

#+begin_quote
  you will follow the orders of the Sovereign of Moonless Nights without intent to subvert or pervert the spirit in which they were given
#+end_quote

and breaking it means instant death. There's an argument to be made that they are an extension of her will, which is far more than property. They recieve no wages, and Cat is happy to have them die for the sake of tactical advantage (impressing Soln with her ruthlessness).

As for the definition of servant... none of it really fits? I guess they perform duties for Cat, but not domestic duties, and they /do/ serve her, but to a degree that's far outside the boundaries of what a servant would usually do.

I really have no clue how you could argue for "servant" over "slave" here, but if you've got a different perspective I'm happy to listen to it.

#+begin_quote
  Nobody forced the drow to swear oaths in exchange for Night
#+end_quote

Except for the part where it was join or die, right?
