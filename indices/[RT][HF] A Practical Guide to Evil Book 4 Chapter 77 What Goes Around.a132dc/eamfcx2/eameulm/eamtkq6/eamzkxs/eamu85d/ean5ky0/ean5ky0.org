My money is on Akua shoving that shard of Winter she stole back into Cat. Doesn't seem like a right junction to betray Cat right now. Even if that succeeded, and she managed to put down both Cat and Sve, she'd still be stuck in Everdark, without support (given that mantle seems to decide the titles of people endowed with Winter it's unlikely Akua would inherit title of Sovereign of Moonless Nights, and that'd mean no obedience from Peerage and rest of Cat's army), with Archer likely still out there and pissed off, and with exit closed off by dwarven army. The odds of this working out in her favor are terrible, and Akua is too smart to take a gamble like that, especially given that her current long term goal is just to survive.

Helping Cat however looks better. Cat has been consistently hitting above her weight, so betting on her beating Sve in a second round is not that dangerous. And if they win, even if she had to sacrifice that bit of Winter she had, well... Collar Fair was useful, Collar Fairy would be less useful without Winter powers, yes? So maybe grant back some Winter. Hell, I'd imagine she'd try angling for full Winter title in this scenario.
