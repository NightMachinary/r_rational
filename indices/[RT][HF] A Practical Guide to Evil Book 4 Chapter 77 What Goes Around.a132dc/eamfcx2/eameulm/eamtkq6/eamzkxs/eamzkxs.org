I laughed, but thinking about it, this really is probably exactly how Praesi think of friendships. In Ubua's eyes, her (likely) killing Cat here is exactly what a friend would do, especially since it will likely empower her and deprive their mutual enemy, Sve Noc, of said power. Praesi friendship really is about how you can use your friends to get ahead and stick it to your enemies.
