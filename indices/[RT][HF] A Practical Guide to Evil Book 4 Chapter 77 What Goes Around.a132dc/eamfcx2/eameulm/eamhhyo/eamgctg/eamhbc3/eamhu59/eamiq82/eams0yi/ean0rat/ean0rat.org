Yep, I think they can, how do you think new names are made? Some names are foreign or twisted, like Heirophant, or Black Queen, names that share roots with other names, but are also Parallels.

Heirophant v. Warlock; a Heirophant being a sage of miracles and learning, while a warlock is of curses and hoarding power. Black Queen v. Queen of Callow; an even clearer parallel, Queen of Callow is a name for the queen of Callow of the gods above, Black Queen is for the Gods Bellow.

But what if someone wanted to craft a new name out of neutral power? I have said many times that there are no Neutral names, and that even 'neutral' named have a clear allegiance, like Ranger to Bellow, as a name has too draw power from somewhere.

However, what if a particularly ambitious mortal killed a couple of fairly neutral Godlike entities, say a highly ranked fae noble and the source of the Drows power, in a feat of such dastardly heroics that it makes an a new name from that power? One that is not reliant on above or below for its aspects?

God I hope this comes true, it would be so rediculously badass.
