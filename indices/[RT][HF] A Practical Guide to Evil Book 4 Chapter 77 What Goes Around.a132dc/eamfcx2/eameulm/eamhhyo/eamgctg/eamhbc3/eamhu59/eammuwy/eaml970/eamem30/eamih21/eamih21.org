  “Since murder doesn't seem to be working out for me, I'll try bribery,” I continued. “Betray... who is it you're working for at the moment?”

Cat, you are laughably bad at this at whole situation.

#+begin_quote
  “You are a surprisingly terrible liar,” Mighty Rumena said
#+end_quote

Like, every part of this situation.

#+begin_quote
  “You warred against an entity older than the civilization that birthed you,” the Mighty said. “Wielding weapons in which it holds superior mastery, following a plan laughably straightforward and fielding armies which owed you no true loyalty. All this, and somehow you believed you would win.”
#+end_quote

Rumena calling it how it is. Cat really did not think any of this through. She had a half-hearted plan to deal with the Longstrides, which was fairly terrible and failed immediately, and /no/ plan to deal with Sve, who she knew would be making her play at the battle of Great Strycht. This is the logical outcome.

#+begin_quote
  “I believe you might be the single most aggressively ignorant creature I've ever encountered.”
#+end_quote

Look, I know Mighty Rumena is kind of a huge dick, but I can't help but find myself agreeing with a lot of what it's saying.

#+begin_quote
  Ah, and there it was. The reason it hadn't just nonchalantly torn off my head back when it'd first found me choking on my death in the middle of a broken wreck. I was still of use somehow. A sacrifice to cement Sve Noc's hold on my domain?
#+end_quote

Oh, I was wondering why Rumena hadn't immediately killed her last chapter. But this is still not good for Cat's long-term survival.

#+begin_quote
  I'd earned the mantle through murder, back in the old days of about two years ago.
#+end_quote

How time flies. I really need to go back at some point and look at all the timeskips, maybe make a bit of a timeline.

#+begin_quote
  The droplet that tipped the cup was that even as I began spewing out clear water and bile the Mantle of Woe fell down over my face, smothering it all over my face.
#+end_quote

Right, Cat still has the mantle of Woe. I wonder if this will become relevant.

More seriously, taking magic items from prisoners seems like it should be basic protocol. Whether the prisoner is basically powerless or not, I don't think anyone would want to have to deal without whatever shenanigans their artifacts might potentially be able to get up to. Case probably in point - the rest of this book.

#+begin_quote
  It glanced at Sve and found no answer there -- she seemed a little miffed by my refusal to take this seriously
#+end_quote

I'm vaguely surprised that Sve gave up trying to humble Cat after a single failure. She went from inflicting unspeakable terror onto Cat for her backchat, to engaging Cat in a little back-and-forth, standing around while Cat enjoys a smoke and gets her digs in. Why's Sve even dragging this out? You'd figure she'd be keen to complete her apotheosis now that she finally has the opportunity.

#+begin_quote
  In the absence of an actual scheme, it seemed like I was going to have to bluff a living goddess.
#+end_quote

Well, there goes the idea that Cat planned for this outcome. And Cat, you just had an object lesson in how bad you are at lying.

#+begin_quote
  “Why so many warriors, Sve?” I asked, opening my eyes. “Witnesses, honour guard? Nah, this is best left quiet. Not the kind of knowledge you want floating out there. I think it's a statement of power. A reminder of hopelessness, to break me down. But if that's the case, why these warriors?”
#+end_quote

This seems like a weird idea.

First off, all these Drow are nothing compared to Sve's own power, as she proves a moment later, so bringing them as a statement of power is weird. Secondly they're the wrong Drow to bring, as Cat herself mentions a moment later, and so bringing them doesn't prove anything except that she can't bring Cat's army. Thirdly, why would Sve care about breaking Cat? Sve's literally about to kill her, as of which moment Cat's opinions will matter to nobody, and she literally just gave up on tormenting Cat and instead stood there while Cat asked for a smoke and wiped vomit on one of the Mighty, which is about as far from "breaking her down" as she can get.

#+begin_quote
  Sure, I would have made you servants.
#+end_quote

Slaves, Cat. The word you're looking for is slaves. If, that is, slaves were forced to obey any and all orders in the spirt they were given or face instant death. So a word worse than slaves? Either way, if you're going to go down this road,Cat, at least own it.

#+begin_quote
  the same happened all around me, every Longstride messily collapsing.
#+end_quote

Did Rumena die? That could be important. It's in Sve's interests to keep this quiet so you'd think she'd kill it too, but Sve's handling of this execution thus far has been pretty sloppy. Which it has to be, I know: Sve holds all the cards here and wants to kill Cat, but if she's allowed to kill Cat then the serial ends.

#+begin_quote
  “Then fear me, drow,” Akua Sahelian announced, “for I wield the power of friendship.”
#+end_quote

Okay, that's a great line.

No clue how Akua is going to help out here. Sve can kill Cat casually at any moment she chooses, gaining control of both the mantle and Akua with it, and Akua doesn't hae anything close to the power needed to stop that from happening.

Maybe Akua is planning on killing Cat herself, before Sve can get to it? I wouldn't rate that as likely, but she needs some sort of creative solution to the problem at hand.
