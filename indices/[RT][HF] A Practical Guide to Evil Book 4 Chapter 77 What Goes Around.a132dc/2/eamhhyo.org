A lot of webfiction stories throw banter in at inappropriate times (namely moments of high tension which acts to diffuse said tension) and as i was reading this chapter i was ready to say how, regardless of how humorous the banter was, it was detracting from the impending climax...but honestly it ended up so fucking hilarious and entertaining that EE brute forced his way through whatever narrative heuristics would normally apply.
