Yeah, this whole arc feels like a side-quest that's just retreading a lot of the same ground. Another chapter of Cat wondering about how her relationship with Akua. Another chapter of Cat wondering if she's doing the right thing. Another Chapter where Cat very nearly gets killed by some low-tier enemy and realizes she needs to take these fights seriously.

How short a lot of these updates feel certainly doesn't help matters. How many updates lately have consisted of Cat having a single conversation with someone? It's like the in-between missions phase in an RPG where you go talk to all the companions until their dialogue is exhausted.
