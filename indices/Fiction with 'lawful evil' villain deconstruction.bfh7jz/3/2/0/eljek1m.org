I like it a lot, but I'm a huge Sanderson/cosmere fan. There are Wild West-y parts, but overall it's much more "Victorian steampunk but with magic." It also feels more lighthearted than the original trilogy, which might be partly because it doesn't take place in a tyrannical theocracy under ash-filled skies.
