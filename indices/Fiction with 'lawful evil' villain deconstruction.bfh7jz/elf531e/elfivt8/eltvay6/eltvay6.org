  I'm only acquainted with canon. I thought the evil all came from perversions of his secular doctrine. Can you give examples?

Even pre-Horus Heresy, the Emperor's policy was to purge xenos (aka: any sentient non-human species) and to squash human opposition /at any cost/. Anyone who wasn't willing to submit was crushed. Anyone who didn't want to let go their religious beliefs was brutally repressed. Granted, he had reasons for that behaviour (namely, hoped that by completely squashing religion he'd starve the Chaos Gods of faith and kill them), but it was still really tyrannical. In addition, he still was arrogant. He did cause the Horus Heresy, basically, first by letting Lorgar (the Word Bearer primarch) do his thing and then brutally humiliating him in front of his Legion, then by trusting Horus with the role of Warmaster. He was walking a very fine thread, but then committed some serious blunders which plunged his whole enterprise into Chaos (quite literally), rendering all the suffering he had inflicted all the more pointless.
