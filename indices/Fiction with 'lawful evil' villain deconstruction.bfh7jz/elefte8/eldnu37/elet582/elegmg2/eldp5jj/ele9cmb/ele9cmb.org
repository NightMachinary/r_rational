Dexter is fun example of "lawful evil" because he literally works for the police department. (Kinda season 1 spoilers:) Dexter's "backstory" is basically about his lawful good father realizing that Dexter is an evil kid, and realizing that that if Dexter is going to be evil, he can at least be /lawful/ evil. Also, in later seasons, Quinn sort of becomes a foil for Dexter as a sort of "chaotic good" character, culminating in season 7 when he murders a mobster after learning that he raped a girl. It sets up an interesting dichotomy with Dexter, where Dexter is cold, calculating, and by the book, while Quinn is impulsive and moody; Dexter works to control his urges and stick to "the code," while when Quinn kills it's because he listened to his conscience and shot an evil person because it felt like the right thing to do in the heat of the moment.
