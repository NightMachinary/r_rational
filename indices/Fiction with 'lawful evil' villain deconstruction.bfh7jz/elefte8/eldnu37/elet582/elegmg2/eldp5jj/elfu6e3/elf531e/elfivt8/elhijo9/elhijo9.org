Well, he is more tough and self-centered than evil, dragging the hymanity to better future, *kicking and sreaming*, and also is not exactly human, but:

Unification Wars were a giant massacre ended in enforcing of harsh law written by Himself and only himself. Not all of people he sentenced then were bad - they were unnecessary for his plan. Like a pretty good priest in the Last Church by Graham McNeill. Also all warriors that he used for war were killed after its end. Means and tools to an end.

During the Crusade several Worlds were destroyed. Genocide was considered bad last time I've checked.

As was proofed in the Dark Imperium He never loved no man even his sons. Engineer, warrior, politic, mage and a lot more. Dad,huh? Not quite. Some people think that the Heresy florished upon daddy issues. Certainly true for Angron, Magnus, Kurze, Perturabo, Lorgar and Mortarion. Especially so for Angron and Lorgan: it cost him nothing to save Angron's comrades or not bombing the Lorgar's capital to make a point in argument.
