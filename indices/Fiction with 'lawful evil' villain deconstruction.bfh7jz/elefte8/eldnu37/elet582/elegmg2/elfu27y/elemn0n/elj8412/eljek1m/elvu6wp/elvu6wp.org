The 2nd Era is Hella fun Brandon has managed to tone down the grimdark and ha gotten /much/ better at character development and progression, the original trilogy is fantastic but has its flaws, I would say that those flaws are compensated for in 2nd era, though it is a very different type of story. Honestly, Brandon is always talking about how he wants a Mistborn video game, but if he just jumped over the original trilogy, and set the Game in the backstory of the 2nd Era MC, it would be /fucking amazing/ who wouldn't want to play Mistborn / Red dead redemption?
