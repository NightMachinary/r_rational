Seriously. It's a series that's longer than Harry Potter (and closing in on A Song of Ice and Fire), has extremely consistent thrice weekly updates, and EE may well be putting out his best work right now. (Though admittedly we've probably said that at a lot of points in the series like Ubua at the Battle of the Camps, Ratface's Ex, Black at the Vales and too many more to count)
