This is the best example I can think of. Not to spoil anything but this gets much muddier and addressed in later seasons.

The movie Les Mis√©rables has my favorite example of this with Javert who sees himself as lawful good. If you enjoy musicals check it out, although if you have singing experience I hear some of the performances aren't great.
