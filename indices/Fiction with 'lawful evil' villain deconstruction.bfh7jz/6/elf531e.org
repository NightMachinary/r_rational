[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight]] Tropes are your best friends.

Les trois mousquetaires - should fit just fine, if you read the sequel. Literally all characters repent their actions against the main antagonist. He was a hero and a patriot in the best meaning the word has.

Worth the candle. Greatest (and somewhat lost) ruler of all times was quite DnD's lawful evil.

Forged destiny - small but good episode with Tyrian. Hero that failed viewed as bad hero. Then he become bad. As a whole book isn't about the villians.

Syper Powereds - well, haven't finished it yet, but probably fits. Praise the Globe.

Team AMBR: Finding redemption. "Evil" = violent people. Not always bad or wrong. Beware: merciful MC that drives me nuts.

[[http://willsaveworldforgold.com]] - Ardon is the best evil bitch character I've ever seen.

Half-joke is a joke only by half, so - /Il Principe. A good ruler is a bad person./

You may try Warhammer 40k. I mean, Emperor is great and all but also pretty evil.
