Main character in Code Geass is, in my opinion, more straight-up villain than simple anti-hero, and yet I sympathized with him and thought his heroic counterpart was naive and ineffectual. Rather than opposing characters openly admitting that he was a good guy, I feel like his choices were ambiguous in-story, despite his place as the main character.

The anime is fantastic, and though the main character is certainly very clever, he's definitely not as rational as he could be, constrained by emotions that work against his best interest, lack of information, and lack of real-world experience in trying to lead a revolution and change the world. Even so, he actually manages to achieve his goals, to some degree.
