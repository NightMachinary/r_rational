So I keep trying to come up with a cool thing I can build, and inspired by your advice from the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fyubf/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d2d4m2l][previous thread]], I have launched [[http://writingstreak.io/][Writing Streak]] - the tool to help people to practice their writing skills and develop a habit of writing regularly.

It keeps track of daily word count, gives you writing prompts, has a github-like calendar representing the amount of words you have written each day, and all sorts of cool features to help you focus on writing. I think it's gonna be pretty great.

It seems to be taking off, it did really well on HN and [[/r/scifi/]], and in the past 4 days gained 460 users, so that's awesome =)

I hope you will find it useful!
