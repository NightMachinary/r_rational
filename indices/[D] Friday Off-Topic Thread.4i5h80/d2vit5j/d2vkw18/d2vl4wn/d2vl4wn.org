Unfortunately, Google Docs isn't too great with large projects (like a novel). I had originally written /The Timewise Tales/ in Google Docs, but at around 40K words it started loading text more slowly, loading comments more slowly, and having trouble scrolling. I split it up into three parts, but it was a pain in the butt. (I've since moved to Scrivener.)
