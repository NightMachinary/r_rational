I'm hoping that someone with a little more technical knowledge than I have could help me.

What I'd like to do is a video of what editing a novel looks like. Let's say that I had a 100K word novel and, in the course of editing, I make ten thousand changes to it. If I did each one of those changes as a git commit, I would have a catalog of how I got from a completely unedited novel to a completely edited novel, and I don't think it would be too hard to do an extremely fast-forwarded visualization of that (or at least, it would be hard to do but I can at least see the path I'd take to get to an end result). From there, I could make a heatmap of changes, do data visualization on /what/ was changed with parts-of-speech tagging, etc. And I could make a cool video that show every edit, scrolling up and down the work adding and deleting words at a rapid pace.

I'm like 90% sure that git isn't the best way to do this, but I don't know what would be. Ideally the gathering of data wouldn't slow me down with the actual editing.
