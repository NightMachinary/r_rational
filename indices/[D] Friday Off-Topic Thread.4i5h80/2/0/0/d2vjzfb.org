Yeah, that is helpful. It looks like the input for it is a git branch, which means that either they make a new commit for every minor change (doubtful) or just set up a separate script that makes a new commit for every save/change/interval or something.

I suppose I could work with that. The important thing to me is figuring out how to capture the data, because that has to be done as editing is happening and can't be worked on after the fact.
