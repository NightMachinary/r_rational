I'm not sure that's strictly true. Rand was generally of the opinion that intelligence and reason == good, while thoughtlessness and stupidity == evil. About three quarters of her villains are well-meaning but too stupid to do the right thing, while the other quarter are pure evil. I believe, though I can't really say for sure, that the latter were portrayals of Soviet leadership, and their lack of obvious motives comes from a bad case of Typical Mind Fallacy - Rand was completely unable to wrap her head around the Soviet leadership, and so her portrayal of them wound up as Ayn Rand-as-Stalin; an intellectual materialist inexplicably bent on destroying everything for no discernable reason. Ironically, I think Sauron-as-Stalin would've been a more accurate portrayal of conflicting values.
