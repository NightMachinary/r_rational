I think that the widespread belief that Ayn Rand is a terrible writer is actually a direct result of her philosophy. In many cases, I suspect the accusers never actually read any of her books. For example, I've heard a lot of accusations of Mary Sueishness, and yet the protagonists of Atlas Shrugged do nothing but lose everything they care about, repeatedly, for the entire novel.

Likewise, while it's true she gets really preachy about communism, so does Orwell in Animal Farm, and yet I never hear anyone bitching about that - because he was /right/. Communism was an absolute catastrophe.
