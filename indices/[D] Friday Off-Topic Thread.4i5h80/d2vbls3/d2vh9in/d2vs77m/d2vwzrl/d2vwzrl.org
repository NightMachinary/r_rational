Orwell is not talking about communism only though, he's talking about censorship and authoritarianism. In [[http://home.iprimus.com.au/korob/Orwell.html][this unpublished preface to animal farm]], he stated that the Farm was a warning for then-Britain as well. He was demonizing Russia when Russia was an ally, somewhat different to Rand demonizing them when they were the enemy du jour.

  The servility with which the greater part of the English intelligentsia have swallowed and repeated Russian propaganda from 1941 onwards would be quite astounding if it were not that they have behaved similarly on several earlier occasions.

I will admit to only making it about 150 pages through Atlas Shrugged. The rest of it might be great, as I've heard said of Proust, but I don't have the time or wherewithal to labor through it. To put it bluntly, I was bored, as is the case with a lot of fantasy, because there is so much work to do in understanding the world before you care about any of the characters. It winds up feeling like Tell instead of Show. (I put Tolkien in this same category, almost unreadably bland description after description, with black/white morality that is set in stone from the beginning.)

I still haven't read Lathe of Heaven, and I'll probably finish all of Le Guin's catalog before I feel any need to wander back near Rand.
