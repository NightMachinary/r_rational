Ah, see I read /The Fountainhead/ with an open mind in college, since I was keen on this girl who had loaned it to me (it was her favorite book). I was all primed and ready to say a bunch of great things about it ... but I hated how it was written.

It's been about a decade since I read it, but that always struck me as one of the most hamfisted, unrealistic things I had ever read. And if you define a Mary Sue as someone who has no flaws and warps the fictitious world around them, then I think Roark definitely qualifies.

(It didn't work out with the girl from college, and I never ended up reading /Atlas Shrugged/.)
