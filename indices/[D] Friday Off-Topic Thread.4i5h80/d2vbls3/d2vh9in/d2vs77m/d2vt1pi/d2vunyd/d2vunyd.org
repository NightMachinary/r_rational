I'm going to leave spoilers unmarked, here, because I actually don't know how to do them. Be advised.

I think "warps the world around him" is putting it a bit strongly. Several people actively conspire against him, everyone hates him, he's (unfairly) critically panned, and he's pretty much a failure as an architect. He also has rather a lot of flaws, and his borderline insanity and complete social naivete destroys his life several times. While it's undeniable that Rand felt that forthright people with no ability to sell themselves or adapt to circumstances were /morally/ superior, her representation of how they tended to end up in real life was extremely reasonable.

While the trial scene is admittedly surreal, his actual plan was more along the lines of borderline jury tampering than impassioned speeches to the soul. Roark chose a jury of the most bitter, angry, disillusioned people he could find, and the prosecution, used to lawyers trying to stock the jury with sympathetics, thought he was an idiot and let it go uncontested. In court, Roark argued that the government had violated his incredibly clear contract (which it had), but that the Soviet-style government's complete lack of respect for the law prevented him from seeking any sort of recourse (which it did). The jury, which again was stocked with the most pissed-off people available, acquitted him.

The rest of the speech is just an author tract with little impact on the plot, much like what you'd see in HPMoR, and probably the result of Rand's habitual drug use.
