Having read each book at least twice (and maybe three times, though I'm not sure), I definitely prefer /Atlas Shrugged/ to /The Fountainhead/. If the protagonists are compared, Dagny Taggart is a lot more realistic-seeming than Howard Roark is--and the entire point of /Atlas Shrugged/ is that the Gary Stu is largely absent from the story.
