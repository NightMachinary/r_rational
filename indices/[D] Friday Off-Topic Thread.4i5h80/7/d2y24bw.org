As someone who won money betting on the ending of HPMOR, I am curious what the community's thoughts are on making predictions about non-rational media. It is seemingly impossible, beyond a what-is-the-writer's-motivation meta-level. Which can be easily foiled by writers not choosing the most dramatically ideal ending, which seems to happen constantly.

Notably: There is a television program currently airing entitled 'Quantico', which presents a hopelessly unrealistic view of a nonsense-based "crime-fighting" organization, which, in-universe, is called "the FBI". Aside from demonstrating perhaps the most dysfunctional hiring process known to man or beast in the main timeline, the flash-forward timeline is about a terrorist attack, and the trainees are the prime suspects (for a reason so massively dumb that it is almost dramatically unimpeachable -- given how flimsy the reason is, at some point you can't question it without outright telling the audience all the characters are morons for not double checking the premise of their investigation).

Is it possible to predict such drama-schlock?
