It's important to note that I consider things like Detective Conan (I've only seen the early stuff, I assume it gets terrible?) to ride the line. Whether individual episode represent fair play mysteries is remarkably hard to guess. Some are so cryptically presented that, yes, while we saw the clues, there's no normal person that would be able to attach significance to most of them.

Unless someone can stand up and say they were able to solve more than half of the Detective Conan mysteries.
