  From 4chan's "Literature" board, a nice explanation of how Atlas Shrugged can be interesting even for people who don't like the espoused philosophy, and a vaguely-interesting discussion of objectivism that also touches on contracts for tit-for-tat "friendship"

I've often thought that even the people who hate Rand's ideas might like AS if they approach it as a fantasy novel. Most fantasy is 95% action, with some minor philosophical element exploring the nature or motive of the Evil Villain. AS flips that over, being mostly about the philosophy, with a few action scenes thrown in. I think I did that by accident, when I first undertook to reading it just to write a definitive smackdown, and ended up absolutely loving it. Think of it as, not "what if dragons were real?", but "what if capitalism were correct?"

Also, any fan of Rand's would say that gifts between friends /are/ earned. They're earned by the virtues that make you like the person in the first place. It's funny to me how anti-materialist types always seem to have so much trouble grasping the notion of non-material trades.
