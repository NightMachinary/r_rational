That's why I was disappointed in the movie adaptations. They were so interested in story fidelity, that they didn't bother to make good /films/.

A gloriously Art Deco dieselpunk fairy tale about railroads, mysterious Nietzschean supermen, and madcap industrial espionage could be a lot of fun... and a popular (but /deeply/ abridged) movie would have gotten a lot more people to read the book than the bloated, preachy-to-the-choir ones did.
