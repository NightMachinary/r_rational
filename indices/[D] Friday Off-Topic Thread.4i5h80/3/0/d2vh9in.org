I think Ayn Rand is a terrible writer, completely separately from her terrible philosophy. It's very polemical and not motivated by character drive like the fiction we usually talk about here.

For better and similar philosophy read Nietzsche, for better female written political fantasy read Ursula Le Guin. I don't see any reason to slog through her stuff when there is much better available.
