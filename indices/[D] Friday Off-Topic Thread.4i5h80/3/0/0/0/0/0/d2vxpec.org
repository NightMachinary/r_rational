  I think "warps the world around him" is putting it a bit strongly. Several people actively conspire against him, everyone hates him, he's (unfairly) critically panned, and he's pretty much a failure as an architect.

To me that's part and parcel of being a Mary Sue. A new girl comes to Hogwarts and suddenly Hermione hates her because her intellectualism is being challenged, or Harry hates her because she's a better seeker ... sometimes (often, I'd say) other characters hate a Mary Sue because the Mary Sue is better than them, and this hatred only serves to highlight how awesome the Mary Sue is.

That's how I felt about Roark. It's not that he was socially naive, it was that he refused to play the social games because he was this stoic, resolute, superior being. He got attacked and was hated by a lot of people, but I always got the sense that Rand was trying to show us how great he was, not trying to show us how he was flawed.

But as I said, it's been a decade since I've read it.
