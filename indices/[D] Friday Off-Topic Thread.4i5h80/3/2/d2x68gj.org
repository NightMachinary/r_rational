I find Rand most interesting as a social phenomenom, why has a work that i generally consideed by literary, philosophical and political commentators to be not very good had such massive impact? It has near singlehandedly led to the resurgence of libertrianism in the republican party and wider US culture.

Part of me thinks its because very few people have much exposure to political philosophy, especially at a young age and in the form of fiction. If so, could other philosophies be similarly influential if they wrote fiction books rather than policy papers?
