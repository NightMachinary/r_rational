I've been trying to put my finger on the "Space battles aesthetic" - what he stories that come out of the spacebattles forum seem to have in common.

There is an emphasis on practicalities and problem solving, lots of discussion of logistics, though without explicit maths, charcters are generally competent but bland, - On a meta level there is more of an idea of stories as experiments with consrained outcomes than of them eing creative exercises.
