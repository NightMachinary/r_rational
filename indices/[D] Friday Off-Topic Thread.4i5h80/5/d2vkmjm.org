Just finished playing [[http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest][Ori and the Blind Forest]], based on a recommendation (or discussion?) I've stumbled upon somewhere around here.

Generally platformers like this frustrate me because the controls in them are usually awkward or poorly thought out. This one though I was enjoying even at difficult parts that in other games would make me [[http://imgur.com/W37TG][violently quit the game.]] The [[http://oriandtheblindforest.wikia.com/wiki/Skills][skills]] were a pleasure to use, the soundtrack and art style were beautiful, the map was interconnected all the way through in a way that reminded me of Dark Souls.

And on a relevant note, are there any /books/ you'd associate with this game's flavour and mechanics of magic?
