I am planning to buy some new wine glasses. Ideally I would like standard bulb shaped glasses with stems. It would be best if they are machine washable. I have done some research on the internet and found conflicting advice about what the best way to purchase these is and where to get them. I am near some fairly fancy stores like Williams-Sonoma and also near some more economical stores like Costco. I usually prefer to buy my appliances and kitchenware Costco because it's pretty good stuff for the price. I was wondering if anyone here had some good advice on what stemware worked well for them.
