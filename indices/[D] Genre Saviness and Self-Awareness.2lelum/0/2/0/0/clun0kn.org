Buffy was structured almost like [[http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-128][Harry Potter in some respects]]. There's a year to each BTVS season, as there is to each of the seven HP books. And BTVS starts with Buffy as a freshman in high school in Season 1, and therefore ends with graduation in Season 3.

Season 3 is therefore, where there's a satisfying ending at the end - Buffy graduates High School, there's a rousing and climactic fight with a major villain, there's a lot of scenes that possess a certain finality. After Season 3, there's a lot of changes and the series as a whole becomes very different. In a lot of ways, the series becomes worse for it, and as already mentioned the series is perfectly ended by the capstones of season 3. While there were some especially powerful and well done episodes in seasons 4+ (for examples - Hush, The Body, and Once More With Feeling), the linked article above is definitely correct that it loses sight of the core metaphor and becomes somewhat unfocused.
