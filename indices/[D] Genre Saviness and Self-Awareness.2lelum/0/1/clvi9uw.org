I don't think EY would necessarily disagree with this: R!Harry mentions at one point that the problem with being "the good guy" is that even when you know someone is taking advantage of that trait to lure you into a trap, you still can't just ignore the trap.

Essentially, a Hero can know full well that they're being manipulated into doing something detrimental, but that they might still rationally decide to do it anyway (if they have no alternative) because their values include putting themselves at risk to help others.
