I'm posting this partially because I disagree with it - or maybe just only agree with it halfway. He covers Deconstruction well enough, but I think that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction][Reconstruction]] can be just as important, if not moreso.

  Intelligent characters would /notice/ if the author was playing it straight.

This ignores the existence of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope][Justified Trope]]. In the [[http://qntm.org/ed][Ed stories]] they have humongous mecha with sounds in space ... but those sounds are piped into the cockpit by a computer program that's creating the sounds based on input from its sensors. Similarly, you can play [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpGang][Let's Split Up]] straight by having the characters split up for logical, intelligent, non-contrived, and completely justified reasons. (Non-contrived is the hardest part of this.)

I think that you could have intelligent, Genre Savy characters who understand that their situations in some ways resemble the stories that they've grown up in, but nevertheless behave the same way as the characters in those stories for reasons that are internally consistent and which spring from their intelligence. They don't do things because that's what people in stories do, they do them because they are, in fact, the correct things to do in their circumstances. (Though I'll also admit that this works better with some tropes and genres than others.) And I do think that seeing the group split up for a reason that's actually good is probably more satisfying for the reader than seeing an author tear apart the idea - criticizing a thing is cheaper and easier than improving it.
