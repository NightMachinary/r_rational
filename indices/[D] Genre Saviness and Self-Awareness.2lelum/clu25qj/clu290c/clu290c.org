Named after an often-used [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase][Catch Phrase]] from _ [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDoo][Scooby-Doo]] _ , [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpGang][Let's Split Up, Gang]] is a common tactical maneuver. In a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG][RPG]] with more playable characters than there are allowable party members, there is usually a point in the game during which the party splits into groups in order to accomplish some goal. This is typically a test to make sure that you've been training all the characters, not just the few you always use. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience][Leaked Experience]] and the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSharing][Bag of Sharing]] come in very handy at this point.
