Yeah, I agree with you on reconstruction. TVTropes itself points out that tropes themselves aren't necessarily evil, or wrong, or dumb. They're just trends in storytelling. A story that deliberately avoids /every/ trend in establishes storytelling rapidly becomes nonsensical post-modern junk that can barely be allowed to have a plot at all.

Although I think that the problem you're pointing out is less due to a disagreement and more of a "you missed a spot" sort of thing. Reconstruction and well-executed tropes are things I think EY is in favor of, but weren't the specific focus of this excerpt.
