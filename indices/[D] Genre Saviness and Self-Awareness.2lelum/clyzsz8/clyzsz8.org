  What would be among your first thoughts, dear reader, on finding that you had been mysteriously transported into a magical world? ”Gosh,” you would think, “this sure does resemble a lot of other books I've read where the protagonist is mysteriously transported into a magical world one morning.” If you had read TV Tropes, you would think the phrase, ‘Portal Fantasy'.
