Genre savviness is a tough trope to work with, because it's by definition unrealistic. Unless there is some in-story reason that the situation is playing out based on certain tropes (like in Cabin in the Woods for example) it's a bit silly for characters to act like they're aware of what kind of story they're in - and even worse for them to act based on that knowledge in ways that wouldn't make sense in the real world.

People watch horror movies and complain about how dumb the characters are, splitting up, investigating or dismissing weird noises as the case may be, etc. when the reality is that their actions are totally reasonable for people who don't know they're in a horror movie. When I hear a weird noise in my house I go check it out without worrying that it might be a murderer or super-natural monster.
