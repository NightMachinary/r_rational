  If you had read TV Tropes, you would think the phrase, *â€˜Portal Fantasy'*.

On a more serious note, this whole idea becomes a lot less meaningful if you really internalise the idea that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/][generalising from fictional evidence]] is a /terrible mistake/.

I don't mean that there is no 'truth' in fiction, since obviously people often find some kind of truth that isn't about literal facts, but there are only two possible sources: the reader, and the writer. In the first case, fiction can enable reflection, prompt consideration of scenarios otherwise inconceivable, etc. In the latter, an author can teach by example - especially ethics, politics, and other mental skills... so long as the author is both competent and a good teacher. On ethics, suffice to say that I would enjoy more stories where pacifism is a decent option. And on the mental side - even when an author has real instead of 'Hollywood' expertise, it's usually hard to tell unless you already know enough not to gain much.

So no, even if I found a portal to another world (or learned magic, etc.), I wouldn't be thinking "how do I avoid the mistakes of characters in my situation" - because they, and the problems they faced, never existed. At most, I'd be treating fiction as a convenient source of inspiration which then goes through a sanity check (mecha: no. re-orient in 0G? yes.)
