The funny thing is that she need not even clarify it as a "bug-infested city".

All cities are bug infested. No one truly appreciates how fucking powerful Skitter would be if she ever went murderous rampage. Frankly it's a bit fucking odd that no PRT Thinker ever read a report of BB and was like "wait. theres a fucking bug-controlling villain cape with no apparent number limit? She needs a kill order signed and locked in a drawer so we can stop her before this get's out of hand".

Now Skitter in the Amazon. That's a fucking whirlwind of death.
