Gods we're the readers and we can /feel/ the sheer scathing fury at these kind of remarks... can you imagine what Cat, who herself has /been through/ these events and is currently seeing her people get killed by these invaders and then hearing them /justify/ it, all the while just in the back of her head an eldrich entity screams for their blood, has to go through? She just showed some of the best self control I've seen from a character period.
