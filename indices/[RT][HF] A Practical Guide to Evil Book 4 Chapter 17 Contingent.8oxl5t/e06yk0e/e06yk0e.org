This was ballsy as all hell, and shows that Catherine is really /desperately/ trying to outgrow her old mentor's teachings. There were sooo many number of ways this could have gone badly. The heroes could have just ignored the truce banner and heaven wouldn't give them any flak for it. Cat could've fallen deeper into winter at Malanza claiming to be the /victim/. Malanza could have seen too much red to even contemplate a retreat. /All/ of this stuff /almost/ happened.

It's like threading the needle of fate through a keyhole you can't even see...
