It's kinda disappointing that we as the readers know that any peace talks either won't work or won't last. Cat owes Larat crowns, and that oath coupled with the existence of the Princes Graveyard means that Procer has a smack down coming.

BUT, that means we get to (hopefully) guess where things go from here. I think this battle is probably over, but the Crusade likely won't end just yet.

Events that are being juggled right now:

1) Black's battle in the Vales with Pappenheim (also Warlock vs Witch) 2) The Dead King is in communication with someone (likely Malicia, or possibly Tyrant) 3) The Free Cities are getting ready to pick a fight (probably Procer) 4) The Watch is on the march, and with Cat up they're ready to be ported

And I think that's it? The demon of Absence is probably dealt with, in-universe the last time one broke it no one realized for a century or two, so I doubt will see anything come of that
