The Northern passage was one of Hasenbachs trump cards. If the army is turned back, and sealed off, then the Vales are the only option. Short of White Knight and Iron Prince breaking Black, the crusade is pretty screwed.

Black may "lose" to White (thus gaining narrative weight to do something downright brutal later on). But White vs Cat, its more likely that White dies rather than Cat in that confrontation.

This is excluding Dead King opening up a 3rd front, which will end this crusade rather brutally. I can totally see Black and Cat teaming up with Crusaders to shut him down, since even Black fears that particular abomination.
