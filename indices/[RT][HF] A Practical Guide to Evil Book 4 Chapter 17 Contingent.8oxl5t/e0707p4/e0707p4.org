I think a lot of readers (including myself) got really excited for a flashy final showdown without realizing the consequences of it: if Cat had stayed and fought 10 heroes by herself, she would have lost and Callow would have been broken. While we all enjoyed the 'heroics' of Akua, it's nice to Cat robbing the Heroes of their narrative momentum once again.

It's even hinted at in the last chapter, when one of the heroes talked about the eyes of the Gods being upon them. It's a familiar climax to a familiar pattern: a final showdown to end all final showdowns, and the heroes would arise victorious after slaying the Black Queen.

Now, Cat gets to win practically. It's pretty clear by now that the only way for Evil to effect lasting change is by winning in small ways. This is Black's education in practice---Cat needs to impact the institutions (i.e. Rozala) and not the Named.
