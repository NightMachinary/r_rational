A leftover thought from the last chapter: what if all the redemption talk from Akua is the set-up for her plan to escape her bindings?

Diabolist seemed to genuinely consider her actions heroic, so the obvious thought is that she's trying to make herself look like a champion for the Callowan side of the conflict, either as Catherine's "follower" or as a narrative leverage to be unleashed at some point. What if she's aware of the greater scope of the coming conflict, and now aims for a redemption story and a common enemy to bring her into the resulting band of five Named? Akua has no way to know about the Witch of the Forest, since she had no previous connection to White Knight's band (or the outside world in general), and the other major practitioner Named all have their respective bands. Even if she suspects the Heavens might have propped up a mage to match Warlock at Red Flower Vales, she might have banked on them dying anyway.

That way, if Catherine ends up maing a truce with Procer (and tries to unseat the Empress, as Akua suspects), she can either return to Praes with a conquering army, putting herself back into prominence (maybe even as a new Chancellor, given her political connections), or fight whatever new opponents emerge, making herself indisposable.

I'm not saying that's a good plan, but it might look feasible from Akua's perspective. Why do you think would she make an attempt at a redemption story?
