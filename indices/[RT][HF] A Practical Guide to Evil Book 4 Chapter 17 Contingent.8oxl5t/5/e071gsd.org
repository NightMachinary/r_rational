Is there any way the Procer army can do anything but surrender?

Heroes aside, they're absolutely screwed. They're in the middle of nowhere, with no food left, and the nearest city is... a week of march away, I think? That's leaving aside that Cat can make a series of fortification on the crusaders' path to force them to stay in battle formation and slow them down, without ever engaging them, thanks to the Arcadia gates. And even if they reach Hedges, they have to siege the city (which they clearly don't have the manpower or time to do) before they can claim any supplies.

They're super duper done.
