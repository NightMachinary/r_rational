They see that in the long term, it will cause less "suffering" if Cat is dead and Callow reverts back to good. Never mind that the Crusade itself will cause thousands of deaths and return Callow to the endless cycle of war and struggle. As long as Callow is "good" again, balance is restored, and will cause less suffering over the long term.

The pilgrim isnt so much blind, as just as willing to burn callow to save it from a (subjectively) worse state. Maybe he knows something we dont.

Maybe he's just another heroic dick.
