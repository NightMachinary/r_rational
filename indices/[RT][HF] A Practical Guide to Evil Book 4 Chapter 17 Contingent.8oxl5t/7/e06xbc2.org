Okay, where's the story going? We have Hierophant probably being resuscitated by Cat, and the enemies regrouping. Saint and Pilgrim clearly do not want to play ball with surrender, and may break with Malanza's truce. If they go part way, why not go the whole way - start calling upon angelic powers, break their word with Cat. At that point, they are truly the villains in the story, and I expect nothing good from there on out. But what form does that take?

Do Saint and Pilgrim find themselves abandoned by the heavens? Unlikely, they're the big boys, and even Black, who's the antithesis of his role, has a measure of power. Heroes cheat, and I can't imagine their power failing them at a critical moment, that's far more a villain trope.

Do the other heroes turn on Saint and Pilgrim? Maybe part of them - I wouldn't be surprised if the younger heroes started fighting each other, or at least leaving, if Saint and Pilgrim break truce.

Does Pilgrim disagree with Saint, who decides to try the reverse decapitation strike? If so, she almost certainly dies, probably to Cat + Archer.

Malanza will almost certainly negotiate a retreat if Saint or Pilgrim dies breaking the truce, or a sizable enough group of the younger heroes depart. The real trick will be negotiating without a failing on the other side, what's the carrot? Does Cat take them back by faerie gate? Drop them somewhere they can ravage Black's forces? Or, playing to Malanza, give her strategic information about the First Prince?

The real problem with all the "Saint screws up" plots is that she literally cannot fail to notice the narrative as we learned earlier, so I doubt she will be the trigger for that. But, who knows? Everybody makes mistakes.
