I just come to both [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and [[/r/PGtE][r/PGtE]] and start refreshing the EE's wordpress at about 4:00 UTC. It's kind of like trying to leave home without checking the stove: I /do/ try to visit other webpages, but every few seconds I'm hit with a wave of doubt about whether I refreshed it /really recently/, until I read the chapter and my brain acknowledges that. Well, that, or I've fallen asleep too late the day before and sleep until 11 AM.
