The fact that the gnomes sent a letter over a thresher and seem to have ignored a Greater Breach machine implies that dealing with them should be as simple as launching a sudden, utterly devastating magical attack. I can't see people who are paranoid about farming implements casually ignoring WMDs unless they somehow can't see or think poorly of magic as a whole.

Either that, or they're wholly immune to all magic. If that's the case, though, Calernia is fucked six ways from Tuesday if the gnomes ever decide to take a swing.
