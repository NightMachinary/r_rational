We return to the point of finite doom. Black would probably be able to twist fates arm into letting him kill one or two of the legends, and then maybe escape the consquences by being forced from the Vales, a token defeat.

While not ideal, allowing the legions to fight in seiges and open field was what they were made to do. The crusade has lots of manpower, but is not infinite. Even if they pushed the front back, all the way to Praes, Malica has already made it clear she will make the Dead King mobilize if she feels threatened.

The crusade will continue if they are forced from the northern pass, but it will not be able to pull off a victory, even in the long term.
