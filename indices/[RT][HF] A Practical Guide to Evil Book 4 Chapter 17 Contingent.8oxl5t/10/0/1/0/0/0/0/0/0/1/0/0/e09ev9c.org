For the majority of the crusaders, the Black Queen is the minor of the threats (at least that's the feeling I get) since the crusade's objective is to destroy whoever has the know how to create the hellgate machine. If Catherine can prove to the crusaders that she is a reasonable ruler and that Procer has more to gain by her being in power, that would be a huge political victory. Which is why she made rules of war with the Pilgrim and offered to ship them directly to the empress' door. She meant it too, but then they couldn't really promise to /not/ invade Callow even if she is doing all this, since a minor threat is still a threat. So that's why they're fighting the fight.

You also have to remember that the tropes are heavily favoured against Cat. She is a recently crowned Evil Queen who has never been beaten in a battle, and the heroes are combining their powers to try and beat her (as a sidequest).

If her actions are that of a powerful villain, wreaking havoc everywhere on the Named, then the time would be ripe for a heroic sacrifice by the Saint and/or Grey Pilgrim to stop her, and then a newly empowered hero would finish her off.

But if she is a reasonable figure, prompting the ending of bloodshed every time there's a chance, suing for peace etc. then the heroes will become villanous, ganging up on the peace loving Queen. Cat is fae right now, so it's possible that she might be able to play both sides of the coin (which may be why the heavens got pissed at her and sent a crusade).
