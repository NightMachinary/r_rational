Hmm, I was under impression that Levantine army was already folded into Crusader army. Otherwise I can't see, how Procer could put together 100k troops on their own. Even medieval England and France rarely fielded more than 20k troops.

How can Cat sure for peace? She is villain. Procer is rigorously "Good" nation and part of coalition. I dont think there is a way to make peace without something drastic deeds from her side. If she does not destroy their armies, what prevents Procer to just pull back, replentish troops and be back next year?
