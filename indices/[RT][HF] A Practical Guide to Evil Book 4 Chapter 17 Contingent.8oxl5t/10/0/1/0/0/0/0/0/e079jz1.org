Re-read this bit here, it'll be a bit clearer why Cat is acting the way she is.

Also this, on the next chapter

  “We can't slaughter fifty thousand Procerans,” I flatly said. “Aside from the brutal bounding our manpower would take in achieving that, it'd be impossible to make peace with Hasenbach afterwards.”

  “Hasenbach's invading us,” the Hellhound retorted. “The high horse stops being that when you ride it to war. If she doesn't want dead soldiers, she has no business sending them to the field.”

  I knew that in speaking that she spoke as an orc. She had the bone-deep conviction that no one with a sword in hand had the right of complaining about death. And there was a lot about that way of looking at the world that appealed to me even now. But that was a seductive simplicity that'd become the kind of luxury I could no longer afford. If I offed half a hundred thousand Procerans, the Principate would be fighting this to the bitter end. The First Prince might very well get deposed if she suggested otherwise. I had to defeat the crusaders, force them out of Callow, but it couldn't be a massacre. Assuming I could even deliver one of those, which was quite an assumption given the number of Named on the other side.
