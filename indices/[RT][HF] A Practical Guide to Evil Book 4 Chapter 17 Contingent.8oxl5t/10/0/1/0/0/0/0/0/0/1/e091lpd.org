You're missing two points here.

Cat doesn't think she can actually massacre an entire army of disposables without the *twelve* heroes that are with them getting significant narrative advantage, likely ending the story with Cat dead and Callow folded into Procer (for another 100 years at least). This is precisely why she was adamantly against Hellhound's "bonfire" plan, as it would have similar results.

Second is that even if she managed to massacre the army and the heroes and everyone with them, she is at a significant disadvantage politically.

1. Once again, a massacre on that scale is a huge ass target on her back for the heavens. Heroes will starts popping up everywhere, causing costly local rebellions and forcing cat to kill more of "her" people. Not what she wants.

2. Once Procer is no longer a credible threat, Malicia gets a /lot/ more leeway. The reason she isn't helping or hurting Cat now is the same thing, she wants Procer and Cat to eat each other. Cat wants the same of both her enemies i.e. Procer and the Empress. Which is why if she massacres the Procerans (only with quite a lot of losses on her side since she's outnumbered in Named and regulars) she would be playing right into the hands of the Empress.

3. There are still some wild cards that are in play, biggest of which are the tyrant and hierarch. Cat honestly doesn't know what the hell he wants. Same with Black. You have to realise she's /surrounded/ by potential enemies, all of whom are perfectly willing to eat her up if she shows weakness. And losing a significant part of her army taking down an enemy to /both/ of them, well she would become a tempting target.
