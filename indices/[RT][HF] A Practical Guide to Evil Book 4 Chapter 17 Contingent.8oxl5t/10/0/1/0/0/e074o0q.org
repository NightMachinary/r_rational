Your very first paragraph is what does not make sense to me in the setting. How exactly suffering heavy loses or even crippling blow would make Procer more unwilling to consider peace?

They are quite politically fragmented and they are only able to wage Crusade because First Prince united nobles with military strength. Collapse (or wipe) of the Procean armed forces in Callow would weaken First Princes position and could lead to another civil war in Procer. It has been also shown several times, that Procer can't wage protracted war and can't afford heavy loses.

So the strategic decision to limit their loses does not seem sound to me. How does that make Procer more likely to negotiate peace?
