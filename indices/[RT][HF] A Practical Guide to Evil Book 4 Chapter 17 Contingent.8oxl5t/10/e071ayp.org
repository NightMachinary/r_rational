I really dislike Cat in this last book. In previous books she has shown willingness and ruthlessness to do whatever necessary to overcome her enemies, but now facing overwhelming enemy force, she just balks and acts with kids gloves? She acts like hero would act, but she is not hero, she is villain.

What is her end game? Does she somehow plan to force Procer to truce? They repeatedly shown, that they will not leave villain on the throne. Even if she convinces Malanza to retreat, I seriously doubt heroes will as well.
