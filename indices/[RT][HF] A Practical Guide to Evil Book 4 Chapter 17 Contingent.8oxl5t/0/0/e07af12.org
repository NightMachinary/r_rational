This - Cat isn't playing by their rules. She's looking more so at the meta level (ie. narrative, plot, literary flow) in order to act. She saw that the heroes were starting to have narrative weight behind their actions and swiftly moved to cut it off.

In truth, I doubt that Pilgrim even understands that he's part of a story - he certainly doesn't act like it. This meta-level (near fourth-wall breaking) knowledge puts Cat 5 steps in front of the competition in terms of tactics and success.

I'd say that Black has a pretty good choice in successors if Cat is able to maintain this lead.
