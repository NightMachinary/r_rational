You bring good points. I guess I just can't imagine anything more serious than Holy Crusade of several nations against her with dozen of heroes. I don't really see how it could escalate from there. That's why I don't like her holding back on anything. She already has huge target for heavens on her back and heroes are already poping everywhere.
