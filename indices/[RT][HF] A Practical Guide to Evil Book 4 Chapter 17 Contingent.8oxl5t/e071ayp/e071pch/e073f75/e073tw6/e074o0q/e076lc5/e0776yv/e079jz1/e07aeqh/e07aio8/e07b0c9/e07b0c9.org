No, unless I missed something, its all of their army. I will check the prologues again when I'm home from work. I think in prologue First Prince mentioned that they will leave 20k troops at Free Cities borders and some troops at borders with Chain of Hunger and Dead King, but thats it.

Also First Prince mentioned that there is too many fantassins as leftover of civil wars in Procer so they sent most of them.
