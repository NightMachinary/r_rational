I understand why she is acting that way and I remember this part. It also does not make sense to me. If she cripple their armies, what are they going to fight to bitter end with? They would have to raise more levies, basically crippling their economy.

Procer can't afford to fight protracted war. First Prince herself said in one of the preludes that they have to finish in two years. They have Chain of Hunger, Dead King and Free Cities to be vary of.

How forcing Proceans out of the Callow without destroying their army is aligned with possibility of peace? What prevents them from coming next year again?
