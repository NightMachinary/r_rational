thats covered in earlier chapters; shes explained why she doesn't want to kill them all, even using conventional means. If she kills everyone then prince whats-her-name is put in too precarious of a position (in internal proceran politics) to engage in diplomacy with villain-led callow.

If instead a retreat comes about because the invading army decides it can no longer commit to the campaign (as has already happened) it puts Cat in a position to diplomatically treat with procer to not only resolve this conflict, but at the same time use procer as leverage against the Tower

She's making tactical concessions in favour of strategic goals.
