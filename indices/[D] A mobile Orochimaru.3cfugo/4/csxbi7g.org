Why should he have to choose? As owner of Sound village Orochimaru can have various strong-ish not-obviously affiliated shinobi wander round the world offering trades of knowledge to the various clans. He's Orochimaru so he'd likely be creepy as all hell about it, sneaking in to malcontent's bedrooms at night to make offers perhaps. Presumably in the time between his exile and canon start he's done a fair bit of this, It's what I'd do if I was a sociopath who sought knowledge more than I valued my subordinates in such a world.

The wonders of delegation.
