As said elsewhere, Orochimaru specifically wanted immortality, on top of his desire to Know All Jutsu. Presumably he's already looked into most existing lore and found dead ends. Given that he's encountered no existing immortal humans, it's likely he'll need to invent it. Hence laboratories.

Furthermore, he has ambitions of empire-building. Starting many separate laboratories in addition to your own village seems like a good way to go.

Thus, his base plan seems reasonable. (Expecting Sasuke to roll over and die, though, that was a little silly.)
