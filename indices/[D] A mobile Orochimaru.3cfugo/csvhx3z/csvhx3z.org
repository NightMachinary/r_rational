there are two more shortcomings for jutsu trading:

- While it will empower you it will empower others, and as power is relative doing so basically keeps you on the same spot.. for the protags that didn't matter much because they reset, but for oro it does

- orochimaru might not have been looking for generic jutsu so much as specific jutsu abilities, things which he just wasnt going to get from others(who is going to trade better imortality jutsus with you exactly?)
