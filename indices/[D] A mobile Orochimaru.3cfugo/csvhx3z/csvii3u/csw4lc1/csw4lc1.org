  Let's say Orochimaru trades one technique with each of a dozen clans. Each clan gains one new technique--but Orochimaru gains twelve. Also, the clans won't trade the techniques with each other--so maybe Orochimaru can pull a fast one and trade the same technique to all twelve before they figure out he's tricked them. The point is that Orochimaru gains more power than any individual clan does.

But that's not how it will work, the other clans are not retarded, the only reason they accepted the protag's offer was because it was disproportionate.. why do you think the clans will not trade with each other? i mean sure, they won't trade with their direct compatitors, but no reason to assume they arent trading jutsus all the time. you just don't see it because the jutsu market rarely gets disturbed by someone willing to give so much more power then they receive.. these are all market dynamics, if you go selling 2 jutsus for 1 it is like someone suddenly going on the stock exchange and selling huge amounts of stock very cheaply, in the end the market will normalize, and you absolutely cannot be sure you will on the winning side..

  Even so, maybe he's heard rumors of clans with particularly-useful teachable techniques--just as he recruited Kimimaro and Juugo because he heard rumors of their particularly-useful bloodline techniques.

well, but thats just the thing, when he could get a useful ability from others he did so, you just gave such examples.. the rest of his research doesn't seem so much related to jutsus of other clans, mostly to the abilities that madara, the first\second etc. developed, mostly fobidden ones..
