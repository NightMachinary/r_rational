Let's say Orochimaru trades one technique with each of a dozen clans. Each clan gains one new technique--but Orochimaru gains twelve. Also, the clans won't trade the techniques with /each other/--so maybe Orochimaru can pull a fast one and trade the same technique to all twelve before they figure out he's tricked them. The point is that Orochimaru gains more power than any individual clan does.

Even so, maybe he's heard rumors of clans with particularly-useful teachable techniques--just as he recruited Kimimaro and Juugo because he heard rumors of their particularly-useful bloodline techniques.
