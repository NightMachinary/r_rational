A few points against what they pulled in Time Braid applying to Orochimaru:

1. Getting killed matters a lot more when you are not coming back. Small risks, taken often enough, are really bad - they just have to get lucky once, while you have to get lucky a thousand times.

2. People already know Orochimaru and don't trust him, making his success rate of diplomacy likely much worse. If a couple genin missing nin who's worst act is deserting Konoha show up they probably elicit a different reaction from the Snake Sannin who experimented on humans and did a lot of other nasty shit.

3. Trading for techniques may empower people in a way that turns out to be bad in unobvious ways. This doesn't matter if you're gonna reset a time loop and keep their knowledge while removing everything they've gained from you. You could end up making really bad trades this way - if you If you trade someone the Impure World Resurrection technique in a time loop, it doesn't matter what they do with it because if it's bad enough you go back and redo. Outside of looping, if you trade that technique to someone and they happen to have the corpse of the Sage of Six Paths in their possession and you didn't know about it, ya dun goofed and you just made someone into a new world power - you just accidentally the whole setting. If there's some unexpected synergy, some sort of expert at using synergistic techniques, or whatever, you can EASILY create S-rank competition for yourself.
