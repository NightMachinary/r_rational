The [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Four_Symbols_Seal][Tetragram]] and [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Reverse_Four_Symbols_Sealing][Reverse Tetragram]] are different seals. It's not definite, either, that Reverse Tetragram is Uzumaki-specific, especially since Reverse Tetragram was used by Danzou. In any event, Orochimaru was knowledgeable enough to manipulate Naruto's Tetragram in the Forest of Death, so I don't think it too outlandish that he knows the entire technique (and he /does/ know it in an anime filler).
