  1. Getting killed matters a lot more when you are not coming back.

He can use his Cursed Seals as Horcruxes, so he may not care as much.

  2. People already know Orochimaru and don't trust him.

I always thought that, before his defection, Orochimaru's global reputation wasn't significantly worse than that of the Sannin in general, even if he was feared in Konoha itself for general creepiness. Certainly, he might be suspected of being a long-term Konoha spy, out to steal everyone else's techniques before returning to Leaf--but would Hiruzen be willing to publicize the fact that he'd failed to stop his favorite student from experimenting on his own civilians? And would unaffiliated clans even take such information as anything but propaganda from the big Villages against the independent clans and "missing"-nin?

  3. If you trade someone the Impure World Resurrection technique in a time loop...

Well, [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Special:BrowseData/Jutsu?Jutsu_rank=S][there do exist S-rank techniques less world-shattering than Edo Tensei]]--even Kakashi's Raikiri and Danzou's Reverse Tetragram Seal are listed as S-rank, and I'm sure Orochimaru would know many more such relatively-innocuous S-rank techniques. In any event, if worse comes to worst, he's already immortal with Fushi Tensei when he defects--he can always just flee off an edge of the map and wait for a few decades (if he doesn't go crazy with Sharingan-lust).
