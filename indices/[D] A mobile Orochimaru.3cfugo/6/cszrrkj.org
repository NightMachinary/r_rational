a village trading jutsu is absolutely unthinkable, especially S-ranked

a village leader should be well aware that this deal is being offered to everyone, which means he has no idea where any jutsu he gives out will end up. considering that shady arms dealer is shady, the odds are good that it will end up in the hands of someone crazy enough to use it in stupid ways.

in addition, knowing how a jutsu works often exposes flaws and limitations in it- exposing even lesser-ranked utility jutsu carries the risk that enemy agents will render it useless

considering that jutsu is basically information and can be traded endlessly, there's no guarantee that the won't end up with not just one enemy village knowing it, but /all/ enemy villages knowing it- suppose we have 5 competing village, they all take the deal, village X gives one, takes two, the rest take X's in addition to another, and give one of theirs. X has potential advantage on two villages, while three have potential advantage on X.

note that each village takes the same risk, but the point is they have no control over it- there's no telling who'd be the odd man out, or even if there'd be an odd man out. it's a complete and total gamble with lives on the line.
