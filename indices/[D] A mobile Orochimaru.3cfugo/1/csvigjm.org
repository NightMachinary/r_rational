I think you need to remember a key difference between Orochimaru's research and Sakura's - he was looking specifically for ways to achieve immortality, while Sakura was content with just finding anything that made her stronger (and to whom immortality techniques weren't as big a deal, since she had the time loops anyway).

That meant that Sakura didn't have a time constraint and no matter what the village had to offer she'd be gaining something, so she could afford to wander around.

Orochimaru's research on the other hand had to be uniquely focused, and largely relied on his own experiments opposed to stuff people already knew.
