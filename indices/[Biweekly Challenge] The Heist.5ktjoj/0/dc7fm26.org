It's a solo heist in a D&D-inspired fantasy world.

I'm not terribly happy with this one. I think it could be written in half as many words, maybe fewer. However, since it's already taken far too long I'm just going to submit it as is.

It was also written over the duration of the challenge so far (i.e. 11 days), so the beginning may be wildly different in character to the ending. I may go back and edit it, but in all honesty I don't know if the story is worth it. The setting, on the other hand, I may toy around with.
