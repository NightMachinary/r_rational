How would you go about designing a science fiction setting that wants to make at least some attempts in the direction of scientific plausibility? My problem here is that science has this awful tendency to keep advancing and spin off in weird directions so that any setting will probably look really weird after just five or ten years.

This isn't an issue for one-and-done stories, but if I like a setting enough to write it in then I'm probably going to like it enough to want to visit it on multiple occasions and I'd prefer to not create a setting that looks fine at first but ages badly and gradually transitions into soft science fiction over the course of its lifetime.

There are a few possibilities that occur to me:

- Get over it. This isn't as much of a problem as I think it is, and most readers don't actually care as much as I do.
- Set the story after some sort of technological collapse (either full or partial) and insert schizo tech on the justification that there are lots of neat gizmos that people know how to replicate (at least in some cases) but don't know to improve on. Probably easiest to do if, for example, there are machines that take care of production and nobody knows how the machines work.
- Use a science fiction setting with no humans at all, and therefore an entirely different history of scientific advancement. It's plausible that another civilization could miss some of the advances that we've made (and maybe make some that we've missed), or at least it's plausible enough to shut up the critic in my head.
- Since the setting will eventually become alternate history /anyway/, make it an alternate history from the beginning. In that case, I just have to figure out what the most interesting point of divergence would be. I'm tempted to go for something in the early 20th Century, but I'm not sure.
