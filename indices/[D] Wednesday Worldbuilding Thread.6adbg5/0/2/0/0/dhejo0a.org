Simply that post-collapse society would be (IMO) highly unlikely to resemble the ~2010s more than e.g. the ~1900s; I think there's a common misconception about the resilience of modern technology and social norms.

Obviously modern society is equal to the task of keeping it all working, but that relies on global coordination and infrastructure. A generation after collapse there would be no batteries, few modern weapons, massive problems with famine and plagues (rurals areas may be ok, but avoid cities!), etc.
