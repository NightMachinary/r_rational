(partially joking, partially serious answer)

/Go big or go home. Fourth option, divergence point: Big Bang./

The quantum fluctuation that led to the birth of our universe was subtly different, leading to laws of physics that are different from those of our home universe. These laws of physics are similar enough to our universe that it's still possible for life to evolve (and maybe even look similar to us), but higher-level technology functions based on completely different principles.

- Advantages: You maintain the hard sci-fi atmosphere, but no one can accuse you of scientific implausibility, and you can pick the laws of physics to be whatever you find interesting and/or convenient.
- Disadvantages: The amount of effort required for consistency and plausibility might make it more trouble than it's worth; it's also not going to suit those people who insist that their sci-fi stories be possible in /our/ universe. (Then again, those people are pretty much doomed to be disappointed with any sort of science fiction, so...)
