Personally I find post-collapse and non-human-society stories tend to be... implausible, as there are too many arbitrary coincidences required to let readers identify with, well, anything in the story.

Plan "just get over it" is inevitable, even if you go for alternative history. "Alternative future" is a fun genre though - posit some technological-but-not-social divergence point within the last ~decade or so, and roll it forward to asteroid mining for 3D printers (if the hype was justified...). The trick is to own it up front, and explicitly note that it's "the Future^{tm} as of YYYY, if X".
