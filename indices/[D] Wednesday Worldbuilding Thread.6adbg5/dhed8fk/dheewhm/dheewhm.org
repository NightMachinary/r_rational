I think that alternate history of technology is a sorely underdeveloped topic in the alternate history field. For example, it occurred to me a few months ago that it would have been /completely plausible/ for the telegram to be invented around ~1800, and this would have completely changed technological development. In fact, someone actually /did/ invent the telegram at that point, it was just extremely inefficient because he was trying to use a different wire for each symbol - the thing that was missing was Morse Code, the idea that you could encode all desired symbols as different patterns of signal on a single wire.
