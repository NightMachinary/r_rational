Okay, so this is where things start getting complicated. First of all, note that for higher values of N (say, exceeding 50% of the population), the Death Noters are likely to become normal themselves fairly quickly. So in order to not have our scenario quickly reduce to a society of normal people, we have to postulate a fairly low N.

The question then becomes one of how Death Noters interact with "normals". A key thing to consider here is the fact that normals /cannot be killed via Death Note powers/. This means that a functional government is now possible, and is likely to be composed predominantly of normals. (The upper echelons will probably consists exclusively of normals, since having a Death Noter in a position of visible power is simply far too risky.) This then leads us to ask the obvious next question: /how large must a government (including enforcers) be in this situation to be effective?/ An answer to this question will give us a minimum feasible value for N.

I'll be needing to head out shortly, so I'll leave the analysis here for now. Anyone else is welcome to add to what I said.
