Nitpick: this part should probably be changed so that the item gets sent to the specialists instead in order to minimize the chance that someone meets someone else.

Anyway, nitpicks aside, the main problem you still have (other than technological failure) is that any open communications channel can be exploited to transmit arbitrary types of information. Sufficiently determined people could, for instance, post a series of fix-requests for items whose first letters, when read in sequence, form a word or phrase. Randomization might suffice to address this particular issue, but people could also simply intentionally hide messages inside broken items that can be seen only when opening them to fix them up. All it takes is one or two people who are willing to cooperate to get themselves out of the hellhole they're in, and we suddenly have ourselves a conspiracy on our hands--one that we have no way of stopping almost by definition, since there's no centralized government to stop it /with/.
