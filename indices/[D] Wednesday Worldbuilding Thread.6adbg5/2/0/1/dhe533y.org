  Really, I doubt there's a feasible way to go about constructing a society with insta-kill powers unless the agents populating that society have a completely different psychology from humans; the incentive structure inherent in the scenario you specify makes the whole thing unstable

Hmm. Wouldn't the following work?

All people are hiding in private residences scattered across the globe. Travel out of them is not permitted. Communication is conducted through anonymous boards. Every residence is connected to a railway through which regularly-arriving automated trains provide it with live necessities. Some residences have mostly-automated factories or farms, which produce shipments for the trains, and power plants which provide the whole system with energy.

If something breaks, you post a request to fix it online, and a script tells specialists about it without specifying which residence posted it; they arrive on the next few trains and fix it. Failure to fulfill one's duty is punished by decreasing the flow of goods into the residence, or by revealing that one's personal information online.

Reproduction... by perhaps artificial insemination --- we're trusting mothers to not kill their children already --- with strict birth control, so that there's never more adult humans than functional residences.
