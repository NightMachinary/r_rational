Well, yes, it is easy in principle. The hard part is (as always) in practice. So something like this

#+begin_quote
  just make people's minds such that everyone universally possesses certain qualities that you would like. For instance everybody invariably ending up with a moral system similar to your own, and nobody ever developing mental illnesses.

  So nobody will ever want to use the death note except in scenarios you would consider acceptable, and nobody is ever deluded such that they believe it is acceptable to use the death note when it's not.
#+end_quote

is not good enough. For one thing, you still haven't specified what your moral system /is/. And you can't skirt the issue by saying "everyone's a mind-clone of me", either, because that's not possible without engineering knowledge /considerably/ beyond our current capabilities. There's also the fact that you're specifying a /psychology/ here, not a set of hardcoded rules--and psychological tendencies can change over time due to a whole host of potential influences. You're allowed to postulate outlandish things like minds with hivemind-esque levels of empathy, but saying "everyone has my morals forever" just doesn't cut it, unfortunately.
