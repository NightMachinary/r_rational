I mean this should be /really/ easy, just make people's minds such that everyone universally possesses certain qualities that you would like. For instance everybody invariably ending up with a moral system similar to your own, and nobody ever developing mental illnesses.\\
So nobody will ever want to use the death note except in scenarios you would consider acceptable, and nobody is ever deluded such that they believe it is acceptable to use the death note when it's not.\\
This is basically the equivalent of giving a GAI your ethical system instead of trying to place restrictions on its actions in hopes of preventing it from doing things you don't want.
