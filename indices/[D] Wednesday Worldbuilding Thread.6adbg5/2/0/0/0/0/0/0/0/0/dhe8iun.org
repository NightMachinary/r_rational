...I confess, this is a novel solution that I did not anticipate beforehand. But I think the most likely result is that you'll end up with people torturing other people in order to get /them/ to use their Death Note powers. At the very least, the situation isn't as inherently unstable as it would be with actual humans, but still, I imagine things would get ugly quite quickly, and it's questionable whether such an arrangement would ever manage to even invent the scientific method, much less elevate itself to a higher technological level.
