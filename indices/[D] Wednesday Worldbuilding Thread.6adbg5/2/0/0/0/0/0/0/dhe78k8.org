Let's try something else, then. Suppose that instead of being forced to populate your society with /humans/, you also get to design a new type of mind with which to fill that society.

1. Easy mode: You get to design both the society itself and the type of mind that will populate it. Can you create a societal arrangement that is stable in the long term? (Again, with [[/u/Noumero]]'s caveat that the technology level of the society in question cannot exceed our own.)
2. Hard mode: You get to design the mind, but not the societal arrangement. The Death Noters start in the Stone Age with whatever psychology you specify. Can you specify a psychology such that a species of Death Noters with that psychology will eventually grow into a large-scale technological civilization?

*EDIT:* I will also impose the additional restriction that whatever mind design you come up with must have comparable intelligence to humans. This is for the same reason as [[/u/Noumero]]'s caveat: no FAI-style solutions.
