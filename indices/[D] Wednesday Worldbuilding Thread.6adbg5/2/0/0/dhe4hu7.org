Well, let's turn it around. If there is zero privacy, you /could/ kill anyone, but it would be known that you did it, and you'd probably die soon after. Do you hate someone so much that you'd be willing to die to kill them?

Terrorists and the insane could do a lot of damage though... so the perfect society would have to produce few or none of those.
