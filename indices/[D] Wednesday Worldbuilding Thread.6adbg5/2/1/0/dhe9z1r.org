I'm pretty sure it ends with virtually every group dying within a few years.

In general, humans are emotional, short-sighted and selfish. Sooner or later someone in any group will have a bad day, find someone to blame for this, and get the entire group killed; the larger the group, the sooner it happens. And making groups smaller would run into the same conspiracy problem as discussed above.
