In theory? Yes, a large society /could/ arise in the face of this power, but it would be a good deal less likely. (The odds of a large society arising become substantially better if it's possible to tell the identity of the person who instantly killed someone). I'm not really sure how this is particularly different to giving everyone in a given society a sniper rifle, except that this ability is easier and quicker to use and has no range limit.
