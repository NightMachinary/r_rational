For a story like this, I would have the powers be determined by the nature of the folklore in the respective nations. So the president of America gets something relating to Native American folklore or relating to the holidays like Thanksgiving. Also the power is the same for all presidents.

This way, a country can be determined to exist or to have disappeared based on whether or not a sufficiently unique culture with an accompanying position of power currently exists.

Tie the existence of the power to the culture, not the governmental position. The position only determines who gets the power.
