  Transfers of power. Peaceful transfers of power are pretty clear - the old leader loses their power when they leave the office, and the new leader gains a new power when they're sworn in. But what if there's an actual dispute, or if an elected leader launches a self-coup to stay in power, and tries to stonewall impeachment attempts? What happens if we wind up with multiple people running around claiming to have the same position simultaneously? Will the Thing-Granting-Powers settle the dispute itself by choosing one of them to give powers to? At what point does it recognize one side of a civil war as having succeeded well enough to count as a distinct country with a distinct leader? At what point does it recognize a country as having been conquered thoroughly enough to strip its leader of powers?

What about the powers and their level being dependant on how much people in particular country actually considers empowered individual a leader?
