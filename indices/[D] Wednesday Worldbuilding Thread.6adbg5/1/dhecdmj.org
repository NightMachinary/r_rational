Let's look at a scenario that involves a sudden empowerment event that respects previously-artificial natural borders.

Suddenly, superpowers are introduced to the world, and exactly one person in each country gets those superpowers - the leader of that country. For example, in the United States, the superpowered individual would obviously be the President. This introduces some major questions, obviously. Here are some of the biggest that occur to me.

- In some countries, there would be legitimate question as to who gets superpowers. Does the President of Germany get powers, or the Chancellor? My assumption is that the Prime Minister gets the UK's powers, but if the monarch got them instead, that fact alone would cause major changes to British politics because it would change how people mentally frame things.
- What happens if the Thing-Granting-Powers' world map is distinct from the internationally-recognized one in some way? (A bit of this is inevitable, since the internationally-recognized powers themselves don't even agree on the nation list.) Say, it fucks absolutely everyone over by giving powers to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, recognizing ISIS as a sovereign nation.
- Transfers of power. Peaceful transfers of power are pretty clear - the old leader loses their power when they leave the office, and the new leader gains a new power when they're sworn in. But what if there's an actual dispute, or if an elected leader launches a self-coup to stay in power, and tries to stonewall impeachment attempts? What happens if we wind up with multiple people running around claiming to have the same position simultaneously? Will the Thing-Granting-Powers settle the dispute itself by choosing one of them to give powers to? At what point does it recognize one side of a civil war as having succeeded well enough to count as a distinct country with a distinct leader? At what point does it recognize a country as having been conquered thoroughly enough to strip its leader of powers?
- Of course, the actual strengths of the powers have a huge effect on the world. The stronger the powers are in general, the more they'll really matter beyond giving supernatural legitimacy to nations. If some world leaders can face down armies of normals, persuade anyone to do anything, or have some strong "Thinker" power, that's a game-changer. The less of a correlation there is between the preexisting strength of a nation and the strength of that nation's leader-power, the more the empowerment will serve to equalize tiny, irrelevant countries with the old dominant nations. Tuvalu has about 1 leader for every 10,000 people, while India only has 1 leader for every 1.3 billion people! It would hurt nations more the larger they are, because they have more to defend and only one superpowered person to do it. I'd say the most interesting thing for balance would be to have a correlation between preexisting nation strength and power strength, but not a 1:1 correlation - so sometimes the Thing-Granting-Powers will shake things up by giving a critical nation an unimpressive power, or an obscure nation a game-changing power.
- The way some powers seem innately aligned with "good" or "evil", and how that effects their wielders' image, is a common theme in superhero stories. In this specific scenario, how would that effect things? How bad is it for a country if its leader happens to have a power that's fueled by death, or controls people, or is obviously useless outside of a fight to the death? How good is it for a country if its leader happens to have a healing power, or one that can be used for humanitarian purposes, or one with a light motif? How would powers be spun differently by their nations' supporters and enemies?
- How does the "meta" for nations work going forward? Secession attempts will be taken a lot more seriously, but some smarter nations may split up and decentralize, figuring that they'll be stronger as a group of small allies with a lot of powers than as one oversized nation with a single power. The Thing-Granting-Powers may call bullshit on this, responding to overly close alliances formed in this way by only giving the dominant nation a power. If the United States wanted fifty powers, for example, they'd need to actually balkanize; they couldn't just issue a statement saying "oh BTW the federal government is just an international body now (but still has all the same authority it did before)". It /is/ possible to munchkin this scenario, I think - just not by "fooling" the Thing-Granting-Powers. You can't fool it. It knows better.
