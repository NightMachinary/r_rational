Regarding secession, since you like themes:

Any individual power can be thought of as having multiple components. For example, a power as simple as "shooting laser beams at people" can be divided into "lasers/light" and "energy beams."

If a country successfully secedes (whatever "successfully" means in this case) then the theme for that counter's leadership will develop from unused components in the power of the other country's leader. For example, if somebody seceded from the United States and the President at the time had "shoot laser beams" as a power, with "laser/light" being the running theme (and other Presidents having had powers like "bend light to become invisible"), then the leader of the seceding country would have powers that draw on the theme of "energy beams" (with "energy" interpreted very liberally, for the most interesting results).
