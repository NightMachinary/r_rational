Let's expand on what [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ldb9z/how_would_a_society_deal_with_an_easily_teachable/][this]] idea leads to.

Essentially, every human has a Death Note-lite. Any human can instantly kill any other human with a thought, if the former has enough information about the latter. ('Enough information' in information-theoretic sense, but for the sake of simplicity, let's assume that means a descriptor unique for that human: a name, a face, a username, etc; or their unique combination.)

1. If every human was granted this ability in Stone Age, could a large society or a technological civilization arise, even in theory?

2. In classical era?

3. In modern era?

4. You are tasked with designing the perfect world for these humans (population: ~1 billion). A genie would implement it. Restrictions: you can only use the already-developed technology; the ensuring civilization cannot consume more resources than /Kardashev I/; the population must be situated on Earth.

5. *Edit:* Same as 4, except at any point in time, there's N 'normal' humans alive. Normal humans cannot kill with a thought and cannot /be/ killed with a thought. If a normal human dies, a random deathnoter becomes normal, which both he/she and the other normal humans become magically aware of.

   What is the lowest N that would make a functional society possible?
