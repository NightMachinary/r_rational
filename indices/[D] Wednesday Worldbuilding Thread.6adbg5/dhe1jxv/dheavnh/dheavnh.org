New scenario: same as 4, except at any point in time, there's N 'normal' humans alive. Normal humans cannot kill with a thought and cannot /be/ killed with a thought. If a normal human dies, a random deathnoter becomes normal, which both he/she and the other normal humans become magically aware of.

What is the lowest N that would make a functional society possible?
