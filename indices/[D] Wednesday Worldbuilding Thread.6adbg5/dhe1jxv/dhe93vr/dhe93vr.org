I'm assuming that a message does not automatically identify its sender. If the set of all messages from some sender does not identify them, you can use that as a username.

Attempt at 4: Let people form groups of up to about a hundred people each. Between groups, no identification-revealing contact is permitted. Within a group, there is zero privacy. If anyone dies by Death Note, everyone in their group is killed.

You might relax the last bit by letting a judge review whether the killing was reasonable, such as a group killing a member that tried to take the group hostage. The judge would become able to kill them all, but he's already supposed to decide their fate.
