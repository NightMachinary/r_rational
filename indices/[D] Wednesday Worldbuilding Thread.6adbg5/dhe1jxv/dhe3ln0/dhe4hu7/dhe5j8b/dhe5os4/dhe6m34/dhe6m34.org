I see.

I was thinking not of supertech but just a society that is safe and stable, and all children were raised in loving families and mental illness detected early and treated before the powers set in (I assume infants being hungry or toddlers throwing a tantrum does not results in mass murder, but that the power sets in later in life).

I do however have to concur with [[/u/696e6372656469626c65]] and say that no, a society of death noters would cease to be a society fairly quickly if there were no accountability.
