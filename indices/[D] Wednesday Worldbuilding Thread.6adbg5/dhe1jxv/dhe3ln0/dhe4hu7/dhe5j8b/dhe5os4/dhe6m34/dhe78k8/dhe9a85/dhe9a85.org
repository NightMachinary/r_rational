That seems way easier.

A hivemind without sense of personal identity which considers other 'individuals' a part of itself, therefore incapable of using the power of killing at all.

A more interesting one: humanlike minds with less intense emotions and fewer cognitive biases, designed to naturally develop enlightened self-interest and long-term thinking in early age; add sociopathy to the mix to make it more interesting. The ensuring society would be ridiculously cutthroat but I think functional.
