There's ways of getting around a direct engineering of value system. Just specify that that genes are changed such that people invariably end up with nearly the same moral instincts. Then define that moral instinct in terms of being one which would if replacing your current one cause you to make the exact same moral decisions you would normally make. Point is you can easily use conditionals that basically rely on a simulation of oneself.

As for the objection about not having the sufficient engineering knowledge, well that objection could apply to pretty much /any/ mind engineering including the hivemind example, since we just don't understand enough about human brains. So it's not clear in what way mind-clones are more complicated than inventing some new hivemind psychology.\\
Also I never said we need hardcoded rules, the basic idea is simply to replace the genes that usually result in people developing moral systems with genes that are far more specific and less open to environment in developing their function, to cut down variation.
