#+begin_quote
  A hivemind without sense of personal identity which considers other 'individuals' a part of itself, therefore incapable of using the power of killing at all.
#+end_quote

An actual hivemind is impossible given current technology levels, so I assume you're talking about a mind whose sense of empathy is so strong that it views other individuals as equivalent to itself despite not actually sharing their experiences and thoughts. How would such a species respond to scarcity? For example: suppose a food shortage occurs, and there's not enough food to ensure everyone lives. How would a hypothetical race of such people allocate their food supply? Distributing the food equally will simply cause everyone to die of malnutrition. (A sort of reverse [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons][tragedy of the commons]], if you will.)
