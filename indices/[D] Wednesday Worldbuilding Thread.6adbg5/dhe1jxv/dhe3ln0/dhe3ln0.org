4. Total anonymity is probably the only way to even /remotely/ guarantee the possibility of safety, but that's really really hard to do (especially since you limited us to already-existing technology). And even if you /do/ manage to implement this somehow, this makes a large-scale society nearly impossible to run, since you have no way of specifying who's who, making economic transactions impossible in principle. Truthfully, I doubt there's a feasible way to go about constructing a society with insta-kill powers unless the agents populating that society have a completely different psychology from humans. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer, but the fact is that the incentive structure present in the scenario you give makes things so unstable that I'm not sure an equilibrium state other than "everyone dies" even /exists/.

TL;DR: Giving a single person Death Note-esque powers is bad. Giving /everyone/ such powers is an extinction event.
