  Then how about which ever culture appeared first and if there's a tie, then it comes down to which one is more prevalent at the time.

Hmmmmm.

In South Africa, the /first/ would probably be the Khoisan culture. The Khoisan were more or less minding their own business down here, when one day the Bantu peoples wandered down from further north at around the same time as European explorers in ships started landing in the far South. (Then a lot of complicated stuff happened). Now the /biggest/ cultural group is the aggregate of the Bantu groups (with different but related cultures) - the most economically powerful cultures have strong European roots (but have since changed a bit, as cultures do) - and the Khoisan culture is of minimal effect to go with their minimal numbers. (There's still a few people around, but I understand the culture has been largely destroyed, mostly by being overcome by other cultures but there was a fair amount of generations-ago war in there as well).

By the whichever-appeared-first rule, President Zuma (who draws from Zulu (a subset of Bantu) culture himself) would get powers based on Khoisan culture and mythology. (How long does this last? If the last member of the Khoisan in South Africa dies, do Zuma's powers abruptly shift?)

What happens as cultures change?
