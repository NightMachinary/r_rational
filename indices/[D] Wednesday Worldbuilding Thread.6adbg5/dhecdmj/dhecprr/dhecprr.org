  What happens if the Thing-Granting-Powers' world map is distinct from the internationally-recognized one in some way?

Depending on how it views the matter of tribal sovereignty, aboriginal populations in the U.S. and possibly elsewhere might also get more influence by dint of their superpowered leaders.

Also, does a state's power stay the same from leader to leader, or can it change during the transfer of power? Personally, I like the idea that powers change but orbit the same "theme."
