  In some countries, there would be legitimate question as to who gets superpowers...
#+end_quote

Now I want to read a crackfic where Queen Elizabeth II gets 16 superpowers (from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis).

  ...the new leader gains a new power when they're sworn in.
#+end_quote

Is this one power per person, one power per person/country pair, or one power per leadership term?

If it's one per person, then it would make sense to have as many people as possible cycle through being the leader of a country, in hopes on getting something useful (like precognition) instead of something useless (like flying). Due to practical concerns, it would likely only be open to the leaders of the official opposition parties for a limited amount of time before the election (1 month each?), because they need real power to reveal their superpowers.

If the same power is maintained across country leaderships, this could even be done in other countries, similar to how some politicians start at the city level, move to the state level, then go federal.

If it's per-term, then it might make sense to elect a /set/ of people, with the one(s) with useless power(s) retiring in favor of their pre-elected successors. This could be done as simply as swapping between a President and a Vice President until the current leader gets something good enough.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand][Principality of Sealand]] would be about 4% superpowered people if it counted. This would be a /huge/ boost to the micronation movement, and perhaps enough to make a few hundred on its own.
