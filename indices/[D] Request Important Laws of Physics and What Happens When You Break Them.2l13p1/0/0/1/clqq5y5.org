Very basically, conservation laws happen because of symmetries.

Conservation of momentum is due to the fact that the physical laws of a system are independent of location for example. So if youre in a system without conservation of momentum this necessarily means that the physical laws vary with respect to space. So it might be easier to accelerate in certain places or directions for example, depending on how exactly momentum is not conserved.

[EDIT] I should also mention that no privelidged reference frames is strongly related to these symmetries. A reference frame is simply the coordinates that our laws are written in, and the symmetries specify limits on the types of reference frames that are equivalent to each other. I.e. in special relativity, only non-accelerating (relative to each other) frames are OK. In general rel, accelerating frames /are/ OK. Breaking symmetry limits the types of reference frames which are OK, if you break rotational symmetry, all frames must align with the great celestial pole or something like that.
