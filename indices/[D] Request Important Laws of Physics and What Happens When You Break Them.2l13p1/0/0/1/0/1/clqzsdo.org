  If there's a nonuniform curvature of space in absence of matter would that violate conservation of momentum?
#+end_quote

It would not in itself be a violation, but it can cause a violation. It would also allow the breaking of conservation of energy and conservation of angular momentum. Just to be extremely blunt, all three of those classical conservation laws don't hold in general relativity.

Instead, they are replaced with the assertion that the divergence of the Stress-Energy Tensor is zero, along with the assertion that the Stress--energy--momentum pseudotensor, in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy%E2%80%93momentum_pseudotensor#Landau.E2.80.93Lifshitz_pseudotensor][words of this article]], "allows the total of matter plus the gravitating energy--momentum to form a conserved current within the framework of general relativity".

This means you can assign an (negative) energy and momentum to the gravitational field. Note that gravitational waves and local wells formed by objects are not fields themselves, rather they are depressions in the gravitational field that permeates the entire universe. When you do this, a loss of ordinary energy translates to a loss of negative energy (an increase in positive energy) from the gravitational field, and vice versa. This is mostly a semantic description. [[http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/][Some physicists]] feel the whole idea of these conservation laws should be abandoned, as we're no longer talking about energy by the ordinary definition.

The typical example that's used is the phenomena of redshift. As photons from a source have moved to new locations of greater inflated space time, their wavelengths have increased, and with that, their energy decreases. Where did this energy go? For all practical purposes, it disappeared. Some physicists argue that it became gravitational energy. Whether this is a useful distinction to make is up for debate. This is explored in more detail [[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html][here]]. If you want to ignore all that, you could just say [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/5/d/f5dfdbbc1337dfe4578e0d322bfd9b5c.png][this]], and not worry about translating mathematics to English.
