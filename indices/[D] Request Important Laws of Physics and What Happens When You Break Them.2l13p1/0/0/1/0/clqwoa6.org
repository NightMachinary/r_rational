It would help if I understood precisely what it means for the laws of physics to vary based on location or not. If an object is in one location but not another, that location would behave differently, but surely that doesn't count as the laws of physics being different in those two locations. If there's a nonuniform curvature of space in absence of matter would that violate conservation of momentum?
