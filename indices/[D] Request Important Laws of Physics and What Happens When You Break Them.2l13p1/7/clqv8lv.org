  High Kolmogorov Complexity Laws of Physics
#+end_quote

I am struggling to imagine this.

Math was built by humans to describe order and structure. We are able to conceptualize math because our brains evolved to identify order and structure and patterns, and draw conclusions from these identifications. The math we use, with our axioms etc, is an abstraction of this process.

It's important to note here that the whole "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences" is absolute hooey. [[http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Derek_Abbott/publication/256838918_The_Reasonable_Ineffectiveness_of_Mathematics/links/00b7d523d5bd289428000000][There are lots of good arguments against the idea]], basically hinging on the above-alluded fact that math didn't evolve independently of the universe, and other universes -- or even other evolutionary paths within our same universe -- would lead to totally different mathematical axioms.

If we were to try to use our mathematics, which we developed in this universe, to model the laws of another universe with alien laws of physics, then yeah, our models would probably have quite high Kolmogorov complexity. But if there were lifeforms that evolved in that other universe, with their own alien brains and models and mathematical axioms, then if they were to model the laws of their universe with their mathematics, they would certainly get formulas and equations with low Kolmogorov complexity (whether they define it the same way or not).

*TLDR*: I think Kolmogorov complexity (and all other Occam's razor esque formalizations) the map, not the territory. There is no universe with high Kolmogorov complexity laws of physics.

Someone tell me if I'm fundamentally misunderstanding something, but otherwise I can't imagine a violation of type 6.
