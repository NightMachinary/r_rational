Depends on whether or not the god-agent is self-modifying or not. It's probably unwise to casually modify the rules on which your own cognition runs, but a superintelligence given that power could probably devise a series of changes to optimize its thinking processes, or even a menu of changes it can implement at will to selectively optimize for different tasks.

Even if that wasn't the case, though, the universe probably won't look naturalistic to the people inside it, so it's not good metaphysics to assume if you're trying to tell a rationalist story.
