  it occurs to me that one possible example of a universe with high Kolmogorov complexity laws of physics would be a universe that runs on the mind of some agent, who can intervene arbitrarily at will

But then, aren't the "real" laws of physics the laws governing the "neurons" in that agent's brain? It may never be possible for humans to study those laws, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.
