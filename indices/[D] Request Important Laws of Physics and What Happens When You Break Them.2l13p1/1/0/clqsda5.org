  Infinite speed of light also means a privileged times reference. I.e. everyone anywhere moving at any speed can agree on whether two events happen at the same time or not (in theory). So Newtonian mechanics works, relativity doesn't.

If everyone agrees on the location, time, and relative time of events then how is that a privileged reference frame? I'm assuming that the light particles themselves don't have one because they only exist in the limit.

"Conservation of momentum" and "no privileged reference frames" sound similar to me. Can you elaborate on the similarity/difference? Often you use your own location as the origin of the coordinate system. Is it just "if event A happens from Bob's perspective then it must also happen from Alice's perspective"? What precisely makes a reference frame privileged?
