It's common for people to postulate breaking conservation of momentum to allow for reactionless drives. This results in breaking conservation of energy. Power = Energy / Time = Force * Distance / Time = Force * Velocity. If you could, for example, produce one newton of thrust with one watt of power, you don't create energy, so long as you're moving below one meter per second. If you move, say, two meters per second, then your kinetic energy is increasing at a rate of two watts, and you're only spending one. If you use a conventional generator to turn this energy back into power, you have a perpetual motion machine. The only way to make it work is to make it take about 300 megawatts per newton, which means you'd have to go faster than light to create energy. But you can get a drive that efficient just by using a flashlight and relying on the momentum from the light leaving, so it's completely pointless. And you've still destroyed energy.

If it's too easy to violate conservation of energy, or worse, mass, you have to explain why no life has evolved to just do that instead of absorbing energy the way life does in real life.

Discrete time and space means that the laws of physics won't be invariant under rotation. In extreme versions, you might not be able to make anything rotate. Try to make something spin in Minecraft and you'll see what I mean.

Continuous matter could cause problems with immeasurable sets. For example, it's theoretically possible to cut one solid ball into five pieces and rearrange them into two solid balls the same size as the original. But if you don't start with them and your physics don't involve the axiom of choice they can't form later on, so it's not a huge issue.

You didn't ask about it, and you might already know, but for the benefit of anyone who does not, having faster than light travel (not to be confused with infinite speed light) and no privileged reference frame allows for time travel. My favorite example of why is this: [[http://www.thebestforumever.com/community/threads/tachyon-pistol-duel-thought-experiment.47326/]]
