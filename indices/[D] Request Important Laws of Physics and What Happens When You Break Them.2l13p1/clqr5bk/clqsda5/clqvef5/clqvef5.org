  If everyone agrees on the location, time, and relative time of events then how is that a privileged reference frame? I'm assuming that the light particles themselves don't have one because they only exist in the limit.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, I think an infinite speed of light would directly result in there being a privileged reference frame because /there would only be one reference frame/. Relativity doesn't work because relativity literally doesn't exist. It would be a purely Newtonian universe.
