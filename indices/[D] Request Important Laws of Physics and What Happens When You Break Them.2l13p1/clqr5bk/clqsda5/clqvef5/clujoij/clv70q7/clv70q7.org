For some reason, I thought that part of the Newtonian framework wasn't just an absolute time, but also an absolute space from which all velocities were measured. Then I realized that, by Newton's time, we already knew the Earth went around the Sun, so that would render several equations unusable. Compartmentalization at its best; thanks for the correction.

On that note, bonus points for using the actual gamma symbol for the Lorentz factor. I usually just use y. :3
