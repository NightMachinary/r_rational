7 Infinite speed of light. This means that light cannot be a wave or a particle, it is a mathematical ray. So, none of electromagnetic theory works - no radio, relativity, QM, etc. Chemistry and electromagnetics may work, but they'd only be superficially similar, the equations would be different. Electrostatics and simple models of magnetism work without any changes.

Infinite speed of light also means a privileged times reference. I.e. everyone anywhere moving at any speed can agree on whether two events happen at the same time or not (in theory). So Newtonian mechanics works, relativity doesn't.

Basically, take the scientific discoveries up to Lord Kelvin-ish era and they might be explainable in a universe with a limitless speed of light. When you join electrics and magnetics with Maxwell's equations the speed of light pops out (because light is an electromagnetic wave). So anything built on this (and most physics since then is) cannot hold true.
