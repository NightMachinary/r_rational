Ooh, ooh, I have something slightly tangentially helpful to add!

1: Conservation of mass and conservation of energy are already a little broken by E=mc^{2}, which says mass can be destroyed and energy can be created (or vice versa). There's a solid conversion ratio between the two. But all-in-all, the amount of ... stuff in the universe does stay the same, yes, once you look at energy and matter as two states of the same stuff.

Why does this happen? Because of 2. E=mc^{2} is a softcore version of Einstein's more applicable spacetime momentum equation, which basically says that mass, energy, and 3d momentum are all shadows of one 4d vector. And since momentum -- yes, even 4d spacetime momentum -- is conserved through symmetry (as [[/u/duffmancd]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2l13p1/d_request_important_laws_of_physics_and_what/clqq5y5][explained]]) energy and mass appear to be conserved, also.

So yeah, a violation of 1 is really also a violation of 2, which is highly related to 3.
