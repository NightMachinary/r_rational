You should find it touched on in most descriptions of nuclear fusion and fission. Reference is made to E=mc2 to explain why so much energy can be generated. Yet no particles are destroyed. The total number of neutrons and protons remains unchanged, however the total mass of the nuclei (atoms) is slightly lower. This is because the nuclei have lower potential energy.

We knew about the difference in masses before we knew about the structure of the nucleus (and the existence of neutrons). Conversion of hydrogen to helium (in a 4:1 ratio) as the Sun's energy source was originally hypothesized on this basis.

I'm afraid my reference for that this month was audio :)
