Actually, E=mc^{2} doesn't violate conservation of mass or energy, it unites them. When an object gains energy it actually gains mass. So a fully charged (closed cell) battery is heavier than a flat one, a compressed spring is heavier than a relaxed one and a hot ball bearing is heavier than a cold one. The mass in all these cases is negligible because c is so large, but it /is/ there.

And so whenever you transfer energy from one thing to another you transfer mass too. It gets a bit more complicated once things start moving (energy/mass in which reference frame are we talking about) but the idea holds. As [[/u/seraphnb]] said we generally talk about conservation of P-vector.
