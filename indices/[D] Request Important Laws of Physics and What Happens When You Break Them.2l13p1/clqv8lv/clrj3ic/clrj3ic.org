Since you can't imagine a violation, it occurs to me that one possible example of a universe with high Kolmogorov complexity laws of physics would be a universe that runs on the mind of some agent, who can intervene arbitrarily at will; in other words, a universe which exists at the whim of an omnipotent god that makes changes regularly.

That adds a lot of complexity to the 'laws of physics', to the point where the term hardly applies. One might assume that the laws of physics could be mostly regular, barring specific interventions... but those interventions could be unlimited in scope, up to and including changing the laws. It's not, strictly speaking, impossible to calculate, but all the calculations would be based around divine intervention, which could only be calculated by considering the infinite information the god has available, factoring that into whatever the god's decision function winds up being, and outputting whatever arbitrary changes the god decides to make, whenever those changes occur. It would only be between those changes that you could simulate anything approaching physical laws.

For an example of this in an actual story, reference [[http://www.talesofmu.com][Tales of MU]], in which the gods that run the universe regularly but unpredictably intervene to curtail observations, among other things. The end result from the perspective of inhabitants of such a world is that science doesn't work, since the rules are demonstrably inconsistent under scrutiny, and sometimes change for unknowable reasons.
