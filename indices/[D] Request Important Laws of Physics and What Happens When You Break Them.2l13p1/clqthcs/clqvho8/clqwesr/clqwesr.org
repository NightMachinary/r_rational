Atoms bond the way they do because of how many dimensions we have. A sigma bond is essentially linear, even if the electron probability distribution is not. Then the first pi bond extends in one dimension of space, effectively making a 2d plane of electron cloud. Then the second pi bond extends into the third dimension in the same way as the first pi bond did. And it stops there, because we now lack any more dimensions for a bond to form without astronomical angle strain. If you have 4 dimensions that an electron cloud can occupy, then suddenly every atom above helium becomes a free radical, forming new bonds with anything near it, releasing astronomical amounts of energy.

I mean, is suppose if you made some theory of chemistry in 4 dimensions that happens to be exactly like our 3 dimensional chemistry and use that from the start, I guess that works, but if you want a structure to exist in 4 dimensions, then you need new chemistry, and 3 dimensional chemistry if complex enough already

(My description is somewhat simplified, but it basically conveys what is hapoening)
