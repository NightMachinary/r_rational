I like to look at the equations of force. Take the gravitational force F=kmM/r^{2} . The r^{2} is basically because the surface of a volume scales with r^{2.} If we had 4 spacial dimensions it would be an r^{3.} (Of course there are exceptions like the curled up dimensions of string theory, or the screening that occurs for the strong force)
