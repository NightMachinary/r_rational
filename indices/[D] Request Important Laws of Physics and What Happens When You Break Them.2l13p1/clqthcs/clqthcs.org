Honestly, breaking any of them makes your universe not make sense. Unless you do it absurdly well, and I mean on the level of rewriting the laws of physics from the ground up and not caring whether the final result looks like, you will have to handwave something that is a consequence of the thing you changed. The laws of the physical world are so intertwined that changing anything would result in massive differences from our real world.

Lets take gravity as an example, as it seems to be the least entangled physical constant that we have. If you change it even the slightest bit, you have no guarantee that planets form, or stars, or that stars still go supernova in the same way, or even that elements heavier than lithium can even form. Maybe if you changed it slightly enough not much would change, but then your story world probably wont be much different from the real world, and massive changes happen for even small bits that you change.

If you want to do anything less trivial than changing gravity, then you most likely alter something deeply fundamental to how our world works. I have no idea how a privileged reference frame would even work in any sense, unless the fabric of the universe was a physical thing, which barely even makes sense. Changing anything about electromagnetism will kill everyone, although it might take a little while for it to happen. Adding a fourth dimension of space probably lets atoms have orbitals in that dimension as well, meaning everything instantly violently reacts with everything, destroying every planet that isnt a gas giant. infinite speed of light at the very least means light can no longer carry information, as c=hv and one of those terms would be an infinity. The constant c is used in so many different formulas that you would probably just stop having a functional universe right there.

I could go on, but I think ive conveyed the point that at some level, you /have/ to hand wave it and say that the world works even with your inclusion, as you wont have a world to write a story in in the first place.
