Not many people here will engage you on this. The rationalist communities generally don't take kindly to anti-epistemology. I'm not exactly sure how what you've written relates to anything in the paragraph above, or how it's anti-rationalist in any way, but I suppose that might be the point?

'Primal fiction,' using what you posted as an example, has been done elsewhere. If you're looking for rarely-coherent/surrealist/dada writing that appeals deeply on emotional and instinctual levels, I recommend you look into poetry, and probably heavy metal or other music along those lines. What you wrote did engage me somewhat on those levels, but the style in which it was presented (prose, all caps), does not lend itself to being accepted, especially here.

You should read Howl, by Allen Ginsberg. I can only recommend Howl because it's the only other example of primally-engaging writing I can think of at the moment. You might want to be in a more motivational subgenre, though. Not all primal thoughts are about fucking tigers.
