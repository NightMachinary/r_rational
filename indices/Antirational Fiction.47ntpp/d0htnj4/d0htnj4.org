Your writing is pretty good.

Trouble is... For neurotypical-esque people, rational thought (even on the level of just “common-sense skepticism”) works markedly better.

Actually, the most important part of "getting shit done" seems to be being able to overcome executive dysfunction: procrastination, bad habits, etc.

So, if you want to write fiction that goes against the classical paragdime of Rational Fiction (understand rules of magic, snap universe in half over knee) you might write something about a main character who Gets Shit Done™.

Write someone who has a superhuman work ethic, incredible introspection, and lots of “skillpower”^{1}. Such a person could, with relatively little epistemological prowess get a lot of shit done, though, say, politics.

So... In essence... Write (the musical depiction of) Alexander Hamilton.
