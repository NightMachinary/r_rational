For this thread, presenting a hard-won heart's treasure would defeat the point of it being an invitation for people to post their own take on antirational fiction, rather than about converting them to mine. That some people are treating it as that, or as a philosophical assault rather than a chill game, isn't my fault. So I do think that was the right way in this case. Beyond that, that's just the heuristic I used. And it intentionally delegates compositional technique to subconscious irretrievability for a post like this. If you think you can conjure a better delirium with more deliberation, try it, and if you succeed, that's good.

I do think editing is often overrated. Too much metacognition can also become paralyzing, which the type of writing you describe could counteract. Both of those are a topic in themselves, though.

As I mention below, it's noticeably different from random words, so there's some degree of quality going on. Whether there are better techniques for doing this type of thing waits on someone to prove it.

Sorry to be kind of vague. Just ask if you want elaboration.
