Rationalism is simply the study of how to most effectively achieve your goals, whatever they might be. It has nothing to do with conscious vs unconscious and if you look at Kahneman or the CFAR curriculum you'll see a lot of discussion on non-conscious mechanisms -- TAPs, System 1, urge propagation, etc. Rationalists accept that being a Vulcan doesn't work and that it's important to use all your resources, logical and emotional.

I would suggest not using the word "antirational". First, because it doesn't mean what you think it means. Second, because it's defined negatively -- the name tells you what it ISN'T, but not what it IS. Similarly, "primitivist" is a bad choice because it's associated with the term "primitive", which is often used pejoratively.

Using something like "subconscious" or "flow-driven" will get you a much better first impression when presenting your ideas.
