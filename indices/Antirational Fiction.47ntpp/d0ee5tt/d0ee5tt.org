That's just misguided and irrational faith in a processes leading to blinkered monomania as a solution, all based on an overly simplified model of reality and likely a misunderstanding of game, information, decision, and chaos theory; but that result is also a strong trope in storytelling.

This writing example here is just oh-so-random purple monkey dishwasher, of course--acontextual and signifying nothing.

Irrationally successful monomania is standard low/modern/high fantasy or horror fare, typical of young adult and other simplified fiction written quickly, cheaply, and poorly.

  "Because I'm sure, more than anyone else in the world, that I'm right," he said, jaw clenched in certainty.

  Seeing he was having some very strong emotions, she suddenly felt he was right about everything, very handsome, and sure to win the day without losing any important body parts.
