Not sure which pills you're off, but I suggest get back on them. Science is good, medical science very much so.

If either English or logic isn't your first language, I apologize. But also, maybe don't front so hard if you can't deliver when challenged.

And if this is intentional, experienced, correct chemically speaking, and not affected, well...

If you can't debate, at least make coherent points in standard essay format. If you can't fall back and prove basic competence in either debate or thesis writing, few will take you or you ideas seriously. Things aren't being presented with any context or rational currently. Hardly a good way to comport oneself if actually attempting to share ideas with others.

Of course, you're not really reading this in your haze of dank "creativity," are you? Just reacting to random words and phrases out of context and without any real understanding of my points. And your next response will be just as emotionally and factually disconnected as this was.

Ah well. Maybe I'll be proven wrong. Doubt it.
