Apparently my tiny brain is too inignificant to understand the full glory of primalist fiction. If you'd care to pretend that I am a dribbling idiot, perhaps you could explain what on earth you're getting at? And how are you supposed to judge a primal expression of subconcious thought? The constraint of expectation would surely shut down the pure act of creation inherent in elaborating on crystaline eyeballs and ursine urine in prose.
