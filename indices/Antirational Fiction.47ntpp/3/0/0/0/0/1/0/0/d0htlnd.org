Rationalism = consciously reasoning through things, which means bringing stuff to conscious attention. (Ofc, practicing rational thought is bound to make your subconscious intuitions more rational.) So antirationalism would be about letting your subconscious do its thing. Running with the current machinery, rather than updating it. So yeah, that's probably about right.

I think primalism/primitivism as an aesthetic is related. It's about satisfying the pleistocene mental ware we have, rather than trying to update it to the environment that it's in currently. Less responsible but potentially more satisfying
