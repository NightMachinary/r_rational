You're pretty vague and riled for someone who indicts me with irrational passion, and pretty spotty on reading comprehension for someone who indicts me with illiteracy.

Anyway, I'm not fronting on a thing, and you never launched a single challenge. If you have one to throw, throw it and I'll answer. Your one correct accusation is that this was written quickly and easily, partly because this type of fiction's inhibition-demolishing quality would be lost if it were overly labored or taken seriously. I have nothing riding on it. But that only makes it more scornable that you can't summon the small effort necessary to try it yourself.
