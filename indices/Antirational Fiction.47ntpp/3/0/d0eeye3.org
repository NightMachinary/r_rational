What you said is unconnected to the doc I linked, as though you're just snapping against the fact that it sounds kinda different from this sub's default writing style, which...the title says is the point of this game. And if you're not viewing art as a game that means you're not here to make it, so at least criticize it with the rigor of a critic.

But as for what I said in the post, here's an example. Most of the data our eyes gather is quickly filtered out, to leave us with a visual model that's far less accurate than it could be but serves us far better than a more detailed model that used more mental bandwidth. Pretty basic.
