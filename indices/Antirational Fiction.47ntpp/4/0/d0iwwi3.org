Check out this bot: [[https://www.reddit.com/user/writingprompts_ss]] I trawled it at one point and it what it writes can be pretty interesting

Both are a little too chaotic for me though. I think to produce the right effect, it has to stay close enough to coherence that you try to make sense of it, rather than immediately dismissing it as nonsense. But if it then rewards scrutiny with making more sense than it seemed to, that's even more substantial.
