Remember that companies are controlled by people. So diseases that can effect them and their relatives and loved ones will more often than not get cured. Diseases that don't won't.

​

A simple example is malaria, it doesn't affect most first world countries, so the cure hasn't been found yet and believe me there's been more than enough time for them to find a cure for it, just not enough incentive.

​

Immortality is also desirable for the people controlling said companies and conglomerates, so it's fair to assume they are properly motivated to get it working as soon as they can.

​

Be jaded if you want, just remember companies aren't actors, they are controlled by people, be they owners, CEOs, or stakeholders. And those people want similar things you want, safety and less suffering for their families and themselves included.
