so, a while ago charles stross had a talk about how [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html][companies are paperclip maximizers]]. stross is a scottish author of transhuman spy fiction.

this is a simplification, but a reasonable one. so, you want them to cure cancer and give you immortality. they want money, and there has been noise about how [[https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/goldman-sachs-says-curing-diseases-may-not-be-economically-valid/][there may be more money in not curing people]].

so, as big companies are the only ones who can leverage the resources needed to solve for immortality, and they also have strong incentives not to cure you, why do we expect them to do so? our theory of mind for big corporations is simply wrong. the first type of way to modify corporate behavior is regulation, but this is hard to do with lots of negative externalities hiding in the weeds.

on the other hand, your government is its own maximizer for political power, with an externality of your quality of life. when people vote themselves money, bad things happen- look at [[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-annual-inflation-tops-1-million-pct-in-november-congress-idUSKBN1O91WT][venezuela]].
