Thanks for the Stross talk. I've been looking for opinions like that (other examples: [[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway][1,]] [[https://thoughtinfection.com/2014/04/19/capitalism-is-a-paperclip-maximizer/][2).]]

He could've improved the presentation a bit by:

- giving a disclaimer on the differences between [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU][wetware]] and electronic CPUs.

  - qualitative differences in reaction times (clock rate, CPU power)
  - susceptibility to large groups of people becoming "outraged" and voting with their money. Doesn't always work, but when it does, companies even tend to overreact sometimes (e.g. the reddit's sub bannings).

- stripping off his own political opinions, no matter how reasonable they are. I see that he did try filtering them out, but quite a bit leaked through anyway.
