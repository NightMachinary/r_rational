  [...] there has been noise about how there may be more money in not curing people

I think this is misleading and the referenced report would be more accurately summed up as “There may be some diseases for which, in some markets, curing is economically less feasible than an ongoing treatment with similar overall costs.” In particular, it is mentioned that the problems are alleviated for diseases with large markets (i.e. there is a lot of money to be made anyway) or high incidence (meaning that you are not going to run out of people to cure).

Additionally, if I understood correctly, the two main effects that actually correspond to a misalignment of incentives (and are not just a consequence of paying back all the R&D necessary) are

1. Curing a disease can eliminate the market, thus the potential profit is limited.
2. A person can pay larger sums in total if they are spread out over a longer period of time instead of being a one-time things, and cures fall in the latter category instead of the former.

First, I note that 2, while valid, only applies in countries without working health insurance, as insurance amortises the cost (i.e. the insurer makes decisions for lots of people at the same time, thus it can choose the cheapest option in the long run). Also, pharmaceutical companies operate internationally, so 2 is reduced overall as well.

Finally, 1 is a problem, but note how it only applies to diseases where the cost of curing exceeds the lifetime cost of treatment. (Else there would still be profit.) It could still be beneficial for a society to pay this large, up-front cost for the benefit of future generations so there is an argument that here, the incentives are in fact misaligned. On the other hand, I do not think most people care that much about future generations, so maybe the incentives are fine.

In conclusion, I think the incentives are, overall, well-aligned and that you have to look quite a bit deeper than most people do to find the problems. I do not /expect/ any company to develop immortality, but that is more because I think it is too resource-intensive for a single company to fund, and not due to a lack of inclination.
