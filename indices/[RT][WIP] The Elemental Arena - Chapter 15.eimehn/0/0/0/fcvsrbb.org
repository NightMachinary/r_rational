I'm having a bit of trouble remembering all the terms here, honestly. IIRC there were four central zones circling around the Final Zone. Then each central zone has four secondary zones radiating around that, which our MC is currently in? So one in the center, four around it, and 16 total around those? Is the "starter zone" the same as those secondary zones, or is there a smaller subdivision we haven't had explained yet?

It is interesting that we have only seen human PCs, so to speak, but if the pickup message was broadcast to /all/ players in the zone, not just human ones, then it's likely we'll get a lot more conflict as the other species realize there's a huge advantage waiting to be picked up. If a species is able to acquire a few race-wide bonuses, then they could potentially snowball the whole thing.
