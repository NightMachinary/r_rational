I'd love to know the answer to this as well - along with the species humanity is up against.

The arena seems to be keeping the player races separate for the time being. It isn't clear if they're in completely different starting zones.

That said, it is possible some of the other species are parasitical, very stealthy, or else casually indistinguishable from human. Some of the players we've seen could be non-human. Wristbands would reveal these imposters -- they wouldn't have the D- prefix on their player ID.
