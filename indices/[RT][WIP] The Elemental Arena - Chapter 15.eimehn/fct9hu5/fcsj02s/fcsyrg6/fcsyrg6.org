Fire is looking very impressive as a Prime.

- Improved Heart allows skill activation 30% more frequently (likely better with higher skill).

- Access to /Blunt Weapons I/ and /Pole Weapons I/. If the scimitar's skill is Fire (to match the likely prime of the mini-boss who dropped it), that's three obtainable Physical +2 increases.

- Fire's destructive opposite is Water, which admittedly is probably no joke in PvE. In PvP, however, enemies will likely optimize to use the element's healing powers at the expense of direct combat effectiveness.

- We've now seen firsthand that Fire has a skill with a close AE attack.

- /Quick Step I/ enhances movement speed. Upgrading this an extra time or two should make it very difficult for enemies to get close enough to hit you.

- And now, every human player left alive in the zone has an additional +1 to this affinity.
