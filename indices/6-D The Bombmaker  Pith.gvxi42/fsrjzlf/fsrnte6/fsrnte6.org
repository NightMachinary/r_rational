Nice to see a new Ana chapter. I like how she and "Wes" have constantly shifting opinions of each other as they come to understand one another.

I suspect Ana will need to forcefully obtain a new body from one of her enemies shortly. She won't want to, and would hate herself for it, but her options are running out.
