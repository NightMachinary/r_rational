Great chapter.

One thing I found particularly interesting was this line:

"I didn't hide my Pith from Clementine.  That was impossible, right now."

I'm assuming the part about Ana hiding her own pith being impossible at that moment was because Clementine was already projecting into it, but I think the implications of hiding her own pith have a lot of interesting implications. One being that her visual illusions won't be super easy to see through by any competent projector, but more importantly, she might become immune to any vocation that requires the user to project into her pith.

Another interesting bit was this:

"Clods of dirt flew above my head and exploded into soil, showering down over me.  /Fuck./  I could mask the position of my Pith, but if that dirt hit me, she'd feel my outline.  She'd know my exact location."

I had actually considered this a while back as a sort of default sixth sense that might arise from most elemental magic systems. It seems to me, that depending on how small of an object a projector can control, they might, for example, project into water vapor in the air to sense any and all objects displacing it. I'd be curious to see if Ana could create illusions against this too since she can already affect someone else's pith sense.
