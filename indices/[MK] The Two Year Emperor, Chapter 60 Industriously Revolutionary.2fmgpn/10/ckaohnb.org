I'm wondering if it would have been better to create a Duplicate Item Gnome Gnome.

/I am imagining a magic item that I shall call a Duplicate Item Gnome. It is a one foot tall magically invulnerable statue of a gnome. It starts with one googolplex experience points. It can be primed with a magic item. Waving a magic item within three inches in front of the face of the statue primes it with that magic item. Every round, if the statue is upright and is primed with a magic item and has sufficient experience points, it produces a copy of that magic item./

Then a Duplicate Item Gnome Gnome is a magic item, similarly capable of being primed with a magic item; the DIGs that the DIGG produces inherit the DIGG's primed magical item.

This is a bit more complex, but you only have one family of item makers to deal with. It's easy to switch out the type of magic item you're creating.

I think the largest problem with this tactic is narration. It's easy to narrate the current set of items: something that spews out fortifying bedrolls, then something that spews out that. It's another layer of abstraction to get to something that spews out copies of a given item, and it isn't as easy to draw a path for the reader from something concrete to this abstraction. It's also a bit harder to follow the additional abstraction from a DIG to a DIGG [to a DIGGG].
