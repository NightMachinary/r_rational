Given that most people seem to have at least 60 levels now, anyone who has specialized in Spot should have +60 to it at a bare minimum (ranks only, no special feats, items, or weird stuff). While that's not enough to see atoms, the smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers across, which is 800 times larger than an iron atom - or about 10 size categories. So to see a single cell, you only need to have a spot check of +92 - which is fairly easily achievable for any of the newly hyperleveled characters.

Incidentally, such high Spot checks allow you to see invisible creatures without really trying:

#+begin_quote
  A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 Spot check. The observer gains a hunch that “something's there” but can't see it or target it accurately with an attack. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to spot (DC 40). It's practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature's location with a Spot check, and even if a character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss chance).

But if we were /really/ following the D&D Spot rules, you wouldn't be able to see much beyond a few hundred yards (or something like that), which makes almost no sense.

Edit: +15 to Wisdom from 60 levels and +5 to Wisdom from the POPE gives you +70 without much optimization. That's enough to see things on the micrometer scale when you take 10. Of course, it's sort of questionable whether things in Stupidworld are even made up of cells or atoms in the first place, but I guess given the matter-antimatter reaction they must be. If you take 20 you can see cells, and that's without a microscope.
