  The rules don't actually specify at what distance you can see things which aren't hiding.

I am pretty sure they do. The rules in the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/wilderness.htm][Wilderness section of the SRD]] give the guidelines. Also, from the entry on Spot:

#+begin_quote
  Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).
#+end_quote

This is backed up by the fact that the SRD gives a Spot DC for seeing a forest fire, which by definition can't be hiding. [[/u/eaglejarl]] has said that this is too stupid to really be worth including. The reason for these rules is pretty obvious - short encounter distances are more dynamic and all for melee/ranged to both get more out of the encounter. I've never met a DM who actually uses the guidelines though; it's always been straight fiat.
