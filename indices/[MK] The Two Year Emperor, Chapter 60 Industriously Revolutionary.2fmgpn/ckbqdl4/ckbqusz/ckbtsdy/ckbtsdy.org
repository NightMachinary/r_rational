True. This just means that without a way for Jake to improve himself beyond that +5 he's going to be left way behind in the ability department. Also, due to munchkining (who doesn't do that?) most characters would dump those ability points into one to three abilities.

I also hope that Jake's reaction to Intelligence enhancement isn't usual or Intelligence enhancement after the turret and FLEA would make many people kill themselves.
