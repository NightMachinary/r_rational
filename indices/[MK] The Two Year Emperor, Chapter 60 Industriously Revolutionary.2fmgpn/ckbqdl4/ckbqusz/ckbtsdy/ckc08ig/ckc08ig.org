No worries on that score -- StupidWorlders won't freak out like that. There's nothing in RAW about ability enhancement being difficult, so it isn't. I felt that Jake, coming from outside the system and without its protections, would probably have some reactions to his brain being modified, that's all.

Besides, it added good drama and made it clear that he had actually been enhanced.

As to being left behind in ability scores -- Jake has never really been within shouting distance of any of the main character-leveled folks. Isaac/Reynard/Matthew/Unn have always been smarter. Drifa and Albrecht have always been wiser. The Landguard are /ridiculously/ stronger and faster. All he's got is outside perspective, deep knowledge of the RAW, and the memory of a lot of internet discussion about exploits.
