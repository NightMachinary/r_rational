Well, first of all, Mindscrape isn't really a polite thing to do to a friend.

Possibly more importantly, it's an Evil spell that is banned in Flobovia. So, Mindscraping Jake is literally against the Writ (the law), which means the Landguard will kill you if you try.

Finally, my interpretation of Mindscrape is that it gives you all of the subjects knowledge and memories as something like the Brainopedia; all of the information is there, you have a good sense of what's in it and you can easily find anything you're looking for...but you have to look for it. It's not the same as your own knowledge where the information is fully comprehended and connected with everything else so things float to the surface / suggest themselves to you on their own.
