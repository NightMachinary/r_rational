Just for funsies, because of that bit about atoms. Each size category is a factor of 2 along each dimension and confers a + or - 4 on Hide checks. Iron atoms have a diameter of 252 picometers. Dividing the average human height by the diameter and taking the log base 2 reveals that iron atoms are about 33 size categories smaller than humans. If someone manages to temporarily get about +132 to Spot checks, they'll be able to see atoms. I don't know if you can come up with a plausible excuse for this to happen, but it would be hilarious. I'm sure one of those threads on optimizing for epic skill checks would help. Fortunately, at such high levels they can get almost halfway there just on skill ranks alone. Also, freaking out about being made of cells. "I can see my own eyeballs! And they're made of little things! Oh Gods, they're moving!"
