Nothing in the wilderness section overrides the information on spot checks, they merely give the maximum distances you can make spot checks. They don't give the maximum distance you can see people with a clear line of sight. Also your cite from the spot check rules doesn't say that this applies to people who aren't hiding or concealed- the start of the spot check doesn't go away because they don't repeat it.

  This is backed up by the fact that the SRD gives a Spot DC for seeing a forest fire, which by definition can't be hiding.

A forest fire can be concealed by trees and thereby be difficult to see. Poor visibility is covered under spot checks.

#+begin_quote
  The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.

  I've never met a DM who actually uses the guidelines though; it's always been straight fiat.
#+end_quote

None of the guidelines actually oblige even a rules stickler DM to use spot checks for situations other than the ones they explicitly cover.
