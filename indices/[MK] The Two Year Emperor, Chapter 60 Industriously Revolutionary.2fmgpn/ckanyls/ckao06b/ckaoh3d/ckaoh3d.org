Ostensibly, a very popular kids/stoners cartoon. /Also/, a sometimes dark and adult story about a violent, post-apocalyptic world, with lots of fantasy and sci-fi trappings built into the absurdist presentation. It /quite often/ meets rational fiction story requirements, with serious consequences and logical plot outcomes.

The characters are kids, but they still use the world as well as they can. Rules exist for a reason, if it is a fantasy trope, and are consistent. Things that happened earlier that no one noticed often come back as highly significant in later plot lines, often for perfectly logical reasons. It does world-building and plot advancement in almost every episode, even if that isn't always apparent. Virtually no take-backsie one-shots that don't change anything.

Usually rather funny, but also really sad sometimes with some serious moments. Like the ongoing storyline with a character who continually loses their memories, having lived centuries with a cursed magical artifact that they had originally used to survive the apocalypse. Their also-immortal friend has to deal with the situation of knowing someone who only sort-of remembers them and their long history together. It is maturely handled and emotionally moving. Some other downright futurist concepts get snuck in there sometimes, as well.

The creators are genuinely intelligent in their writing, and it is never dumbed down for its supposed younger audience. Instead, the metaphor and heavy significances are simply silently left in for the more adult topics and never explained. It isn't done like a Pixar movie, with the wink and a nudge for the parents. But instead, it is simply told mostly from a younger perspective, and the dialog reflects that. The world is still fully formed and deep, though, and that comes through all the time. Especially in the wreckage of civilization and the world itself, which is literally shattered.

Also, a stretchy dog creature farts. So. Yeah.

Won't make any sense at all unless one invests serious time reading up wikis and such, or watching a hundred or so episodes in some sort of order.

Which is one reason a lot of people dismiss it as merely banana-monkey-dishwasher wackiness when they drop in half-way through a single episode in, say, the last few episodes in the third season.

These people are shallow and dismissive of something genuinely good on TV. I like to laugh in their faces when those same people complain that English language TV doesn't have anything as deep and artistically significant as Japanese anime. Which I also like to watch quality examples of, of course, because /I'm/ not a shallow, dismissive idiot myself. At least, not about that.

In conclusion, if you have the means, I highly recommend picking it up.

That was from /Ferris Bueller's Day Off/ (1986), BTW.

Oh yeah. The dog is named "Jake". Huh.
