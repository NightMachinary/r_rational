One thing that they're missing is extra fighters, every death is a tragedy. Maybe an Admantine Golem Maker Maker Maker next?

Or maybe just boost the people more. I don't know if Spell Engines can do personal range spells or not, but [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/shapechange.htm][Shapechange]], [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/foresight.htm][Foresight]], +[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/globeOfInvulnerabilityLesser.htm][Globe of Invulnerability]]+ *[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spellResistance.htm][Spell Resistance]]*, [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/bearsEndurance.htm][Bear's Endurance]]/[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/catsGrace.htm][Cat's Grace]]/etc, and [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/holyAura.htm][Holy Aura]] (all level 10,000,000 for immunity to dispel and year long durations) would be amazing buffs for any combatant. [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/races-of-destiny--81/delay-death--3048/][Delay Death]] would be amazing if it exists as well.

EDIT:...if you can make a level 10 million spell engine. Stretching a 1 round/level spell to lasting two years might be pushing it. If arbitrarily high spell levels are allowed, there's all sorts of exploits that are possible.

Would a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/healMass.htm][Mass Heal]] engine be allowed? Running into battle with one would be very effective, damaging all undead enemies within 30 feet 250 damage per round per engine, and healing all allies the same amount.

For new tactics, they can now carry out instantaneous attacks with their high level casters. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/timeStop.htm][Time Stop]], then [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/teleportGreater.htm][Greater Teleport]], drop Doge Balls (or some other free action), then teleport back out again. It is literally impossible to retaliate against the attacker if they do this, and each Wizard 20/Sorcerer 20 can do this 10x per day (or more if they have >= 28 Int/Cha).
