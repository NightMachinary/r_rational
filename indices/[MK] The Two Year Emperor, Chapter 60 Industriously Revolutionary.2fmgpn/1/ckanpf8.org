How come Isaac didn't have to pay Graham's number of experience to create the Earring? Wish doesn't remove the experience point cost of creating items, so unless the XP cost for the Earring is somehow (vastly) less than the XP stored within it, it should have used more XP to cast that Wish than Isaac could have possibly had.
