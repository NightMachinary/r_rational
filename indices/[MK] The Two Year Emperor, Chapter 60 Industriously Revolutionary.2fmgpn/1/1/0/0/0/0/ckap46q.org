Heh. Actually, I think this is the first time that's happened. Usually when I ask innocuous seeming questions it's because I've got something up my sleeve and I don't want to spoil it but I can't resist hinting a little bit.

[giving 2 wishes vs 1]

In both cases, it's because the extra Wish didn't matter and there's a question of perception. If the person you're doing the deal with is getting more out of it than you are, there's a small sense of irritation. If you're getting more out of it, you feel all magnanimous and DEFINITELY don't want to screw around.

And the second Wish really didn't matter -- in the first case, one Ring was enough to get infinite Wishes. In the second, Wishes were easily available and XP was the limiting factor, which the Earring solved.
