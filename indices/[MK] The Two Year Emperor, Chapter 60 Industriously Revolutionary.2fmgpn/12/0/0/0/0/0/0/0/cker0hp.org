Much like real world nations, Flobovia has two levels of legal structure: the law and the Writ. Think "legislation" and "Constitution."

Mostly, Jake can muck with the law all he wants but cannot change the Writ without some lengthy and difficult hoop-jumping.

In practice, there are limits on what he can do with the law as well. Lady Justice is, as has been shown, rather proprietary about the legal system, and the Conclave also has some strong feelings about things. Changes that they disapprove of tend to be lost in the paperwork shuffle, or poorly enforced. Although, yes, that doesn't affect things happening in his immediate presence.
