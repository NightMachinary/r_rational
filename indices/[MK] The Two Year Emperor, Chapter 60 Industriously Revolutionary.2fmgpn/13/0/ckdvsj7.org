How big a place? Do /you/ want to take a chance on starting a war between god-level beings that will without doubt spill over into the physical world?

So far as the BDHs know, there isn't a defined rule "if X% is safe, you are ok". It's the opinion of the individual Outer Plane rulers as to whether something constitutes a violation or not. Much like a nation can decide whether and how much they're going to bitch about one of their traditional enemies moving troops up to the common border for "military exercises."
