I was under the impression that the Gods put strict limits on Ice Assassin use, but I may need to reread it.

The advantage of high level Golems (or a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/monsters/colossus.htm][Colossus]] if you want one) is that they are completely invulnerable to lesser undead, and very resistant to casters. As long as nothing can get through it's DR 20, spell immunity, and construct traits, it can fight off an entire legion of ghouls, zombies, skeletons, and vampires, and ignore the ghosts and shades. Golems are ideal for front-line fighting against an undead horde.
