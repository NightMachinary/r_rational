My idea for an equip-engine, the G.O. (gear and out) system:

Create a magic statue with outstretched arms, if it does not hold a handy haversack in its hands it creates a handy haversack in its hands and triggers any attuned spell engines behind it to create whatever other magic items you want inside the handy haversack. Stack the POPEs in the same square next to the statue.

Just needs a single level of meta to create each individual engine, made on demand instead of automatically. Alternatively add another layer of meta by having spell engines put into the haversack to create a given item when it does not exist in the same extradimensional space as them, allowing you to pull out and use X every round.

The round after they use the flea, the new archmage picks up their equipment, gets +5 to all stats, then moves off. This frees up the peasants used in a railgun and avoids having to deal with giant piles of replicating equipment. Added benefit of being modular for future uses, just make a new spell engine and attune it to have whatever you want deposited in new handy haversacks.
