Haversack gnomes gave me another idea. Spell turrets from DMG2 (pg45) are diminutive traps that can trigger by type and cast 4 different spells, one spell a round, and repairs itself after rotating through its spells. Diminutive is only 6 inches, so make a 6''x6''x1'' wall that you carry around in your haversack with a spell turret on you.

Make a "trapper keeper gnome" that creates one of them every round there is not already one within 5ft of it for deployable spell turret mines. Key one to undead, pick the four meanest spells you can think of, and have the landguard drop one every round they spend in the maze. Not only will it mark where they have been, it will make short work of any undead that comes across them.

Alternatively, key it to humanoid, pick four amazing buffs and line grofhamr with the things.

Thanks to their diminutive size you can actually fit 25 of them in a single square. Cover the entrance hole's walls with them for a crazy number of spells per round being shot at any invaders.
