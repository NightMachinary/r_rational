  This was wonderful. Jake has gotten so much better now he's not a PTSD suffering alcoholic.

Heh. Thanks, glad you think so. To be honest, I was just as tired of writing him that way as everyone seems to have been of reading him that way. When Icefi showed up, his primary mission was to get the humans onside, but his secondary mission was to steal Jake's brain and get the information out. It was a perfect opportunity to fix the bad parts en passant.

  I presume that they were automating the production of useful things like HoOA? And that the Landguard made ice Assassins off screen?

Yes and yes.

  If they're forbidden from turning Neklos' servants against him, shouldn't the gods be annoyed by their treatment of Colborn and plans for Hammond?

It was more "you can't do that en masse". Converting individual worshippers of a god is an acceptable and time-honored tactic in divine warfare. Stealing entire swaths of them in one go is not cricket, however. Anything that violates the divine equivalent of the Geneva Conventions gets all the gods uniting to spank you with an axe.

  Also, would any kind of limited time Grey Goo be useful? Eg. Something which converts an area of matter in front of itself into a copy of itself until arbitrary time. Or, say, a spell engine which cast Sunburst, or one which created such engines, dropped onto a field of undead?

As to the Sunburst -- it would be useful, yes, but it's approximately the same thing that Fragment already kiboshed. They might try asking about it separately, though.

Grey Goo...might be useful, although the only thing I can think of that you'd use it for would be utterly destroying an area of ground and everything on it, and there's already plenty of ways to do that. It's pretty much the same problem as the AM explosions -- chewing up lots of landscape tends to piss off the mountain / earth / river / etc gods.
