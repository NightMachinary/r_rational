I have to wonder how the various stat blessings will affect people (especially Jake as the viewpoint character).

I mean, if I get that right, the POPE will grant +5 to the various stats, respectively, right? And given the exponentially growing blessing capability soon enough everyone will have arbitrarily high stats, with the only distinguishing difference being what the characters started with and selected for when they gained character levels. My assumption is, soon enough either everyone will have a POPE and can increase all their stats +5 every... day or so.

Since all stats are similarly increased, there shouldn't even be a period of acclimatization to the increased stats be necessary. Sure, everyone is suddenly stronger, but their *wisdom* and thus perceptional and intuitive faculties ought to be increased as well, so no accidental dislocating door handles and other mishaps, right?

But what are the limitations? Will soon enough everyone be strong enough to

- jump hundreds of meters high (based on *strength*),
- put eyes out with paper air planes consistently (hand-eye coordination based on *dexterity*),
- have astronomical hit points (are there even hit points?),
- disable everything (based on *intelligence*),
- be living lie detectors (Sense Motive, Listen, Spot all based on *wisdom*),
- and be insanely appealing to everyone not /blessed/?

Also, if I got your chapter right, Jake now has +25 INT to whatever his natural score was due to each "I wish to be smarter" granting him +5 INT; the parenthesis pandemonium that followed was due to (a) the sudden increase and (b) Jake not having the appropriate increase in WIS that would have the willpower and intuition to deal with this.

(I never played D&D, but due to popcultural osmosis am aware of enough tidbits to reason a lot of stuff out, yet do not know the rules and, more relevant, tripfalls of the system.)
