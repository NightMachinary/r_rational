<3 Graham's number. For the mathematics nerds, you may want to check out the [[http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?t=7469][my number is bigger]] thread on the xkcd forums. g64 is suitably overkill (its already large enough that doubling it doesn't make much difference), but Ack(Ack(g64, g64), Ack(g64, g64))...

Or y'know,

#+begin_example
  define h(1) = g64  [Ack(Ack(g64, g64), Ack(g64, g64)) up arrows] g64;
  h(n) = h(n-1) [Ack(Ack(h(n-1), h(n-1)), Ack(h(n-1), h(n-1))) up arrows] h(n-1);
  earring.setExperience(h(g64));
