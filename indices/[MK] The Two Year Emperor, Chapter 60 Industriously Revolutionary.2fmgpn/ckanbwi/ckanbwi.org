Incidentally, if anyone can come up with a Wolfram-Alpha-able equation that graphs the production capacity of the 3-tier production lines, I'd love to see it. I wrote out the first few levels of it longhand to make sure it had the production I wanted. Later on I tried to actually write down the equations, but my brain kept breaking when I did.

You can safely assume that all GGGs fire before all GGs before all Gs.
