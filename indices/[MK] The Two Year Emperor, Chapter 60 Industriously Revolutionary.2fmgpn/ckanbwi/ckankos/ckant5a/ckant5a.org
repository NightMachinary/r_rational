Indeed, the number of Gs exactly follows the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number][triangular number sequence]], which can be calculated with the polynomial 1/2x^{2} + x/2. Since the rate FBR increases per round is just the number of Gs, we now know the derivative.

Simply take the integral and you get 1/6x^{3} + 1/4x^{2,} where x is the number of FBRs. (Of course, this assumes infinite space, which constrains the actual numbers of a bit. Stupid reality screwing up math.)

Anyway, here's the [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28x%5E3%29%2F6+%2B+%28x%5E2%29%2F2+at+x+%3D+100][Wolfman Alpha graph]], at x = 100. It matches your calculation.
