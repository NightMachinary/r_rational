There are 14400 rounds per day, so the engine has a daily maximum output of... uh... */calculates furiously/*... [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28x%5E3%29%2F6+%2B+%28x%5E2%20%29%2F2+at+x+%3D+14400][500 billion]].

Maybe a bit.

EDIT: Of course, the copper gnomes take up space too, and they would be up to 100 million at that point, which probably wouldn't fit in the space constraints. So actual output would be lower. (Unless they're allowed to occupy the same physical space and merge into a super-dense gnome-matter? In which case, you'd eventually get a tiny gnome neutron star or something.)
