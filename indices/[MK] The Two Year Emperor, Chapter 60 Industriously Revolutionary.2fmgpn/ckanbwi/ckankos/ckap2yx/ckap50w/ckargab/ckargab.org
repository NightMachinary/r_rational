Wait, but then you can easily fill any arbitrary volume with gnomes and FBRs in a single round. We know from POPEs that an engine can cast multiple spells a round, or at least consist of several spell engines each casting 1 per round. So if each gnome arm can cast Wish, wishing for a G^{r} will give you 2^{r} FBRs within a round, as each gnome wish will create two more wishes, which again create two more each etc.
