Ignoring the volume constraints, the problem is just a simple polynomial. If then cannot spread the things out fast enough, this just remains an upper bound.

Assuming that it starts at round 0 with 1 GGG and nothing else, that each round the total number of GGs is the sum of the previous number of GGs and GGGs and likewise for Gs and FBRs, you get:

0: (1, 0, 0, 0)\\
1: (1, 1, 1, 1)\\
2: (1, 2, 3, 4)\\
3: (1, 3, 6, 10)\\
4: (1, 4, 10, 20)\\
5: (1, 5, 15, 35)\\
...

This generalises to (1, n, n(n+1)/2, n(n+1)(n+2)/6), or (1, nC1, (n+1)C2, (n+2)C3).

If you started with a G^{r,} rather than a G^{3,} it would be (G^{r,} ..., G, FBR)=(1, nC1, ..., (n+r-2)C(r-1), (n+r-1)Cr)

So, after 1 minute you would have 220, 5 minutes would give you 22100, half an hour would give you 4545100, and an hour would give you 36180200, enough for all of Grofhamr and Flobovia's population. If you're willing to wait a day, every person in Grofhamr and Flobovia can make 13500 Ice Assassins and give them all a Fortifying Bedroll, with a few left over for all the trees and animals in Flobovia.

EDIT: Gnomes are apparently able to cast Wish the same round that they are created. My solution has been amended accordingly
