Just for fun, here's the [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F24%28x%5E4%29+%2B+1%2F12%28x%5E3%29][Wolfman Alpha]] for the platinum gnome, which unless I'm being dumb would just be the antiderivative/integral of the previous equation. For added fun, let's assume Jake "forgot" to put in the volume restriction.

After 10 minutes it's already reached 5 million bedrolls. An hour and it's shot up to 5 billion. Let it run for the day and it's up to 1.8 /quadrillion/. A week and it's up to 5 *quintillion*. Depending on the size of the planet, that's enough to cover every square foot with well over a thousand bedrolls. Woops.
