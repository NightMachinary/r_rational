The distinguishing characteristic of all Jake's rejected plans in this chapter is that they are /en masse/, and generally stupidly OP exploits -- 'kill/turn all the undead' definitely fits in that category.

Using a Helm of Opposite Alignment opportunistically on significant /individuals/ is positively mundane -- highly effective, but nothing jawdropping -- as war strategy goes. I would call the gods seriously OCD if they were bothered by that.
