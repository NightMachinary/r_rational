This was wonderful. Jake has gotten so much better now he's not a PTSD suffering alcoholic. I presume that they were automating the production of useful things like HoOA? And that the Landguard made ice Assassins off screen?

If they're forbidden from turning Neklos' servants against him, shouldn't the gods be annoyed by their treatment of Colborn and plans for Hammond?

Also, would any kind of limited time Grey Goo be useful? Eg. Something which converts an area of matter in front of itself into a copy of itself until arbitrary time. Or, say, a spell engine which cast Sunburst, or one which created such engines, dropped onto a field of undead?
