It can get worse than that. Cover a tower shield with 24 spell turrets and a counterspell trap, then fill the inside of the shield with a mixture of boon traps and spell turrets. Put one of those in each squad to make a heavy weapons landguard.

24 spells a round at enemies and 25 buffs/healing spells a round for you. You can do that while having total cover vs anything but targeted spells, which you have a counterspell turret for. Total cover is disgusting.

Go even crazier and cover your entire body with an armored suit of traps as well.
