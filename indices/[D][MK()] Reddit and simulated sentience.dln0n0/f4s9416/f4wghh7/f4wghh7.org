Hey, if you liked that one, I wrote an entire short story collection a few years ago that is a "discontinuous narrative" about an AI slowly becoming sentient enough to write narrative, specifically Hollywood movies.

One of the things that I think is novel in this conceit is that I draw the distinction between "temporary" and "permanent" AI, which I think will become more important as we move forward and need problems solved but don't want to leave a trace.
