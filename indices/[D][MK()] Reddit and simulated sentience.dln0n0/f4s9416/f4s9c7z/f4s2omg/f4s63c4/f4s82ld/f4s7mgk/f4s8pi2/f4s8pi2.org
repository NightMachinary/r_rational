I think you misunderstood; I'm saying that the chinese room /is/ in fact sapient, in the sense that the aggregate mental work done to perfectly simulate how a sapient would react to any given query is equivalent to a sapient (or many sapients) experiencing and thinking about each query before giving their reply. I'm calling that a meta-sapient, because it's a sapient running on a substrate composed of other sapient minds.
