I think you might have hold of the wrong end of the stick here, in terms of reddit bots that simulate simple gates being intelligent.

Like, nobody here is trying to argue for souls, yeah? You are free to do whatever you want, not free to want whatever you want, deterministic universe, etc. Calling a brain in a human body a 'person' is a useful social illusion, not a cutting of reality along the joints sort of deal. People are part of physics, same as their chairs, exactly equally free of causality.

The point, then, of the label of 'personhood' is its utility to our polity, not what it describes. To call a Reddit bot a 'person' isn't to say anything about its nature, it is a useful handle for a bunch of other things. Like, can you be friends with it? Should it be allowed to vote? These are examples of the kinds of questions that 'personhood' is salient to.

Whether a skull with a Chinese room inside it is useful to call a Chinese person is down to how it acts, not what shows up when you x-ray it. Bots don't fail because they are bots, they fail because of the social considerations of them not failing.

Whenever AI passes a hurdle a new hurdle gets put down further along. This isn't because there is some distinct degree of usefulness that an AI needs to pass to 'be a person', it is because AI being a person seems like it would have bad consequences, so we move the goalposts. It is a motivated judgement. The real "tell me what my AI needs to do to be considered AI" is something like 'vote without deception under its own identity', or some other test that is equally recursive.
