As I said, nothing I'm saying is new or controversial to [[/r/rational]]; the short story is at least a decade old too. Though this isn't really the same thing as a chinese room; the point of that though experiment was to think of something that appeared sapient but in actuality wasn't. Using the terminology I made up for this post, a chinese room would be a metasapient running on the substrate of the room, the interpreter, and all the people who thought of how a sapient would self-consistently respond to any given query.
