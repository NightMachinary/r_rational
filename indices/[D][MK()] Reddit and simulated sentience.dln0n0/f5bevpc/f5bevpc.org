The question isn't how complex it can get, but how independent of substrate and optimized it can get. Suppose it wasn't at all independent of substrate, by this I mean that there is no information you can skip out and still get accurate predictions. Suppose a human John mentally simulates a system of logic gates. If we want to predict this specific part of Johns mind, we don't need to know what john had for lunch, the result should come out the same either way. If John is writing a diary, or filling in a happiness questionnaire, the result might depend on all sorts of things, like his lunch and relationship status. If peoples redditing behavior depend strongly on these other factors, then reddit alone cant be an independent subsystem.

There is also a question of optimization. Human minds are optimized by evolution. A random arrangement of logic gates won't produce anything interesting. (Using only reversible logic gates on random inputs will give random outputs). There is no obvious force optimizing any of these meta level systems, and the amount of compute in them is tiny if each person is acting like a 20 microhertz not gate.
