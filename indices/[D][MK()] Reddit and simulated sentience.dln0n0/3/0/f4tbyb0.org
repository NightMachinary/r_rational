I'm not really disagreeing with you; I'm a fan of [[/u/DataPacRat]]'s "Trader's definition" of personhood from this blog: [[http://blog.datapacrat.com/2013/05/page/2/]] (warning:furry transhumanism). That is, that a person is anything it's useful to treat as a person. But even by that definition, or perhaps especially by that definition, personhood is applicable to metaintelligances that arise as emergent properties of organizations, since what I'm trying to determine if we can describe and therefore locate metaintelligences that could perform useful computational work. At this point I'm just trying to find a NAND gate as a thought experiment, but maybe the social networks of the future will be complex enough to allow for commensurately complex metaintelligences.
