Once again we see someone making a joke about Juniper looking like a 'default' character. My hypothesis is that Juniper is a game character, but not as someone from Earth playing in Aerb, but rather someone from a future high-tech society who is playing as a character from present-day Earth thrown into Aerb.

It sounds weird to have Juniper be a character from Earth rather than being an Aerb native, but it saves on exposition having him already know the backstory of any 'dungeons' the party enters and it provides a mystery/plot for the player to pursue (why am I in Aerb and how can I go back to Earth?).

It could explain the weirdness of several different layers in the game. It's because multiple different highly advanced gaming software are being used in a kludge by people just importing assets to make the game Aerb.

Also can I say how much I love this chapter for being a real-life version of high-stakes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game][Mafia]])?
