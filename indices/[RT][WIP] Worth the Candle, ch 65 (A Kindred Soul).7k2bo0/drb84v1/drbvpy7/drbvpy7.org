Through this lens, what if the point of the 'game' layer's skill numbers are a way to not-really learn the subject, an abstraction between it and the player's brain?

Suppose you want to play a survival game with immersion but making traps to catch small animals is aesthetically unpleasing to you even if you're not a vegetarian. The ability to +map+reduce a skill set to a number has an obvious appeal in the domain of fighting and violence. But why not just combat skills? Consider driving as an example. The instincts of a NASCAR racer on a closed course are not the best for everyday driving.

Now to take this line of reasoning to the fullest: ideal Bayesians don't want to learn false things in general, so the abstraction allows the designers to respect this preference /and/ invent systems and interactions for the game. Magic is a prime example. Training the impulse to call on non-existent magic to solve an urgent problem seems like an actively bad thing to do to yourself.

Having said that, I think this explanation is missing something. When the narration jumps back to Earth, there's clearly someone we're following. And when I try for increasingly fanciful explanations I keep hitting the same sort of notes that we're presently or imminently experiencing on the topic of our new friend Valencia.
