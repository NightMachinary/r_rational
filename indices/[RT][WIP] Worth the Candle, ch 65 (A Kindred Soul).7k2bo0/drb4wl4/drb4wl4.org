I think a sufficiently devious soul mage wouldn't just springboard themselves up in the values table. Instead they would change the math that allows values to change. Qualitatively that might look like "rational arguments have a 1.5x effectiveness in changing someones values." In this way the soul mage would immediately know the best ways to 'naturally' get to the top of the persons value table. This type of manipulation would be much harder to detect.
