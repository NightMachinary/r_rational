Actually, this is the best reason to do as OP suggests. Any change you make reverts, but if you make a change to how input is processed, the output probably doesn't revert. So change their value-deciding function so that they tend to place great trust into people who seem strangely aloof and chipper, act that way and slowly gain their trust, and when your changes revert they maintain the "naturally" developed trust.
