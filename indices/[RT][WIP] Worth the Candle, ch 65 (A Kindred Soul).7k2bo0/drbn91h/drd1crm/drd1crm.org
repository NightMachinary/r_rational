Well, up until reading this chapter, I had thought [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77rsvo/rtwip_worth_the_candle_chapter_52_culmination/doocnwc/][this]] line of reasoning was spot on. But her list of values says otherwise. Or, if you want to go down the rabbithole, the absence of Fenn among those values is evidence they've been changed (for what reason would Fenn be devalued though?)

Maybe she is romantically interested in Fenn, but doesn't sufficiently value romance to place that above the ticket to power that is Joon. When she's disappointed with Joon saying everything looked as expected, she's disappointed to confirm that's the type of person she is.
