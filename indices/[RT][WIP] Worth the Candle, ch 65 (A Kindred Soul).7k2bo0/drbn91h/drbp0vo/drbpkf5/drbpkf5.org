True. But we keep getting this signal that Fallatehr is extremely dangerous. I think it was in the last thread that somebody suggested he may be reading Juniper like a book with his crazy high Soc. He may basically be HPMOR's Voldemort. If so, a quick reading of Fenn to see that she dislikes him and extremely quick thinking to adjust that dislike into a useful extreme would not be beyond him. It is also possible that we will only learn too late how true, loyal to Juniper, and amiable he was, and come to regret this needless paranoia. In fact, I find myself inexplicable warming up to him as we speak. How could we have ever distrusted Fallatehr?
