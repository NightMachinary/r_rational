I'm not so sure. Fallatehr could tell at a glance that Joon is a blood mage. Maybe he can see (but not alter) a person's soul at a glance, and he can tell something is going on between Amaryllis, Fenn, and Joon with that ability. If 'being companions' is something he can detect by sight alone, he might alter Valencia to rapidly grow in loyalty as a gambit. Er, if a soulless being can be altered....

Disregarding that, he did spend some time in Fenn's glove. Maybe he saw the Twinned Souls from her end.
