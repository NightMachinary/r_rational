The last I remembered.. They still have Solace's soul in a jar, right? If Joon got better at Essentialism maybe he might be able to transplant it into her body. At least temporarily - like a Speak with Dead spell, until they can properly resurrect her. The ethics of doing it is a whole other can of worms though.. How would things interact if Solace's soul has degraded?
