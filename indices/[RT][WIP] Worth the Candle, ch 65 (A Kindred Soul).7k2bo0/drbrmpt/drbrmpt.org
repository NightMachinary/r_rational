This is probably going to be a lengthy post so let me start right.

*First of all* i really liked the story and characters, even tho binge reading kills my soul cause i have a habit of putting myself into characters shoes.

I find so elements of the story or rather Junipers description of things funny or ironic considering his knowledge, but i it maybe a personal thing.

Here is the list if this funny\ironic things.

*1. At the start of the novel he comments about video games having less freedom or free form compared to D&D and the like.*

But i'm pretty sure there are plenty types of video games that allow you to just run a simulation of regular life Sims style or even be a Tycoon. Even some RPG's are strictly about running your own shop and being a merchant. In the world of Aerb and to an extension in the previous D&D sessions of juniper he says the narrative wouldn't allow it or it would be boring. I think this highly depends on the group you are playing with and the system you use. There are even some homebrew systems like Maid RPG and i'm sure there are some that are dedicated or applicable to running a fantasy tavern with friends that can be used after you are tired of looting and plundering. This leads into 2.

*2. I guess D&D is more rigid about stuff you can do and what exactly counts as out of box thinking.*

But it seems the narrative and his previous D&D experience was to an extent about party being a Murderhobo type. We have them talk about issues and discuss roles and being in character, but at the end of the day Aerb and snippets of previous escapades lean towards kill them after identifying the problems you have with them approach. Every "enemy" or problem is mostly resolved with killing stuff, in a smart or roundabout way, but still. They are not full on murderhobos, but funnily enough they are technically hobos and they do murder a lot. System itself lead into 3.

*3. The d20, fabled natural 20*

I was under impression that physics still worked somewhat normally in D&D and the example of sickly crippled man vs. knight in super armor raise a couple of questions. The d20 results of critical successes very not misrepresented per say, but the explanation was somewhat weird for me.

For example a super strong warrior saying that he starts flapping his hands and begins to fly wouldn't prompt the DM giving him flight even he throws a 20 and at the very list all rules thrown aside would require a series of 20 for a variety of tests.

In the case of crippled guy he would not only require an aim throw of 20, but at least a strength check of 20, maybe even a vitality check so that he isn't crumpling to the ground cause his body can't take it. I'm also pretty sure the difficulty of the task affects the rolls and makes it semi to impossible to make it even with a 20 at hand. I guess grazing the cheek and not straight up murder is the result of this super successes failing, but it still kinda felt like treating d20 as something that it's not.

*4. The DM not being able to wiggle the results.*

This one seemed pretty funny since there is a system that bears name of Pendragon and if i remember correctly it actually has the exact thing that would have helped Amaryllis in their D&D game to protect her sister. It's called Passions and she would be able to make a passion roll or DM could say she should make one or gets a bonus, since she is protecting her Sister and Family could be a passion in that system.

*5. Bond Girl and creating conflict*

Again kinda ties into the whole D&D in Junipers case was more about fight action and other systems followed in similar ways. There are more narrative driven systems, but i'm sure author knows that.

The conflict or interest generated from Bond Girl syndrome serves almost no purpose in the D&D campaign and in the case of Aerb's DM (him existing or not) would loose all tension after a couple of deaths. Repetition of the same trick is kinda tires people and players or observers\readers wouldn't really care after the 5 attempt cause it would seem artificial. For all the 'rules" of narrative Aerb "follows" it certainly can hint at choosing boring\artificial ones to uphold. The Bond thing also raises the question of the DM's ability to tell a story, cause Bond Girls were more of a necessity and inability to progress the character\story with them intact. Also Bond from a movies stand point was played by different people too, would it call for Juniper changing for another protagonist who is similar and in some cases totally different?

In case of his previous D&D group the DM(Juniper) would be somewhat an asshole somewhat if he tried to create tension by killing the lover frequently or at all, cause for it to work the pair would be a real couple of players - aka real people and his friends (murder without reason mind you, they can't just say love wins all the battles). There is a little chance of someone role playing a realistic romance and even if they did that, they wouldn't exactly care about death of an NPC after a couple of times. It's like making all of the chests in the game mimics, you become desensitized and don't really care after a while, no tension just tired of the same tricks even if it's a variety of mimics.

*6. Stagnation and change, there is conflict or there is non?*

I know people are complex creatures and not everything can be solved by analyzing what someone said or did. This just seemed funny and part of it felt wrong or out of place.

Joon's thought process or things he thought about after the revelation of Fenn being thirty-three years old seemed kinda strange and didn't sit well with me. It wasn't out of character or contradictory to himself in a span of those thought, but it seemed kinda out of place with itself on a small scale. I wish i could put my finger on it, but maybe i'm just confusing myself or combining multiple different dialogs and talks into one in my head.

His assumption of her not changing in the span of 16 years, or his definition of maturity and what "adult" people do and feel, seemed okay for a panicked reaction of a 17 year old, but at the same time felt strange and like him thinking it for story reasons and not person reasons. He wanted to change and grow with her, but at the same time he didn't want her to change previously and i bet even after this. I guess there is nuance to those "changes", but it still felt like going in circles.

I'm also sure that not addressing personal problems or even thinking about them as problems or "high school level drama" and not as people being themselves, is totally healthy and not a problem onto itself (Sarcasm). But this at least is in connection with a 17 year old boy who didn't really see much of the world.

*All in all this story is a great read and i hope people will notice and disagree\agree and talk\comment about points a brought up.*
