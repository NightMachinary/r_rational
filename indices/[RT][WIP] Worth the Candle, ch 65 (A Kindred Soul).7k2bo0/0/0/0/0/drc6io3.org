That would be very interesting! I'm personally not a big fan of Grak's character; not that I overtly dislike him just that I'm so much more interested in almost any other character and their storyline. I think his personality just kinda bores me.

But I do agree that would be a /very/ interesting spin on things considering the amount of agency Joon's had so far. And the SED could also bring potential interest to such a storyline too.
