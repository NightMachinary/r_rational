Devils can take possession of normal people. Is that a danger? Possession jumping is easier when the devil's in a non-anima?

I'm getting the Yeerk vibe from devils, but if it's only explicit/declarative memory, then having enough Insight might let Joon discern a poor actor of a devil. On the other hand, if the devil also actively access implicit memories like muscle memory or conditioning, having soul magic makes it relatively easy to check for foreign souls in her body.

So soul magic can work through clothing. (Fenn's glove considered clothing or does skin-contact with invested entads make it a part of you?) Would be scary if the definition of contact isn't clear or can be changed.
