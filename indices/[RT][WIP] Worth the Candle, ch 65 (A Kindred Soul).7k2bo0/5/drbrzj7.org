thought

I was reminded of his lisp from Ch. 61

#+begin_quote
  To my surprise, I realized that he had a lisp; the ‘th' sound was coming out awkwardly, or replaced entirely by something that sounded similar. ‘Uther' had become ‘Oo-her'. I could imagine how that was a hard sound if you had to stick your tongue against pointy teeth, but couldn't remember the other elf having that problem.

How many other elves have lisps? It's not something I've ever seen mentioned before, even in passing, but idk how many elves we've seen before other than fake-Fallatehr (even as simple one-liner NPCs). Maybe lisps are common in elves since they have those ridiculous fangs, but you'd think they'd be used to them. I'm no linguist but that sounds like someone trying to keep their tongue /away/ from their teeth because they've accidentally bitten down one too many times. (acci/dental/ly huehuehue)

Maybe Fallatehr is just an outlier. Or maybe that's what happens when someone's transformed into an elf but isn't used to talking in that form.

Conjecture: We haven't met Fallatehr.

The story's awesome btw [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]!

[EDIT] Hmm. When they broke him out they got quest text including "You have retrieved Fallatehr Whiteshell" - but I've played games that lied in the quest text to preserve an in-universe fiction.
