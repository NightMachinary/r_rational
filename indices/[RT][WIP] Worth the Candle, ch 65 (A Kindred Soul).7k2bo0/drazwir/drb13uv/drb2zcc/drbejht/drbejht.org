My qualm is that updates aren't readily syndicatable. AO3 has atom feeds for canonical tags, but that's about it. I can't subscribe to a specific series or author. My workaround on that is to subscribe to a reddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search.rss?q=%5Brt%5D%5Bwip%5D+%22Worth+the+Candle%22+site:archiveofourown.org&restrict_sr=on&sort=new][search query]] for "[RT][WIP] Worth the Candle" on this subreddit, linking to AO3, and ordered by most recent post, but it hasn't exactly been reliable.
