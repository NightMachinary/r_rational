He tried that back in chapter 56. Didn't work.

  I gained a single point of loyalty from [learning dwarvish from Grak], bringing him up to 7, when I apologized if my relationship with Fenn made things awkward, but that was about as much as I got for my efforts. I'd had this idea of â€˜grinding loyalty' with him, but it didn't really pan out like that, no matter how much we talked. He had, apparently, made up his mind about me and trying to budge him wasn't easy, especially since he knew that I wanted him to be more loyal. I'd tried telling him the same thing I'd told Amaryllis, that he would become more powerful, but that didn't sway him like it had swayed her.
