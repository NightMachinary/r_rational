I read it as him disproving of twin souls. "Wow this would make it easy to bypass informed consent /frown/". Now that you mention it, it does sounds like a Fallatehr thing to think.

Perhaps thats how Fallatehr does it at first, insert minor pragmatic beliefs that align with Fallatehr. They are minor and useful so they will probably self-reinforce and stick around (as long as there isn't too much dissonance with existing beliefs). All the while making Joon easier to deal with.

Prediction: If this theory is true we will see the gang act slowly more sociopathic, pragmatic, academic, and reckless. Recklessness will help them give him openings. The other values that would help Fallatehr get along with them safely until he has the info he needs to act.
