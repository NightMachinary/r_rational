Nope. I definitely read that line and did like a mental 'double-take' and wondered if Joon was being exceptionally pragmatic and cold hearted or if this was a purposeful hint left by the author to show that Joon is in fact not alright.

My tentative theory-bunny is that perhaps Joon is compromised but Grak is /not/ and, as being the only companion not soul bonded to Joon (edit: Six Eyed Doe isn't yet but it's a doe and Fallethr also doesn't know about it yet), Fallatehr hasn't had time to compromise him in some other fashion. Grak says he tried to rouse Joon by touching him but it's also possible that Fallatehr could mess with Joon's soul in some other fashion or through touching Joon very softly, such as grasping a few strands of Joon's hair or something similar. We haven't heard Grak's side of the story (since he himself assumes that he's compromised) so we only have the nonanima's version of events and, much as I instinctively like her due to the shitty, pitiable life she's had, it's also possible she's been Fallatehr's puppet/agent from the jump. The sudden loyalty jumps are concerning to me and I feel like they may be a method that Fallatehr is using to attempt to connect her to Joon via Twinsouls (which it's possible he knows about, if he got to access Joon's soul, we can't say for sure)

Either way, due to the intelligent way this fic is written and the very real possibilty of everyone double crossing everyone and soul magic fuckery thrown into the mix...I can say I'm more than eager for seeing where [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] takes us.
