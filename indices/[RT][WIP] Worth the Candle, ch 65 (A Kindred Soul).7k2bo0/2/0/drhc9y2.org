Which would explain wh Val's loyalty is going up so fast. Nothing says the numeric representation of loyalty isnt based on both how much they trust joon abd how much joon trusts them.

I'm not convinced Val is a nonanima (i need to double check some game interface feedback on that). Regardless of whether she is a non anima I do believe she contains Fallatehr's actual soul.
