Hm, the Amaryllis partial preference ordering doesn't seem that interested in the kingdom. Maybe it's just a means to Autonomy/Power? Maybe the world needs Arthur because Amaryllis is not Best Princess?

Increasing complexity:

"Nellan" isn't the name of a (past) love interest. (An AO3 comment suggests a /parent/.)

Nellan isn't the name of a person, even though the narration in that paragraph sets us up to think of a person/concept dichotomy and then think of this list as not conceptual. Maybe a specific place?

EDIT: Oh, one more: the entity in question might no longer exist/be alive
