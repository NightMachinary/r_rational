I think this whole arc is about resetting Joon and our expectations by creating as much paranoia about the game interface as possible. The DM/Cthulhuraejepsen is setting trap after trap using assumptions based on game interface information. The DM won't lie in the game text. But he can arrange situations where we and Joon assume the wrong thing from the assembled info.

--------------

Joons gets the quest update message when he crossed the wall with Nulli. It doesn't happen when the arrow gets across.

This allows for a version of the story where Nulli is The soul mage. The name null pointer exception is the means by which he escaped the prison's detection. Coincidentally (DM is cheating) this tricks Joons companion log.

This works in my own head because it is the intersection of [[/u/Cthulhuraejepsen]]'s desire to surprise us, the DMs desire to make Joon afraid of his own conclusions (like the suits of armor), the symmetry of fallatehr actually becoming a companion, and the cost of losing solace just to get an empty shell. The remaining incongruity is the rapid increase in Nulli's loyalty. Maybe fallatehr is ratcheting up his loyalty in order to facilitate integration into the party without realizing that Joon gets immediate verbatim feedback on it. Again DM fuckery to make the whole arc joonbait.
