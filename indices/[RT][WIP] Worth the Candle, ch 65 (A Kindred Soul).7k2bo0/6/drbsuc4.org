The creeping paranoia here is filling every action the good guys take with tension, I love it.

Also, super funny how Jun's value system rates Tiff over Fenn (if I interpreted last chapter correctly), but as soon as he sees Fenn's system rating some rando over himself he gets irked.

Also also, the value system has thus far revealed a lot of potentially frightening stuff: Jun's (healthy?) obsession with leveling up, Mary basically being some sort of bred-from-birth automaton fixated on her own success above all else (above even her kingdom's propsering, which she pays lip service to as her responsibility but is apparently just a rationalization for gathering power/safety?), Fenn doing a rather exceptional job at hiding her murderous inclinations vs anyone of the elf race.

But on the bright side Juniper doesn't have to worry about figuring his companions out anymore, since he can just directly hack into their brains once they pass the loyalty threshold. I'm sure he'll use this newfound power responsibly.
