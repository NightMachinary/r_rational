So to split up the questions you really ought to be answering. Do they even want to take over? Do they have any needs? Do they have any wants? My tastes are rather odd so in your position I would make them some sort of psychic soulbased or memetic symbiote or something. I could also go for just a single vast entity toying around with a world for a little while, aka thousands of years. Not every species needs to evolve boardness to our extent after all.
