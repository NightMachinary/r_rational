  Perhaps inability to cooperate would make entities vulnerable?

I momentarily misread this and it generated a different idea - what if they're unable to /concentrate/ - like a debilitating species-wide case of ADHD?

They could be sentient and smart, and it could fill some goal of theirs to interact with the humans (siphoning power, satisfying a hunger or equivalent biological drive, or they just find it amusing), but nonetheless they don't have the attention span to devise a means of enslaving the humans as obedient hosts; instead they just flit from one mage to the next in a constant state of "You want to do what? That's /awesome/, let me fuel that for you!"

Makes for a somewhat non-human but still comprehensible nature, and strikes me as quite fey-like to not really care about the affairs of humans even while playing an active role in them. Also leave your options open for a non-typical entity to become a more active player by trying to overcome that limitation.

Although, that approach might have some knock-on effects on exactly what kind of magic it's possible to get done (anything requiring long term effects would need to be continuously cast to avoid your helpful spirit wandering off).

Could also make it difficult to do "boring" magic if that means they get distracted faster. But then, having a reason to make the magic more flashy and grandiose isn't necessarily a bad thing for a story... unless you were aiming for a tone where it's all fairly mundane and commonplace. In the latter case... idk, by authorial fiat spirits are equally fulfilled by all magic regardless of how grand it is?
