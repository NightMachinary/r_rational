Option 1: The entities are actually avatars of trans-universal scientists (or the operators of the Universe simulation, if you want to go that way) who want to work in limited ways to test aspects of this hypothetical universe.

Option 2: The entities are wildly, massively different from humans mentally, such that neither can comprehend the other, and the only similarity is their ravenous curiosity about other forms of life. They want to know how humans could learn to use magic rather than just controlling them and using it in the ways they already know.

Option 3: The entities absolutely do take control, but they find it enjoyable to be perfect mimics of their captives.
