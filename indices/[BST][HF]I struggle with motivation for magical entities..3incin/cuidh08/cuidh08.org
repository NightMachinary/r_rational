You could pull an Atlantis and have them be a constructed species created by a since-fallen civilization. Maybe they're just a straight up archival system meant to store records through any catastrophe (although that wouldn't really be the best way to do it). Maybe they were a servant race that were keyed to certain artifacts/individuals, without which they're largely unresponsive (perhaps willing to answer a few questions but not engage for too long or leave whatever locations they inhabit).

Basically with a past human civilization you can come up with a lot of reasons for them to not take over the world but still help humans. But of course you end up with more issues/exploits you need to deal with (why did Atlantis fall? what happens if someone finds the house-elf control ring?).
