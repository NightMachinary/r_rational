Off the top of my head:

a) maybe they use humans as phones? Entities are sort of locked in place (gives you an excuse for different areas to have primarily one type of magic), so they use people for communication. They give a mage a spell, and/or a quest, and use leftover room to carry info to other Entities.

B) Maybe they use people for reproduction, like flowers and bees. The more mages there are, the better their population.

C) Another way you could do this is make the Entities distributed infomorphs. to have them use mages like a torrenting service, where the entities are torrents. Every mage they teach a spell to carries a seed of their existence. As long as one is around, they're immortal. I imagine that when warring against one another, they have their mages target the competition.
