A variation on your idea: the world from The Last Ringbearer. There is a magic world, where the magical entities live and their entering the "real" world is very limited. There are artifacts in the real world that allow their owners to make it easier.

This is a complicated setup, but it can be explained by having the creator of the world try to engineer a balance between the "real" and "magical" worlds.
