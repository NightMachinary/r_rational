I kinda enjoy for them to have some agenda. Somewhat similar to warlocks in DnD. Bored omnipotent entities aren't very exciting, it's hard for intelligent character to get more value out of interacting with them.

Needs and wants are similar in general sense, aren't them? I am thinking that they like to exist (and possibly reproduce), and they may need interaction with mages to syphon some power (which they lack). But I fear the resulting society would be dominated by entities, which would breed obedient hosts. Would "common" mages be able to stop enemies vastly superior in technique and immensely clever strategically to boot? Perhaps inability to cooperate would make entities vulnerable?
