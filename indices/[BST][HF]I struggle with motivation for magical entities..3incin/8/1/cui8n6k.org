If I'm understanding your approach correctly, it won't work that well. You certainly can move surface air, but you'll need immense volumes and speed. Making jet enjines is probably easier, and even those require a lot of energy, especially without extra gas volume provided by fuel.

And we're talking from 20th century scientific knowledge. It's much more difficult for medieval person, enough to make flight skill very uncommon outside of Great Mage Community. Which wouldn't be the case if you could just move your boots up in the air.
