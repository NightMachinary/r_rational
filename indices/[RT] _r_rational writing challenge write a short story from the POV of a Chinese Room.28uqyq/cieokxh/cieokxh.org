I'm having trouble understanding how that story would even be structured. If you're doing it from the full perspective of the Chinese room, it only really has one input and one output. So the entire story would have to be told entirely through dialog, which can sometimes work but tends to be very hard to write - and if you're in all dialog, you can't really convey POV. I think maybe you'd have to alter the concept of the Chinese room so that there's additional inputs of some kind, like an internal clock, or a sensor that allows the Chinese room to "know" that someone is in front of it.

I will probably try my hand at it, unless someone else steps up.
