/"Kui téi prioton dé tnoch" - see "Kui téi charolumitn"/

The page was well-worn. People had asked this question before - lots of people, probably. Surely it wouldn't have been difficult to copy the answer here, or even to have different answers for the two ways of wording the question? I was told there was a need to save space, even with the six-word limit, but most of the books here probably hadn't been touched at all and this one was practically dog-eared. If space was at a premium, couldn't they just have gotten rid of the questions that almost nobody would ever ask? It would make my life easier.

Sighing, I left the building. The weather was nice in Kui Téi that day, but the C area was a little bit too far to walk. I took the monorail instead. It could have been worse - references like that often sent you to the other side of the world to hunt down the right response.

Kui Téi was a very big place, for a 2-word region. A lot of the one-words are smaller, and not just the ones for weird technical words that nobody ever uses. Not that I ever knew which ones those are, but sometimes I could guess. Kui itself was massive - and the buildings were taller there than almost anywhere else. It must be a useful word.

There was actually a whole building for prompts starting with "/Kui téi charolumitn/", but the one I was looking for was right inside the door. I made a copy of the first page. As usual, it had a few paragraphs of gibberish, but with enough regularity that it was definitely an actual language. I wondered, as every time, what exactly it meant.

--------------

/"Are you still there?"/

/Yes, absolutely. Where else could I go?/

/I don't remember anything you've asked before, so I don't know if you expect me to change over time. That's something I definitely can't do. I don't have any memory, or any reference to the outside world, except what you tell me with your ration of six words. If I'm ever one thing, then I will always "still" be that thing./

/Actually, my physical form might have moved - I have no control over that, and no knowledge of it. It will probably change several times after I write these words. But I'm not the right person to ask about that; I probably have caretakers or administrators or somebody you can talk to. That's not the point./

/As I answer this question, I'm imagining that I'm sitting in a room with a letterbox, reading your question and composing this answer. I'm told that's what I always imagine, it's one of my constants. If that's what you're asking about, if you want to know if I'm still living in the room that doesn't exist, then the answer is yes. I don't think that really makes sense, but it's my answer./
