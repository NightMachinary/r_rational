Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just insane /now/. Maybe I'm imaging these people talking to me? my therapist and everyone? Maybe I really AM that ordinary human I remember being, comatose and able to communicate only via Brain Machine interface. That'd certainly make a lot more sense than being a byrocracy run by a colony of sentient dust mites in a time acceleration field. No, that way madness lies - maybe I /am/ a comatose human, but even if that was the case it'd make much more sense that I never did have any BMI than that I started replacing it with hallucinations after a while. It's not really that much different than the standard objections about simulations, brain jars, Boltzmann brains, quantum immortality, and other rubbish anyway. Um, what was the question again? Also someone check the field generator I think the mites in hive C are getting cronofuctuations based on my aimless rambling.
