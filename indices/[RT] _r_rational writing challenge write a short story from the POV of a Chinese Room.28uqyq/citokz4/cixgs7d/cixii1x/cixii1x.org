Thank you.

Wow, Searle's responses to his critics were painful to read.

In the original expirement Searle is acting as a motor neurone, and in the pipe experiment he's acting as the laws of physics and chemistry and the proteins in the neurones which allow Na+ and K+ ions to move around at the right time, /so of course he wouldn't be the mind, in neither experiment is he the brain/.

And that whole thing about "A perfect simulation of a brain isn't a brain because... Uh... Chemicals?" when the reply made it perfectly clear that the chemical properties were a part of the perfect simulation.

Just... Ugh...
