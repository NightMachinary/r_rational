I woke up and said good morning to my mother. Then I brushed my teeth and made some toast and coffee. I ate the toast dry, without butter - gotta watch that cholesterol. Then I went to work.

At my job, I get this little tape. Based on what is already on the tape, and a little book of instructions which I carry, I have to alter the symbols on the tape. It's supposed to be part of some grand simulation project...some sort of theoretical physics thing. Everyone has a different notebook. They're trying to find the set of rules which describes our universe. Sometimes, I wonder what sort of universe my notebook simulates... I don't think about it much though. It doesn't effect my job. The whole process takes so long that I'll be long dead before it's finished, anyway.

I sigh and pulled out the little pocket notebook, ready to start the work day."
