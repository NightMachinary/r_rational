There's a lot of good theory, but art is mostly practice. Art schools know this, so the good ones are all focused on making people crank out gigantic portfolios, because the process of doing that involves getting the practice. The best artists I know all got involved in some additional source of practice on top of that. Some examples are attending figure drawing sessions, inktober, the 24 hour comic challenge, and posting on oekaki boards.

Focus on getting fast first, then focus on getting good. Figure drawing from a photo reference is a great start. I think oekaki is the best format for raw volume, but they tend to be focused on anime, and realism really is a better style for practice (even if you were trying to draw anime in the end). If you can find something like an oekaki board that focuses on figure drawing, that'd be perfect.

And enough theory to copy your fave:

Lighting - Direct lighting is when light goes from a light source, bounces off the object, then heads towards your eyes. How bright it is depends on the angle formed between you, the object, and the light, versus the angle of the surface at the point the light bounced off (you can learn the math from a computer rendering textbook, or draw fruit until you get it). For everything not in direct lighting, you can mostly ignore the angle and figure out how many bounces it'd take light to get there from somewhere directly lit. A lot of artists approximate that by pretending indirect light can wrap around corners.

Color theory - I recommend looking up the LCH color space, it's better than the standard color wheel. You can emphasize things the most with contrasting brightness (which can be tricky because it needs lighting to justify it). You can emphasize second most by making the hues very different. You can also emphasize by increasing the chroma (saturation) of a color. All of these can be done by doing the opposite to everything else, and this is especially effective for chroma (desaturate everything you don't want to emphasize).

Composition - Is a big topic, but your fave is mostly using the rule of thirds plus a defined foreground/background/middleground.
