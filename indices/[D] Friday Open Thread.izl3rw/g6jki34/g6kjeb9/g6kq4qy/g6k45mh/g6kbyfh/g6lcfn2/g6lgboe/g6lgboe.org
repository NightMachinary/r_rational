Haven't gotten to the ending again yet, but early stuff like the first fake Philosopher's Stone, Nina etc get more time and more depth and detail than in Brotherhood. And I get not wanting to just tell the same arcs over again, but since Brotherhood does go back to the start those arcs are supposed to stand on their own. And in comparison, they just don't.

If I recall correctly the manga ending simply wasn't finished when the first anime completed, so they went off and improvised. I would agree Brotherhood has a more complete ending. I shall have to see which one I prefer when I get to the original's ending again.
