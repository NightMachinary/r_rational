Just finished it. Not a big fan of the gate taking Ed & dad to England, but other than that it was good. The true mastermind behind the philosopher's stone production and the homunculi I felt were handled well. Also just really like the look of the underground city. Will rewatch Brotherhood next and see if I still prefer the original after that.
