I accept the challenge. Why do you think it is better? Personally the story in brotherhood seemed to wrap up nicely and had a good climax and everything was foreshadowed. The original's ending seemed really weird. It's been a long time since I watched it but was it the case when you die you get reincarnated in another world or you just have to pass the gate? Either way I thought that came out of nowhere.
