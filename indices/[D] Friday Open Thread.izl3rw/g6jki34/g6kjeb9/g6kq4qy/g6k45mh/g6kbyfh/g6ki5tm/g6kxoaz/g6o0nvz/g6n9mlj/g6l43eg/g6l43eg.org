I know exactly what you mean. It's actually gotten me into (some definition of) trouble--I tend to find incredible people, fall head over heels for them, and enter emotionally serious relationships despite external factors that might lead others to be more cautious.

My sister and I had a conversation that I took to heart while I was dating my last-but-one girlfriend, who I had planned on bringing home to meet the family. She asked me if I didn't think it was unfair to my mother and grandparents to keep introducing them to women who I knew I probably wasn't going to be with forever, and if I didn't think it might cheapen what should be a pretty significant step. She was right--I didn't plan on being with last-but-one forever, and my grandparents want great-grandbabies so badly that it's cruel to dangle false hope in front of them. But my takeaway wasn't "stop dating so many women seriously," it was "don't bring women home to the family so soon." I really like emotional connection, physical & intellectual companionship, and getting to know a person that deeply, and (COVID dating issues aside) I don't plan on not doing that in the future. But I think little sis was right that, if I plan on operating like this, I need to push that particular milestone back a few notches on the relationship meter.

I think the moral of the story here, not to toot my own horn, is that smart, honest, open people tend to find others in the same vein. [[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/opinion/how-to-cultivate-the-art-of-serendipity.html][This article about serendipity]] has resonated with me since I first read it (and how cool is it that that word comes from a fairy tale?)

Congrats on your new beau, and enjoy your periphescence.
