In most people's lives there is no room for rationality.

The majority of our choices are dictated by our material conditions in a way that limits our ability to have free will and self determination.

Most of our lives goes towards dealings with capitalism which is highly rational but aliens in the way of a paperclip maximizer.

The rest we deal with other people who have a specfic respect for irrationally as a goal.

The number of times a week anyone would have the power to make a meaningful choice, and then have one of those options being a rationally good one is minimal.
