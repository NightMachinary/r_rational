I don't think it's wrong to try to be more open when searching, certainly if you are so heavily focussed on personality then swiping based on appearance is not a good place to start, but I guess you can be racist by excluding people like you're suggesting and it's good to recognise our biases and the such.

There's also the power dynamics where Easterners expect all white partners to be rich and again vice versa.
