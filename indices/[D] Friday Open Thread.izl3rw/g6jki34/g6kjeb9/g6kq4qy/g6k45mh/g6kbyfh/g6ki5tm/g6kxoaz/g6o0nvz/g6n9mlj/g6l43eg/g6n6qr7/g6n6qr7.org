I wonder how much or if it at all this has to do with that in terms of cishet interaction it's much more of a two way street than it has been for a long time.

If we're talking about the period of time from when women were able to choose their partners (so quite recently) to now I'd imagine the dating pool has only really improved as traditional perspectives disappear more and more. In general I'd expect the more open and communicative approach of modern society to work better

In addition perhaps the way we search has improved, modern matching algorithms seem to be able to recommend youtube videos, I'm sure they could cut some chaff out of dating pools
