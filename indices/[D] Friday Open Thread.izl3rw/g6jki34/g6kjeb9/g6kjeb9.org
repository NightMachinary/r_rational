Does anyone remember a story called something like "Bugs in the System" or something similar? About emulated humans who're being looped without their knowedge/consent, so that they can handle support tickets at a software company or something like that. The short loops keep people from realizing that they never go home at the end of the day. Some of them are looped for longer, because they have long-term tasks, but are cooped up in a research bunker. I thought it was qntm's, but I can't find it on the qntm site.
