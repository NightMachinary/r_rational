Getting to the level of the pic you linked will take years if not decades of dedicated practice. My main recommendation is just to start drawing stuff--trees, your hand, pictures of people, objects around te house--but since you say you need some structure, check out [[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-drawing-course-beginner-to-advanced/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=GraphicDesign_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.US_ti.6020&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_83365030281_._ad_436603254907_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930040689_._li_1023402_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8MjdgtKE7AIVjLbICh1fWA3xEAAYAiAAEgInfPD_BwE][Udemy's drawing course]] or one of what I'm sure are dozens of other online classes.

I'm aso fairly sure that the Jagnic image you linked is a digital painting, so maybe invest in a drawing tablet or e-pen as well.

I can't say I identify with your hobby burnout, but I'm probably happier in isolation than the vast majority of people. As a single guy, having this much free time is pretty fantastic for me--I've been reading, running/working out, playing D&D, and watching movies more than at any other time in my life. I also picked up guitar as a quarantine hobby. I'm not very good, but I find making music to be extremely rewarding even if it still sounds pretty amateurish. It's also a combined mental/physical exercise in a way that I'm not at all used to, which is a nice challenge. I feel that drawing falls in the same umbrella of "activities that engage your hands and your brain," so it might have a similarly therapeutic effect for you.

Congrats on the masters program! I was set to start mine this month, but deferred a semester. Will be starting in January. I'm not looking forward to what will certainly be at least mostly online courses, but I'll get through it & hopefully have a more traditional grad school experience for part of the program.
