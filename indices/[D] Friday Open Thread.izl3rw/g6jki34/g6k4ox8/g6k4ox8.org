Many people like [[https://drawabox.com/][Drawabox]], it's quite solid for studying fundamentals of traditional (i.e., not digital) drawing. Also, it is very structured.

In general, the study process is 5% learning theory, 95% practicing, so it doesn't /really/ matter how rigorous is your approach. Sure, you need to know perspective, volume, color theory, and many other things to draw on the level you'd /find tolerable/, but they mostly come from drawing a lot, not from following some sort of a course.

On a positive note, drawing is like riding a bike: once you have a solid grasp on some aspects of it, you'll be able to maintain your level even if you take a year-long break.
