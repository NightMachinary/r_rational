How? Unless you want to claim that the entire field of behavioral economics as well as university textbooks like Bazerman & Moore's [[http://www.amazon.com/Judgment-Managerial-Decision-Making-Bazerman/dp/0470049456/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321928423&linkCode=as2&tag=lesswrong-20][/Judgment in Managerial Decision Making/]]/, Gilboa's/ [[http://www.amazon.com/Making-Better-Decisions-Decision-Practice/dp/1444336525/?tag=vglnk-c319-20][Making Better Decisions: Decision Theory in Practice]] and Hastie & Dawes' [[http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Choice-Uncertain-World-Psychology/dp/1412959039/?tag=vglnk-c319-20][Rational Choice in an Uncertain World]] are somehow unscientific I don't see how anyone could claim that overcoming cognitive biases isn't good for you.

Also, unless you want to make yourself look like an idiot you probably shouldn't link a comic strip that claims that there is no scientific evidence for scientific inquiry being better at converging on correct consensuses in terms of beliefs and optimal decisions than emotional intuitions as if it supports your argument.
