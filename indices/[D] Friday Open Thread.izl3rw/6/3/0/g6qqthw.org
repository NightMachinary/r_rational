When you say "all of this", what "this" are you talking about? Finding eligible partners?

I think technology has definitely helped with the search/etc but also, yeah, I wouldn't want to be transported into the 1960s and not be able to do the stuff I like doing in dating (like, y'know, polyamory or being EXTREMELY forward with men - my "line", if you can call it that, to get someone into the bedroom is literally "do you want to go to the bedroom and see what happens?", which according to a friend of mine is not so much a line but a blatant invitation to have sex).

I don't know if searching has improved. OKCupid is great because you match according to questions, but tinder is the most popular in my area and you have only a photo and a short profile to judge by, and there are just so much fewer people on OKC now. I've moved to feeld because it's easier to find non-mono people there, but it's also, like, full of people looking for one time things / FWBs / unicorns and I'm like, can't we have a long term committed relationship but only see each other once or twice a month, lol?
