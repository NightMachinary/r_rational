I definitely think it's different, for me at least, as I find myself attracted to men of colour in the media but less likely to swipe them on apps. I am also attracted 98% to personality and 2% to appearance, so by swiping right on men of colour I can ensure that those with suitable personalities have a chance to dazzle me with their pickup lines.
