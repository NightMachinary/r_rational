The thing is I have so many partners now (husband, boyfriend, 2 pieces on the side, 2 permanent LDRs) that I'm being extremely fussy with what I'm looking for. Like, when I just had my husband and LDRs, the modal chubby geeky guy would for sure get a look in because that's 100% my preferred type, but now I'm like, you also need one or more of (queer / vegan / probably other things idk).

That said, because I know I'm subconsciously racist (only ever dated white guys despite living in a multicultural city), I do have a policy of swiping right on any men of colour I see. Not sending a message first or going on dates or anything, just swiping right, to give them a little bit of a leg up. I would encourage other straight women to do the same, since the opportunity cost of doing so is potentially getting another "hey" "hows ur week" message that all the guys you're swiping right to /anyway/ are sending. According to a sri lankan friend of mine, dating on swiping apps as a man of colour is really, really depressing. (I knew a woman from Saudi Arabia who had it worse, she had basically worked out how to "flee" to Australia for school by pretending to her parents that she was a good muslim (she was an atheist), and most of the Australian men who messaged her were looking for a "submissive" "traditional" type of woman).

Tinder doesn't let you filter by anything except gender, and the info it shows is age, occupation, and the free text field. It's fine but more if you want mindless swiping than if you're looking for something specific. Feeld is more or less the same but it's got more genders you can search by, and you can search for couples (that said in my city, restricting my search to MM couples who are interested in women comes up with nothing, so that sucks (my dream would be to date such a couple!); I tried grindr which is actually technically okay with straight cis women being on there, and although I was bombarded with messages, they were... uh, too thirsty for me).

Anyway in short my life is great. I find dating interesting and fun, but I also worry I'm spreading myself a touch too thin at the moment. But hey, if I can't slut around a bit in my early 30s then what's the point?
