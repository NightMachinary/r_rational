I use dating apps, mostly. OKCupid is my favourite, but I've got some decent prospects on tinder and just last night stayed up texting someone on feeld. OKC has gotten worse the past few years, I guess tinder is eating their lunch :(

I don't know how small your area is, but if you find you have problems with dating apps then yeah, you gotta do things IRL, you're kind of forced.

That said I've used dating apps in:

- Paris, which was a whole different experience because there's effectively an infinite supply of people

- My home city, which has about 2 million people in its greater metro area. No problems whatsoever

- A big country town, with about 400,000 people in its greater metro area. This was in 2012 so before the heydey of tinder and the like, but I remember having much lower standards on OKCupid. My boyfriend there I met through roller derby, though I did go on a date with a guy from OKC who remains a good friend to this day (we didn't click in a romantic way).

My strategy as a straight woman is very different to what I'd advise straight men to use (eg: the guy who I'm seeing tonight, I picked him up by standard flirting when we met and then when I ran into him at a party a few months later, I just straight up asked him to go home with me), so I don't have advice beyond the tired "go out and meet people!" and "have basic personal hygiene".
