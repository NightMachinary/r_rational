Dating seriously again has astonished me.

Like, I seem to very quickly find people I consider "perfect" and am able to be in stable relationships. Perfect in terms of similar values, sex stuff, finding each other attractive, etc. And I mean /very/ quickly - within 6 days of a major breakup I'd been on a first date with someone who, although it's early days, is definitely a "long termer".

I have been on two other first dates, both of whom have turned out to be more suitable to casual dating, which is fine as I don't want too many serious things going on at once.

I'm completely astonished that Mr Long Termer is, well, so great, because there's probably nothing particularly special about us our our relationship, we're just two random people who happened to go on a date at the right time. I'm sure in the past 7 years I stepped back from dating I could have had dates with 10 people who were just as great as him, and I'm sure that there's probably 5 equally good men I could have dated in the past three months and been just as happy with.

FWIW, due to the unequal dynamic of cishet dating, people might be saying "well it's easy for you as the sort of woman who hangs out on [[/r/rational]], you no doubt have the pick of all the greatest nerds!" and to that I say, Mr Long Termer says that 2 of the 7 people he's gone on dates with in the past ~9 months have been long termers, and he's an overweight nerdy 30 year old man with 2 kids. He's not some chad.

Isn't this... amazing?? Like, people put so much pressure on themselves to find "the one", but, polyamory aside, there's... so many Ones out there!

And yes, two months into a relationship I'm waxing lyrical about "the one" - yes I know what new relationship energy is and yes I know I'm still steeped in it and yes I know I might look at this post in a year and cringe. But I'm old, I've been around the block a bit, so I do know this is a good thing we've got going.

EDIT: update, since writing this post I matched with someone on Feeld and am now, against all my better judgements, considering trying to make room in my schedule for him because we spent 90 minutes texting when I should have been asleep. DATING IS AWESOME.
