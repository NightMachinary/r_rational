You don't need a study to tell if your life is improved by doing something, because you should presumably be able to judge it for yourself. It's hard to be wrong about how you feel about your life, not like someone can tell you that you're actually having a worse time when you feel otherwise.

In addition logic can be used to derive things you don't need a study to work from axioms.

Still I'm sure having an experiment some people wake themselves up by punching themselves in the face every morning would provide helpful information even if it's obviously not an improvement
