Keep up the hard work on the masters, that's awesome!

While my largest source of stress from the quarantine is definitely a reduction in social interaction I've also caught 3 other major factors for me.

It made a lot of my healthy habits much less automatic and hurt my motivation for them. I'm a runner so losing my long run group and having no races to train for has been awful. I don't actually care about my race results, I just enjoy getting better at them as a way of getting healthier. It made my fitness go from sticking to a training plan in order to survive the upcoming race and getting myself to the long run group to doing /pointless/ training and making myself do the long run with my own logistics and willpower. You wouldn't be surprised how well that's working.

It has also made my schedule very easy to disrupt. Without events and friends to meet up with work is my only hard scheduled thing. This let's me slack off on planning, procrastinate, and avoid things I want done but don't want to do.

Lastly I've replaced a lot of my hobbies with much worse things, the worst of which is politics for me. It's opening a fire hydrant of objectively stressful and useless information. I've finally realized it but I'm torn between my drive to adhere to the categorical imperative and keep engaged vs utilitarianism to shut it off due to negligible positives at personal cost. I've also generally replaced social time with computer time, which isn't good even before that got consumed by garbage.

On a positive note the first step to improving things is identifying them, so hopefully my problems help people here too!
