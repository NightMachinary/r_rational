The most important part of developing art skills is simply practice. Spend some time drawing every day, even if it sucks. If there's some aspect of your art that you're able to single out as needing improvement, feel free to look up techniques and tutorials, but don't forget to spend time actually putting pen to paper (or stylus to tablet).

A hugely overlooked aspect to skill development is how much contribution the unconscious parts of your brain contribute. By focusing on it regularly, you'll start to see improvement as your brain progresses as you sleep and as you develop the dexterity and muscle memory to match.
