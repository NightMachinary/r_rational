I would like to learn how to draw. I want to learn how to draw very realistic fantasy settings like [[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/OOzLb][Tomislav Jagnic does]], I dont quite know what to call this art style. As someone with the artistic talents of a five year old does anyone know where I can start to learn? I've discovered I need structure for my learning, as I attempted to teach myself piano but could not do it successfully til I signed up for an online piano course.

I've been feeling pretty burnt out on my hobbies due to quarantine restricting my more social ones like dancing, working out, and rock climbing. I feel all stretched and thin . It seems to me that my hobbies that I can do are less relaxing than they used to be due to all of this stress from all this social distancing. Is anyone else feeling this way?

On a more positive note, I finally started reading Mother of Learning and am enjoying it very much. Additionally I started a masters program and am maintaining an A average in all of my classes.
