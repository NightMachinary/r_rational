Ok, see, now I feel like this concept needs to be parodied. Ruthlessly. /With ponies/.

The Great and Powerful Trixie decides to cast the entirety of Equestria into a Lotus Eating Bliss with some lost artifact or another -- because there's just too much fighting and pain in the world (by which we mean, because Trixie found out Twilight Sparkle became an alicorn princess and is jealous). Someone-or-other has to go out and stop her.

It would just be /funny/ to read about some character /so incredibly emo-kid/ that they feel a need to go Lotus Lord on a sugar-bowl setting.

EDIT: Obviously the lost artifact should be called the Black Lotus.
