I'm pretty sure the writer's weren't actually making a statement about communism or socialism in any capacity. It was more about cults, ideas that seem nice on the surface, and stagnancy, with the lesson that diversity is good and people having skills is a good thing. I don't think even hardcore communism advocates not putting skilled people to good use.
