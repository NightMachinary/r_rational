I just kinda feel like a Manson-mixed-with-straw-Communism was face-palmingly bad. Like, it's a moral lesson for children, designed to address something that the writers' society saw as big and terrible and threatening /decades ago/, but which today is viewed as a dead piece of history.

We don't /have/ cults living on communes droning on about how individuality makes life terrible or about how sameness is equality. Nobody does that. Use your kids'-show villains to teach lessons about threats the kids will actually face!
