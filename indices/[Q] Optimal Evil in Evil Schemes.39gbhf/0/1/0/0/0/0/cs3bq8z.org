That and it's not really an AI so much as it is a dumb magical happy machine that's sole purpose is to keep the mind happy and occupied while the body is a rock. Bit of a semantics issue, but the magic would more or less turn on the happy leaving the brain to figure out its new reality. Not that its nailed down, as I roll over pretty easily in these kind of discussions, but it's what I intended to go with to try and avoid "Why doesn't the Magical Computer do this instead" question.
