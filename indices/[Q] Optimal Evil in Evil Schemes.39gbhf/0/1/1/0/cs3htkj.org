  I hope you are not claiming that you have a proof that makes a particular philosophy the only one correct.

Uhhhhh....

- I don't see why I or anyone else should deliberately create "essentially heaven" rather than "actually heaven". If you can still come up with objections and uncomfortable nastiness in the background (such as, say, omnicide), then you still got it wrong.

- If we're talking about the same thing, you can have all the free will you want in that scenario. It'll be the free will of a small child on a playground, a free will without the contact with a larger, more global, more entangled reality necessary to make it properly meaningful, but it'll be free in the sense that nobody is actually compelling or even much manipulating your choices. You're just only getting options you're pre-guaranteed to like, to the point that it's solipsistic bullshit.

- Why not find or invent a Third Option to take rather than trying to make blatantly apologia-flavored arguments for an omnicidal robot (and/or magical girl. Context of "what [[/u/alexanderwales]] was referring to" is not clear)?
