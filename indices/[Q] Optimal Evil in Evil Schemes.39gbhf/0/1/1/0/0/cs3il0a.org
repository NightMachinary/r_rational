  I don't see why I or anyone else should deliberately create "essentially heaven" rather than "actually heaven"
#+end_quote

Because the difference is so minimal i really don't see why to bother. The main issue with the mentioned state is that people will be forced into it, if you have or don't have "free will" while inside is irrelevant because in such a situation you are effectively brain dead, in the sense that you will not bother doing anything even if you could.

  Why not find or invent a Third Option to take rather than trying to make blatantly apologia-flavored arguments for an omnicidal robot?
#+end_quote

Is this pointed at the author or the character? If the author then its asking for a different story where i don't really see a big issue with the suggested approach, or at least that particular part of it.

If the character then why invent a third option? the time spent on inventing a newer better spell is suffering\pain\death of more people which supposedly is something which you want to avoid. For it to be better to try and make a better spell you need to reach the conclusion that the net negative over this time is greater then the net negative for that one time ignoring people's wishes to place them in "heaven".
