Assuming you are talking about the version [[/u/alexanderwales]] mentioned i don't really see any personal reason to object to it. The only part which is questionable about it is the fact that it is forced, but really how could it be claimed that the free will aspect makes it bad when the positive side is so great? i mean this is essentially heaven for the small price of free will. In plenty of philosophies that would still count as "good", which I think is what [[/u/alexanderwales]] was saying essentially, not everyone will agree with it but it really depends on the person's philosophy. And I hope you are not claiming that you have a proof that makes a particular philosophy the only one correct.
