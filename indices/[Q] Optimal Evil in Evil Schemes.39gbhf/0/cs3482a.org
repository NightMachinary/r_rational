Good vs. Good is almost always more compelling.

My suggestion would be to have the Lotus Eater megaspell be perfect. You want the reader to /almost/ feel some sympathy for the villain, especially if they're a known character who already has some sympathy. The petrification is terrifying, until it's revealed that the person that's petrified is living a life of bliss, and then it's just unsettling. (My personal suggestion, knowing nothing about the magic, is that you can play up your themes by having someone become unpetrified and /beg/ to go back to the life they'd had as a person of stone.)

The question then becomes one of free will, consent, and the nature of what's real, all of which are good things for a protagonist and antagonist to be fighting over, because there's not really a right answer. Introducing flaws to the petrification is just putting your thumb on the scale, and there's not really a need to do that.
