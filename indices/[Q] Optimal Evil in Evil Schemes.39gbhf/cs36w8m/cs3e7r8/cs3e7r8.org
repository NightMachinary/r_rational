I agree with all of this.

Consider a group of people turned to stone will live indefinitely (especially if the magic can be altered to ensure it). So there will be no death or disease any longer. There is no real need to have people's fantasies isolated from each other either. So the character that cast this spell can do so from some very good motives.

Those who want to stop them must do so because they believe that free choices that change the real world are better than living a false life. More importantly, they have to defend this even though people are dying, sick or violent.

If anything, I think that the job of the heroes is actually a lot harder. After all, the villain is really offering a critique of current society and the hero. Their claim is that the hero is really only interested in preserving the status quo and that they are the real hero instead. The "hero" is really just a punch-clock villain ready to defend their ordinary lives. So the hero needs to show that this critique is either wrong OR they need accept it and change their behavior.
