Yeah, that isolation aspect is why the wrinkle that I'm currently looking at, either through the spell forcing the brain into doing the heavy lifting on entertaining itself, putting them into an altered state of mind, or doing what another redditor suggested where they're preferences are altered to enjoy isolation or are made ultra sensitive to reality. I wouldn't put it past the villain to get tunnel vision either, maybe valuing conflict-avoidance over the lives she's saving if she gets cornered and afraid, then send every mind to their rooms without supper. But again, speculation. I learned a lot here, will get back with y'all if anything comes of it.
