A variant on the above for you -- this is an idea that I came up with for Team Anko, but feel free to use it.

Two or more groups, all of whom have access to the same information but interpret it differently. Maybe there's a spell that will Lotus Eater the planet and it can only be used when the stars align for five minutes once every century, the way they will next Thursday.

One group believes that the spell will create a separate lotus world for each person, therefore everything people do will be pointless because it will be solipsistic. The other group believes that the spell will put everyone in a mutually shared lotus world where experiences are just as valid as in the real world because they are shared.

Both groups have all the information, and it all supports either view, No one is being reckless or stupid; they are all very smart, have put in lots of time and effort on research, have done whatever experiments are possible, and they are confident that their version is true.

I can come up with other interpretations that would support three or more groups as well, so you might put that in the hopper.

EDIT: I should add that the idea for Team Anko isn't explicitly this Lotus World thing, just that it has the "both sides could easily be right" bit.
