  Lots of bad people in real life, for example, justify their actions using blatantly self-serving rationalizations, or even vast, rationalized philosophical systems designed to justify the statement that there's not really any such thing as right-and-wrong, and other people are just being delusionally irrational for having morality in the first place.

They still don't consider themselves to be an evil villain, they just dismiss the entire notion of "evil villain". Granted, they don't consider themselves to be "good" either, so it's hardly a "good versus good" story.

At worst, people can recognise that history will hate them, that they're breaking the law, that they were placed in a shitty situation with no acceptable "right answer", or that their actions are evil by a standard of morality which they consider na√Øve and idealistic.

But I think a negligible minority of people in real life would consider themselves the Bad Guy in their own story. (Ignoring depressive misanthropes who think they're bad people but aren't actually.)

  There's also the fact that readers will sympathize at least a little with any character portrayed as sufficiently /awesome/ , no matter their moral alignment.

Excellent point! I hadn't considered that, but it's perfectly true. Villains can have style and class and still be compelling - even /likeable/ - characters, and their moral standing need not enter into it.

  I just don't think that this necessarily means the villain must believe themselves to be /good/, in the sense that an outside reader would recognize as good.

A good character, what we call a Level 1 intelligent character, needs to do what a real person would do in the same circumstances - meaning, what a real person with that character's experiences, personality, skills, etc. would do. If the story is not completely fantastical, then a few readers will empathise with the villain's traits. Some readers have lost loved ones, or have a sociopathic streak, or have had their dream crushed by an unfeeling universe, or at least they /can imagine what that would be like/. And such a reader will look at the villain's actions and say "Yes, that's what I'd do". You're right, the reader in question might recognise that such a decision would be wrong, or Evil.

It would be a fairly small proportion of readers who would sympathise with the villain to that degree, and an even smaller subset who would refuse to accept them as the villain and post "AKEMI HOMUCIFER DID NOTHING WRONG" on the message boards. But they should exist if the villain is a well-written Level 1 character and the work has a large enough fanbase. Their existence doesn't make the story good, but they're an unintended and hard-to-avoid side effect of a well-written villain.
