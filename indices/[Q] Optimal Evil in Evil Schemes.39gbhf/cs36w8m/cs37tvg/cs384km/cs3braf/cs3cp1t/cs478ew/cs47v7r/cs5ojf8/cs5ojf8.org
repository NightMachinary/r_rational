I was expecting you'd object to Skitter too, since despite being a self-confessed supervillain she's one of the most sympathetic characters in the setting.

The problem I see with having obvious "good" and "evil" sides are that any remotely rational villain will recognise that they are on the wrong side. The "evil" side has to at least look good from the inside. That way, the villain can be smart and reasonable, but when they critically examine their own side they find their cause is just. (It's different if the villain's character isn't meant to stand up to scrutiny - if the work is more lighthearted, or the villain is only ever in the distant background, or if they're deliberately characterised as powerful but not self-aware.)

When some people agree with the villain's ideology and/or his methods, then you know their position could convince a reasonable person - or, at the very least, a realistic one. Making the villain /more/ sympathetic than the hero is a mistake, usually one relegated to heavy-handed moral lessons. But the reader should at least be able to understand why the villain wants the things he wants.
