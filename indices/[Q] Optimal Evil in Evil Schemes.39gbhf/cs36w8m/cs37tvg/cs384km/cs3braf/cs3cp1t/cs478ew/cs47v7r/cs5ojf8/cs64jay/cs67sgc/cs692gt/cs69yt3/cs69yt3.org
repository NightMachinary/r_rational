I think you're right! Thanks for clarifying my own position to me, and I say that with complete sincerity.

I really just wanted to discuss how some villains attract apologists. Sometimes it's an intentional interpretation of the story (like you said, Ozymandias is an antagonist but may or may not be a force for good), sometimes it's reasonable but goes further than the author expected, sometimes it's just silly. But I think this distinction between Inside View and Outside View is a key part of it.

As you've surmised, I have the two perspectives the other way around: I consider your Outside View the ambiguous and subjective view, while the Inside View is the definite and objective one. To put it another way, "X is a good person" is a subjective statement, while "X considers themself to be a good person" is an objective one. Arguing about the Outside View is almost sure to devolve into semantics and arguments about absolute morality or the lack thereof.

I don't actually know anything about /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/, I was just repeating what you said.
