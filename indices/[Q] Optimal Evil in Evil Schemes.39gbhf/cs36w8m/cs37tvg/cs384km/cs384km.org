  Or is it being "evil" in pursuit of some idea that most other people agree with?

Well, I think that's just called being ruthless in pursuit of a cause, and it's been done by self-proclaimed Good Guys since ever.

  Is ideological evil just following some ideology that someone else has declared to be evil?
#+end_quote

I think I would phrase Ideological Evil as, "believes in his/her capital-I Ideology more thoroughly, with greater normative weight in terms of deciding his/her actions, than in what the audience will recognize as commonsense morality."

Ends of spectrum: unpopular public policy (mere I Did What I Had To) ... Nazis (Ideological Evil to the nth degree). And I really mean it about the Nazis: they were the ones who mis-paraphrased Nietzsche to claim that Jews invented morality to enslave the stronger races. An Ideological Evil character believes that morality, as a category or concept, /should/ be discarded, and gives their ideology as the reason.
