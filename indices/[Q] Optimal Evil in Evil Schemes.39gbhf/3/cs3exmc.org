Ooh, you can transform people into other things and their sould are attatched to them? There are opportunities for some /excellent/ transhumanist things there, even if there are drawbacks.

I think you're right; the "villain" is /too/ right. Destroying or preventing Utopia because /freedom!/ is a well-worn cliche, and (IMO) incredibly unsympathetic in a protagonist. On the other hand, you don't want to give them a good plan and then bolt on a stupid downside.

Here's my suggestion: there's no Matrix. The Petrified don't dream, and they certainly don't live in a perfect Lotus Eater world. Rather, they're fully conscious, but blind, deaf, and dumb - and their soul/mind has been altered so their preferences are OK with staring at darkness forever. (This would allow AlexanderWales' excellent suggestion of depetrifying someone at some point.)
