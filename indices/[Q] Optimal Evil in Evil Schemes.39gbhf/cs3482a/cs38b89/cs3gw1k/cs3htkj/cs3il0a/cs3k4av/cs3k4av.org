It's pointed at /you/.

  For it to be better to try and make a better spell you need to reach the conclusion that the net negative over this time is greater then the net negative for that one time ignoring people's wishes to place them in "heaven".

The net negative over an infinite timespan is always infinite. In fact, if you've already use your inferior spell, you now have infinite undisturbed time to work on something better without having to attend to ordinary daily life.
