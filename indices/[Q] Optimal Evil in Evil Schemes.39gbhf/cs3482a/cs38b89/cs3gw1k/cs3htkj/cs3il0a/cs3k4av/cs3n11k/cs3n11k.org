  It's pointed at you.

i'm not writing the story and generally am more of a nihilist so i don't really agree with the "good" or "bad" in the argument. All i can really say is if i heard someone planned this "imperfect heaven" spell i wouldn't be particularly inclined to stop them, unless I had a good reason to believe that the spell will not work as they think it will.

  The net negative over an infinite timespan is always infinite.

i thought we agreed that once the people are already in the spell there is no real negative for them, nothing really to improve in any way that they will be capable of appreciating. the only real negative is in the fact that it is forcefully pushing people into that without asking them, which some would even say isn't that negative in the first place.

  you now have infinite undisturbed time to work on something better
#+end_quote

only if something better is possible and undoing the current spell will not cause too big of a negative compared to the possible positive in the "better" spell. In any case during that time there is still the not insignificant negative because you are not effected by the spell..

Anyhow the point is not so much that this spell is objectively good but instead that it really depends on your values, which is why it should probably count as "good vs good".
