I agree in the case of a general AI setting goals.

The strongest argument I've seen in favor of virtualizing everyone is that human bodies use up resources that would be better spent on computation, which isn't all that strong of an argument, and doesn't mean that everyone has to be in a "fake" version of reality (because there are layers of mediation).

However, in a fictional world you can bypass a lot with your conceit. In the OP's magical girl example, it might not be /possible/ to use the power in another way; if your only tool is a spell that petrifies people and throws them into their version of Heaven, then there aren't questions of using that power in another way. This is /slightly/ cheesy, in that your audience will see the conflict of choice that you've set up, but like a good hypothetical question, you can cut out the parts that are irrelevant to what you want to discuss.
