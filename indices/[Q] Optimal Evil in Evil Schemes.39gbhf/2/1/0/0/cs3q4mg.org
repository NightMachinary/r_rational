That is fine. The other elements I pointed out still apply.

The problem with isolation like that is that there is a easy problem with it. It is quite possible for people to notice that there are no real people besides themselves. Effectively, you gain immortality at the cost of permanent social isolation. But social isolation is also known as solitary confinement (in prisons). Long lasting solitary confinement is very bad for you and causes a lot of suffering.

So you have two options. Either she needs to add "false" people that are indistinguishable from real ones (Turing test people) OR she is not really solving the suffering problem that she claims to be solving.
