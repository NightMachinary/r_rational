I'm going to dissent: Ideological Evil, evil with /ideas/, is a more interesting conflict than Good vs Good. You can only mess-up Good so much before it becomes Neutral or Evil anyway.

I'm sorry, but this sounds kinda... cliched. It could work really well if executed well, but that's a fairly big /if/.

For one thing, if you make your villain motivated by Free Will Makes Suffering, you end up with your heroines having to defend /precisely/ the shittiest conduct of regular people as a matter of principle regarding Free Will. This is despite the fact that most regular people would probably say "yes" to a "morality pill" (that conformed to their notion of morality, or even that used a fully naturalized grounding for its morality) that lets you do things like control yourself better and make better choices.

It's also irritating to get to a Final Battle between such a villain and the heroines, and all of a sudden the heroines are motivated by making a more moral, less shitty world /without/ violating Free Will, /when they never had any such motivation before and are really just rationalizing the status quo/ (paging /Slayers Try/). Then the giant Eldritch Abomination Kriemhild Gretchen (or Jasmine, whatever) is killed, the Lotus Eating megaspell is broken... and everything goes back to normal, /proving the villain right/.

If you want to make a conflict about Free Will, you can't leave it as "Anti-Freedom villain versus sinful but pro-Freedom heroines." You need genuinely /good/ people to hold up the cause of Freedom /on principle/ rather than /because they'd rather keep being shitty people/.

If your conflict winds up with the Evil Law Firm of Satan sending a note to the heroes saying, "Thanks for averting world peace. That really could've put us out of business", then the heroes'/heroines' side of the moral conflict was irrational.
