  But I think a negligible minority of people in real life would consider themselves the Bad Guy in their own story. (Ignoring depressive misanthropes who think they're bad people but aren't actually.)

I think it depends on whether you're using the terms "good" and "bad" to denote the character's own feelings on stuff, or in the more rigid way of denoting how the characters model /other people/ as feeling. I'm using them in the latter way, and in that way, plenty of people are self-consciously the Bad Guy /in how they know they affect others/, but they still have coherently human motivations for what they're doing /from the inside/.

So I guess we're not really arguing over much, and I dragged out the thread in semantic bullshit because, being a LW-y science nerd, I have gotten overused to considering the Outside View the /real/ view, with the Inside View being largely self-delusion in many/most cases.

  It would be a fairly small proportion of readers who would sympathise with the villain to that degree, and an even smaller subset who would refuse to accept them as the villain and post "AKEMI HOMUCIFER DID NOTHING WRONG" on the message boards. But they should exist if the villain is a well-written Level 1 character and the work has a large enough fanbase. Their existence doesn't make the story good, but they're an unintended and hard-to-avoid side effect of a well-written villain.

I think we're agreeing vehemently on this point?

(On the subject of Homura in specific... I think I just fail to understand the metaphysics and metaphysics-based moral system in play in /Madoka/. Like, I don't consider Kyubee sympathetic /at all/, and while I do think /erasing Madoka's memories/ is clearly evil, I also don't think that Madokami was necessarily the optimal outcome. The show seems to be saying, "Bodhisattvas > happy mortals", where I (and Homura, apparently) don't happen to think being a Bodhisattva is all that great at all.)
