  There's always some moral uncertainty, but frankly when it comes to evil overlords there's not a lot.

Oh, certainly. Everyone agrees that Quirrel from /HPMoR/, CelestAI, the Virtuals, any incarnation of Lex Luthor, Ozymandias from /Watchmen/, Andrew Ryan from /Bioshock/, Skitter from /Worm/, and Hyperintelligent Rainbow Dash from that one fanfic last week, are morally irredeemable supervillains. Nobody has ever suggested that such characters were not in the wrong.

The author's intent may be clear, but just because you can accurately judge whether a character is a villain or not doesn't mean most people can.
