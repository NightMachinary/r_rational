  I was expecting you'd object to Skitter too, since despite being a self-confessed supervillain she's one of the most sympathetic characters in the setting.

Ah. I haven't read /Worm/. I'm currently working my way through /Shinji and Warhammer 40k/. And I have to finish /City of Angles/ at some point, because that was /great/ but I couldn't read it outside a web-browser, which is /distracting as fuck/. And there are lots of nonfiction textbooks to get through.

  The problem I see with having obvious "good" and "evil" sides are that any remotely rational villain will recognise that they are on the wrong side.

But why would they /care?/

  But the reader should at least be able to understand why the villain wants the things he wants.

Well of course. I just don't think that this necessarily means the villain must believe themselves to be /good/, in the sense that an outside reader would recognize as good. Lots of bad people in real life, for example, justify their actions using blatantly self-serving rationalizations, or even vast, rationalized philosophical systems designed to justify the statement that there's not /really/ any such thing as right-and-wrong, and /other people/ are just being delusionally irrational for having morality in the first place.

Eliezer's Quirrellmort is actually a very good example here: a lot of what he says makes him /sound/ like merely a very cynical person, but when you /listen/ and /take his words seriously/, he's actually saying to Harry and the reader that he considers moral compunctions to be for sheep.

There's also the fact that readers will sympathize at least a little with any character portrayed as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard][sufficiently /awesome/]], no matter their moral alignment. You really can write Wizard Hitler and his Wizard Nazis and make them compelling characters that people like -- Harry Potter and its fandom proved that.

Sometimes, Good vs Good conflicts are /unrealistic/: some people are evil, and self-consciously /evil/, because the evaluative algorithms in their head have outputted that morality is just a shitty thing to do.
