You rather spoiled your sarcasm by including at least one example of /deliberate/ ambiguity. Alan Moore was damn well intending that we should sympathize with Ozymandias. Oh, and since this is my flair and it's mandatory here, AKEMI HOMUCIFER DID NOTHING WRONG.

And Quirrellmort from canon!HPMoR doesn't really belong on the list anymore, since he didn't get to do much Evil Overlording, at least as he was, before getting permakilled by an 11-year-old kid. Following the Phoenix's Quirrellmort at least managed to start a major war ;-)!

Oh, and I didn't read the thing with Hyperintelligent Rainbow Dash because it was boring. So I can't judge other than having heard the ranting complaint on this sub that it was a textbook case of Genius Makes You Evil, in which case it's clearly Author Fiat interfering with how alignments normally work.

Oh, and basically /everyone/ in Bioshock is an evil villain. It's an all-villains game about all the nastiest scummy ideas the 20th century vomited up.

  The author's intent may be clear, but just because you can accurately judge whether a character is a villain or not doesn't mean most people can.
