But can you split the difference then? End on a more melancholy note where the spell backfires on the caster when the power of friendship is introduced, and while the magical popo try to unpetrify her for questioning and punishment, her friends try and rationalize what just went down, who was right and who was wrong, and end with the Shin Sekai Yori ending of "this is our world as it is and we will try to do better?" Or is that just lip service in your opinion?

Doubt you and I will come to an understanding here and now on whether flawed characters defending free will is strictly acting in self interest, let alone if that can be considered a good and/or healthy thing, but I should at least understand the conditionals.
