  End on a more melancholy note where the spell backfires on the caster when the power of friendship is introduced, and while the magical popo try to unpetrify her for questioning and punishment, her friends try and rationalize what just went down, who was right and who was wrong, and end with the Shin Sekai Yori ending of "this is our world as it is and we will try to do better?" Or is that just lip service in your opinion?

Actually, I think "We will try to do better" is an entirely valid moral. You just have to show people genuinely trying to do better.

What might be useful here is to have /three/ factions:

- One conventional set of fantasy heroes, conservative to the core (in the sense of preserving the status quo, because they think the status quo /is/ The Good, as fantasy heroes often do). Lawful Good, to the point of sometimes being Lawful Ideologue.

- One nonconventional set of heroes, of radical orientation. They are shown to be really, genuinely acting to improve the world and the lot of people in general, but since they're True Good they can't take the easy way out by riding off into the sunset when monsters have been killed (like some Chaotic Good characters) /or/ of always supporting the establishment (like Lawful Good). They have the toughest uphill battle because their values require the most hard work.

- The villain(s), who view the radical heroes' struggle as useless and the conservative heroes' actions as actively harmful. They want to just petrify everyone into bliss. They justify this on grounds of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight?from=Main.AndItWorked][And It Will Work]].

Any pair of these two factions might oppose the third, depending on the situation, and for interesting reasons.
