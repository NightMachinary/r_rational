This should be good for a 6th generation rational pokemon fanfic (omega ruby and alpha sapphire) except with FOUR factions: Team Aqua, Team Magma, Team Aer (this of course would be Zinnia's faction, although they don't have a name in canon so far as I'm aware) and all the people who get caught in their crossfire.
