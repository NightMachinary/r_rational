Guess so. The brother is a bit of a Pinocchio where it's inconclusive if he his the lead's brother in the form of an animated stuffed animal, or a representation of his sisters thoughts and memories with a new kernel tossed in. Think FMA if Al was never sure if there was a difference between Al and the Almor. His body is in stone storage though until it can be cured, and the cat memories could always be transfered back in, but he tries not to dwell on the identity thing and just be a supportive brother who is also a stuffed cat.

The petrification spell is an entirely different animal though, that locks you in your body, keeps you alive and turns on whatever makes you happy. I don't know if there is more than a semantic difference between "whatever makes you happy" and "making whatever happy," but I'm willing to hear you out if you have a good reason as to why one works better than the other for long term happy making.
