So that was my initial thought, but there has been a nonzero amount of foreshadowing that the Squire could become the White Knight. If what will save Callow is Lady Squire allying with the heroes, and turning on Black, I could see it happening. I think it may not be conflict as much, but a place for a wedge to be driven.
