  So that was my initial thought, but there has been a nonzero amount of foreshadowing that the Squire could become the White Knight.

Squire is /not/ a hero. She knows it, Black knows it, everyone knows it. One of her lines is "Justification only matters to the just", which is not heroic.

I think that if she will become a Knight at all, it will be a Gray or Green(if you follow medieval storytelling conventions) one, and certainly not White.

As for this...

  If what will save Callow is Lady Squire allying with the heroes, and turning on Black, I could see it happening.
#+end_quote

Thing is, it won't save Callow. That would be just continuing the story of Callow and Praes-heroes redeeming a villain, saving the country, yadda yadda. It wouldn't /break/ the pattern like what Black intends to do, and our lady Squire knows that. She was selected by him for a reason, that reason being “Because I rarely suffer the company of imbeciles” in his own words, so I think she understood his idea perfectly and is now a devout supporter of it.
