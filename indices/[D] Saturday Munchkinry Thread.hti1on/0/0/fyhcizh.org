Hire someone to push notifications to your phone every 2 minutes or so about what the best performing stock/best stock to short in the previous 2 minutes. Spend a lot of time on your phone doing whatever, but make sure to memorize the push notifications whenever they come up. Whenever I notice a skip, immediately tell my person what stock to buy. Roughly 5 minutes later they can sell it again. Doing this there's a good chance you can make enough to live very comfortably and always have someone drive you places, as well as pay the person that's pushing you notifications. I'm sure the military would also pay for random 5-minutes from the future reports even if they can't control when it happens.

You could also just spend the day enjoying watching a sport that has heavy batting on the outcome, and same situation. Don't bet until you notice a jump.
