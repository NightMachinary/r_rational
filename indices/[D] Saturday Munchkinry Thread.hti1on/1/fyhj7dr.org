I read an interesting magic in a [[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/2357][glowfic]] recently. The fic was incomplete and old, so I'm filling in the blanks to make it more definitive for the purpose of a Saturday munchkinry thread, and making it take slightly less time, to make it slightly easier to munchkin.

By repeating the exact same action, over and over again, down to the exact same muscles used in the exact same way with the exact same tools, until your muscle memory is perfect and automatic, followed by visualizing and exertion of willpower, you can acquire the ability to telekinetically apply this action. This basic telekinetic tool is referred to as a memni (memnos plural).

The muscle memory stage typically takes 3-6 months of practice (depending on the complexity of the action and assuming you practice correctly). It generally takes another 6 months of practice with visualization/willpower exertion to get the first initial bit of telekinesis, followed by several more years of practice to get the telekinesis to the same strength and precision as the practiced action. 2-3 years for a simple/fast action with a simple tool, closer 5 years for a more complex action or for an action that uses more complicated tools. Subsequent memni can be learned somewhat faster, the strengthening of the telekinesis take about half the time.

Existing motor skills can sometimes be leveraged to develop a memni faster (maybe around half the time for a motor skill that has been already perfected), but then this doesn't result in any improvements to the time to develop subsequent memni.

Interrelated memnos can form a synergy together and form a single more flexible, more efficient, and more general usage tool, refereed to as a memnodyne.

So as a basic example, lifting a rock vertically and holding it for a year would get very limited vertical lifting telekinesis. After another two years of practice, you would have telekinesis that could precisely lift objects that weighed equal to or less (but still close in weight) than the rock your practiced with, to the same precision as your hand, moving a distance equal to or less than the height you lifted the rock to, at speeds equal to or less than the speed you lifted the rock, with range of about arms length. Spending another year practicing moving a rock horizontally would get very limited horizontal telekinesis, followed by another year to get horizontal telekinesis up to strength and synergizing with the vertical telekinesis. Once it synergized into a memnodyne, you could move object in any direction, with improvements on speed/max distance/max weight,range (improvements generally being the combined values of the memnos that made up the memnodyne).

Memnodyne, and to some extent memnos, can also apply some esoteric effects. A memnodyne composed of several woodworking memni might allow for directly applying a mental image to the wood and rapidly and nearly instantly forming it into such. At an extreme example, combing multiple medical memnos (applying anesthetic, applying stitches, cutting away rotting/infected tissue, applying a sterilizing substance, applying a bandage) could be combined to get a memnodyne that allows rapid healing of various types of wounds. (This is an extreme example, it would take over a decade to learn and require practice on living subjects.)

So munchkin ideas.

- Best single action to make into a memni?

- What memnodyne would actually be economically worth it to develop? In modern times or in less technologically developed times periods?

- Given unlimited practice time (or much faster learning of memni), what memnodynes would be most powerful/flexible.

- Ways of getting economic value out of people who are practicing? (At a simple end, subjects that can be learned over audiobook while they practice, and a more complicated end, Amazon mechanical Turk type tasks they can perform while also practicing)

- Best weapon memni? (Note if you wanted to make a bow-and-arrow memni, you would have to use the same arrow every time (to get arrow like telekinesis) or make the memni just of the bow (to get telekinesis that launches object that are sufficiently like an arrow). Also, if your arrow/bow breaks, you are out of luck...)

And a few munchkin ideas I've already had:

- Use sensors to detect body position to ensure optimal practice.

- Precisely crafted simple machines (levers, pulleys, rails, guides) to develop memni for heavy weights and to make the motor action as simple and fast as possible to make practicing easier and faster.

- Sensory memni/memnodyne. (Looking through a pair of binoculars, looking through a magnifier glass, sweeping your eyes over the same way again and again).

*Edit:* I don't think I explained what can get included as a tool correctly. During the visualization stage, you can decide what counts as a tool and what is included. So for example, if you repeatedly swung an axe, you can either get a telekinesis that swing objects (if you don't include the axe), or telekinesis that chops objects (if you do include the axe).
