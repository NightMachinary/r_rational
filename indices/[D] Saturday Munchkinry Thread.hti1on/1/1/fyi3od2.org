I think walking and/or running would be a popular one, because the muscle memory stage should be easier to reach. I assume you'd have to be walking in a straight line though, turning is a different movement. I'm not sure what effect it would have though. My initial assumption is that it would let you levitate yourself horizontally in a straight line at walking speed, which seems fairly useful. Does using a memni tire you out at all?

I could see some sort of farming related memni being very common at some point in the past - planting, maybe, since that doesn't necessarily require a tool and can be used for multiple crops?
