Typing. (Or really pressing one keyboard button.) (Or phone button!)

This is an incredibly simple and fast action, and you would repeat it almost all the time anyway, so I imagine it would be incredibly quick to master with very little effort.

But now we have a question: what are the range/restrictions on this telepathy? Can I type on my home computer's keyboard while I am outdoors? Do I need to be able to see it somehow, like through a camera? Do obstacles matter? Can I "type" in someone's heart to kill them?

For that matter, does it need to be muscle memory from an "active" muscle? Can I just use my heart beat, which beats all the time anyway? That would be even faster to learn than typing, and could be used to pump all kinds of things other than blood.

Blinking could also work, but it would be a really really weak telekinetic force.

Edit: Re-reading the rules again, I find myself confused. Rock lifting lets you telekinetically lift other lighter objects, but gun-firing only lets you fire one specific bullet and nothing else? Why?
