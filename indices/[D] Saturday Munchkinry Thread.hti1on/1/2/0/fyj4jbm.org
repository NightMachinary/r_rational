All the muscles under your active conscious control need to be used the same way. So the smooth muscles in your intestine don't mess up your practice, and even actions irrelevant to the task that you don't think about (like blinking or eye movements) won't mess up your practice, but actively doing something else with different muscles will.

The car could be a memni. You would need to make sure you can maintain the car without outright replacing any major parts for the entire process, and because a car is such a complicated tool, it would take on the longer end (5 years) for the memni to fully develop. The end result would be something along the lines of hovering and forward movement (depending on the visualization and how the car is accelerated).

  but I can't think of how you could develop a fire creating memni without something like a lighter

If your society has glass working, a magnifying glass could work. Depending on the exact visualization, it could get you a memni that creates burning heat at a point or a memni that bends light towards a point. Combine with several other light manipulating memni (using mirrors or glass), you could get a pretty useful light manipulating memnodyne.

A sufficiently durable fire bow drill could maybe work (maybe you could make one out of metal). The base board and kindling are consumed and thus cannot be part of the memni, but the drill shaft, bow, and hand piece are all constant and could be part of the memni. The resulting memni couldn't create fire out of nothing, but given a softwood and/or kindling could generate friction and heat on them.

You could use an oil lamp to transfer fire around. The should get a straight pyrokinesis memni. Combine with one of the ignition techniques described above and maybe a few other memni (fans or bellows for aerokinesis), and you could get a pretty powerful, general purpose memnodyne.
