Life that both generate excessive waste heat, and is adapted to high temperatures could drive life less adapted to extreme heat extinct. Although eventually the heat would be too much for even this life and it would die out to, unless it had a way of self regulating, like maybe going dormant at too high temperature. So you might get a heating season/cooling season like you described, or it might form a homeostasis at just below the maximum temperature life can function at and fluctuate around it as various life forms go dormant when it goes too high and active again when it drops.
