Earth probably wouldn't survive nyctosynthesis, but Mars could! And it would be fascinating.

The big problem here is nyctosynthesis effectively creates energy out of "nothing", assuming its use of dark matter does not have any other effect. The chemical energy will be used to create large molecules that are eventually burned, either by mitochondria or by forest fires.

Effectively, the planet could have artificial GLOBAL seasons that are independent of its orbit. First, there will be a Growth Season, where large masses of nyctosynthesis organisms grow and spread everywhere, creating tons of chemical energy.

This chemical energy would get converted to heat energy over time, bringing about a Burning Season, where global temperatures rise so high that most of the organisms die off. There could even be a catastrophic chain reaction where the higher temperatures result in more fires that turn more of the chemical energy into heat.

Finally, the planet cools down again in a Cooling Season since most of the chemical energy has been used up. Once temperatures drop far enough, the next Growth Season arrives as the few remaining organisms once again experience explosive growth.

Any intelligent life that evolves on this planet would be truly pitiful.
