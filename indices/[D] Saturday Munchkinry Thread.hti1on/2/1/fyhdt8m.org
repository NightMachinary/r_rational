So more massive planets would favor nyctosynthesis and smaller planets would favor photosynthesis, both for surface area available and forge gravity well at work. Given how rarely life has occurred in our universe, and the diversity of life that has evolved, whatever planet does develop life will probably eventually evolve both types of life (just as our planet as chemovores in specialized niches), although one or the other may end up being very niche and only existing at the fringes.

For a nyctosynthesis dominated ecosystem... Initially, prior to the evolution of multicellular organisms, life would occur at various the interfaces of materials suitable for life. These areas would be maximally colonized by nyctosynthesizing bacterial mats. The first multicellular organism would burrow through the layers of mats to get at biomass and serve to diversify this monobiome. Also, depending on how frequently the dark matter currents shift, I could envision mats blooming as the current waxes and then dying off and being scavenged by chemovores and more energy efficient nyctosynthesizers as the current wanes. Burrowing organisms would adapt to follow the current and to reach now sources of scarce materials. At an end state, the planet's crust would be thoroughly processed and intermixed to be composed of biomass with an abundance of energy but intense competition for biomass toward the core and and a scarcity of energy toward the edges. Photosynthesis would exist as a niche on the surface where nyctosynethesis is at it's weakest and sunlight available.
