Suppose there exists an exotic form of chemosynthesis driven by gravitationally-interacting dark matter, and that this chemosynthetic process suffices to support multicellular organisms without regard to the cube-square law: As long as the organism is exposed to a sufficient concentration of unrespired dark matter, it is transported to and from individual cells by naturally occuring dark matter currents without any effort on the part of the organism. As long as the organism avoids regions of low dark matter content, it can subsist without respiration and only requires food and water insofar as they are required to support growth and cell replacement. This form of chemosynthesis can occur on a cellular basis in individual chemoplasts, but is considerably more efficient if performed in a dedicated organ composed of a particular kind of nacre-like biosilicate. Due to gravitational effects, the required form of dark matter increases in concentration as one descends in the gravity well.

Suppose that both photosynthesis and more conventional forms of chemosynthesis also evolved in this hypothetical universe, in addition to this dark matter based 'nyctosynthesis'. How does this change the history of evolution? What sorts of organisms would arise, and which ecological niches would they fill? Would you see photosynthetic and nyctosynthetic life in the same environments, or would they compete to the point of one or the other going extinct?
