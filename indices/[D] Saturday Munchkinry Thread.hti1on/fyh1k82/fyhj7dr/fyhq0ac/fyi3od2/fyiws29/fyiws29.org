Do all your muscles need to be used in the exact same way, or just the ones relevant to the task?

Could driving a car be a memni? Specifically pushing the gas pedal and visualizing the car as a tool.

In less technologically advanced societies, a fire creating memni would be very useful, but I can't think of how you could develop a fire creating memni without something like a lighter, because I assume most other tools would wear out too much.
