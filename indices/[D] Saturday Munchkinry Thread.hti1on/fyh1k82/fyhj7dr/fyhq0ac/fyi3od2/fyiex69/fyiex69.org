Walking should result in levitation/hovering with forward motion at a similar speed to your walking speed. Combined with several other memni and you might have limited flight.

The complete memni doesn't require any physical exertion, but the process of developing a memni requires completing the same motor actions over and over again, and if you get so tired you can no longer maintain the precise movements, that limits your ability to practice. So if 4 hours of walking (with precisely controlled movements)!is tiring enough to prevent you from walking 4 more hours in the same day, your practice schedule is going to take twice as long (the training time assumes 8 hour a day practice).

Farming tools sound like an interesting idea. You would need to refine your movements to make them precisely the same, but with enough care you could still be doing work as you practiced. And a complete farming memnodyne might have useful esoteric properties, speeding up the plant growth for example.
