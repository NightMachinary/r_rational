  Re-reading the rules again, I find myself confused. Rock lifting lets you telekinetically lift other lighter objects, but gun-firing only lets you fire one specific bullet and nothing else? Why?
#+end_quote

I'll edit the rules to explain them more clearly... for the rock lifting, you would need to practice with the exact same rock but the resulting telekinesis would apply to a more general category. If you wanted to get a "bullet force" telekinesis (telekinetic blasts that hit with the force of a bullet) from practicing firing a gun you would need to somehow fire the same bullet over and over again when you practiced.... although now that I think about how I described it, you could get gun telekinesis (launching objects of a similar/smaller size of a bullet at bullet speeds) as long as the gun stayed the same across your practice. I'll try to describe that better.

  This is an incredibly simple and fast action, and you would repeat it almost all the time anyway, so I imagine it would be incredibly quick to master with very little effort.

It needs to be an exact set of motor actions that you do. So you would either have to make a single keypress the memni, or maybe make several separate key presses with different fingers into separate memni and then combine them into a memnodyne.

And to follow up on the gun/bullet distinction. During the visualization/willpower stage, you can decide whether the keyboard gets counted as part of it. If you didn't include the keyboard, it is small telekinetic presses. So if you included the keyboard, your memni wouldn't be generating button pushing telekinesis, it would be telekinetically generating the electrical impulses that a keyboard outputs. The power would cheat a bit, especially when it reaches the level of memnodyne, to make the output of the keyboard work towards the end result, i.e. if you tried giving the output to a computer that lacked the drivers of the keyboard you practiced with.

  what are the range/restrictions on this telepathy? Can I type on my home computer's keyboard while I am outdoors?
#+end_quote

The range would be that of your arm's reach initially (for telekinesis). With practice it might extend a little. If you included the keyboard, it might be the length of the keyboard's cable. To get long range, you would need to combine it with another memni that has a long range. So use a bluetooth keyboard when you develop it initially (to get the range of a bluetooth connection), then develop memni for longer range pieces of wireless technology.

  For that matter, does it need to be muscle memory from an "active" muscle?
#+end_quote

It needs to be something that you consciously exert control over for the visualization and willpower focusing part of the exercise to work right.

  Can I just use my heart beat, which beats all the time anyway?
#+end_quote

If you gained precise enough control of your heartbeat through biofeedback, you could maybe make that work? So even if you needed less practice of the movement, you would need to practice biofeedback to get control over your own hearbeat. The resulting memni sounds like it might be really useful... telekinetic circulation of blood (if you don't include the blood as part of the memni) or telekinetic distribution of oxygen and nutrients (if you do include the blood).
