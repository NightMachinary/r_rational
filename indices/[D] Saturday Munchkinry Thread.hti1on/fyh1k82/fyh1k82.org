You have a time leap ability that is blessed with suck. Every second, there is a very small chance that you will be forcibly time leaped backwards by 5 minutes. On average, the ability triggers about 10 times a day. There is no way to predict when the ability will be triggered, and no warning whatsoever. The ability can even be triggered consecutively, sending you much further than 5 minutes backwards in time.

There are no signs of the ability triggering. You simply suddenly time leap. So for example, if you are just standing still and admiring a work of art for a long period of time, you may not even notice your ability activate during that period. Similarly, time leaping while you are sleeping is unnoticeable, your sleep will not be disturbed by your ability (unless you time leap to before you got in bed, at which point you could fall over and probably wake up from the impact).

On the other hand, the time leap can be somewhat disorienting if you were in a very different situation 5 minutes ago, such as transitioning from walking to swimming. So certain actions, like driving, can be very dangerous.

How would you use or deal with this ability?
