Good point. It's basically a private off-books economy that ends up outperforming the global one because its incestuousness ends up being to its advantage. I sort of think there could be a similar economic hack in real life.

If you were to make a small scale factory that mostly replicates its own construction requirements (using relatively small-scale methods with minimized complexity/specialization to avoid labor costs), it seems that each individual step in the industrial chain would /appear/ much more expensive than buying it on the open market from a specialized firm that does it at large scale. You would at each point be able to argue that it is energetically inefficient, slower than it needs to be, and so on. (One of those components could be the solar panels needed to gather energy, which again could, naively, be sold for more than the cost to make the new units of the factory.)

But given the fact that you don't have to sell outputs to obtain the results, the sticker price is misleading; it's kind of like you are buying it from yourself. Each time you decide to replicate the factory, you auto-generate /demand/ for all of its components, and the profit goes to the seller who happens to be the buyer. That means you can afford to just keep turning the crank until you crowd the available environment, which is something a normal business can't do because it has to worry about flooding the markets, the costs of what it needs going up, and other inherently hard to control factors.

An extreme case of this would be a self replicating space factory. You can't easily sell the products of such a factory, which naively makes it look like a bad idea. But you could funnel the outputs to new factories over and over until you have enough that the cost to ship stuff back to earth is a relative pittance not worth worrying about.
