I assume have but cannot construct more of? Recycling of defunct electronics, etc. is the most immediately obvious high value activity, but it's probably not worth it if I only have the one. Another higher value but riskier and requiring more up front capital thing to do is use it for refining uranium ore, which is kinda awful to do the normal way IIRC.

If I only have one and don't know how to reproduce it then the highest value thing I can do with it is probably to charge people in the relevant industries who would love to get their hands on the tech access to for studying.
