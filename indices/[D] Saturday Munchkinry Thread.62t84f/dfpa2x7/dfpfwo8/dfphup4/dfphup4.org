Having the option to get more of them makes it more interesting, whereas turning it over scientific study would probably just mean making up technobabble since this is fiction... Let's say the device is a magic blackbox impervious to study or functional modification, with the dimensions 3x3x3 meters, which you can purchase from a friendly genie for 1 billion dollars (apart from the first unit, which it gave you for free).

In addition to money, the genie also accepts equivalent exchange at market value in electricity, raw materials, or manufactured goods. However, any credit you build with the genie by trading it stuff disappears after 24 hours, so you can't conveniently use it in lieu of storage.

  Another higher value but riskier and requiring more up front capital thing to do is use it for refining uranium ore, which is kinda awful to do the normal way IIRC.

If you had access to a mine of uranium ore, maybe. Otherwise, according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust][this chart]], uranium is present in the crust at about 2 ppm. Assuming 5 tons of materials per cubic meter, and given that natural uranium sells for something like 5 cents per gram, you would make something like 25 cents per cubic meter from the uranium content of random rock/dirt from your back yard. That at least pays for the thermal losses.
