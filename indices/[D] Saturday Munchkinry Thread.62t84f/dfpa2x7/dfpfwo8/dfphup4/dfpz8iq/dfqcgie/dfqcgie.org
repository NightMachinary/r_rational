  Optimistically, you can fit about 9000kg of pitchblende in the box, which gives you say about 8000kg of uranium, which nets you about $440k / day at current uranium prices. Which isn't a bad revenue, but will take you about two millenia to see a good rate of return.

You'd make a billion dollars every 6 years at that rate. Which implies that you'd get 1024 machines in 60 years, ~1 million in 120 years, etc.

Also, bear in mind that it comes out isotopically sorted, and the price of uranium is known to [[http://www.activistpost.com/2010/11/highly-enriched-uranium-has-spot-price.html][vary]] by isotope.

  It's a bit of a boring solution, but I think the most profitable thing to do with this box is auction it off.

Ah, you have chosen the Molech scenario. /Evil laugh/

To keep it consistent with the von Neumann machine metaphor, we can say the genie contract is also attached to the box, so it will do business with whoever owns it.

Suppose the first one goes for 100 billion dollars. The winner of the auction (a member of a trillionaire family, with access to plenty of credit) borrows an additional 100 billion from the bank, buys 100 of these things from the genie, and auctions them off, netting an average of 10 billion each. That lets them pay back the 200 billion they borrowed to begin with and keep 800 billion for themselves. As Donald Trump would say -- smart!

Many of the buyers realize they have just a short time to compete against each other, so they borrow whatever they can and make as many machines as they can, each fueling various special projects to produce rare stuff and electricity. They end up selling much of the stuff to pay back the bank, crashing the market for these things (and doing untold good for humanity in the process -- or harm, in some cases).

Three months later, all the countries of the world seem to have mysteriously obtained fissile nuclear materials, and the going rate to buy a new box is down to 1 million dollars. Weird, why would anyone...

In other news, Congress is getting ready to pass a bill to hyperinflate the US currency at the behest of some very powerful lobbies that seem to have sprung up all of a sudden.
