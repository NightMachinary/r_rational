If you put less than a cubic meter in, does it still take 24 hours to process? If processing time is proportional to mass, you could have a very efficient way of creating otherwise tricky-to-layer substances, which could result in revolutionary new technologies, e.g. [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150814122850.htm]]

Or at least the very fast exploration of different possibilities, which could then be engineered through more conventional means. Even if it takes a full 24h for any amount of materials.

It would be very worth exploring what structures the pure materials produced, have, in case it gets to something tricky, as well as whether that structure could be manipulated via the "does not place anything next to something it is particularly reactive with" (e.g. if the default structure is really unstable next to some other material, then put two of them in and see if the former will go for a different structure). This could potentially result in exciting new metamaterials if there's some highly nonreactive theoretical structure possible.

How finicky is the genie about the "1 billion dollars in... cash" thing? Do they punish attempts at subversion? Can I give them counterfeit dollars, non-US dollars, etc.? Can I collude with the US (or other) Gov't to somehow devalue the dollar and buy up a bunch? If the "market value of... goods" is just how much someone (or ones) is willing to pay for something, can I conspire with some billionaire individuals or organizations to buy my [[https://i.imgur.com/Qdk3vOw.png][fantastic artwork]], recently valued at $1B?

I imagine that the best course of action, as with most prompts, would be to appeal to the relevant experts (material engineers/scientists, etc.) to come up with experiments, and work with the appropriate powers for funding to buy more machines, at least until I can work out a proper monetization strategy. Though "ask for help" is not a very fun answer lol.
