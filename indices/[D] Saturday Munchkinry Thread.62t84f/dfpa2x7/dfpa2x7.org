You have a machine with the ability to take a cubic meter of any solid material and sort its atoms into a stack of square-meter layers of pure substance, over the course of 24 hours.

Gaseous and liquid layers are collected into individual containers. This includes anything that evaporates quickly in a vacuum, such as metallic calcium. The rest of the substances are layered with each other in an order that does not place anything next to something it is particularly reactive with.

The form of each layer tends to be pure but not monocrystalline, for example carbon forms as graphite rather than diamond, and the silicon metal is polysillicon.

The machine requires energy to operate, since it has to break chemical bonds and does not break CoE, but is highly efficient in that it produces only about 100 watts of waste heat. It can be powered by electricity.

Edit to add:

The device is magic so it cannot be replicated by science, however it was provided by a genie which has agreed to provide you with an additional one for every 1 billion dollars in either cash or equal market value of materials, electricity, or goods as can be delivered within a 24 hour period. (Delivery is done by drawing a magic circle around a spot and transferring things into it)

The device does separate isotopes.
