  What I think is probably the main interesting application of it it: You can use it to produce ridiculously high purity materials, which is a niche but potentially high value market for use in scientific instruments etc.

Well, if you can produce 1 ton of anything worth $1000/gram or more, you can replicate the device in a day. So yes, this is a great idea. (I'd consider anything faster than 1 replication per month a smashing success, and one per year isn't at all bad.)

  The main problem with the box I think is that it's too expensive to be useful for producing materials, because refining is something we can already do pretty well for orders of magnitude less money.

My understanding is that there are typically environmental costs, and the energy requirements are higher due to waste heat. Also, it's much harder to separate isotopes than ordinary elements.
