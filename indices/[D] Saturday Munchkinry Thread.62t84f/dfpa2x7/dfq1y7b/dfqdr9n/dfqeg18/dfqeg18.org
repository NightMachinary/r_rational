  Well, if you can produce 1 ton of anything worth $1000/gram or more, you can replicate the device in a day.

Well, what matters is the really ratio of the value of pure to impure, which I'm struggling to find good numbers on. The isotopes angle someone else suggested is probably better, as those are much harder to separate chemicalyl.

  My understanding is that there are typically environmental costs, and the energy requirements are higher due to waste heat. Also, it's much harder to separate isotopes than ordinary elements.

There are, but $1 billion / box is quite a lot, and a cubic meter per day isn't really on an industrial scale. Also energy is (for the moment) fairly cheap and the history of getting people to pay more to reduce environmental costs isn't very successful.

Don't get me wrong, the boxes would be super useful, it's just that for bulk production you need a /lot/ of them to really make an impact, which given the high cost limits their utility for most applications.
