The main problem with the box I think is that it's too expensive to be useful for producing materials, because refining is something we can already do pretty well for orders of magnitude less money.

What I think is probably the main /interesting/ application of it it: You can use it to produce ridiculously high purity materials, which is a niche but potentially high value market for use in scientific instruments etc. You start with having done the first pass of refinement elsewhere, you shove a cubic meter of 99% pure material into the box, and then once you take it out of the box you chop off the 1% that was solid and isn't your desired material. With a bit of wastage (which you can reclaim later by running the discarded material through the box again) you now have 100% purity.

I don't have a good sense of how high value the market is, so this may still not be worth it, but it's probably the only thing the box allows you to do that we can't currently do very well.

Edit: BTW I'm assuming for the sake of avoiding the obvious boring munchkin that it also preserves all the other relevant conservation laws. You've moved the centre of mass when shuffling things around, but I'm assuming it does that just by bracing against its surrounding environment and exerting force or something.
