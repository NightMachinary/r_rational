  I was assuming under this scenario that the genie wasn't granting machine buying to anyone except me.

Fair enough. However, I'd be really concerned about getting kidnapped in that scenario. A person who can afford to purchase a box like this is definitely going to want more, and to keep them out of the hands of competitors.

  It definitely changes the parameters if that's not the case, but TBH if that's not the case we're screwed because the secret is going to get out at some point.

Keeping the secret as long as possible would be important. At some point, you could build a power base to protect yourself and make sure the tech doesn't get abused, but you'd want to be very careful in the early phases.
