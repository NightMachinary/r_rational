  If you had access to a mine of uranium ore, maybe.

Yeah, that's what I meant about higher up front capital investment. You don't need your own though - you can rent it out to someone else.

Even with a uranium mine it's not really worth the billion dollar price tag though. Optimistically, you can fit about 9000kg of pitchblende in the box, which gives you say about 8000kg of uranium, which nets you about $440k / day at current uranium prices. Which isn't a bad revenue, but will take you about two millenia to see a good rate of return.

That's probably an upper bound on the rate of return you can see with this box directly - there are plenty of more valuable elements, but the rest are mostly made valuable by their scarcity.

It's a bit of a boring solution, but I think the most profitable thing to do with this box is auction it off. There are plenty of eccentric billionaires who'd want it, and the big mining and chemical companies are both loaded and better placed to use it than I am, both in terms of expertise and existing infrastructure. Also they'll want to study it, regardless of any claims as to the futility of doing so.

So, do whatever to bootstrap enough money for a marketing campaign if you don't already have it (recycling of dead electronics is almost certainly valuable enough to net you a couple grand a day, so do this for a few months. You won't be loaded, but you'll now have a nice nest egg of a few hundred k). Now do a big public demonstration showing this cool thing you have.

Once people are aware and interested, set up an auction with a reserve price comfortably over a billion, then use the proceeds to buy a new box. Repeat once a week until you stop getting takers.
