One way to munchkin this would be to produce calcium 48, this has a market cost of about $250k/g and an isotopic abundance of 0.2%. Calcium Carbonate has a market price of about $500/tonne, and a density of 2.7Tonne/m^{3.} This gives us about 5kg of isotopically enriched calcium 48/day. The sale of this on the open market would of course depress the value of the material but if we were to use this instead use it to buy more devices you would be able to get exponential growth. (Just so long as none of the material leaked). This would then reduce the price of one of these machines to about $2000, which might just make it commercially useful for other ventures.
