Isotopically enriched silicon is useful in quantum computing (also very expensive).

The Processing of nuclear waste is both very difficult and very sensitive to isotopic poisoning so the ability to separate 1m3 of waste in 1 day would be of high value.

Ultra-pure metals have industrial applications, and high cost, so this would allow easy production.

The reprocessing of chemical weapons in a safe manner would likely have significant value. As would the destruction of other chemical waste. (after the removal of high volume components).
