Yes, it works on isotopes. So you could use it to separate C-14 from C-13 molecules, U-238 from U-258, and so on.

Using it to turn water to hydrogen fuel efficiently would work, but would take a while to pay for itself. A ton of water only contains about 100 kg of hydrogen (it's mostly oxygen by mass), so it might be worth around $300, but your profit is reduced by the amount of energy you have to invest to get there. Also there would be the cost of storing and transporting the hydrogen.
