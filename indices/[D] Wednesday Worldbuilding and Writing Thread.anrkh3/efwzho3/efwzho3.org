I have an idea for a race/species of hive-like organisms, which is more-fully described at this link: [[https://irradiate.space/worldbuilding/dancing-robot-warriors/]]

tl;dr: Each individual is composed of subsentient mechanocytes, coordinate to form the individual's body and mind. The individual's level of internal cohesion is affected by the body's ability to act in concert with itself and its surroundings. A body that falls out of coordination with its setting will experience pain-analogue and eventually fall apart as its mechanocytes lose coordination.

Poke some holes in this idea, please.
