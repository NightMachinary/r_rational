I need a comic where Iron Man asks his opponent if they can reschedule this fight because he ate Mexican food last night and is suffering from explosive diarrhea, and the villain agrees because it's understood that this sort of thing just happens from time to time, and someday it'll be them who needs the other person to be understanding and accommodating.
