Writing skills general discussion topic: what do people do about plot bunnies?

Request for specific advice: I have a plot bunny that I'm not sure is in-character for the character it's about, and if it was in the story, it'd probably undermine the narrative. Should I write it to get it out of my system, in a drafts document where it'll never see the light of day, or is there a risk of that causing me to fall in love with it and adding it to the story and undermining it whilst trying to convince myself that it is totally /thematic/?
