I think the most realistic answer is that it depends on the superhero in question. This is an excellent means of showing character and setting. Are they focused on utility and practicality? I.E. wearing normal clothing or a costume more akin to normal clothing, or one of the aforementioned clever zippers

Alternatively, if they don't expect to be far from a bathroom at any given time like if they're in a city they might decide that the moderate impracticality of having to take off the tights to pee is worth it for a more seamless look. This could also suggest a focus on appearances at the expense of sense.

A third possibility is a character with an outright nonfunctional outfit. Why they're wearing it is an excellent question that can potentially lead to interesting answers. Perhaps they're not great at thinking ahead, or some kind of perverse incentive structure results in the costumes being made by subpar contractors, or maybe the one wearing the outfit is simply inexperienced.

TL;DR it's another opportunity to show character
