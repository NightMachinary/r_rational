For some reason I have the "Hero spins around very fast, and when the spinning stops, the Hero is all of a sudden in their costume" - so I imagine they'd be very quick to remove with super speed/etc.

Also, ironman probably has a cath in his suit, and holds his poops? But the ironman suit is very quick to remove too and can be removed in bits so it's like it has a butt flap.
