In comics, the answer is that the author didn't think about it. But in a story like /Worm/, for instance, the answer is that heroes go out for patrols for maybe one or two hours at a time, and design their costumes to be easy to remove. Or their costumes are part of their power, like Lung. Taylor, for instance, has a two-piece form-fitting suit underneath her costume, and her costume slides off fairly easily over that. Rachel and Brian incorporate conventional clothing into their "costumes" - Rachel because it's just her normal clothes with a dog mask, an Brian in leather biker gear. And Lisa is usually better served by sitting behind the front lines, so her costume is less practical.
