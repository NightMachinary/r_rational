Let's discuss superhero costumes.

People with penises generally have uniforms with a fly that allows them to unzip or unbutton the fly, whip out the penis, and urinate without disrobing further. But that doesn't work for people whose urinary equipment doesn't protrude from the body, and it doesn't work for pooping.

Most superheroes are depicted wearing singlets, unitards, catsuits, and similar form-fitting one-piece outfits. They wear these in space, in spaceships, in public, while flying, while sitting, while standing, when performing days-long stakeouts, in trips to the past and the future, and on islands full of dinosaurs. Thus, my question: what explanation makes sense as a Watsonian explanation for existing superhero costume design?

- Superheroes have hidden crotch zippers to allow for urination and defecation without disrobing
- Superhero costumes that are apparently singlets have hidden waist zippers to allow dropping trou
- Superheroes fully disrobe in order to use the facilities, which probably means they hold it for longer, experiencing an increased risk of UTIs and constipation.
- Superheroes wear diapers under their form-fitting suits.
- Superheroes do something else not on this list, like magic poop evacuation devices
