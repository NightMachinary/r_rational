That makes a lot of sense! There are a couple of gaps in my story's /how-abc-gets-to-xyz/, but for the most part I think I have the broader strokes established -- and I've been toying with it for about the same amount of time, if in a little bit of an on-and-off capacity. Anyway, I know I've ironed out any possible plot holes that would require major rewrites, so this might be a good sign that it's time to dig in for real.

By the way, forgot to mention I read your essay about need when you posted it above. "Coference" is a wonderfully useful word, one that's already slipped into usage in my internal monologue, so thank you for that. I enjoyed the rest of it too.
