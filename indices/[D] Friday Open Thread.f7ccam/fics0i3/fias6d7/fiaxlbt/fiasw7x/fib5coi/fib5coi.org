I've been slowly chewing through Wheel of Time on audible; it's standard fantasy but has been enjoyable enough.

Dunno how rational it is, there have definitely been times where I've yelled in my car "Mat you idiot" or "Rand you idiot" that I wonder if I should keep score. Hasn't been bad enough to drop however.
