While I get why everyone, including criminals, deserve as fair a shot at defence as anyone else, I don't think most lawyers would aim for a total acquittal if they knew their client is also guilty as fuck. It's not very realistic either. They'd probably simply try to highlight any extenuating circumstances and get a lighter sentence - or straight up tell them to settle.
