I don't know how those people are planning to be lawyers. Part of the job is to defend the reprehensible. Unless they're all planning to be civil rights lawyers (and there's no way for them to pay off loans doing that right out of school, and there is finite demand for that), they aren't going to be able to do their job properly.

I damn well hope they never have to defend people they know are guilty of heinous crimes. They might deliberately get their clients convicted.
