Arguments regarding emotion are inherently flawed, even if the topic is regarding how people ought to be treated.

  If something makes someone feel bad, that is an objective fact about reality.

No, the objective fact is that someone claims that something makes them feel bad. If there is an objective reality where it is fact that thing A makes person B feel bad, that reality can be indistinguishable from one where person B pretends that thing A makes them feel bad.

Even situations where it may be "obvious" quickly go into murky water. It is "obvious" that bigotry makes person B feel bad. Being called slurs for immutable characteristics is bigotry which makes person B feel bad. Being denied equal opportunity is bigotry which makes person B feel bad. Therefore, since hearing opposing viewpoints makes person B feel bad, it is bigotry.

It is worth listening to the feelings about a matter, but it is dangerous to make decisions based on a completely subjective, unverifiable, and uncontrollable variable. Arguments should be made with emotion, not be solely made of it.
