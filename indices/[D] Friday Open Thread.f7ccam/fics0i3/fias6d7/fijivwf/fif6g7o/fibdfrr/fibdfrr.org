Law school is kind of a disappointment. The classroom environment feels intellectually stifled because of a vocal minority of (in my opinion) overly sensitive and politically correct individuals.

I came to school with the hope of engaging in honest intellectual debate about divisive issues, but instead it's a bunch of virtue signalling and emotional, not intellectual, reactions.

One of my classmates posted an article about George Zimmerman suing 2 democratic candidates for defamation, right after we learned about defamation in class. He (somewhat flippantly) asked for people's thoughts on whether there was liability for defamation. A black girl took serious offense to his post and called him out for re-traumatizing the black community and a couple people piled on to agree.

I think posting the article was kind of stupid but I also think it was an honest invitation for discussion. And it was shut down hard. It's really disappointing that people assume malice instead of ignorance and are unwilling to talk and learn from each other.

Not looking forward to two more years of this.
