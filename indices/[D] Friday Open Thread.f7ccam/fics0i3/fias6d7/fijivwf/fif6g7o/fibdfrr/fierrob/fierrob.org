If anyone watches it, "rational fiction" was mentioned in episode 6 of the anime In/Spectre. I don't know if the origin is the same as how we use it here - the context it is used in is similar but not precisely identical. In the show it's mentioned when a character mentions needing to make up a believable story to deflate a urban legend that's giving power to a ghost, and thus plans to design a 'truth' that sounds both as plausible and intriguing as possible by connecting known facts about the case.
