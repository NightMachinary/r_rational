1. 'Rational fiction' is a genre of stories that focuses on object level plot and characterization rather than attempting to evoke mood or emotion.
2. 'Rational fiction' is a genre of stories that focuses on internally exposed thoughts and logic.

Neither are perfect, and they exclude a fair bit that they probably shouldn't, but I think both are close. (To me, realism and avoidance of contrivance is an outgrowth of thinking-oriented fiction, a symptom rather than a root cause.)
