I know I'm posting in the Friday thread even though it's technically not Friday anymore for most of us, but I wanted to post /somewhere/ and this didn't feel worthy of a whole thread of its own.

Recently I got caught up with r!Animorphs for the first time since The Big Hiatus. I read from the recap up through the recent Jake/Visser chapter before the rewrite happened, and then today I reread the rewritten chapter and continued on through all of what's posted. I have thoughts in no particular order. Spoilers ahead, naturally.

First, I feel a little conflicted about the scene where Marco is dying and asks Jake for a kiss. It was well-written and everything, but as a gay guy myself, I couldn't help but feel a little... uncomfortable. I /know/ how it feels to be a Marco in love with a Jake. I'm also all too familiar with how Marco obviously felt when this plot thread first came to light - his squirming discomfort at the thought of it being the center of attention, his need for it not to matter. There's this quote from the first chapter we really find out about it:

#+begin_quote
  Or worse, the whole thing could devolve into pity, patronage, condescension---could easily, accidentally, irrevocably turn into a story about Marco being fragile, being needy, being somehow less than an equal in their friendship. It could end up displacing everything else, become the thing their friendship was /about/, and things might never be the same again.
#+end_quote

This paragraph sticks out to me because it's so /real/. I've had friendships where one person was interested in the other, and there's very often this terminal sense of unevenness that settles in and kills the friendship.

Marco's dying wish being a kiss from Jake - that feels like suddenly it's "the thing their friendship is /about/." If I were Marco, asking for this would make me feel needy, and Jake's compliance would feel a lot like pity. I can't imagine I'd even /want/ a kiss from someone who's probably only doing it out of obligation. I'd also feel humiliated about /this thing/ being dragged into the spotlight, and on top of that, I wouldn't want to make Jake do something that might honestly be a little weird for him.

So that scene has been weighing strangely on my mind. (Funny how I was totally on board with the chapter where a character maybe had sex with a dolphin, but as soon as there's a straight guy doing a gay kiss, I get uncomfy... but I digress.) The rest of it, I'm loving.

I actually registered the possibility of clones back when Jake woke up after dying the first time - but I conceived it as "the group thinks x character is dead and brings them back, only for the original to resurface, and then there's two of them." I didn't consider /mass-producing someone on purpose/, lol. I'd like to know more about their little language, their numbering system, etc. Most of it was reasonably intuitive, but I couldn't crack how they assign numbers.

Rachel is having seizures and glimpsing the memories of a different Rachel. Among, y'know, other stuff - I got some vibes from that last vision that reminded me of the end of Megamorphs 4, when the fake reality is crumbling around Cassie. Presumably, the emulator in the hypercomputer still has a ghost of the old Rachel's brainstate floating around, and the streams are getting crossed somehow, so bits of that Rachel keep getting mixed in when the current Rachel demorphs. That's a /damn/ cool idea. How is it happening? Why now, with Rachel, and not with any of the other resurrectees? I'm stoked to learn more.

I can't quite decide how much of Esplin and how much of Alloran there is in Visser Three. On the one hand, he seems to have a smooth blend of memories from both in equal measure. On the other hand, he only really has the goals of Esplin. And on the bioengineered third hand... I don't actually have a third thing, I just wanted to make this dumb joke.

Ante doesn't quite have me yet. I believe he's trustworthy and strong-willed and all, but I'm not emotionally invested in him the way I am with, say, Garrett. (Whom I /love/. Garrett is a /beautifully/ realized character. I mention him specifically because, even though all the characters are sorta OC's to an extent, Garrett's the only /real/ OC. I was sad to see him get reset so far back, back to only having known the others for a month, but I of course understand that it had to be done. Ooh, /unless/ - apparently the Ellimist keeps a backup of everyone's brains even after they demorph - maybe they'll fly up to space, fight God, and redownload all the "lost" memories from their alternate selves, or something? Might get complicated for Marco....) Anyway, if Ante sticks around in a psuedo-Animorph, non-narrator capacity like Tom did for a while, that'd make sense to me, especially with him being introduced here, in the endgame. But we'll see!

That semi-Visser-hemi-Andalite-Chronicles thing with Edriss and Elfangor sounds like a ton of fun. I wonder if that will ever be explored in depth, or if there's room for a fanfic of a fanfic?

And lastly, as my train of thought peters out, I seem to have found a typo in Chapter 39:

#+begin_quote
  ‹I don't want it to---to not be okay to shout, or something,› I continued. ‹Like you're trying *to* hard not to piss me off that it---that I feel like I'm hurting you if I do.›
#+end_quote

I think that's supposed to be "so," right? Summoning [[/u/TK17Studios]] . I feel like there may have been another one higher up, but I didn't write it down :(

And now that you're reading this, dear author, I'm compelled to try (and fail) to describe how much I love this fic. It's so incredibly well-crafted, it's hard to express. I used to view fanfiction as this thing that's just uniformly /pretty bad/, and this story has proven me incalculably wrong. I wish so desperately that I knew more people who read Animorphs so I could share it with them and they'd fully appreciate it - while a stranger to the series would easily enjoy your story for what it is, they wouldn't have the background knowledge that makes it so breathtaking. You've teased a logic and symmetry out of the Animorphs universe that simply wasn't there in the original series. Every twist and turn of the story is /fascinating/, the basic writing is like candy for my brain, the characters are like people. Like /different/ people - you have this profound grasp on what it's like to live inside different heads, to think in different shapes - like, it's not just that people /have different thoughts/, but that they fundamentally /form thoughts in different ways/, like the very nature of thought itself is unique from person to person, and you've /captured that/. Your version of the Animorphs universe is such a perfect lens through which to view that concept, and you've executed it with /stunning/ deftness, in dazzling colors. I can't wait to see how it all ends, and I'll be right here with you and your characters when it does.
