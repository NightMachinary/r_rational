  First, I feel a little conflicted about the scene where Marco is dying and asks Jake for a kiss. It was well-written and everything, but as a gay guy myself, I couldn't help but feel a little... uncomfortable.
#+end_quote

"Uncomfortable" was absolutely the intended effect. I don't know if it's ever been made explicitly clear on reddit, but I'm not straight, either, and the single dominating story of my life from ages 10 to 18 was a slow-motion crash-and-burn of falling in love with my straight best friend and then everything going all to hell.

The way I envisioned this scene in my head was something like this:

- Jake is begging Marco to lighten up, let go, be vulnerable for a second, stop /taking care of everybody/ and /be real,/ dammit.
- Marco, /thinking/ that Jake is in-the-know about Marco being in love, is like, ah, fuck it, why not. He's taking Jake's emotional reaching at face value, and thinking (without words) something like, if this is literally the end, if these are my last ten minutes alive, there's one thing that I've wanted for a while that I could get, if and only if it's freely given, and he's shouting at me to let myself want things/let myself feel things, so sure, I guess I'll ask, conditional on the belief that he'll say yes /only/ if he means it. I wouldn't ordinarily ask because I'd be afraid of like guilt or pressure or weirdness or whatever, but he's right, I've been sort of seizing control by doing all the being-grown-up myself.
- Jake's face twists up in confusion
- Marco's like OH FUCK, NO, SHIT, HE DIDN'T /KNOW??/ NO, NO, CTRL-Z, I was only willing to even make the request conditional on the context of this already being a thing that we had in common knowledge and that clearly /hadn't/ warped our friendship. I wasn't signing on to make this request in a sudden, out-of-the-blue, dying-man's-last-wish context, FUCK, that's the EXACT OPPOSITE of what this was supposed to be---
- Jake, knowing Marco through and through, knowing how hard he's ... curating? ... their relationship, knowing that Marco's mind is /absolutely/ spiraling on this right now and that there's no quick way to convince him that /it's actually fine, Jesus Christ, calm down/, takes the quickest possible route to making it not-a-big-deal and shutting up that part of Marco's mind and is just like, look, dude, here. Smooch. Now let it go and bring your mind back into the present moment here with me, instead of being all inside-of-your-own-mental-model-of-the-consequences. Look at ME, buddy. I'm right here with you.

And yeah, all of that should feel /insanely uncomfortable,/ in my opinion. Like, one of those situations where they both care deeply about each other and they're both trying to do the right thing, and it's that very fact that makes everything twisted and difficult and horrifying and no, no, no, this isn't what we were trying to make happen---

#+begin_quote
  If I were Marco, asking for this would make me feel needy, and Jake's compliance would feel a lot like pity. I can't imagine I'd even want a kiss from someone who's probably only doing it out of obligation. I'd also feel humiliated about this thing being dragged into the spotlight, and on top of that, I wouldn't want to make Jake do something that might honestly be a little weird for him.
#+end_quote

Exactly. Marco mistakenly thought that Jake was trying to send the message "It's /not/ needy in this context," or maybe "It's /okay/ for you to be needy for a minute, you're /literally dying,/ stop insisting on having iron self-control literally all the time." And when he found out that this was a (slight) misinterpretation of what Jake was saying, he was extremely dismayed.

As for the rest of what you wrote---I couldn't find many places to offer a response that wasn't spoilery or whatever, but thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you. It was amazingly warm and fuzzy to wake up to this comment, and I'm so glad the story is working for you; this is the sort of thing that makes it feel like it's worth writing and I'm not just alone at a keyboard entertaining myself.
