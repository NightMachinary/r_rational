I spent about four months thinking and planning, which was enough to get a vague sense of the whole story and a pretty solid sense of the first ... 10? ... chapters, and then I just dived in. I think this was better than trying to square more stuff away at the outset, because even though I've been frantically scrambling to keep the thing going and to keep up with plotting and planning, having only half-baked preconceptions about direction /also/ allowed the characters themselves to sometimes tell me where the story ought to go, and allowed input from readers to make things better than they otherwise would have been.

(Where we currently are in the story is me sort of pathfinding reasonable and plausible lines from the evolved state of things toward a set of events that I want to occur in the near future, which feels eerily like being the Ellimist/Crayak.)
