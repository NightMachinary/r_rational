Beautiful. If discomfort was the intended takeaway, then you nailed it. I guess I just misinterpreted the tone.

  I don't know if it's ever been made explicitly clear on reddit, but I'm not straight, either

Uh, I hope this doesn't come off as creepy, but I actually /did/ know you aren't straight. I googled you after I read the chapter on the mesa. You captured the not-straight condition /so/ well that I became convinced you had insider knowledge. So I googled you, hoping it would confirm my suspicions, and it did. Haha.

Can I ask how long you spent in the planning stages before you started writing and posting chapters? I've been playing around with a ratfic setting of my own for the past couple of months, and I think I have most of the building blocks in place to go ahead and start really writing the thing. It's got me curious how long it took you to get your longer, more comprehensive story to the same point.
