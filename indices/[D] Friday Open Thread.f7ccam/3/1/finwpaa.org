"Stories that make the reader feel like everything makes sense."

Plot holes are bad because they make the plot not make sense. Worldbuilding is good because knowing the greater politics makes the story's politics make more sense. Villains are generally smart because most of the time it doesn't make sense for the BBEG to be an idiot (notably, an idiot can be an idiot, and smart people can do idiotic things /as long as it makes sense/)

It also doesn't have to make sense all the time, but if something doesn't make sense then it should make sense later with more context. (Leaving questions unanswered is slightly different. "How did Wizard-guy get from point A to point B so fast?" doesn't make sense if we don't know that Wizard-guy has a rare teleportation relic. "Who made that rare teleportation relic?" is an unanswered question that nonetheless doesn't harm the 'makes sense' of the story if something like 'any number of strong wizards from centuries ago could've made it' is an answer that makes sense in the setting).

The idea of 'making sense' goes beyond internal consistency (which we already espouse) and avoids rational-fiction-is-good-fiction because 'making sense' is only one part of the whole of narrative enjoyment and something that, to most people, can be traded away to some degree in exchange for other important qualities if necessary.
