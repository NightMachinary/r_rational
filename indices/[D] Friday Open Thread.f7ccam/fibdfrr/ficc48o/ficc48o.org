I think if you came to law school for any reason other than 'to receive credentials necessary to practice law' you are setting yourself up for disappointment. In particular, I wouldn't get your hopes up about engaging in debates. Most people, I expect, are there for their credential. It seems unreasonable to expect them to do or say anything that endangers that outcome.
