  If something makes someone feel bad, that is an objective fact about reality.

Yes, but the problem is that in certain specific professions, such as law, it is inevitable to deal with subject matters that are likely to make you feel bad. Therefore, managing those feelings is essential for those in such professions, because otherwise they won't be able to perform them properly. Just like a surgeon who's afraid of blood, how can a lawyer do their job if they feel not just anger or indignation at injustice - that's absolutely fine, in fact I'd rather have that than completely amoral psychopaths - but paralysing amounts of it, enough to reject the discussion altogether? A passionate but more controlled response is to analyse your own feelings and rationalise /why/ you think Zimmerman is a piece of shit and doesn't deserve to win a single cent of restitution in this lawsuit, by the law. Or if the law actually agrees with him, where do you think its moral failures are.
