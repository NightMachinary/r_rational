What if you're actually wrong and the people you think are ridiculous and oversensitive have insights and information into how society is structured that you lack due to differing experiences? Something to think about, maybe.

Arguments from emotion aren't inherently flawed either, assuming that the subject of argument relates to how people ought to be treated. If something makes someone feel bad, that is an objective fact about reality. It's quite possible that something you assume people are irrational and overly emotional about is actually just something that personally effects them instead of just being an abstract intellectual idea they can consider with a cool distance.
