That seems like the practical suggestion, and what I would probably end up doing. Part of it makes me sad, though -- it perpetuates social isolation from dissenting opinion, preserving existing echo chambers and creating new ones ("but this one's /different/!"), rather than challenging and being challenged. Evaporative social effects, etc.

On the other hand, I believed some stupid things in college, in a way that I wonder if I might have grown up sympathizing with at least some of the over-the-top be-nice-to-people PC tiptoeing if I had been born to be college age now.
