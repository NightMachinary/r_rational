[[https://scribl.com/books/P2A75/quarter-share][Golden age of the solar clipper]] is availible for free on scribl, and its a series of several books. quite good scifi slice of life.

[[https://scribl.com/books/P6D93/how-to-succeed-in-evil-the-novel][How to succeed in evil]] is a fun deconstruction of the superhero genere, from the villian point of view. the story of an evil efficiency consultant who is quite rational, his secretary, and a crass midget lawyer who cheats at golf. also free on scribl.
