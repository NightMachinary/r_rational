I use a text to speech program on Android. That could expand your options a bit (works with any epub you can find drm free, plus webnovels if they have long enough chapters).

Plenty of people hate the roboticism of tts though - although comparatively I can't stand the slow pace of human speech for audiobooks. Ymmv.
