  What if you're actually wrong and the people you think are ridiculous and oversensitive have insights and information into how society is structured that you lack due to differing experiences

I acknowledge that everyone has a very different set of experiences and I believe that sharing those experiences and learning from each other is largely beneficial. I want to learn. That's a core component of the problem that I'm facing.

The people that I'm talking about /don't/ share or teach. If your viewpoints don't align with theirs, there is no reasoned discourse to show you why your viewpoint could be wrong. They publicly shame and assume malice instead of ignorance.

I'm not saying that this behavior is absolute. It's likely that if I engaged in a 1-on-1 conversation, we would be able to have a principled conversation where both sides learned. But the default is that in classroom and group settings, some classmates speak out in a way that does not encourage learning and discussion.

Yes, some topics can be triggering. But we're literally paying to be here to learn about homicide, rape, institutionalized racism, and domestic assault. This should be an intellectual safe space, not a blanket safe space to avoid all topics of discomfort.
