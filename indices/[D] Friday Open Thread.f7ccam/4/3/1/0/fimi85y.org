  I'm not saying that this behavior is absolute. It's likely that if I engaged in a 1-on-1 conversation, we would be able to have a principled conversation where both sides learned. But the default is that in classroom and group settings, some classmates speak out in a way that does not encourage learning and discussion.

So, the debate arena isn't a one-on-one exchange of views. Rather, it sounds like your classmates are treating it as a spectator sport with themselves as the performers. Their aim is /not/ to persuade the person that they are debating to change his mind, because that is one person. Rather, their aim is to persuade as many members of the audience as possible to support them - gaining more supporters, albeit with weaker arguments.

Because they're trying to gain supporters /whether or not/ their position is correct (or possibly because they're trying to practice tools useful even when advocating a position that is either incorrect or too nuanced to clearly explain to a crowd) they appeal to emotion and use crowd-swaying rhetoric to support their points.

This implies that they're not interested in being correct. They're interested in being /accepted as/ correct, and cheered on by their peers.

Does this match with your experience?
