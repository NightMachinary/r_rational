Try finding a small group of people with similar goals to yourself, and start studying with them. I'd suggest starting out with a single person, then expanding the group from there.

Don't be afraid to reject people from the group if you don't think they have the right mindset, or would otherwise detract from the discussion. Make sure rules are in place to ensure that good discussions are taking place too.
