Maybe you could do a Twilight Zone-esque story that's just about living in a world where this technology exists. The only thing I can compare it to is the Black Mirror episode, An Entire History of You, my least favorite episode of the otherwise brilliant series. The first few minutes show off some interesting ideas like having your memories scanned by airport security and even a lawsuit where someone would use their memories as evidence that their parents didn't give them enough attention growing up. Why couldn't that have been the plot?

Sadly, the rest of the episode is about some asshole fighting with his wife and suspecting her of having an affair, which was boring and didn't have a coherent theme. There were still some cool details, though, like parents watching their child's memories when they come home or couples reliving past erotic memories when they were angry or unsatisfied with each other.

The only other thing I can think of to add to this discussion is the question of whether having your memories used as evidence in a trial would be considered a form of self incrimination, and therefore protected under the Constitution. That would certainly make for an interesting debate as to the purpose of the legal system, does objective fact outweigh someone's rights?
