It's always seemed to me that you can use the False Memory Charm in Harry Potter to get around the limitations on Time Turners. There's already acausal bootstrap paradox going on all the time with Time Turners, so why not just get someone to FMC your past self into remembering what you remember, thereby freeing you from the reality of any events you hated by making them bootstrapped magical delusions?

Also, Total Rickall is my favorite episode of Rick And Morty. Great premise implemented very well.
