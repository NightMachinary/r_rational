I've had the idea kicking in my head for a while now of a Gilderoy Lockheart who absorbs people's memories and personalities when interviewing them, who stops being a fame obsessed individual and starts to be a collective embodying all the most successful unknown heroes of the past hundred years. Competent Lockheart stories seem fun with a lot of potential, to me. Most authors I've read who've attempted it have been weird, but the premise is solid. Need to think of a way to derail canon somehow, of course.
