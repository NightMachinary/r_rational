With the caveat that I'm a software engineer, not a neuroscientist:

/The 6th Day/ uses a fairly common depiction of memory, also employed by movies like /Inside Out/, where memories are like video files that are stored in some kind of filing system to be played back at a later date. This is common sense and easy to depict, but it's wrong in many ways.

1. Memories change. Every time you access a memory, it goes "back on the shelf" different from how it was when you pulled it out. In other words, remembering things is a read/write operation, not read-only.
2. Memories are incomplete. They tend to have the detail filled in when you remember them, either from context or other memories. In other words, the "video file" is highly compressed and depends on algorithms to correctly give the appearance of detail (and some of this detail is just made up on the spot).
3. You don't tend to remember unimportant things. Similar to the previous point. If you have a 20-minute commute, it's unlikely to generate any memories for you at all. So a lot of the "video" just goes straight in the garbage (/Inside Out/ gets this more or less right, which is rare).
4. Memories are linked, in a couple ways. First, they're linked between senses; you might have a smell memory of an event and a visual memory of an event, and these aren't stored in the same place in the brain. Second, memories link to each other; pulling up one memory can tend to pull up a different memory. These links get strengthened every time you remember something, but they can also get incorrectly linked. So your video file is actually separate video/audio/odor files from different places cobbled together and with metadata pointing towards other different files in a complex network. (You don't tend to have a thousand memories of your mother's face, you have just one memory that all the other memories link to.)

So if you wanted to be accurate about /how memory works/ you would be better off showing it as a complex network of pieces that link to each other, where links are strengthened and weakened over time as memories are accessed, and where memories are more on-the-spot /reconstructions/ of past events than they are /recordings/ of events.

To be clear, I'm talking about long-term conscious memories only; there's also procedural memory, sensory memory, and short-term memory, but those aren't terribly prevalent in fiction. And there are lots of gaps in what we know about memories, I'm not pretending that we have /that much/ of a grand unified theory of how memory actually works - it just doesn't work like a long video file, nor like files stored in a cabinet.
