I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/26wgfe/d_the_sixth_day/][mentioned this]] before, but the guilty pleasure Arnold Schwarzenegger movie /The 6th Day/ contains a /really, really/ overlooked technology. The movie is about clones, and to a lesser extent personal identity and the concept of self, but beyond the physical technology of cloning a person, they also have the technology to grab a person's entire brainstate with a flash of light to the eyes, which can then be stored on a hard drive the size of a sandwich. Worse, the memories can be played back like a video. Leaving aside all the technical problems there (MEMORY DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY, GOODNIGHT!), it strikes me as an awesomely powerful technology that's basically used for a tiny sliver of what it should be.

I don't know how to turn that into rational fiction. Maybe you could justify keeping the technology secret because stealing memories from people is enormously useful if they don't know those memories are being stolen. That implies a plot where the protagonist's entire memory file has been stolen and is being used against them, which might be fun. ("Keeping the technology secret" is a tall ask though, simply because of how many precursor technologies are necessary.)
