This story always felt a little lazy to me. Even excluding the setup of the situation, which is at best, problematic, I think it's OOC for Harry to be this rash this late in the story. It's also a little unbelievable that it takes that much computronium of memory for a task as simple as simulating a human mind, to any level of fidelity.

I dunno, the gotcha just doesn't feel earned to me.
