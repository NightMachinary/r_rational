That's a poorly designed system, if it allows a viewer at a lower privilege level to listen to the password of a higher one.

In fact, I'm surprised he was allowed to view the logs of a higher-privilege user at all.

And that Fawkes was willing to do what he did. Taking Harry to the Source of Magic is one thing, but a member of a species known for its extraordinary loyalty /stealing/ something from its bonded partner... seems unlikely.
