It is indeed a poor system, but there would be no story to tell without a flaw. Someone else mentioned that Atlantis is broken, and with only one core online the entire thing may be operating in emergency mode. Perhaps the other cores were meant to supplement remote viewing and ensure no one viewed anything sensitive, or maybe the rod only started working after a great part of Atlantis suffered critical failures as a sort of emergency maintenance device.
