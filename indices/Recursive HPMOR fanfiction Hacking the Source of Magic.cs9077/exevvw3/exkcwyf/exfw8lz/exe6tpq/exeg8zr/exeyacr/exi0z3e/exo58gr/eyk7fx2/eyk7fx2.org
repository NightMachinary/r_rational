Me reading the story:

“Well this is good so far”

HPJEV: “god-computer make more computronium”

Me: oh god oh no oh shit oh fuck WHAT HAVE YOU DONE??

God-computer (source of magic): >! turns earth and much of the solar system into computronium before decanting the resurrected hermione granger onto the airless surface of the computronium sphere.!<

Hermione: dies because that's what humans do when dumped into vaccum.

all other humans are dead because they got turned into computronium. afterlife may or may not be functional it's an existential catastrophe either way so in practice it matters very little one way or the other as in both cases no one can interact with the real world

Me: /thanks/ HPJEV you destroyed the world because you failed to spend 5 fucking minutes thinking about what could go wrong or even talking to a semi reasonable adult

TL;DR A good story with a very “thanks I hate it” ending.
