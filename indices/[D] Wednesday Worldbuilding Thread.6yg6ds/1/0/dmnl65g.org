Shipping takes a lot of energy. Lifting takes more.

One of our most energy-efficient ways of shipping is container ships. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_M%C3%A6rsk][Emma_Maersk]] is a big one, carrying 55k tons of cargo, with a 47 km/h top speed, and an 81 MW engine. Working all that out, it has an efficiency of 8.86 kg * m / J. That is to say, given one joule of energy, it can move 8.86 kilograms of material (including +both cargo and itself+ /only the cargo, and not itself/) a distance of one meter.

If you use gross weight instead of net (and count it as moving the ship too), the efficiency rises to 27.4 kg * m / J. For comparison, a person walking (with no cargo) has an efficiency of 0.3 kg * m / J, or 100x the energy burned to move the same load the same distance.

--------------

All of the above is pure inefficiency, as no thermodynamic work is being done at all. Lifting against the force of gravity, on the other hand, requires work.

I'll assume that your planet has 2% stronger gravity than Earth (because 10.0 m/s^{2} is nicer than 9.81 m/s^{2}). That would work out to 0.1 kg * m(up) / J. 3x as hard as walking, or 88-274x as hard as shipping. *That 3 km of lifting uses /at minimum/ (assuming perfectly efficient mechanisms) as much energy as 9 km of walking or 264-882 km of shipping.*

Flying is almost certainly less efficient than walking, so you need to add energy requirements for that too, and remember that the walking and half of the shipping calculations are based off of the mass /including/ the transporter, not purely the cargo.
