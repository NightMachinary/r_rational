I guess that would be a big problem , teleporting things so high would also be dificult so the city would have either be almost autosuficient( that would need plants capable of surviving at that heigh) or have a lot of transports . Some people would have access to magical bags of holding that would allow them to transport more things , those actually spend energy to let you lift things ignoring their weight and would have to be charged often , but there is a source of the magical energy required in the city(that's one of the reasons people would want to live there) so that would help.Also there are multiple ways of teleporting things, althogh all of them have problems whith teleporting things to high places.

The problem is that even then I'm not sure if that is enough to make the city viable, I guess could put really strong air currents towards the floating islands , which help getting things there , and makes sense by the way the floating islands work, and it also makes sense that flying moves would work easily near the floating islands , so the pokemon get extra energy for free for the wind manipulation shenanigans that help then to fly.

Things will probably still be expensive there, but not so prohibitively expensive that the city won't be able to exist.
