Is there any reason that I'm overlooking why building a city in magically floating terrain at between 3 and 6 km of height would be completely impractical and wouldn't happen even if there was valuable resources there and it was a convenient place to live because other reasons?.What engineering problems would have to be solved ? , any other cosequence of living in group of floating islands that would impact how the inhabitants live their daily lives ?

Details:

-The inhabitants are mostly flying Pokemon , they can fly and survive the lower pressures and oxygen concentrations during ,and at lest some of them can carry multiple times their weight , and low mass high value things can be teleported.

-The city would be floating over the ocean , near the continent and other cities in the coast, so I guess transporting food could be a problem , but there are solutions to this , and the city would have an abnormal number of people working on transporting things by air anyway .
