I recently have an idea on a kind of thinking and technological axis.

Esoteric-Exoteric and Magic-Technology

Magic is the power to disregard the laws of nature to get what you want. Technology is learning and using the laws of nature to get what you want.

Esoteric is the idea that only the mind/soul exist and reality is just a dream/illusion, that power comes from within. Mysticism basically. While Exoteric is the idea that the world around us is real, and not some dream, that power comes from without. Science basically.

When combined, it gives off interesting basis on things. Esoteric-Magic and Exoteric-Technology are the usual Mystic Magic and Hard Sci-Fi Tech. Esoteric-Technology would be divine revelation, the spark of mad genius, the leaps in advancement. While Exoteric-Magic would be the more rational magic systems.
