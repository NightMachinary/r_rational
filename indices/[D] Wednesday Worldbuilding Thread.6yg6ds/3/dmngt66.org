I have been thinking about a civilization that is so advanced that they keep bodies like meat suits. These people keep their brains in "jars" and they then plug those brains into different meat suits.

This society would be so advanced that they would have AIs inside of the jar with the brain. The Jars themsleves would not need the meat suits to move around or anything, to me I always imagined them as more spherical ghosts from destiny. Maybe something like this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/55tmmf/bungie_please_have_festival_of_the_lost_ghost/]] .

I kinda want to see one of these brain jars in a DnD setting where they hijack bodies to use their abilities but I dont know if they would be to OP or what. Maybe with the AI enhanced brain he could memorize ALL spells and he wouldn't necessarily take the powers of his victims.

IDK

You could be in a funny situation where you hijack a goblin's body and using their vocal cords you speak in the traditional scraggly voice, but you use very eloquent terminology.
