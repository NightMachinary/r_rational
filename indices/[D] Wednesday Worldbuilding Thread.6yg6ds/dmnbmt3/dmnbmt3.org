One of the players in my group said that she'd like to play in a campaign set in a fantasy version of the city that we live in, and I'm somewhat taken with the idea, partially because the city that I'm in has a lot of stuff to translate to a fantasy world (there's literally a giant stone tower that sits up on the hill looking out on the city, and we're on the shores of a lake so cold it keeps its dead).

The problem is in striking the right tone in bringing the fantasy elements into the modern world. I know I /don't/ want something like Shadowrun; I think I want a kind of Miyazaki feel to the game, where most things are bright and optimistic, with only the occasional spots of (easily identifiable) darkness. The question is how to approach that from a worldbuilding perspective.

I think my starting place is probably the removal of globalization. There's no McDonald's or Starbucks, there are only small, local shops run by local people, who get their products/ingredients from /other/ small local establishments, and if they /don't/ then it's kind of a big deal, like you order something from a far-off city and it's this long, arduous journey of your package to get to you - an event you look forward to, rather than the machinations of Amazon.

In terms of tech level, I think I'll probably take out guns entirely, both because most tabletop rulesets I'm interested in don't support them, and because you get more of the classic fantasy feel if the police are walking around with swords and breastplates. Cars are in, because a modern city doesn't make sense without them, but probably given a fantasy flair like an engine the runs off a small, captured fire elemental, and there are trolleys to navigate the hills in order to give it the more local feel.

I'm still sort of mulling over the core aesthetic /before/ getting started on taking a map of our city and marking it up, but would maybe like a little bit of input on what constitutes that provincial, PG-rated world design that I'm going for.
