My gut response was to suggest the city building system from The Dresden Files RPG since it's useful for converting parts of your hometown into occult symbolism, but I don't think that's what you're going for. Instead, I'm going to recommend [[https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/16/16250.phtml][Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine]] as the only game I've ever seen where the mechanics encourage creating the atmosphere of a Studio Ghibli film.

One idea I have for this style of worldbuilding is focusing on the interplay between the mundane world and fantastic world. Magic is usually something that intrudes upon the characters lives that they don't understand very well, but isn't usually a significant threat to anyone. The villains are often human and most of the danger people get into is all too real. Even the climax of Totoro was about a looking for a missing child.

The key to this is to figure out where to draw the boundary between the mundane and fantastic parts of the world, and how they interact with each other. It can be a wall around the city to keep monsters out, friendly spirits only children can see, aristocrats with magical knowledge, etc. I think an important rule of thumb is that the story is about a mundane conflict that the fantasy exists to enable.
