Okay, I guess I can talk about a certain snake hypothetical that I have been thinking about.

The scenario is a country of snakes, where the king snake has absolute power and so doesn't have to give a damn about what the other snakes want. However, one day the king snake goes missing without any warning, and years pass without anyone finding him.

The king snake has two official sons: the eldest son is called Work-Snake, because he likes work, like, a lot. The second son is called Bio-Snake, because he likes biology, like, a lot. The king snake also has a countless illegitimate children, collectively called the Rush-Snakes. And some more children who I won't mention because this story will get too long. Since the king has gone missing, his children are now eying the throne, and a succession war is brewing.

The Work-Snake is the most popular snake, especially among the merchant class because they like his work. However, he has a bad personality, so most snakes don't want him to be king, they just like the work he does. Nevertheless, he has a decent chance to become king anyway, seeing as he is the eldest and most popular heir.

The Bio-Snake is a less popular snake, because he is less outgoing and less productive than his elder brother. Nevertheless, he has a reputation for having a much better personality, and a decent fraction of the population wants him to be king.

The Rush-Snakes are a dime a dozen, and have no real support for the throne. Their upbringing was a wreck, and their personalities are a mess as a result. Most of these Rush-Snakes are just plain crazy as a result, so no one really wants them to be king. However, they have a special ability: when supported, they are far more likely to become king than the real heirs. No one really wants to support them though, so this special ability is useless. Or so it seems.

So the competition for the throne is really between the Work-Snake and the Bio-Snake, who hate each other to death and would kill the other the moment they become king.

Our scenario begins when one day, both princes wake up with a (brilliant?) idea: Each can tell the citizens to support them for the throne, otherwise when they become king, they will imprison and torture the citizens who didn't support them. The question is, is this really a good idea? Let's put aside all the spiteful things the citizens could do in retaliation to being threatened, and suppose instead that all the citizens of the country are cowards, and would obey when threatened. Would this threat be a good idea then? I think the answer is no.

The reason is because if one prince threatens the citizens, so would the other. The citizen snakes would then have no idea who to support. After all, if they support one snake, and another becomes king, the new king snake would torture all of these citizen snakes who supported his rival instead of himself. Effectively, the only way for a citizen snake to avoid being punished would be to obey one snake at maximum speed, rushing to make it the king.

But then, the citizen snakes wouldn't need to obey either of the two prince snakes then would they? They are just trying to make one prince snake the king so the other can't punish them. In that case, they could choose to support a Rush-Snake instead. And in fact, it would be in their best interest to support the Rush-Snakes, because of the Rush-Snakes' special ability of being easy to make into the King when supported. So by supporting a Rush-Snake, they would increase the chance of supporting the snake that ends up being King, and thereby decrease the chance of being tortured.

Effectively, the more the first two snakes threaten the citizen snakes, the more the citizen snakes would be cornered into obeying the Rush-Snakes. Which is probably a really bad outcome for the two princes, because Rush-Snakes are plain crazy and would probably ruin everything the princes currently have. As for the rush snakes, they can't threaten anyone at all, because they wouldn't become king anyway if no one obeys them, and no one in their right mind would obey the illegitimate heirs if they weren't being threatened by the real heirs to the throne. Also, the Rush-Snakes are a dime a dozen, many with different desires that go against one another, so threatening the citizen snakes could just result in them making another Rush-Snake the king instead, foiling whichever Rush-Snake threatened the citizens.

So I think that they, being clever snakes, would choose not to threaten the citizen snakes in this scenario, since any attempt to do so would horribly backfire even if the citizen snakes were obedient serfs.
