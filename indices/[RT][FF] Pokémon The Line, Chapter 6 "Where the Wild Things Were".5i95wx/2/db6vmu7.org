Dang, Red sucks at walking. How much is his pack supposed to weigh? I guess if he's using blankets and lanterns and bedrolls and isn't using pokeballs to store things, his lack of physical fitness would make sense given a sheltered upbringing in Pallet town. Though I'd expect both more athleticism and prudence to have been drilled into him by Oak (and through rivalry with Blue). I think I'd like Red's general incompetence more were it not for this, personally.

Overall though I'm enjoying this story. Maybe not quite as much as /The Game of Champions/ (I do like me some competence porn), but more than I did /The Sun Soul/, which IIRC were the two other semi-realistic Pokemon fanfics that managed to hold my attention. I like the seamless inclusion of the old Cubone-Marowak-Kangaskhan fan theory -- it helps add depth to the world IMO. Here are some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/top/?sort=top&t=all][more popular ones]] if ever you hanker for ideas, or maybe look [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NightmareFuel/Pokedex][at]] other [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/Pokemon][resources]] like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fridge/Pokemon][those]] on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/ThePokedexExtendedFanonEdition][TvTropes]]. I take it that Cubone will play a larger role in this story given that it's the main image being used (or does that change regularly? I've only ever read this on mobile where no image shows up, so seeing this thread is my first time encountering it). Also, did you get the "Red finds abandoned Cubone early in journey" idea from anywhere? I swear I've seen it before.

I think I saw Chpt. 1 of this last year and didn't make it through. Maybe skimming it quickly I missed the transition from joke->not and found it confusing or something. It seemed a little crack-y to me, and the tone has certainly shifted in the chapters since. I'm also sympathetic to a lot of SJW-y causes and so the "I sexually identify as a Nidoran." He nodded sagely, ticking the 'M' Box" lines fell a bit flat and put me off slightly. Anyway, I'm glad I tried it again. The writing is pretty solid too!

Also, how far plotted is this story so far? It's moving kinda slowly you're what, like, 1/50th of the way through the game/manga at 6 chapters? I like world-building/slice-of-life-y stuff, but maintaining this pace through the rest of Kanto seems untenable. You do mention that this is the penultimate chapter of this arc, so would that suggest a timeskip?

Are you from NZ? The predicted update times mention it. I stayed there a while back in '11 and while there went on a hiking trip on South Island (I'd explored North Island earlier). My choice of words to [[https://i.imgur.com/ROEqqKQ.jpg][announce it to FB seems relevant]] ;]
