He's making idiotic mistakes, but they're realistic idiotic mistakes, in line with his normal state of relatively intelligent but arising from a lack of mental discipline and perspective. The way he makes idiotic mistakes when he's emotional (whether that's indignant anger at Giovanni's secretary or the overwhelming desire for stimulation in the Forest) makes him more human and relatable, not less.

He's got all the groundwork, really, he just needs a few experiences like these, where things /obviously/ went wrong specifically because he wasn't thinking clearly, and he'll be better prepared to restrain himself and make the choices he knows are smart, even when emotional.
