This is based on an old "urban legend of zelda" to list the trope. Cubone/Marowak share a lot of similarities to Kangaskhan, so the idea was that Cubone is what happened to kangaskhan's Joey if the mother died, and it would have a divergent evolution. This rumor was started back in gen1 before you could breed Marowak, but since the dex entry says it wears the skull of its mother, the original rumor makes more sense than the game mechanic.
