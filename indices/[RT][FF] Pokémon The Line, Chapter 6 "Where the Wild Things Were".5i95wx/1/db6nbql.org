Really good chapter! It was a blast to read. I can absolutely sympathize with Red's blunders in this chapter, the combination of overconfidence and boredom is devastating. I can relate to that! The final scene in the cave was ominous, really enjoyed it as well. So, does the cave actually host a dead Marowak as well as a dead Kanghaskhan? Can't wait to read on!
