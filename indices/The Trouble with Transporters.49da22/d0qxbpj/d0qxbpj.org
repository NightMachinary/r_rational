CGP Grey must be running low on topics. :)

But this does bring me to ask - does The Prestige count as Rationalist fiction? It's basically the story of the first transporter, back when it was still an emerging tech, and the de-constructor part hadn't been implemented yet. Taking an existing SF trope (transporters) and exploring how it (or in this case, it's intermediate steps) would impact a less advanced world is fairly common in Rat Fic. And it fulfills every criteria aside from "The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers."

I think it counts.
