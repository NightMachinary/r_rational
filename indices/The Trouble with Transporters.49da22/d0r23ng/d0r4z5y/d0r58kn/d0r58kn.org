Real world: Well, "memories and associated software and customized hardware". I am my memories/connectome/whatever. My consciousness is recreated anew from them multiple times every night.

Trek world: There's some handwavium in the Star Trek canon that there's some kind of "soul" thing that's stored in the pattern buffer and beamed with the rest of the transmission, which is why you can't just beam the pattern to two transporters to duplicate people.

Yes, there's been a few, very few, cases of duplicates coming out of the transporter, but they're always clearly new people and there's all kinds of handwavium about why "this is a special case".
