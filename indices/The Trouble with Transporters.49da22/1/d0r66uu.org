Being honest, I'm perfectly fine with the idea of a teleporter just sending a duplicate of me to the other side. Honestly, I'd rather it be a duplicator, with none of this 'destroy the original' business, as long as there's some sort of memory-integrator (preferably also FTL) that lets my instances stay informed. Even if there isn't, though, having another human being whose branch point from my current state is some time in our shared history rather than null would be really nice.
