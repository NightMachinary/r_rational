True, having them bundled does have side-effects, just like most bundled plans.

Thinking about the logistics of having multiple local instances. On a short term scale, it seems like multiple instantiation is net negative, economically, beyond doubling or maybe tripling up (depending on your privacy thresholds between instances). But isn't sharing costs with a housemate generally cost-saving, long term, scaling up to the maximum occupancy of the domicile? I guess for long term, it comes down to whether that is a stable social dynamic between your instances.
