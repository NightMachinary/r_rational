I suppose the problem with a transporter is that there is a gap in consciousness if no gap actually existed it would be a sort of different thing. As for dying several times a second, because of the gaps in neurons, I used to think that might be the case, however because you have so many neurons i'm not really sure any aren't firing at a given time.
