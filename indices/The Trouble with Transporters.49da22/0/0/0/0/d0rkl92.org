Well continuuity theory just seems to be the most consistent and defendable, as well as it having an intuitive appeal. For one thing there are considerable problems trying to define anything other than one's continuous stream of consciousness as you. For instance there are problems defining oneself based on your personality and memories since even barring bizarre hypotheticals those are easily lost or drastically changed. For another thing I almost can't conceive of a theory of consciousness that makes any sense, which doesn't define you as your constant experience since that just seems obviously what you are when you're observe yourself.

As for you comment on the other thread which explains your position. One problem is that as you said you position allows one to be resurrected by having one's pattern reconstructed later, but if it's not being defined as a continuous process then how rigid does the recreated pattern have to be? I'm not sure you can make any argument for it being a specific percent so it just seems so staggeringly ill-defined I can't really conceive of any of the implications of it. Hell, you could make an argument that for reincarnation with this theoretically if some other life is created at any point it will have similarities to your pattern so why can't that be considered to be you? Unless you choose to define you based on identity but i'm not sure why you would do that given how that can change drastically at any moment, or what that would even mean.

As for the transporter scenario; since the transporter in question has a delay, if it didn't deconstruct you then you would have had experience, in the intervening time and thus any real world transporter that didn't deconstruct you would be making not a perfect copy of you but a copy of you a split second (or longer) in the past.

Another thing that strikes me about your position is that it does seem to imply immortality via Boltzmann Brain's of course that is obviously not evidence of anything but it is a observation.

Ultimately our ideas aren't totally different, as they are both materialist (presumably) and define you as a process of your brain, but since I intuitively draw a distinction between one's identity and one's experience (which I consider to actually be oneself). Then I find problems with allowing one's definition of self to continue past a break in consciousness.

Ultimately I suppose I do actually hold similar views to the person in the comic you linked, with the difference that since I'm not as sure I think I know which processes count as "experience" since you may /just not be able to form memories during deep sleep/, after all even during deep sleep you have some degree of awareness of surroundings, but that's subconscious and like I said it's hard to draw that line. Still this issue is something I think is actually rather important since it has implications for how we should treat true AI and how to deal with mind uploading, things which seem like far more likely technologies than teleporters. As well as making some potential problems for sleep and anesthesia.
