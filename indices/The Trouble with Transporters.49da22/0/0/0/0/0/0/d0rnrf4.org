I had actually confused you for with the person who posted the parent comment in this thread my bad. I can see the incentive to not use certain words since they are loaded, however they do kind of work and I generally expect people in this reddit to be mature and not easily offended.

I suppose one thing about you position that seems clear is that you seem to consider memories and personality a integral part of you, since that's what matters when talking about "resurrection". Whereas since the only defining aspect of "you" as I see, is your continuous experience, then that doesn't really make sense.

Of course when dealing with this it is important to note that there are often multiple definitions of "you" which for me at least may include "true" you as I previously was talking about as well as one's experience+personality (identity) and the set of those two.

As for boltzmann brain's: I don't get why you think they're unlikely. I had actually thought about boltzmann brain's before I had heard about them in philosophy, and they always struck me as a inevitability. It just seems that given quantum mechanics should give them a non-zero probability and we may have a arbitrarily large amount of future time to work with they seem inevitable. However there are many unknowns such as how long the heat death of the universe might last for, and brains couldn't happen in a big rip scenario. Of course in a multiverse it seems not only do you have as much time as you need for boltzmann brain's, but since there ought to be infinite (or arbitrarily many) versions of you in most theories, you shouldn't fear death in your concept of consciousness. Basically if you think a multiverse is likely then you ought to think you're probably immortal. Of course since you can't experience those perfectly parallel versions of you's experiences now, I don't think it makes sense to say "you" lived on even after they diverge so they don't die when you do.

Still I wonder what you make of this since there are many different ways through which immortality is made likely for you within your theory, whereas the only theory which would guarantee immortality to me is quantum immortality which is /much/ less likely since it is more specific. Of course depending on whether heat death is conquerable by SI, the singularity may allow immortality to me in the future but of course that's a toss up.

My last point in my prior comment may not make sense since I was mistakenly replying to Pluvialis.
