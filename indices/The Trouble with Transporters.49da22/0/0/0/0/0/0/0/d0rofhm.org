I sort of got the feeling that was the case.

That does seems like a major difference in our positions.

Multiple definitions of self was something I was trying to get at as well. A highly divergent instance could be mutually satisfying only in particular respects, and otherwise insufficient.

My understanding of dynamical systems, even quantum mechanical ones, leads me to believe that it is entirely possible that a particular universe is, in fact, unreachable from the one we appear to exist in right now. From my understanding of the universe and of physics, BB-type universe are not reachable, and therefore not plausible.

Immortality remains unlikely in my understanding, since agents that will be mutually satisfying with me /generally/, rather than specifically, is a very small set. I do have some small hope that, as I seemingly approach death, I will suddenly find myself in another time and place (possibly but not preferably with some amount of amnesia or other mental changes), having been recovered from sort of back-up.

Alright.
