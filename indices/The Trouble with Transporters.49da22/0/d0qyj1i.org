Just spent the evening [[https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/49cghv/cgp_grey_the_trouble_with_transporters/d0qpogy][trying to explain this]] to the kind folks over at [[/r/videos]]. Funny how everyone has such a strong intuition about it!

Somebody posted [[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1][this comic]] which is just awesome.
