I'd say it doesn't even qualify as a Rational fic. The characters aren't acting rationally. They're crazy. It's not that the guy using the "transporter" considers both copies himself and thinks of killing one as no different than amnesia. It's that he just doesn't care. I suppose you could say that he's rationally following the goal of publicly embarrassing his enemy and framing him for murder.
