Terminal goals don't require justification. If I desire ice cream, or sex, I just desire those things. They're neither rational, nor crazy, they just are. I guess they could be unfortunate, like if I desired something that is literally impossible to have.

So while a desire to exact revenge might be instrumentally stupid, I don't think you can dismiss a fic as not-rational because the characters' motivations are less noble than "optimize the world." Voldemort may have been crazy, but as Quirrell he acted rationally quite often.
