  For one thing there are considerable problems trying to define anything other than one's continuous stream of consciousness as you.

But why does it need to be *time* continuity, and not *logical continuity*? It's more intuitive, and makes more sense, I think.

For example, software processes, which are executed on a single CPU, aren't time-continuous. They are executed in slices of time. But they are *logically* continuous.

And are you *really* time continuous when you're awake? Neurons fire at rather slow rate. And discretely. What happens between neuron firings? With time-continuous model, you would die *several times per second*.

  Ultimately our ideas aren't totally different, as they are both materialist (presumably)

I don't see this position as materialist. With transporting, all matter is in exact same informational state. There is *no physical difference*. If you believe that consciousness arises from the interactions in the brain matter, you shouldn't believe that transporting means death.
