That certainly seems like a reasonable position, and if it feels comfortable to you, I'm not going to bother bending over backwards just to poke holes in it.

I am having some trouble just parsing your argument, though? Maybe it's because I just sort of agreed with SoundLogic rather than stated my opinion standalone. To clarify, from here on out, I'm just talking about the position that I hold, which may or may not be near to SoundLogic's

One important thing to note, is that I do not consider a hard boundary between 'self' and 'not-self.' This may or may not speak to your point about percentages and divergence and such. In different contexts, different sets of agents in the space of possible agents will be sufficiently similar to my current (and, lamentably, only) instance to satisfy that instance. In some cases, this set is large enough include other people, who don't even have a branch point with my current instance. If that's the case, then I am willing to delegate that task to satisfying people (with the understanding that they may evolve into agents who are insufficiently similar in the future).

The advantages of multiple instantiation, from in my opinion, is that instances that have a branch point in their personal histories seem likely to diverge from one another more slowly, allowing them to remain mutually satisfying for longer (possibly even indefinitely, if memory-integration technology like what I mentioned is available). The random generation of an agent mutually satisfying with my current instance seems mind-mindbogglingly unlikely, but if I were fortunate enough for it to happen, then, well, it's mutually satisfying, by definition. I also prefer to divorce these concepts from words like 'resurrection' or 'reincarnation,' since they seem to paint the right picture, and seem likely to lead to button-pushing rather than communication.

I am fine with my destination instance being marginally divergence from my source instance, since it seems likely to me that they will remain mutually satisfying in that time period.

I don't consider Boltzmann Brains to be plausible at this time, but supposing that they do exist, and they are defined in such a way as to allow some number of them to be mutually satisfying with my current instance, then I would accept them as instances, again by definition.

I simply don't know how to respond to your final point. I honestly just don't understand.

(Also, sorry for possibly flip-flopping between instance-terminology and ordinary pronouns. I avoid using the former for the sake of expediency and not sounding pretentious, so I'm out of practice.)
