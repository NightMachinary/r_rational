Related to this video: I suspect I'm one of the few people who is actually seriously disturbed by the implication of the continuity theory of consciousness, but doesn't think think that makes it less plausible. That comic /did/ actually bother me when I first read it a while ago, though I had been bothered by that same thought before, and yes it /does actually keep me up at night on occasion/.

The only thing that gives me hope is that I'm not sure just because you don't remember it, that you don't have /any/ sort of experience during deep sleep. I have a certain amount of doubt regarding what counts as experience for the purposes of defining continuous experience "me". For instance I'm not sure whether there's such a thing as subconscious experience and whether that counts or where the line between (if any) is between consciousness and unconsciousness/death.

Altogether I'm probably going to want to shy away from general anesthesia if that sort of medical thing ever comes up, and if i'm ever digitally uploaded (through a gradual process) I don't think I would ever want to include deep sleep in my simulation.
