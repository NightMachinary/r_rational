The Emulation

- It's too /early/ for the game to tell Joon that he's in an emulated world. There has to be a twist on it. Maybe he's a non-human entity emulating a human one? Maybe a god, since Amaryllis mentioned that he did something that one had done? It's unlikely that he's a straightforward brain-in-a-jar on an Earth-like world, at least.

- How does Uther/ Arthur tie into the emulation, though? How do the other people from Earth?

- Speaking of Earth, there's no possible way that someone else from Earth (besides Uther/ Joon) hasn't ended up in Aerb. Maybe Reimer? /Of course/ the story would have that one friend who Joon had massive tensions with show up.

Exclusions

- The ability to exclude things is massively powerful, more than anything else we've seen so far. What controls the exclusions? The gods? Something bigger? Does that have any relation to his power?

- Fel Seed's description mentions himself, his spawn, and his brides. Some bizarre cross between Nilbog and Heartbreaker? But Joon's more scared of him than the rest of the world, why is that?

- Doris has about nine million bodies in an excluded area. Does she have access to artifacts that were in the area before it was excluded? If so, she might have a ton of magic that she doesn't have to share with anyone.

Companions

- Amaryllis' perfect beauty is suspicious, as is her bit about maybe having to be a love interest. The game /might/ have the first companion you meet be an impossibly beautiful love interest, but the /story/ we've had so far seems like it would have an in-universe reason. Is her beauty deliberate - does she have an artifact that makes her perfect-looking? But that implies that her look /isn't/ natural, except her relatives looking like her, so maybe it's fantasy plastic surgery or something instead of shapeshifting?

- Fenn/ Joon can't work out, because of course it can't. Relationships that start this early never last. Either neither of them can manage a lasting relationship, or Amaryllis being the obvious love interest interferes with whatever's building between them, or there's something about elves and half-elves that interferes with the relationship.

- Is the Locus' Loyalty 10 bond an ability to grow stronger with Joon? Because that might be the solution to its losing power. And what's more mysterious than a power that seems to be related to creating the world itself?

- One of the next companions has to be a meatshield - we already have a sniper/ artillery, a face/ melee fighter, a battlefield controller, a wild card, and the protagonist.
