  With that done, I started running toward where I'd seen Amaryllis and Larkspur fighting. I got there in short order, using blood magic to hurry my steps, and gave a hoarse shout when I saw that Grak was lying nearby them, bleeding. I ran forward, panting slightly, trying to get in a position where we could flank him. He turned slightly toward me, taking his attention off of Amaryllis for just a moment, and in that moment I saw her lunge forward.

I'd suggest "where we could flank Larkspur", rather than "him". It's pretty clear from context, but Grak is the closer antecedent, so this threw me off for a second.
