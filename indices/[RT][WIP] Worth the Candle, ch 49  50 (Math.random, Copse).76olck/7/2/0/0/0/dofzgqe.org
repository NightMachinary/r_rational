AO3 only supports CSS, not Javascript (for the obvious security reasons), which means that it's probably not possible without some serious hackery that would be beyond my capabilities. I'm pretty sure that you can do CSS-only text hide/display, but probably not within the limited HTML that AO3 allows, and probably not without messing things up for anyone not using the CSS (it needs to work well without either).
