Are confusing things worth posting? Like this:

#+begin_quote
  “I'll need you there,” said Larkspur. “Doris --”

  “I know,” said the woman. “And that's your burden to bear.”
#+end_quote

I read that as Larkspur addressing her by name, and tagged her as "Doris woman". It got confusing later and required reread.

#+begin_quote
  I could tell that she wasn't beyond saving, not for someone with my resources.

  New Virtue: Mercy! (CHA +1)
#+end_quote

This I dont get. MC states that he has enough resources to save her, and then killing her somehow becomes mercy.
