Man oh man! Amaryllis must have had a lot on her mind for her loyalty to increase so many levels, and her thoughts on being a love interest.. I'm so conflicted right now, on one hand I love the interactions and the relation between Fenn and Joon, not to mention how slow amaryllis is to open up but Joons line if thinking made me wonder if Joon and Fenns relationship will last. I hope they do, I hope that they'll at least try to work on it instead of shoving any problems aside or just end it as is at the first sign of trouble like what most writers do. And I pray that there won't be a plot point/clich√© where the MC has to choose to save one and sacrifice the other, I think Joon would have DM'd an interesting twist to anything close to that.

Now, Joons levelling is really becoming an issue, he's like some druggy waiting for the next shot, that mild rage when he killed the horned mage and didn't level up, thinking about how this was 'his kill'.. Imagine if he lashes out at the rest of the crew when they helped him kill someone in the future. Also, is this what happened to Arthur? He got addicted to the feeling of levelling and when he realised he didn't level anymore ruling over his kingdom he went out to search for more exp?
