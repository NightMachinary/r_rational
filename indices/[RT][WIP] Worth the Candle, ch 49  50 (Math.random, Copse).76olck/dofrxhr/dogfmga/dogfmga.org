  Joons levelling is really becoming an issue, he's like some druggy waiting for the next shot

Though he's having progressively stronger reflexive thoughts, he's trying /really hard/ to not let it affect his decisions, to the point that he was dragging his feet trying to be safe while the rest of the party wanted to push forward with the plan. It was their first deliberate large-ish scale battle though, so being afraid might have contributed a lot.

Either way, managing an addiction to something that's extremely valuable for its own sake seems really hard. I suspect he's going to have to share with his party and rely on them for sanity checks.
