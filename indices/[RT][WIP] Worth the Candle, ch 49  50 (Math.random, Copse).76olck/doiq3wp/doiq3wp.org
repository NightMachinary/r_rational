Well done, heroes, well done! Unicorn blood party, everyone!

Also, they now have a magical helicopter. Put it in the Sable, Fenn! You know you want to.

This explains /so/ much.

So, Larkspur wants (wanted) to acquire the Penndraig entads, either for himself or his descendants. After Amaryllis turned his marriage proposal down (because who wouldn't want to marry a blood relative?), he married the next woman in the line of inheritance, then hatched a plan to have Amaryllis killed without being obviously implicated. Which is probably how she happened to be on the plane to Risen Lands, with the Fuchsia Coterie after her. And we already know about Fireteam Blackheart, as well as everything else that happened up until now.

Also, I am really happy about the Juniper-Fenn relationship, and I'm not just talking about the, ahem, romance stuff. In fact, I like that their attraction to each other (if any) is not the primary or most important thing in their interactions.
