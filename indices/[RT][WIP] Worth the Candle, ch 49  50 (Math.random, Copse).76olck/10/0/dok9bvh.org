I was wondering if someone other than me would notice that.

Yeah, if the "gain information by self-tracking" strategy was viable at all (which we don't know if it is), it would have been viable at the new location as well.

  In particular, it seems like Larks should be able to precommit to fighting, then query the oracle to see if he's likely to end up in the post-battle success indicator location. I'm not really sure how the bit about sending others factors into it - surely he could just plan to go to a given location after winning the battle, and P(he doesn't end up there) basically equals P(he lost)?

If he plans to query the oracle first and only go in if the odds of success exceed a certain threshold, he isn't actually precommitting to fighting.

What we don't know here is if in the "alternative presents" the oracle's power still work.

If it doesn't, then when alternate-Larks asks alternate-Doris "is my attack going to be a success" she tells him "that's weird, my tracking powers just stopped working". Then I guess he goes in, because he knows he is a simulated reality so he uses it to gain intel for his real self?

The self-tracking strategy would work unconditionally in this case, all it would take is enough time between precommitment and action for enough alternate-selves with this particular precommitment to build up to get a useful probability reading. For example, if 20% of alternative-presents split from reality within the last hour, then Larks could plan for his alternative-selves to attack in an hour, then 30 minutes take a reading of the probability of his alternative-selves being at the "success signal" location. Multiplying the probability by 5 (since only 20% of alternate-selves were attacking) would give him the real probability of success. It also follows that the real attack would be delayed, because he needs to wait for the alternate-selves to finish the battle and send the success signal.

The problem with this particular scenario is that some simulation inhabitants would be able to learn they are in a simulation (as Larks does, in this example). We could posit that the simulation alters people's psychology to prevent them from noticiting that, and just continute as normal despire tracking powers stopping to work (so Larks would just carry out his precommitment and not give any thought as to why he is not getting any more tracking data from Doris). Either way, it seems inelegant to me and if I were the DM I would not go for that option.

Which brings us to the second possibility, that the oracle's powers work in the alternate-presents as well. This seems to be what Juniper is assuming.

In this case, if Larks only goes in if he gets the success-signal, then none of alternative-selves will go in because they are waiting for the success-signal as well. Hence the coin strategy - some of the alternate selves need to attack unconditionally in order for Larks to get a useful probability reading on whether the attack is a success. Which means Larks needs to precommit to some probability of himself attacking unconditionally (50%, with the coin strategy), because his only way of affecting the actions and decisions of his alternate-selves is through his own actions and decisions.

Anyway, a lot of Juniper's thinking and planning here is based on assumptions and incomplete data (which I like, because that's often how the real world works). It seems to me his implied assumption is that even if Larks can use self-tracking strategy to glean information on whether his plans are successful, there is some non-trivial cost to doing so (time, at least. and possibly payment for additional use of Doris' services). So Larkspur's initial assumptions and beliefs about the situation *do* matter, and making the situation look less like a trap is a good thing. And the whole thing is probabilistic in nature, so maybe Larks has a bad flip of the coin and goes in anyway. And if he does learn that he would fail, all that means he doesn't show up - all that costs Juniper's party is time. Or maybe if he learns he would fail he instead shows up with (what he thinks is) an overwhelming force, which is might as well what could have happened here.
