I'm a little confused about the way Joon thinks Larkspur uses his divination, and how the forest gets around it.

In particular, it seems like Larks should be able to precommit to fighting, then query the oracle to see if he's likely to end up in the post-battle success indicator location. I'm not really sure how the bit about sending others factors into it - surely he could just plan to go to a given location after winning the battle, and P(he doesn't end up there) basically equals P(he lost)?

And if so, I don't see how the forest ambush factored in. Using the cards meant the probability was very spread out, but then they had to wait until there was high probability density of them being in a single location, which presumably means the resultant spread of outcomes wouldn't be significantly wider than if he'd attacked them in town.

If I'm understanding this correctly, either Larkspur had a high chance to win but Joon got lucky, or he was desperate enough that this looked like the best chance he would get. There doesn't seem to be a way that the ambush setup could deceive his probability-querying regarding his odds of success.
