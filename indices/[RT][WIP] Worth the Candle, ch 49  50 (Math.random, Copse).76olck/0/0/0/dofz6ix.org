I've got basically no clue what people actually want in a blurb, so I thought that maybe, if you were one of the people who visited this subreddit and had seen this posted like thirty times now, pointlessly generic would do it for you where other blurbs hadn't.

My problem is that this story is calibrated for my own personal tastes, and the blurb that would get /me/ to actually read this story is something like:

#+begin_quote
  From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that had grabbed his interest. At the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgamation of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world might be trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he had been back on Earth.
#+end_quote

Which isn't wholly accurate to the text/plot/character, but is /close enough/ that I don't think I'd be too upset if that was what got me in. Problem is, I don't think that blurb would work for a lot of people, especially those who /want/ a more-generic power fantasy isekai story (and I'd say that this story is also that, but that wouldn't get /me/ reading).
