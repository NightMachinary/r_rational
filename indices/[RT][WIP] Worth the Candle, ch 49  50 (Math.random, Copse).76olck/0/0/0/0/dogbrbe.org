For what it's worth, I was really put off reading the story for a long time by the AO3 blurb which, yeah, made it sound like generic wish-fulfillment power fantasy to me. (I don't think I ever made it past "self-insert litRPG portal fantasy" to the joke about "my personal experience", even.) I reluctantly decided to read it once EY said it was good, because I needed something new to binge, but now I'm a total true believer.

It's, like, legitimately very good/interesting/inspiring, it offers challenges and interest and themes in a way that a lot of portal fantasy doesn't. (Especially with the hook back to the real world, but also the non-exponential growth curve, the autonomy+existential worries, the gradual addiction to levelups..) I feel like it's selling the story short to frame it as a more conventional thing, and doing so will put off people like me who love some of the less-conventional stuff you're doing with it.

IMO, the comments and upvotes speak for themselves in terms of how much the story will appeal to people reading this sub. And, again, it's a sub full of contrarians who like to see story conventions messed with and challenged, especially by meta/existential/hole-poking concerns like "does this world have a DM, and how should this alter my behavior?", "are my companions' personalities created or altered for my benefit?", and "why should having a stat for a type of magic mean you can level it up arbitrarily?", not to mention "how would smart, powerful people react to someone observably rocketing up skill ladders way faster than they should?"

Maybe you could try a blurb that mentions the standard portal-fantasy stuff but also some of the questions it leads to? (I feel like the standard bookjacket approach would be to talk a lot about Arthur, but that's a pretty slow-burning story thread. Maybe you could hint at that too, though.)
