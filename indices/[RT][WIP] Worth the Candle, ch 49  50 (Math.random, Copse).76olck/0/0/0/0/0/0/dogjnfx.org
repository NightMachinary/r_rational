Yeah, something like that would be good. (My own draft was a little more verbose, which is a sometimes-unfortunate tendency of mine.)

  a vaguely familiar fantasy world My taste would be for something that notes the twistiness of a lot of the vaguely similar bits, like "twistedly familiar" or something. (Because "twistedly" is totally a word, shush.) Also heightens the sense of danger a bit, hinting at "twisted" as in monstrous.

And, hrm. I was definitely giving advice from the POV of "blurbs that would appeal to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]", since that seemed like what [[/u/cthuluraejepsen][u/cthuluraejepsen]] was thinking about. I agree for a general audience an intro that's not just "look at how clever and unusual this is" might be better, though it does stick in my craw a bit (I /like/ looking at how clever and unusual it is, darnit!).
