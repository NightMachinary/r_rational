I just finished binge reading this entire story, and wanted to comment both to thank you for the excellent read as well as to offer a few points of constructive criticism that caught my attention while I enjoyed your work.

First, I found myself on several occasions feeling like the barbed jokes and vicious sarcasm being thrown between party members came across as much more literal than I think was intended. Until I grew more used to it, I was somewhat confused why they all seemed to keep "fighting" with each other. Because so much of the relationship building is based in these comments, perhaps some clarification of body language or tone of voice would make the fact that these are jokes and prodding and not vicious attacks more clear.

Secondly, dispite the meta theme of whether or not Juniper's thought patterns are being totally screwed with by the "DM" and his efforts to think about and look for those changes, he failed to notice that he went from his first kill to finishing off the mortally wounded in a span of around a month and a half or so. This seems like something that he should have caught on to. Similarly, his ability to ignore pain and continue to function is significantly above human norms and seems like something that would be noticed as external influence. These can both be waived aside as the "DM" could certainly prevent him from noticing those things, but given that several other potential existential crises were able to be discovered, I am unsure why these were not.

Lastly, while they are certainly relevant to the story, the fact that all of the interludes of Juniper's time on Earth are related directly to playing D and D seems like it puts a bit of a limit on the potential character development for him. Allowing readers to see him in other contexts than playing a game or living one can help shed light on his interactions with his companions. Interludes with the companion's points of view would also be great for the same reason, but I also understand that they would kind of ruin the subplot regarding whether or not they are even real people.

Thank you again for this excellent story, and I will check back in regularly to read new chapters!
