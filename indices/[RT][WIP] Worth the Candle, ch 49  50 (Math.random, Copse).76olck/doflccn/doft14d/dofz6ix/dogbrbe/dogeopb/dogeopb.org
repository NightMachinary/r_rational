Same here. SI+litrpg nearly scared me off. But I think we're part of the disillusioned minority that's been disappointed one too many times. There's a large reader base that enjoys SIs or litrpgs or even wish-fulfillment fantasies that doesn't overlap much with the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community. To that end, I think a generic and exciting blurb catering to the action/adventure aspects would attract more readers overall. Low barrier to entry, with recommendations (like from EY) doing the legwork for the more choosy readers.

I've been thinking of a summary that combines the best of both worlds, but it's hard to avoid spoilers and for me, part of the story's initial appeal was the unexpected surprise of a thoughtful litrpg.

Here's one:

  Juniper Smith, teenage boy from Kansas, thought he knew the difference between fantasy and reality. He never expected the D&D campaigns he ran to matter. But it's no longer roleplay because he's been thrown into a vaguely familiar fantasy world. His life is now literally an RPG and he doesn't want to die, not least before finding out how and why he's here.
