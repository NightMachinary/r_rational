Games generally have an exponential level-experience formula and, depending on the game, quests give a hefty and often higher EXP reward. So Joon might be assuming that "grinding" kills will net him levels where it could be the difficulty curve or plot significance that determines the EXP value of each target.

That would be pretty troubling because it implies that he'll eventually /have to/ (literally, since addiction) keep seeking progressively harder challenges.

Another problem is that points rewarded for each level might be disproportionate to the increasing difficulty. To put it in perspective: how many hypothetical points would a god have in the skill of their domain? 100? 200? 1000? Or another example: Joon just killed Larkspur and gained one level - if he invested the points in PHY, he most likely still can't beat Larkspur 1v1. But maybe the points are also progressive? 5 points per level after level 10?
