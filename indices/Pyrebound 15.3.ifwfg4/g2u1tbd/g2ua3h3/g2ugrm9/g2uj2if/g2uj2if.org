Dangerous is relative, though. Ram has shown considerable power compared to an ordinary man; he's not quite Superman, but he can move faster and hit harder than any normal man, in addition to regenerating and absorbing ambient heat. Plus he's resistant to white sun and corruption effects. All very nice.

However, Mannagiri already has an "army" of handmaidens, whom he is used to working with, and in terms of sheer military utility they leave the men in the shade. An indwelt man is strong and fast. An indwelt woman is a fully automatic rocket launcher with infinite ammunition, exquisite aim and a variety of payloads which can be swapped out with a thought.

If you put an equivalent handmaiden in Ram's position for most combat challenges, she would likely do better. Consider the moonchild ambush in 9.4. Ram takes a tremendous beating and survives, taking them down first by throwing rocks and then by rushing to engage at close range. Girl-Ram could blast the lot of them out of their saddles in seconds, at that distance from her fire. Even against Manka the murrush in 11.4, Ram played a valuable role, but only delayed the beast (with Pimna's help). Manka was finished off in the end by the other women returning and destroying his foothold. Even before that, the attacking barques were destroyed by Pimna (with Shimrun using his senses to target).

To be fair, I haven't stopped to elaborate all the differences between ens and handmaidens, so it's not clear from the text how many of Ram's powers are shared. It's said or strongly implied that handmaidens also heal quickly, resist heat, and endure the white sun. They cannot sense haranuu, and cannot become ensi. I haven't said as much, but I don't think of them as being particularly strong or fast.

Aaaand now that I've written this epic reply, let me thank you for reading and offering feedback. I do depend on it, even if I argue with you.
