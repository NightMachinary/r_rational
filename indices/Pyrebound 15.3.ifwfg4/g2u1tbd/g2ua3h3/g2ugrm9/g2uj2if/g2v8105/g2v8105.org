I agree with all your points. Given that, let me slide to an adjacent point. Why spend time and resources on having a militia? Why not just indwell a few more girls and have them be the military/police? That would have to be less expensive and more militarily powerful, the militias patrol duties seem only weakly needed due to the social forces at play. So why do they exist?

As a side note: I'm here from your comment on the classified thread of the late SSC.
