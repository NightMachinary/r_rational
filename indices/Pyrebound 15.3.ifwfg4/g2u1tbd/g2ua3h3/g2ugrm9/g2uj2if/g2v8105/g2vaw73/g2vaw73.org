Awesome! The answer to your question is more complicated than you might expect, and ties into--oh, politics, religion, economics, you name it. Appendix A of the print edition will be a detailed analysis of pyre society, including the full answer to that question.

The quick/short version: indwelling more women would not save money. Militia are poorly trained and equipped, recruited each year from the dregs of the middle class, and easily replaced. Every handmaiden is indwelt at infancy and raised in the temple, and isn't really useful until the better part of a decade has passed at a bare minimum, during which time she is a continual expense and somewhat dangerous. When she's grown, she's a member of the social elite and due special consideration, along with a fair share of creature comforts.

Plus, it's just not necessary. You don't need a handmaiden to subdue rioters or discourage pickpockets--they're not the best at nonlethal force, plus there'd be a considerable risk of collateral damage if they got excited--and it would be scandalous on a number of levels. If they got a few more handmaidens, they'd be using them to improve economic efficiency, the same as their sisters.
