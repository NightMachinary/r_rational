Sure is! Handmaidens have to be celibate (can't risk restarting the theocracy by popping out new healthy ens willy-nilly), only so many girls are born in any given year, and men who can't get married tend to cause problems.

Also, having a handmaiden relative has political implications, as with Ram's sister. Any old brat from a hearth will do, since she'll just be going back to serve her own community when she's grown, but you wouldn't want some quarry-worker's daughter in the temple; she might expect you to stop whipping her family or something.

We haven't established what happens to an indwelt adult woman. The system's set up for girls to be indwelt young, and they only come into full power slowly to prevent toddlers from killing people in fits of rage. I imagine Darun would power up rather more quickly, but I'm not gonna WOG that rule. It's academic, since she and Imbri have both refused and I don't see either changing her mind.
