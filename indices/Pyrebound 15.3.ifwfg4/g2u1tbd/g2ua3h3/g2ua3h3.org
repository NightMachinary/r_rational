You know, that didn't even occur to me! It's an interesting thought--but even with Mannagiri's knack for micromanagement, I don't think he'd be able to control them well enough to trust them (leaving aside sexual jealousy). If he did, they might be handy as infiltrators, due to men having generally greater rights and freedoms in this society. For sheer firepower, of course, it's hard to beat a handmaiden.
