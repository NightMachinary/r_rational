Ooh great timing! It feels like there's been several new serials in the sub, with the writers being relatively new to serials. This FAQ is probably the most concise one I've come across so far. For anyone interested, other serial authors have also shared their thoughts on writing web serials, and while there are a lot of common threads, there's a bit of YMMV and anthropic principle.

Personally I think the web serial medium is a dark horse in the publishing scene. Many businesses are trending toward B2C (business-to-consumer direct) and to all appearances, the same applies to the serial scene (or self-publishers). However, this serial format is not for all authors. It requires a certain writing temperament and resilience: web serials have a low barrier to entry for writers, but the path to success seems like a very unforgiving grind.
