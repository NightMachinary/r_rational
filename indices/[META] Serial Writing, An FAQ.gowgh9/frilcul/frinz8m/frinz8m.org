I can definitely add that one, but I think it's fairly personal, and harder to just answer with an FAQ. I mean, I can sum up the reasons that people have given, along with pros and cons of the medium, but it would be more by way of telling people what they can expect out of writing, rather than giving them a reason.

(There are also two different aspects to it, one being "self-publishing online" and the other being "publishing serially", since serial webfic consists of two overlapping categories.)

  *Why would I write serial fiction?*

  There are two components here. The first is writing serially, the second is publishing online.

  The primary argument for writing serially is that you can get feedback as you go, improving the work as you do and avoiding some missteps. This is also one of the big drawbacks: editing is a godly power, allowing you to unmake mistakes, and you have less of that power if you're publishing as you go. Another plus side of serial publishing is that you can abandon things if they're not working out, and rather than investing the time and effort into writing a 100K word novel that no one reads, you can instead write five 2K word chapters that no one reads, then go back to the drawing board without a lot of wasted effort. The initial investment is much lower. (Though note that there's nothing stopping you from writing a full work, then releasing it serially.)

  Further, you can get more interest and discussion by going serially, something that's very clear to see if you look at discussion for television shows that are released weekly when compared to those that are released one season at a time. A weekly series will have more discussion, theories, and conversations. A full season will have less, because there's less to talk about: the mysteries or conflicts set up at the start of the season will largely have been resolved. Writing a serial allows you to insert yourself into the rhythm of someone's consumption of media, staying in their head for much longer than you otherwise might.

  Writing online is a different question entirely. The two biggest benefits are 1) the low barrier to entry and 2) immediate response. If you wanted to, you could put your novel up online right now with only a few clicks of some buttons. There would be no querying of agents, no rejection letters from publishers, no waiting for people to get back to you, no process, just the purity of your words being available to read. If that sounds attractive, then I should issue two words of caution. The first is that "immediate response" sometimes isn't: you can put things up online and watch them flounder, with no readers and no feedback. It's a terrible feeling. Second, if you publish online, you're destroying value to some future publisher. It's <em>extremely</em> rare that web fiction makes it to a "real" publisher, and it also kills value for self-published e-book versions of the story. A book that could have been polished and sold to a publisher might instead turn into something that will only ever languish online, without any advertising or marketing that would allow more people to read it. Maybe you don't care about that, but that's something that you should be aware of.

  Putting those two together mostly amplifies the benefits and the drawbacks of each. Aside from short stories or flash fiction, writing an online serial is the lowest initial investment that you can make, with a disproportionate audience for that effort. If you really wanted to, you could spend the next two hours after reading this FAQ writing a first chapter of a serial, and have people reading it not long after that. You have the ability to increase "production value" just about as much as you have the time or interest, spending more effort on editing, or getting beta readers, or moving to your own website, but the floor of investment is as much time as that first chapter takes you to write and as much technical knowledge as you need to copy and paste text into an input box.
