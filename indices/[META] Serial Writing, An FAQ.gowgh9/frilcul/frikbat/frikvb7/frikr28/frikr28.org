Good read. I'm not a writer myself, but from the reader side, I agree with all the points you brought up.

That said, I guess I never really considered any online author writing serial works aiming for profit. Maybe it's because I always saw any popular free to access content of any kind as starting as a passion project. The idea that a new author releasing online work would be thinking about profit at all seems overly ambitious to me.

Also, your thoughts on feedback reminds me of this [[https://youtu.be/P05ONfLOqmY][recent video from Game Maker's Toolkit about whether game developers should listen to negative feedback.]] I don't envy newcomer authors dealing with this part of writing. The temptation to give in to a strong vocal minority is a hard one to pass up, especially if you don't have a huge reader base to begin with.
