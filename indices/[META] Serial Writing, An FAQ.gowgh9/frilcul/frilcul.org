One big question that I feel is unanswered by this post is /why/ to post serial fiction; this submission contains some discussion of what types of stories seem best-suited to serial fiction, but I think there's also an interesting conversation to be had around which types of /authors/ are best-suited to publishing serial fiction. I think one of the biggest reasons for publishing serial fiction is that getting feedback can be tremendously motivating: writing a 100k word novel in private can be a daunting task, and getting to stop every 2k words or show to share your creation with the world and get words of encouragement can make the journey feel less strenuous. (Some people will also be less likely to abandon a project if they know that an audience is eagerly awaiting the next installment.) On the other hand, not all comments will be positive, and sometimes the feedback can be discouraging, especially for authors who have a disposition that is inclined to pay more attention to negative feedback than positive feedback. (For some, knowing that an "eager audience" is awaiting the next installment can also lead to a sort of performance anxiety.) For authors who want to get the motivating effect of positive feedback without the discouragement of negative feedback, one option is just to ignore comments entirely, and simply bask in the glow of the upvotes/likes/kudos and watch as your follower count goes up. (Royal Road might be the most hazardous in this respect, since it doesn't have "upvotes," and instead opts for a 5-star rating system, which aggregates negative as well as positive ratings from users.)

I'd add that one of the more popular methods for monetizing fiction is Kindle Unlimited, which is generally more attractive to Kindle readers since it allows them to read a story (while financially supporting the author) at no marginal cost. For people who are already in the Kindle Unlimited system, "buy my ebook for $4" is a much bigger ask than "read for free with your existing KU subscription."

The issue, however, is that Kindle Unlimited demands exclusivity for as long as the story remains on KU, with a 90-day minimum contract, which means that if you've been publicly posting a story as a web serial, you need to take it down from wherever you've been posting it (sans the first 10%, which can be publicly posted as a "reading sample"). The consequence of this is that many story pages on sites like Royal Road are hollowed-out shells consisting of just a few chapters plus a link to Kindle Unlimited ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/9000/digital-me][example 1]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25461/haven-chronicles-book-one-eldritch-knight][example 2]])
