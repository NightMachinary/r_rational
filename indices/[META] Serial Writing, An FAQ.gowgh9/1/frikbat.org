  This means that as an author, you're writing “ahead” and not getting any wide feedback until the “free” readers get to it. It also splits the community and risks spoilers.

While I agree with the first point, some feedback is a double-edged sword. It is very easy to fall into the trap of having the characters refute the naysayers, especially when you find a stupid comment that a vocal minority seems to agree with, and that can hurt a story in the long run.

On your second point, it very much depends on where your community is centered. In your case for example, you use discord, which is very much stream of thought and is closer to 4chan than reddit/your average forum. I haven't ever seen a spoiler for, say, delve, which is 10 chapters ahead and posted here weekly. Also never seen one in royal road, but that may be because I'm not brave enough to venture too deeply into that site's comment section.

Still, if a story as big as practical guide to evil did early chapters, I suppose I could see spoilers being an issue even in reddit.

Good post by the way, since this isn't far from web serial: the subreddit, it should probably be somewhere in the wiki. A lot of us are tempted to write something, I think.
