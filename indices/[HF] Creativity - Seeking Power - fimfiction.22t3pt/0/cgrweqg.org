Only a few chapters released so far but the author seems to be releasing rapidly. AU but not drastic changes: it seems like the order of several familiar events has been juggled (e.g. Cadence and Shining Armour are married /before/ Luna's return) but other than these timeline changes the world feels pretty familiar. Context is provided well with a brief selection of scenes from Twilight's early years. Several interesting new characters. Pretty well written so far, I look forward to more chapters.

Edit: Update after more chapters. Still fantastic! Thouroughly enjoying this. Somehow still /feels/ like MLP despite the tone being changed a lot, and some characters a fair bit too. If it stays this good it might take the top spot for my favourite fimfiction from "Days of Wasp and Spider."
