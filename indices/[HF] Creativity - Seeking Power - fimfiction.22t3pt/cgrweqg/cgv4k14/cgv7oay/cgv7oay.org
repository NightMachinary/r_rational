Seems roughly that way so far. I'll cautiously say that so far I like it better than Luminosity, which felt a bit like 'painting by numbers' to me. I think it was a lack of world-building and characterisation, causing me to feel more like I was observing something complex being assembled, or reading an instruction manual for taking over the world, than enjoying a story.
