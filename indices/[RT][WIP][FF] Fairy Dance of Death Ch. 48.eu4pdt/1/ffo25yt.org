For those who haven't read this fic before, it's a rational take on Sword Art Online. It is extremely well written, with a beautifully built and coherent AU. Strongly recommended. It's updated consistently but very slowly.

  AU reboot of the entire SAO storyline, beginning from the premise that Kayaba Akihiko was obsessed with magic and Norse Mythology rather than swords and pure melee. As a result, he created the Death Game of Alfheim Online rather than the floating castle of Aincrad---a world in which player-killing is not a crime, and the nine player races are in competition with each other to reach the top of the World Tree. Multi-POV epic following the stories of multiple canon characters throughout the game.
