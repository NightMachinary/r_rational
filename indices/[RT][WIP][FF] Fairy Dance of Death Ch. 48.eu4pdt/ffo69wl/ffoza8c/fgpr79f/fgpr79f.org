It's an Abridged series, so "rule of funny" always comes before everything, but while its focus is not only being rational, I'd say it qualifies as rational-ish. You get stuff like Kayaba having made SAO into a death game because he tried to cover up for a ridiculously dangerous bug in the NerveGear but really, while that's pushed to absurd limits, it's still meant as a satire of a kind of fuck-up that can certainly happen in real life game development at a smaller scale.
