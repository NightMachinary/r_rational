You know, thinking about it SAO abridged is more rational than the original. If only for the 'Ghost' arc.

Only in comparison to the original, but still that and giving the characters actual character makes it the default voices in my head as well.... Huh, I wonder if theirs fanfiction of SAO abridged characters..
