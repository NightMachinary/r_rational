Second type of faith is not actually much different from the first. It's also situational and can flip according to situation. It's only faithfuls who believe they would be faithful forever and ever, whatever happens. In a reality it's always possible to force any person to change faith, with situational or psychological pressure, or physical pressure or chemicals as the last resort.\\
The difference between the first and second is that first mostly change in reaction to specific type of event - verified knowledge, experiments etc, and the second change in reaction to random events.
