This power (along with sufficiently advanced analysis devices) essentially gives you the ability to "diff" humans by checking what's different before and after a "healing". Imagine what we could learn by effectively using such a power:

- Brain scan before and after healing mental ailments: allows researchers to find the genetic, structural, or mechanistic underpinnings of those mental ailments which can lead to development of new treatments.

  - A brain before and after being cured of depression (or other mental ailments believed to be related to structural or chemical imbalance-related neurological problems within the brain) would provide far more precise information than comparing two /different/ brains, one with depression and one without.
  - A detailed psychological profile of a person before and after being "perfectly healed" of PTSD (or other mental ailments believed to be purely or largely /psychological/ rather than /neurological/ in nature) would provide "perfect" examples of a re-adjusted person after overcoming psychological issues. It doesn't tell us how to achieve it, but knowing the start-point and end-point would be extremely valuable to developing therapy and treatment plans.

- Discover the causes/mechanisms of various idiopathic diseases and ailments that we still don't understand by doing a "diff" (a before-and-after-healing comparison) of people with those ailments. What changed? Can that knowledge be applied to developing preventative measures or effective treatments?

  - A huge amount of diseases fall into this category: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Autism, various autoimmune disorders like Arthritis and Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Asthma, Gulf War Syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, Narcolepsy, IBS, etc.

- Discover/affirm the various factors affecting cell senescence (aging) by looking at various types of cells before and after the "age reversion". Can help us develop means of extending human life without "magic healing".

  - Might be difficult to isolate only certain factors, but at least the changes associated with aging and lack of health would /absolutely/ be reversed after a healing, which would allow us to exclude anything that doesn't change as irrelevant and to ensure that the factors we believe to be related to senescence actually /are/. Would also allow eventual (admittedly borderline-) ethical human studies that intentionally induce certain factors related to senescence to see what happens.

- Allows ethical usage of "knock-out"-style studies on humans.

  - "What happens when a human is missing ______?" - A certain gene, a certain part of the body, etc. As long as the person won't die within 5 minutes of losing it, anything can be removed without worrying.

- Allows (again, borderline-) ethical usage of high-fidelity but destructive full or partial brain scans (and any other inherently harmful analytic methods) on living people, because they can be healed afterwards: can allow researchers to understand structural changes in the brain in response to various experiments involving learning, memory, and consciousness.
- Given the premise that the person is "fully" healed to the point where they are no longer predisposed for a relapse or reacquiring the ailment, it would allow researchers to answer many questions of "nature vs nurture" and "genetic or acquired" that right now can only be partially explored via twin studies.

  - "Is this disease genetic or not?" - After healing, check to see if DNA has changed, if there are changes to gene expression, or if there are any other unexpected changes to the person's physiology.
  - Try healing horrible criminals (especially sociopaths and other "criminally insane") and see what happens and what has changed in detail. - Were their dispositions curable? If so, then what's different before and after? Can this information be used in prevention or rehabilitation? Do we need to change our ethical positions based on the answers?

- I would predict quite a lot of "accidental discoveries" to come about just from healing a few people with each known disease, doing a detailed before-and-after comparison, and looking for commonalities.

  - For example, maybe after healing 5 people with disease X, we find that every one of them had a detectable change in serum concentration of a certain protein, hormone, or prostaglandin that was never thought to be related previously. That would open up a new avenue of research.

It would also allow us to learn other things like:

- What happens to a human mind when it ages well past the original limits of the human body? What is a mind with 200 years worth of memories like? (Obviously a long-term project, but it would prepare us for dealing with the psychological effects of broadly-available life extension)
- Do people in various types of vegetative states have any conscious awareness? Just wake them up and ask them! If so, we may need to change our policies on long-term life-support for people in these conditions.
- What happens when we "heal" people with savant's syndrome? Do they lose their abilities? If so, what changed in their brain? If not, did any of the downsides of savant's syndrome disappear? What changed in the brain to make the mental superpowers available without the side-effects? Can it be reproduced or does it teach us anything new about the brain?

This was a fun thought experiment.
