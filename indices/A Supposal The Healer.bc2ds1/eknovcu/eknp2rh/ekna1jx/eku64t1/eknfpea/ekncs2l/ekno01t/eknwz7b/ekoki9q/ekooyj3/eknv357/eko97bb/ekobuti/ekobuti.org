You can manage a deadlock, but you need to be careful. I believe the trick is to creates a situation where the benefits of leaving her alone outweighs the risk of going for monopoly. She needs to be alive, awake and willing to heal so even the threat of a contingency should be enough to make everyone hesitate. As for the carrot, you just need everyone appeased and looking forward to their next go at the miracle.
