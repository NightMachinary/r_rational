If we're looking at the long-term effects:

Healing anyone based on any particular bias would lead to that set of people having an edge in society (if we only heal those who have a skill that contributes to society, then we have to choose which skills are more valuable, and we can only make that choice through personal bias because there's no way to really measure that. This will lead to eventual inequality, where people with a certain skill-set or natural ability overpower those without.

If we heal people with money, and then contribute that money towards developping better medecine, or possibly even use it to do research on what causes this healing in the first place and replicating it, we still give priority to the rich, creating a wider wealth gap overall. This would be extra toxic for our society, since the newly-healed would live longer, allowing them to accumulate extra funds and status over the centuries, which will widen the wealth gap unimaginably, sending the un-healed poor into slums in which they either rot as a sub-species of human over the milenia, or develop their own seperate society that diverges from the uber-wealthy. The only way that turns out well is if the research actually gives us answers, in which case we would be better off in the long term. But we would still be betting on there being a replicable version of this healing power, and rationally, we need to choose something that has a more certain outcome.)

My proposal: We have a lottery. If our healer can heal herself, thus causing her to live and heal for centuries, she can continue healing generation after generation of people. Eventually we'll start seeing something like in Ringworld, where our species develops a genetic tendency for "luck", which can potentially give us an edge in figuring out how to replicate this healing power. We would also need to start studying the healed people. We need to see how their cells are lasting as long as they are. My guess is that the healing re-writes something, either at the DNA level or the cellular level, so that the cells get a power boost of sorts. If it is at the DNA level, then the children of these people are going to be born perfectly healthy and (semi) immortal as well.
