It's unclear if that'd even work though. Who can she bring back? I'm assuming she could save someone who's heart had recently stopped, but would cryonics work? If cryonics would work, why wouldn't some random skeleton you found buried in a graveyard? The loss of information that cryonics normally prevents clearly isn't an issue here if she can completely cure alzheimer's.

If she CAN bring back the dead, it seems like an immediate priority should be bringing back some of the great scientists and engineers.

If her power works on herself, it seems like her best option is to stay in hiding, bringing back scientists and engineers along with their loved ones in an effort to accelerate research into FAI or other means of immortality and health, along with working behind the scenes to ensure as many bodies as possible have well-recorded locations (this shouldn't be that hard; even in hiding, when Alan Turing and Einstein come back the benefits to doing so should be clear), so that she can work through the backlog and eventually bring as many people as possible back.
