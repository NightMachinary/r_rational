I think perfectly healthy immortal people, on a long enough timeline, will have more children than people who live a normal modern lifespan. It's still a Malthusian problem, but nowhere near the explosion of immortals breeding every 20 years indefinitely. Also, some won't have any choice but to take the option, possibly before having children. Voluntary sterilization isn't a thing I take lightly-- but all in all, a small price to pay for immortality.
