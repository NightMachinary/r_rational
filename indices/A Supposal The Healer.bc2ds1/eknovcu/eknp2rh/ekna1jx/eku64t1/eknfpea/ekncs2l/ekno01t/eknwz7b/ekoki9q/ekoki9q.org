I haven't seen anybody mention the fact that this superpower makes cryogenics /massively/ easier. All those desperate people just need to be frozen solid, and she can work through that backlog whenever she gets time. (In order to prevent this from leading to a population explosion, a prerequisite for this procedure might be an agreement to undergo sterilization immediately afterwards.)

This service could be divided up so that perhaps she heals 25 charity cases a day-- thaw, heal, repeat, first-come-first-served-- 25 research cases like [[/u/Cuz_Im_TFK]] mentioned (whose ticket is paid by agreement to undergo some dangerous or lethal medical research), 25 participants to be selected by lottery daily, and 25 patients who are either personally selected by the healer or who agree to pay, say, ten million dollars (enough for her to live extremely comfortably and more than enough funding for the massive cryogenics facility and attendant medical personnel.)

The cryogenics option works even better if neuropreservation is sufficient for her healing process to do its thing. Just a huge warehouse of frozen heads, we'll get to them when we get to them-- the majority might even be revived by the medical technology gleaned from the research study participants.
