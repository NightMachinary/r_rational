you could prioritize people who have donatable organs, two for one. if we're getting really rules lawyery, check to see if you can heal more than one hundred times, so long as it's not more than 100 people. also, look into gene therapy. you might not be able to fully replicate the healing, but you might be able to extend it to more people per heal.
