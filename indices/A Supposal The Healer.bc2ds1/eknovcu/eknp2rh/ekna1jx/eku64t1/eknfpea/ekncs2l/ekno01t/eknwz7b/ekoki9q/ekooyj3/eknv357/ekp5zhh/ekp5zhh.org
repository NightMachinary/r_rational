some people have the wealth/power to make your life very unpleasant if you don't go along with them

plus you need the wealthy/powerful to protect you

but you also want to do the 'greatest good' with your ability

auction a certain number of slots (say 10 every day) where the elite can guarantee their access

then for the rest set up a 'heal or not' site where people can post their sob story and everyone votes on who's most worthy
