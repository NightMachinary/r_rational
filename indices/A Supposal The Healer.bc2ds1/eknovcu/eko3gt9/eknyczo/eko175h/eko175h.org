So you're treating it as a magical healing/regeneration of obviously damaged parts + the implanting of a magical regulator/omni-organ to fix/maintain health going forward? That would indeed make many of my ideas not work, but it feels like a much stronger superpower than the one my post was based on.

My post allows the "healing" to be as magical as it wants to be, as long as the end result of the healing is no longer inherently magical and is the result of fixing the "problems" with the current body so that it can continue functioning normally as a body. Those are the only constraints that I was working with.
