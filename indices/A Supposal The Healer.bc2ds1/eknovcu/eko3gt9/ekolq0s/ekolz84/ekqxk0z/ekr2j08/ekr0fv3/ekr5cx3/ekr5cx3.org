I'm a little confused to this comment. It seems that you are formally disputing my choice of words as a way of diminishing the severity of the people dying. That seems interesting as you are doing the same in your choice of words 'leads people to kill themselves' rather than 'leads people to mistreat trans people to the degree that they'd rather die than continue the torment', thus implicitly putting the responsibility of the people who commit suicide and absolving guilt for people with said attitude.

That said I'm down for debating linguistics. Are you claiming that the phrasing 'attitude literally kills people' is incorrect because there are intermediary steps?
