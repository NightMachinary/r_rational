I feel like saying one kind of dysfphoria is silly and the other ought to be validated, without very clear criteria, is dangerous. Where does someone who seeks castration because they don't like intrusive sexual urges fall between transgender and limb dysmorphia?

And I suppose, to bring it back to the topic, how does the healing ability get its answer to this question? What's the difference between healing and improving-based-on-personal-preferences?
