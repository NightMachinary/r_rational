While I do appreciate the coherency, the only box that is related to our conversation here is your dislike for what you call emotional manipulation. In all debates people chose words that makes their case seem favourable(i.e. there's nobody who claim that they are anti-life or anti-choice because 'pro' have positive connotations), and I haven't disputed the claim that my wording was deliberately chosen to underline the severity. If we call that emotional manipulation then I've pointed out how your phrasing also is emotionally manipulative and you have yet to really address that claim, including ignoring the bulk of my last post.
