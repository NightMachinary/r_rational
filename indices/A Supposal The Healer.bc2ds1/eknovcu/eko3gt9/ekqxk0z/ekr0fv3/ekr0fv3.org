  This relies on the notion that transness is a disease which, aside from being medically inaccurate, is part of an attitude that literally kill people. I'm down for having no sacred cows but we should keep that in mind when having these kinds of discussions.

I don't think you're appealing to logic when you say that it "literally kills people". It's more accurate to say that it leads people to kill themselves. This is an example of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion]] , I think.
