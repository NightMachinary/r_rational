limbs don't belong to their body = obviously wrong. Their limbs /do/ belong to their body. And it's just kind of silly.

Although.... I guess you could technically say that about trans people too, although personally I would disagree and say they are two very different cases.

But I'm presuming the power would work in the way that most benefitted the person, so with a trans person it would change their body (as they would feel mentally violated if their mind changed) and for a person who feels the limb doesn't belong to them it would change their mind (as their limb is useful and they need it)
