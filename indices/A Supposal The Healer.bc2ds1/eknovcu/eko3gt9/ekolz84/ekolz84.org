I'd say their mind. Dysphoria requires conscious thought. If their body shifted, it would indicate that the power somehow queries you yourself for what you consider your ideal state. Next thing you know you "heal" someone whose ideal state (in their mind) is a monster. Or you can use it to shapeshift, if you figure out a way to trigger dysphoria artificially.

Funny thing, in general it's not actually clear if healing someone without their consent is actually moral due to how the power works.

In general you need a better definition of sickness to make sense of it, and you need to know which definition the "power" is using.
