Worst case scenario: It's magical enough it allows little to no research. It could just magically produce and enforce a healthy phenotype, making healthy enzymes, cells and etc. spontaneously form while harmful ones disappear for example. It doesn't change your DNA, or any indirect biomarkers we can measure it just magically makes it happen. Imagine it healing heart attack damage just by making new heart cells replace the scar tissue with no observable cause for example, it's a cure but doesn't tell us how to replicate it.

This could still be used for a bit of research though, purposely causing damage and studying the effects without killing anyone like you said. Non-manmade would be less useful for research than most people would expect since it heals everything all at once, confounding causes, effects, and correlations to diseases. It would be the equivalent of trying to study a car by having every part replaced at once whenever one thing stops working. Engine running rough? New engine. Alzheimer's? New 21 year old brain.
