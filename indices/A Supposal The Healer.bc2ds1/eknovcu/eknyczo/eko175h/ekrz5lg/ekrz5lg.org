I'm proposing that a ongoing magical healing/regeneration effect is a possible mechanism that prevents most research. Given that it keeps them 21 and perfectly healthy apparently permanently some ongoing effect is confirmed.

I think your constraint is larger than you think: any steps that are magically enforced prevents study of any steps before it. We don't really need to study the end results so that's the worse case scenario, we pretty well know what we want just not how to take it happen and this magic wouldn't help us study that. Any steps the magic doesn't physically change we won't be able to study, and I'm just saying that allows for healing magic that doesn't help research.

The best case scenario is that the magic is acts in one shot: it acts to create a human body that doesn't require further magic to remain 21, healthy, and obeys physics. This could be with massive DNA rewriting to code for a robust, redundant, and healthy body along with some magic to make that express itself immediately after taking effect. This would be hugely useful for research since all we would need to do is to apply that DNA rewriting non magically to help more people.
