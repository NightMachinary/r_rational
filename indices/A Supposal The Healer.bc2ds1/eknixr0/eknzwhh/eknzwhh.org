You're thinking of wealth as a zero sum game: the rich getting richer doesn't necessarily mean the poor get poorer. This kind of trade policy is called merchantilism, that the only gains to be made when trading is to take more money from the other person. There's a lot of examples that disprove this but just ask yourself if you'd be better off in poverty today or 50 years ago? Or a 100? Income is less equally distributed today (in the USA at least) but on average people are still better off.

Rich people having more money isn't a real problem, although there's some emergent problems from it, the problem is that some people would benefit much more from money and the rich can provide that at the lowest personal suffering. Taking a hundred dollars from a millionaire hurts them less than taking it from someone in poverty.
