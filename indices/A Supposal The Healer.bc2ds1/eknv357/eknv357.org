Could 10 people go around her and touch her hands for 5 minutes and be healer simultaneously? If so, she could heal the 100 people in 50 minutes or less and be done for the day. This would give us 3.000 cures a month without putting too much burden on her.

Going with this scenario, what I would do is to set up an clinic in a nice, central country with hired security and easy access to an airport. People wanting access to the healing would be required to already have a complete diagnostic of the problem's severity. The queue for the 3.000 "slots" would be ordered by each case's severity.

One single slot a month would be reserved to the highest bidder in an auction, with the condition that it's still a critical health problem. One single slot a month would also be reserved for a separated queue to be filled at the request of governments all around the world, payed on a fixed rate (something a country can field easily but still considerable), also based each case's severity. Finally, one last slot a month to be used by the government of the country the clinic is set up in as they please (same rate as the others).

This would give us a good relation with our current place of residence without being at their mercy and a mutual interest on both keeping us there and defending us from external meddling. The other countries would still have a privileged queue for cases like prominent figures and leaders, so we would cultivate a positive relationship with every country. Lastly, the auctioned slot should bring us money to run the place independently and invest back.

The investment money would be used for: more professional security and facilities. doctors to run our own triage, mobility such as planes and helicopters we can use to move critical patients and research budget to study her special gift and see if we can learn something from it.
