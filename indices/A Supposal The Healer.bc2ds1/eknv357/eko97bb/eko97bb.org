You're the only one who states thing other missed: immediate consequences. Greed is great mover of the world, that's a belief I subscribe to. And the advice to this magical girl should be go on an exile, in the darkest of the night, to where nobody could recognize her. Once she successfully hid herself in a cave (or concrete jungle) somewhere, find out the extent of her ability. Self-heal should be the first to ascertain.
