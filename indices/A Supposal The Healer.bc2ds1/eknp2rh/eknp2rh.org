Imagine yourself in the shoes of a billionaire for a moment - one of the world's thousand richest men, who can buy anything that is for sale. You have a mansion on every continent and more private jets than you know what to do with. You can make or ruin a life on a whim. Laws are things that your lobbyists rewrite for you.

But you'll still die. Soon. No power known to medicine can keep anyone alive long into their second century. Your life's probably been stressful too, so you'll be lucky to make it past 80. You have everything else you could want, but there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop a brain tumour.

Until now.

On the one hand, each person only needs five minutes. Some of them will be reasonable. They can pay for preferential treatment, if that's an option. If there's a lottery, surely some winners will agree to sell their tickets.

But the richest, most powerful, oldest and most desperate men in the world... didn't all get that way by asking politely. Somebody will try to kidnap her, to keep her for himself and his family. Somebody else will stop the kidnapping, or try to take her back.

The military will intervene to ensure her safety. Another country's military will intervene because they can do a better job. War will break out.

A plane that was carrying her to a secure location will be shot down and crash into the ocean. Perhaps she survived - her power works on herself, doesn't it? Surely it does. Everyone wants to believe that she's OK, that she somehow survived the impact for long enough to heal herself, that she swam to safety, that the corpse eventually recovered was somehow faked. They'll hope she's gone into hiding. Perhaps they'll even be right.

In grand total, less than 50,000 people will be healed - by the draw of the lottery, by coercion and force, by lucky circumstances that put her near them for long enough. Some of them will become minor celebrities. Scientists will try to recreate the Healer; snake oil salesmen will spring up like mushrooms. It will be remembered as the greatest humanitarian failure of all time.
