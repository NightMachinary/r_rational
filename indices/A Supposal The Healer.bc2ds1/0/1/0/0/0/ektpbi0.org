That's true. So assuming no ongoing magical effects after healing, I guess there are two major uncertain factors left that would determine what kind of research benefit we could gain:

1. how "smart" (or personalized) the healing is
2. "how far" the healing takes things with regards to ensuring future health

My original post is reasonable under the assumptions of:

- "smart" -- working incrementally based on the original body and DNA in a personalized manner rather than enforcing a universal prototype
- and "not too far" -- only changing things that will /definitely/ or /with high likelihood/ cause problems we would recognize as "diseases" or "abnormal conditions" within the remaining 60-80 years of life for that person.

If "not smart": then depending on "how far", the end result would land somewhere on the spectrum between:

- "Way too far" -- Something so heavily altered/hacked that they're no longer recognizably human, genetically, even if the super-DNA is still somehow reproductively compatible with normal humans

  - I'm imagining something like "using a modern laptop and some clever code to simulate an old card-punch computer". It would never get stuck and would work more perfectly than any real physical card-punch computer ever, but card-punch computer operators would have no chance of understanding what's actually going on just by opening it up and looking inside. Using "higher-dimensional super-DNA" like this would allow any amount of phenotypic diversity without any related health risks, since it's all "simulated" and any number of safeguards could be built in, but this tends toward "magic" as complexity approaches infinity. This would probably be the worst case scenario for extending the effects of the magic healing beyond 100/day within any reasonable length of time, but it would (or at least /could/) remove worries about healed people being essentially identical.

- "Not too far" -- Beings that are obviously human genetically, but that are genetically identical on every factor except those magically determined to be "purely cosmetic or arbitrary genetic variables", where the healed patients basically just have a large portion of their DNA overwritten by the "standard healthy person DNA prototype"

  - Exactly how far this would push people toward being essentially carbon copies of one another is dependent on where the magic draws the line between "harmless diversity" and "potentially harmful traits". For example, blue eyed people have a higher susceptibility to certain ocular ailments that brown-eyed people don't. Would a healed patient with blue eyes have their eye color changed or not? If most things are treated as harmless diversity, then there's less "noise" so it would be easier to study the end result. If most things are treated as "potentially harmful", then almost all diversity would be lost and the only thing we'd gain would be essentially one example of a "perfectly healthy human" and their DNA, which would still be useful, but wouldn't allow us to abuse the healing to study individual ailments like in my original post.

The last box of the table is ["smart" and "too far"], but I don't think that box differs much from ["not smart" and "too far"]. Once the modifications are taken too far, I don't think it really matters whether the process was personalized and incremental or not. I guess you might get a bit more variability in the final results which might make it slightly easier to study way in the future, but it wouldn't be a meaningful difference in the short-term.
