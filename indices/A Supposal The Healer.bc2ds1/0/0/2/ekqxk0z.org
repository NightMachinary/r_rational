This relies on the notion that transness is a disease which, aside from being medically inaccurate, is part of an attitude that literally kill people. I'm down for having no sacred cows but we should keep that in mind when having these kinds of discussions.

As to the actual question it depends on what the power recognizes as what 'healing' consitutes. Does it have a uniform idealized version that it returns everyone to? Does it depend on the mental idea of 'healing' of the healed, of the healer, of the average of a demographic of the population, or some idea independent of humanity?

In the first case I would expect the body, though as [[/u/Kuratius]] points out this would also mean that a small fraction of people would gain inhuman bodies. In the second case it would depend on the healers attitude.

I find the third case to be particularly interesting since for many people the gender that they ascribe to other people are based on appearance and if you have been on any dating app you'll know that appearances doesn't necessarily match gender. So in this case I would predict that if someone dressed up(including appropriate clothing, makeup, whatnot) then they would get the body of the gender they were presenting as. However in the case of someone not presenting as within the gender binary I would predict their mind to change, which I know for some people counts as being killed and replaced with someone else.
