A causal relationship isn't the same as fault. E.g. butterfly effect. It's not reasonable to expect people to kill themselves over what someone else thinks. For all you know, they might not be wrong. And if they're not wrong, then what? You want to use mind control as a moral alternative over people dying?

Edit: Also, thinking isn't the same thing as mistreatment. Yes there are people that will do that, but there's no law that says you have to physically torture a trans person just cause currently existing medical treatments don't allow them to fit your definition of male or female. Saying that it literally kills them to think a certain way is manipulative.
