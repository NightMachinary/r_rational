Thank you for engaging in debate with me. I would appreciate it if my questions were address in a direct matter.

  It's not reasonable to expect people to kill themselves over what someone else thinks.

Are you arguing that people's thought patterns and attitudes towards groups doesn't cause action? If not I'm misunderstanding this statement. If so then I don't know what you think causes actions. Nobody is saying people kill themselves because someone is sitting isolated with hypothetical thoughts. Treating transness as a disease is part of an attitude that makes people mistreat trans people to the degree that they can't stand living, and that isn't the fault of the mistreaters.

  For all you know, they might not be wrong. And if they're not wrong, then what? You want to use mind control as a moral alternative over people dying?
#+end_quote

Mind rephrasing this? I don't really get the point that you are making. Who's wrong? Wrong about what? Mind control?
