I would suggest dedicating a majority (I like 2/3) of her heals to some sort of lottery or other blind system as to satisfy the masses and the lower class. Then you could also reserve spots for the rich via auction, starting at 10$ million (value of a human life). Ideally most or all of the money would go to charity - you could make a crapload of money doing advertisements, book deals, talks, or a billion other things anyways. Last of all I would reserve some spots for heroes - nobel prize winners, people who selflessly save others, etc...

66 - randomly chosen via lottery of people who are about to die or severly disabled.

20 - auction - for the rich

10 - chosen - for the accomplished, as selected by a independent panel of the UN.

1 - chosen - for whoever you feel like. This may be a bad idea - it could open yourself up to bad publicity if you make a choice people don't like. Or good publicity if you save someone people do like, it really swings either way.

1 - reserved for yourself (assuming you have ability to heal yourself). You could use this up at the end of a day of you wanted to risk it.
