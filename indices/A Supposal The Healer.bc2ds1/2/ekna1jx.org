The cheesy advice would be to focus on researching how exactly the power works and trying to replicate it with classic science. No healing she could do herself would be ever comparable to the good coming from even partially successful research.

Even if the process itself is impossible to replicate the science can still, potentially, benefit greatly from studying the effects.

If, however, she has a good reason to believe that the healing is truly miraclous in nature and no research would ever produce any results - then it's a question of ethitcs, not rationality. Utilitarianist, pragmatist, deontologist - they would all have different answers.

I'm purposefully leaving out other factors, like governmental and criminal response to the discovery of a real-life superpower. The answer "keep your power hidden if you don't want to be abducted and enslaved" is too boring, even if likely correct.
