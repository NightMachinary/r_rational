Priority advice would be to move somewhere safe, from which she could still work effectively. In situations like this, there is probably, almost definitely going to be someone crazy/extreme enough to try and kill her. That, in my opinion, is the true traffic jam; not that deciding who to heal is hard, but that not everyone is going to react to a messiah healing figure (or, more likely, being rejected for healing by a messiah healing figure) positively.

If she can only heal 100 people in day anyways, and each healing only takes 5 minutes, than there is plenty of time to properly vet and check every patient for ill intent. The most pressing priority isn't figuring out how to use new Jesus most effectively; it's making sure this savior doesn't end up nailed to a cross like the last one.
