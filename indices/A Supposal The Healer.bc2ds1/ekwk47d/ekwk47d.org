Oh boy, well /she/ needs to do everything she can to make sure that the military power which comes to control her is as benevolent as possible. She should probably hurry up and pick one voluntarily before she's forcibly taken. After that it's just healing whichever 100 people they bring to her..

As for what the military power should do with her....they should probably sell healing to the highest bidders, on the condition that R&D will be done on them (which potentially involves unpleasant things like dissection pre-healing) and use the funds for making sure no other military can overpower them or kill her, R&D on the fact that physics has been broken, followed by the more conventional good things you can do with money.
