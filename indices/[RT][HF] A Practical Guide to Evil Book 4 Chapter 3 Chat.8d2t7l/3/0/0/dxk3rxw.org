I don't think her goal is to make Catherine fail though. Don't get me wrong, if she can revive herself in some way by fucking Cat over I have no doubt she'd go for it in a heartbeat. But if that's not an option, I think she'll want to realise her goals (chaos, magnificent feats of war and horror, and Evil in general) through Cat instead.

Also, don't forget that Praesi highborn adore overwhelming strength, cunning, and deceit. It's completely possible Akua gained a lot of respect for Cat when Cat managed to kill her.

My opinion is that she's really giving Cat helpful advice, while slowly trying to get her to turn her into someone like her: a ruthless and violent villain. It's the only way she can influence the outside for now, so there's no reason to fuck Cat over when she will receive no benefit.

She's like a corrupting little genie.
