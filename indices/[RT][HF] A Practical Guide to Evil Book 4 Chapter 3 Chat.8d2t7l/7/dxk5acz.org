At no point during the chapter/conversation did Cat seem like anything else than what she usually is. No Fae mentality or brutality to be seen. And I get that becoming Fae was supposed to be becoming more rigid and such. But then why does Cat make such a big deal out of drawing Winter into herself if nothing really changes.
