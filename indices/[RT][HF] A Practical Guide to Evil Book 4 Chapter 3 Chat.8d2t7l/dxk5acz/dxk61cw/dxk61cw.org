It's very possible that the rigidity and unchangingness that Fae have was in part applied to the Cat we already had - it's not going to completely erase her existing personality, but it might make that ruthless, somewhat angrier person stay that way when she might have had a change of heart otherwise. She's introspective about how she's been fucking things up, but being Fae might make it harder for her to adopt a new mindset or way or doing things, so she might just keep making the same mistakes. Plus, if there was any time for her to have maximum self control and refuse to let her emotions get the best of her, it was there.
