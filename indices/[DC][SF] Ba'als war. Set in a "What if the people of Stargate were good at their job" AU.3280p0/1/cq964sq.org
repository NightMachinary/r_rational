As a big time fan of the series, I am happy to see rational SG fan fics. Really enjoyed your first SG fic on how the Ancients inadequately software tested their Gates.

Looking forward to seeing how this one goes, especially since Baal is one of my "favorite" Goaulds. Do you intend to include Anubis in your fic ?

How about the ascended Ancients and the Ori ? I assume post-singularity players will break a rational fic really fast.
