I'm deliberately keeping the scope of the fic limited because there's just so goddamn much SG1 that I could never hope to do it justice. It will cover the events of the war until their conclusion, whatever that may be. It will probably be ~ the level of content of a 3 part episode. There may be other Competent!SG1 fics depending on how this goes.
