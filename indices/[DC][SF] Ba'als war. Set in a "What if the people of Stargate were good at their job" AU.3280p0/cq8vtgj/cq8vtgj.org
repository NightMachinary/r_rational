Will this be continuing? I really like the premise.

I wasn't very clear on what was happening in the beginning -- I got that the humans used mustard gas, but I wasn't clear on why they were putting up shields and all that. As to destroying the world but it must have had something to do with the gate opening and then not closing -- did they dial a black hole?
