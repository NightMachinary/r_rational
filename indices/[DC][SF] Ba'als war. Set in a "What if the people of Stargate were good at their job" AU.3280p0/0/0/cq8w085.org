  Will this be continuing? I really like the premise.

I'm certainly intending to continue it. I don't yet know how it's going to end so I'm not ruling out that I'll accidentally write myself into a corner or run out of steam, but there will definitely be more chapters.

  I wasn't very clear on what was happening in the beginning -- I got that the humans used mustard gas, but I wasn't clear on why they were putting up shields and all that. As to destroying the world but it must have had something to do with the gate opening and then not closing -- did they dial a black hole?

It's deliberately a bit under-explained, to be further elaborated on later (the intended chapter 2 is from the PoV of the people responsible), but yes basically that's what happened.
