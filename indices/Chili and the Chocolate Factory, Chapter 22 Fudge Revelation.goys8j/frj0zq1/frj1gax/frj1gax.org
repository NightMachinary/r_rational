I disagree. These chapters feel to me like they've got the same energy and planning as usual.

Chapter 20 in particular has so many dahl references it's hard to believe it wasn't done very carefully. Just look at [[/u/gryfft]]'s post in the last thread about all the references in Teavee's items.

The pace of releases (which is happening after a month in which there were suspiciously no posts) reads to me like gazemaize took a month to write the entire climax sequence, and has been posting the stuff he wrote in that month in quick succession.

So much of the content here has been set up tens of thousands of words in advance, lol.

Way back in chapter 14, for example.

And the pickle was first set up in chapter 5, even enough we couldn't link the two until recently.
