I think the ending has been planned from the beginning, but there are a number of plot threads (Chetan misleading Keerthi about "vermicious", Fantasticer Fox's identity [assuming that the dead fox in Teavee's house was the real Fantastic Mr. Fox], Peachland, the person who made Mahuika want to vape, etc.) that seem as if they were dropped. Also the whole witch subplot did technically get resolved but it was rapid and glossed over for the most part.

Then again, we still have the epilogue, so we'll see what happens to the rest of our lingering questions.
