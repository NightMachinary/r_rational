I'm not providing excuses, I'm pointing out the context. Neither am I stretching anything - I'm going off exactly what he said, whereas your interpretation relies on a lot of assumptions of his meaning (textbook case of FAE), most of which I've refuted above. When you say you're sticking to core points, it feels like you're really saying you're looking at what he said in a vacuum and you don't care for "shades of grey" or context because you've already made up your mind.

Yeah you don't claim that, but you are implying that he thinks they deserved it - which is a grossly overreaching interpretation of his actual words. Otherwise, I agree with all 3 counts (minimizing, victim blaming, prejudice). It's an extremely insensitive racist comment. But it doesn't make sense to attribute malice to his meaning when the core point of his statement is a plain syllogism. Which is why I disagree with using blanket statements from the opposite side to simplify racism and lump all cases together as "racism full stop" or "straight up anti-Semitism". I think there's an unfortunate tendency with sensitive topics like racism to trigger this kind of black and white labeling and stonewall any attempt to look at it from a different angle.

I'm not a Dahl scholar and he really may have been anti-semitic to the level of condoning hostility against all Jews, but I don't see that here.

P.S.

  Saying Hitler had his reasons is racist full stop.

What? Regardless of the validity of those reasons, he had reasons. Every other anti-semitic group through the millenia had reasons. From a purely empirical POV, postulating that there's a reason Jewish culture consistently provokes animosity is "racist" and insensitive, but academic.

  Using terms like "a filthy old Syrian Jewess" in your writing unironically is racist full stop.

Fiction can be a mouthpiece, but I really don't want to start deciding what an author meant ironically or unironically.
