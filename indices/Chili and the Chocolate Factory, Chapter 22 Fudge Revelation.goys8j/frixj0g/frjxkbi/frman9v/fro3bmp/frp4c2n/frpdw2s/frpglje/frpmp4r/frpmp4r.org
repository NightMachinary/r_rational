There's several problems here, some of which may be fundamental differences in worldview.

1. Lots of cultures have been conquered - what's the follow up? Are you arguing that Jews have been laboring under the "conquered" status for the past few millenia and barring that, there has never been a reason why they've been persecuted beyond the circular "they are victims because they are victims"? Also your statement is completely incompatible with Dahl's "empirical racism" against Israeli Jews (he's against them because they victimized others, not because they're victims).

2. You're emotionally conflating premise with outcome (Dahl's statement that Jewish culture provokes animosity with the implication that they deserved the Holocaust/suffering). You're also conflating the WW2 instance of anti-semitism with every other instance.

3. That opening is certainly nothing new. But there's quite a difference between "I'm not anti-semitic. I'm anti-Israeli." and "I'm not anti-semitic, but Jews deserve their suffering." Again, think context, not just grouping things together because they share surface characteristics. Though it feels like you're arguing against my words without having read the wiki at all.

P.S. sorry, looks like I cut the full quote before:

  There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity, *maybe it's a kind of lack of generosity towards non-Jews.* I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason
