I had assumed Happiness Central was peachtown. Is the BFG living there, then?

I had also assumed, maybe incorrectly, that the other product Bucket's beat at are suspenders, since we know Urkeldelphia is the number one exporter of them (and human suffering).

In retrospect, it's also amusing that Charlie's got Urkeldelphia beat for suffering -- just not the export of it, and not human.
