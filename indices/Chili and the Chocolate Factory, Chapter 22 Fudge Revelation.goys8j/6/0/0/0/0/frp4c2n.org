  There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity. I mean, there's always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason.

this is racist. straight up anti-semitism, no qualifiers.

I don't like isreael either, but that's not what he said. he said jews as a race have a character trait that provokes people, and that implied that this is what provoked hitler to murder millions of them.

It's racist as fuck.
