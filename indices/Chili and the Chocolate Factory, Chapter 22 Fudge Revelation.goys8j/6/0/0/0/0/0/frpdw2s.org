I disagree with both counts. Often racism is just thoughtless or malicious bigotry, but when there is a larger context, it's important to consider it and look at it through these qualifiers. Otherwise you're falling into the trap of labeling things and arbitarily drawing a line on the floor for "bad as fuck." It's attractive to hate something that deserves to be hated, but it also perpetuates the cycle of hatred. Dahl's case especially isn't black and white. He says he's not anti-Semitic, but if you consider this statement unambiguously racist, then where do you draw the line for "racist as fuck"?

Also, I don't see how that statement is "straight up anti-semitism." It's a syllogism that wouldn't be out of place in some book explaining why Jews in particular have such a long history of persecution. I don't have any feelings toward Jews, but growing up learning about the hatred spanning since biblical times, I've wondered what about Jewish culture triggers this ancient abuse. So if I look at this long chain of empirical data and conclude that there must be something about Jewish culture that provoked it, does that make me racist as fuck?
