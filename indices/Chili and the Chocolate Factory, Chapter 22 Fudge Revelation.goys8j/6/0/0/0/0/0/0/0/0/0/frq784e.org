Mm, in the context of everything he's saying, it's less likely "generosity" is meant fiscally than as an allusion to the insular nature of Jewish communities.

I already hinted at it above, but I think you're falling hard into confirmation bias. You're just ignoring any inconvenient context since you've already decided to label it as clearly evil racism. Part of the problem is we're talking past each other (beyond the fact that you're ignoring everything I say and cherry picking the easy jabs). Racism and anti-semitism have different nuances here. He makes a blanket assertion about Jewish character provoking animosity, which meets the definition of 'racist', but that's about as racist as saying Americans are arrogant and entitled, except much more sensitive given history of persecution. That's different than the kind of anti-semitism you're accusing him of - saying there's a reason for something is not the same as condoning the Holocaust or saying they deserved it.

Yes, his statement is "racist" (there are always degrees), but it's not "straight up anti-semitism."
