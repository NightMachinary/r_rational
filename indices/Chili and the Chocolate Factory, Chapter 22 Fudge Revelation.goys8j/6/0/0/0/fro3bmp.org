He really doesn't seem like he was joking; it seems he was bitter about the atrocities Israel perpetrated and he fell victim to stereotyping + outgroup homogeneity. The wiki explains the context, but his exact quote was "There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity. I mean, there's always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." Not a kosher statement, but not quite Hitler apologism either. Hitler had a point (to scapegoat someone) but it wasn't because Israeli Jews were killing people.
