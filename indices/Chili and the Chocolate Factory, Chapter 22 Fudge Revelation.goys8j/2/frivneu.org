I wonder if Banksy II is the successor to the BFG as well as the well-known subversive graffiti artist. Banksy II got mentioned in the first and last chapters-- they're responsible for launching JUROR's career as well as changing Chili's heart. Perhaps it was Banksy II who is responsible for Mahuika's vaping, too?

Edit:

I was so wrong with my guesses lol.

I really ought to have figured out what Mahuika's best course of action was. It was pretty heavily foreshadowed in chapter 21 when Mahuika vaped. And in chapter 20 when Mahuika vaped. And in like one or two other chapters.

So, my bad, but not /that/ hard to miss.

Went back searching for "juice" in previous chapters and stumbled on something else. I don't know if anybody else figured it out, but the BFG is the one who makes the better vapes than Wonkaland.

  "Because! That moron in Happiness Central makes better vapes than me and everyone knows it! Whenever I invent something, it is almost always best! I have the best chocolates! I have the best ice cream! I have the best dirt! That giant jerk is the one exception, and he makes the only two products I cannot beat! His vapes are one of them! Why, I should go up to him and give me a piece of my-"

The BFG is totally putting dreams in the vapes, so that's pretty rad. Dunno what the other product would be, but I wonder if it's also dream related.
