It was canonically not Teavee, Bucket, or the pickle who made Mahuika vape. From chapter 20:

#+begin_quote
  "You lived your life. When you were five, an unknown entity intervened in the GAG and managed to add a fact. It wasn't the pickle. It suddenly became a true fact that Mahuika vaped. This made you a character."

  ...

  "I had my suspicions," he said. "It was you who made her vape."

  Charlie laughed. "Mike, you don't know anything. I didn't do anything to Mahuika."

My musings...

If the street pickle is the avatar for the original creator of this universe... someone salty, bitter, aged, and +racist+ prejudiced against liquids resulting from squeezing fruits.... then perhaps... perhaps...

Perhaps vape juice... something conventionally sweet or fresh, newfangled, kind of subversive but also generally regarded to be something enjoyed by weirdos...

Maybe... gazemaize was the juice all along.
