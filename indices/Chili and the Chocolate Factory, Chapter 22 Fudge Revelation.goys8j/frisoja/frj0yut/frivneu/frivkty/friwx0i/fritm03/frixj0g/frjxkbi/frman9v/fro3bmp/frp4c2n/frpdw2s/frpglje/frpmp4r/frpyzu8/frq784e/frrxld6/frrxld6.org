And I think you are biased to try and provide excuses for a plainly antisemetic statement. You stretching everything you can to try and weasel out of reading it exactly as it is. I'm sticking to the core points because those are what matter.

I'm not claiming he condones the holocaust outright if that's your concern. But he minimizes it, victim blames, and displays gross racial prejudice. Saying the Jewish character causes people to hate them is racist full stop. Saying Hitler had his reasons is racist full stop. Using terms like "a filthy old Syrian Jewess" in your writing unironically is racist full stop.

No amount of qualifying changes this.
