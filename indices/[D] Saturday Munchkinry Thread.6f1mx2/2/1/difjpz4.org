It depends somewhat on how the power actually works. When do I decide when to receive it? When I send it, or when I would receive it?

If you can define reception from the "future" point, then you can encode a lot more information by choosing when to send the single bit to. For example, if I receive the bit at 10:34PM, 6/3/17, then I've actually gotten a much larger number of bits (how many depending mostly on how wide or narrow my timespan is).
