Let me clarify, let T be the time I start the plan, and T' be the time I find out whether I win.

In the original (1st) timeline, at time T I receive no messages from my future self, so I just buy the ticket with the smallest number.

At time T', I find out I lost the lottery, so I now send a 0 to my past self at time T.

On the 2nd timeline, I receive a 0 at time T. I don't receive any other 0s, so I proceed to buy the second smallest lottery ticket.

At time T', I find out I lost the lottery. Since this is a different timeline, I have not sent myself any messages yet. So I can once again send a 0 to the past. This time, I send it to time T+1. I know I should send it at time T+1, because I received the last 0 at time T.

On the 3rd timeline, I already received a 0 at time T, and now I also receive another 0 at time T+1. I don't receive any other 0s, so I proceed to buy the third smallest lottery ticket.

At time T', I find out I lost the lottery. Since this is a different timeline, I have not sent myself any messages yet. So I can once again send a 0 to the past. This time, I send it to time T+2. I know I should send it at time T+2, because I received the last 0 at time T+1.

And so on.

No memories are transferred between timelines, only a 0.
