You automatically win by touching as many people as possible.

The main danger I see is that touching so many people is likely to give you all kinds of weird diseases, which you will then spread to the other people you touch, resulting in a pandemic that kills us all. So choose wisely who you want to touch and wash your hands often!

Also, your ability would be useless against germophobes since they would be fully covered from head to toe and refuse to ever have skin contact with anyone.
