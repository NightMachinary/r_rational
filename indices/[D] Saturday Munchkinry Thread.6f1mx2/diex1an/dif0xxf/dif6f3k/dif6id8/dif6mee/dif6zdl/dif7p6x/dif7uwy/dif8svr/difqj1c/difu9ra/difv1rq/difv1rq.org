I'm not alleging any. Group alignment and in-group preferences explain semitism and justify counter-semitism.

There's nothing inherently wrong about war. /War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have courage to meet it./ If anything, jews realise this, even though they prefer to remain ignoble have other peoples kill and die on their behalf - a rational in-group preference, just like the gentiles' preference for ridding themselves of jewish influence. When two peoples have conflicting values like this, the stronger should obviously prefer war over peace.

So basically if Stalin were immortal and continued to starve, exile and genocide people to this day to bring about the quintessential post-nationalist, post-racial, post-capitalist shithole? Because /that's/ the polar opposite of nationalism, racism and in-group preference.
