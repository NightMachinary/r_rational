You picked the worst example to counter-signal on, since the jews actually /are/ an inbred ethnic tribe as well as a cult. I mean, their own scripture defines it as a matrilineal nativist group.

  Cultural differences sure, but most Jewish communities have adopted the social norms of those around them

Most of my countrymen identify with some form of conservatism and nationalism, whereas the jews, who are disproportionately overrepresented in the academia and politics, are mostly liberal and globalist. Sure, unlike muslims or gypsies they mostly tend to adopt the surface-level "social norms", and it helps that they're harder to detect visually, but they definitely act subversive towards key racial values.
