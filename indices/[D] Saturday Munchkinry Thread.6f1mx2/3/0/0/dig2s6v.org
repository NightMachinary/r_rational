Unless you're "a selfish person". If you're selfish, then you're potentially completely fucked - you shake hands with person X, and person X becomes interested in supporting person X.

So step 1 is to achieve enlightenment, I guess.

EDIT: Also, don't tell anyone or go public, and make sure your minions don't leave a pattern of suddenly changed behaviour after meeting you, for much the same reason. Once you meet sufficient people, publish a manifesto or something that can "inspire" people. Although realistically, keeping hidden would probably require government assistance thanks to the wonders of Big Data. Still, easy to fix: Meet a general, shake hands, get help and arranged meetings. Go to a UN convention or something.
