This power is already win condition tier, no need to /munchkin/ it.

Meet up with world leaders, shake their hands, convert them, and have them do whatever you want, probably ending with a computronium construct acting in your best interests consuming and expanding from Earth.

Edit: The first step to this plan is the same as the first step without this power: heightened longevity. We're also going to stop wastage of negentropy on stuff like religions (this one is hard, possibly doable in most part through a truly excellent PR campaign, and should only really be done for fun as it's ineffective on the whole), wars, and bad policies, we're going to popularize existential risk mitigation and effective altruism and focus on such problems, form a single world government, dramatically accelerate technological process, and puppeteer the world government from the shadows on easy mode thanks to at-will mind control. Basically, we're utopiaizing Earth and its future light cone by solving cooperation problems and stupidity.
