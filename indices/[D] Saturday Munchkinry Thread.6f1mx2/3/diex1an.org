You have the power to convert people to sincerely hold your core values, but you must be touching them at the time. The touch can be initiated by either party, but if they touch you you will need a moment to focus on your values to do it. The length of a brief handshake is enough, but if their hand just brushes yours it wouldn't be enough unless you already had your values in mind.

How do you use this power to promote your core values? And what are the dangers to yourself and your ethics?
