  disproportionately overrepresented in academia and politics

And Asians are disproportionately represented in medical school, at least in the US. This can be attributed to several factors: the fact that US medical schools accept students from abroad means the baseline rate to compare should not be US demographics, but global demographics, and a cultural expectation of work ethic and interpersonal competition which tends to be stronger than those of the US. Adding some kind of racial conspiracy to that mix is unnecessary when all of the data can be explained by factors where race doesn't matter. Similarly, Jews got into academia because their religion already involves careful study to achieve greater understanding of a set of rules. This is exactly what science /is/. Figuring out what God meant through Talmudic interpretation is isometric to figuring out what reality means through experimentation. This also makes them good at legal interpretation.

No global conspiracy necessary. All of your observations are explained without resorting to a convoluted, behind-the-scenes plot.

Your complaint about politics...have you considered that Jews tend to lean more liberal because /some conservatives want to kill all of them?/ Have you considered that they are strongly antinationalist (as am I), because nationalists going back centuries have attempted to wipe them out? Your own attitude explains their politics, not the other way around. If you wanted to bring them around to seeing things your way, maybe start by not claiming they are simultaneously subhuman slime /and/ master plotters on a global scale.

As for my antinationalism, have you considered that nationalism has been a primary cause of every modern war? Human society has pushed to the point that violent competition for resources just destroys the infrastructure which extracts resources (see: Africa), and as such land wars don't make sense. Any modern people is better off buying resources they don't have from their neighbors rather than warring over them because commerce is cheap. There is no good economic reason to go to war.

I am going to make an assumption that you are some kind of Eastern European based on your claim that most people in your country think like you and your hatred of three ethnic groups which coexist only in that region: Jews, Muslims, and Roma. If this is the case, may I submit that /nationalism has been absurdly terrible for your region?/ The problems in the Balkans are entirely due to racial and national tensions, the problems of the former Soviet states stem from Soviet and Russian nationalism. Take a step back, observe your situation, and imagine what the shape of reality might be if irrational attachments to artificial administrative borders weren't a thing. Your country, whichever one that happens to be, would be better off if it were /not/ overwhelmingly nationalistic. I guarantee that.

This is totally meaningless to me. Define without using either word.
