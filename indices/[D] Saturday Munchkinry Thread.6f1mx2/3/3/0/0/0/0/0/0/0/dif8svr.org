There's nothing at all concrete about the groups you have chosen, though. I took a look at your post history, and it appears you are antisemitic. There...isn't any evidence of biological or cognitive differences between jews and non-jews, not ones large enough to call them any different from you. Cultural differences sure, but most Jewish communities have adopted the social norms of those around them. There is nothing about Jews, other than their religion, which you can point at and say "this is a Jewish trait," and if you want to go down that road then every single religion is its own race, which is patently absurd.
