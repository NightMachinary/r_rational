I don't believe social, political or biological "equality" exists in any meaningful sense of the word. "Human" is an overloaded qualifier and useless as an identity, seeing as how there is no such thing as a non-human moral agent as far as we know (assuming for the sake of the argument the agency of all humans to begin with). I prefer to think in terms of more concrete groups that are easier to discriminate between.
