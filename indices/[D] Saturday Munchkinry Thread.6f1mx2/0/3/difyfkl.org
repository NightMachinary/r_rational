I would be surprised that I get better after exploding, thus causing an endless series of explosions.

Also, forget exploiting this power, even living in society would be all but impossible. Mild surprises happen all the time, even waking up each day is a mild surprise to your brain (since it realizes everything immediately before was a dream). You would leave a constant stream of explosions allowing anyone to track you down with ease, where they will then kill you for good to stop you from being a danger to everyone else.

Or worse, be the ones to exploit your ability for explosions.
