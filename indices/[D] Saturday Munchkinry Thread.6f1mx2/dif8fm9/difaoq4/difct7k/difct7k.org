Good question and stuff I didn't consider. I'm not sure this is a good answer but I would say that the material would not be able to convert kinetic energy into sound or heat when rubbing up above anything else. Maybe something like superfluidity perhaps? So, a frictionless fan would work even more efficiently because it would make no noise from the blades touching the air.

And I have no idea why gears wouldn't work if the teeth were meshed well. It would work like the ultimate well-oiled machine.

I have no idea if this at all makes sense in the world of physics so correct me if I'm wrong.
