Hmmm. Let's try this. When atoms rub up against each other, the energy is converted into heat and sound. So, more entropy. Through the magic of this power, the energy is not converted and all momentum if retained. So, a frictionless ball in a circular groove would roll around indefinitely. Perpetual motion machines.

Anyway, we can just assume that it works. How then would you exploit it? Would whether the teeth change shape effect how you would exploit it?
