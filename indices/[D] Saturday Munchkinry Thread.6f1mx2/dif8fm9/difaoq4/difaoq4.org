Friction is in parts a function of shape. If I make sandpaper or gears frictionless, do they still perform their function? Does their shape change visibly?

Would moving a finger across material at ludicrous relative velocity to turn it frictionless hurt? If not, I can replace maglev, increase engine efficiency, etc.

What happens if material I targeted is melted temporarily? Blendered?
