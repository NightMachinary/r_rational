You're going to need to define this more clearly. If I send a bit to my past self, causing him to take a different action, is my current future erased? Do I, in effect, get another chance to use the power?

Basically, I'm thinking of winning a lottery like this. First, i buy the lottery ticket with the smallest number. Then if I win, I send a 1 back to the past. If I lose, I send a 0.

If I receive a 0, I choose to buy the lottery ticket with the next smallest number. Doing so erases the future where I sent myself a 0, so I have not used my power yet. Thus I can once again send myself a bit from this new future, telling my past self whether I won. Repeat until I buy the winning ticket.
