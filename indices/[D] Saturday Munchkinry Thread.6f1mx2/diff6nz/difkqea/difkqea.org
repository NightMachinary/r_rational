So, the exact time I receive the bit can contain a lot of extra information.

What I'd want to do is spend a decade or two acquiring and saving money to purchase the most accurate time measuring device possible. Seriously, every extra bit of information would be incredibly valuable, so if the device isn't costing as much as house, I'm probably eating a lot of opportunity cost.

Once I have that, I can send lengthy messages back in time encoded in the exact time of receipt.

I'd start by sending a message back a day, with a code indicating that it's the first loop. Then, for the second loop, I'd send a message back two days with an iterated code, and so on. The reason for that is that I'd want to maximize the total number of loops, but if I die at any point, then I don't receive a message, and the whole thing resets to one bit of information, so starting very cautiously is probably the best bet.

I'd probably decide that after a certain number of loops- or maybe once the message has become sufficiently helpful- I'd just send the same message back every time. Otherwise, I'd be certain to die eventually, creating and infinitely resetting loop. By creating a closed loop, I'd be guaranteed to have that extremely helpful message every iteration thereafter. I'd also want to avoid sending a message back more than nine months or so, since in that time, new babies would be conceived and born, and potentially erasing them from existence would be unethical.
