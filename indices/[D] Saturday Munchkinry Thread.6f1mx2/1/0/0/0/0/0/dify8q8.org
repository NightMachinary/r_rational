  Anyway, we can just assume that it works. How then would you exploit it?
#+end_quote

The problem here is how you exploit it depends on how exactly it works. Consider your example:

#+begin_quote
  frictionless ball in a circular groove would roll around indefinitely.
#+end_quote

How exactly does this work? Even if the ball is frictionless, it's still going to be hitting stuff. Like the groove, or air molecules. Since it rolls around indefinitely, I'm assuming it somehow has a constant amount of kinetic energy. But then what happens to the stuff it hits? Are they still pushed out of the way? If so, you have an infinite energy source using the air currents. Use denser air and larger balls for larger production per second. Heck use liquids, since air resistance is basically the same force as water resistance, and should be equally nullified.

If not, what you have is effectively the ball and the air molecules occupying the same space without any forces pushing them apart. Depending on how exactly we are "just assuming that it works", this could mean you can use your ability to phase stuff through one another. This becomes much, MUCH more exploitable than the first assumption.

There's the obvious example of phasing an object into someone's heart to instantly murder them, but you can go one step higher here. Phase multiple layers of dense material into one another, and then release. This would likely trigger a nuclear reaction since you literally have subatomic particles occupying the same space (or at least, way closer together than normal). You could do this with multiple balls on overlapping groves. Or on the same groove with different speeds.

For that matter, there's another issue with the given example:

#+begin_quote
  So, a frictionless ball in a circular groove would roll around indefinitely.
#+end_quote

If gravity still works on the ball, then it wouldn't roll around indefinitely. The tiny amount of gravity exerted by the table on the ball would eventually cause it to come to a stop at the table's center of gravity, or as close to it as the groove would allow. So if you want it to truly roll around for eternity, you would have to also nullify gravity. Now you have anti gravity.
