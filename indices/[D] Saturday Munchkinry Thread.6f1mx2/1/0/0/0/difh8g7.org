Because in the world of physics, friction is actually the result of miniature gear teeth. For example, if you have a wooden table, and you try to slide something across it, it slows down because of friction. What exactly is this friction? It's (partly) the fact that the table surface isn't actually flat. When you zoom in a lot, there's actually tons of little hills and valleys. When something slides across your table, it's getting stuck in those valleys the same way gear teeth are stuck in each other, and losing energy since it pushes around the hills and valleys of the table when it hits them.

So making something frictionless is like removing all the hills and valleys, making it totally smooth. But in a sense, gear teeth are just much larger hills and valleys, so does making them frictionless turn them into simple cylinders with no teeth? If not, what magnitude must a hill/valley be in order to not be erased by your frictionless superpower?
