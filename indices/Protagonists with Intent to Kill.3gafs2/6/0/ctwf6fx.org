I don't think that's accurate. Skitter can be rather gruesome and painful in her methods and is often unaware of how terrifying she is to others, but, IIRC, the first time she even attacks with deadly intent is the Slaughterhouse Nine (whom /everybody/ attacks with lethal intent) and the first time she kills anyone in cold blood ([[#s][]]), it's a Big Deal, taking place most of the way into the story.
