The humans have way more effective intent to kill than the kzinti. When the kzinti met us, we has abolished war because we were /too good at it/. They found a human reaction drive slowboat in interstellar space, and their telepath told them it was unarmed. So, being kzin, they decided to microwave the human crew to death and take their ship. The humans cut them in half with their drive exhaust.

That's intent to kill.
