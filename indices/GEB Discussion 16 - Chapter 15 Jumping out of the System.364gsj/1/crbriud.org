Awesome summary [[/u/xamueljones]].

- The chapter's discussion about Lucas argument why machines can never be as intelligent as humans was especially interesting to me.

- when the Crab asks

  #+begin_quote
    /Crab/: Curious that you should think so... I don't suppose that you know Henkin's Therem *forwards and backwards*, do you?
  #+end_quote

  This is similar to p.78:

  #+begin_quote
    /Tortoise/: Curious that you should think so... I don't suppose that you know Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem *backwards and forwards*, do you?
  #+end_quote

  but note that it's *forwards and backwards* vs *backwards and forwards* which matches with what [[/u/xamueljones]] says about Henkin's Theorem being somewhat the reversed of the Incompleteness Theorem.

- They talk about *Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible Metallic Alloy* which is a self-reference to GEB and was first mentioned on p. 402 in "Aria with Diverse Variations"

  - the bowl of the pipe as a *copper* lining (p. 481)
  - the records have a *silver* lining (p. 486)
  - the frame of the picture shown in Fig. 82 has a *gold* lining (p.494)
  - does that mean =copper = bach= (the pipe), =silver = gödel= (the records), =gold = escher=(painting)? That would be *e*ternal *g*olden *b*raid backwards, but against it would speak that in "Aria with Diverse Variations" it seems as if the intended association is =copper = Gödel= (*G*iraffe), =silver = Escher= (*E*lephants) and =gold = Bach= (*B*aboons)
