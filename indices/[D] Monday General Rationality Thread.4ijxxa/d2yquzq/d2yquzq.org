All this GAI progress lately is /pretty spooky/, I've got to say. DeepDream is a nightmare. I've felt pretty depressed lately because all of my brain's independent estimates indicate that the world as I know it will end before /a very conservative estimate/ of 2030. What does my fanfiction matter, then? What does my original fiction matter? What does my education or pretty much anything I can do matter?

Any advice for remaining a functional human being despite my knowledge that I will soon be either dead or something beyond my comprehension?
