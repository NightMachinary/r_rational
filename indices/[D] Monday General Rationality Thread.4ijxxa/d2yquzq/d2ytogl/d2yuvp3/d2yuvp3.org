As a fellow computer scientist... yeah. At this point I've lost track of how many flagrantly unrealistic overpromises our project's upper management has made. And that's for a new smartphone, not for something big and serious like AI.

Deep learning is actually making large advances on vision and control problems, but it's also still finnicky, hard to architect, and error-prone on edge cases. The probabilistic approach to cognitive science has explained a lot, but on the computational end, it has some speed problems and the languages aren't very good yet (especially for integrating with arbitrary real-world libraries). Hell, prob cog sci hasn't even got complete explanations for some observed psychological and experimental facts yet.

The future will arrive with maddening slowness. Meanwhile, global warming is the only thing constantly ahead of schedule :-(.

Fairest and Fallen, you are /such/ a total douchebag.
