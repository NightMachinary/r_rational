2030 is a wildly rosy estimate. Assuming Moore's Law keeps working (and there are those who think it won't), a $1000 computer will have the processing power of a human brain by 2045. Extrapolating back, we see that such a computer would cost over a million dollars still in 2030. Doable for some to do an upload at that point, but still too expensive, even assuming that we can develop a safe and consistent means of mapping and simulating a connectome before then. Your meatbrain is still going to beat the bots for a while yet.
