Well, you could focus your efforts on putting yourself in the position where you can take the most advantage of the upcoming AI/technology/etc.

It may be hard for your brain to function and be motivated when facing death or incomprehensible things, but it loves to solve more short term and understandable goals.

Until AI comes over and kills us all(or whatever), there's plenty of things you can do to be in the best position when it happens. You can be learning CS and try being a part of the research, or you can make money doing what you do best and then donate to things or invest in startups, to steer the world in the right direction. Or you can focus on becoming rich, because I bet that not every person in the world will be able to take advantage of life extension, BCIs, whatever comes in the future. You might as well strive to be one of the people who can.
