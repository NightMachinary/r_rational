AGI by 2030 is not properly conservative. That's 14 years away; as far as we are away from 2002 right now. I was rereading /The Singularity is Near/ last week, and I really bought into a lot of it back when I was in college ... but that was more than a decade ago, and so much of it has failed to materialize, or has come only in the absolute weakest form that it could. (I also got a degree in computer science and worked for some pretty big companies since then, which also served to make me more skeptical about the rate of progress.)

I think futurists /in general/ overestimate, because overestimation is more sexy than underestimating. "The world will end by 2030" is a shocking statement, which makes it easier to spread around with clickbait titles. And it's not just futurists! Scientists and engineers tend to overpromise, or at least the more extreme promises tend to get spread around more. It's why you go to E3 and designers are talking about these lush, verdant, detailed worlds, but when it actually comes out, features have been lost and graphics have been downgraded. This is also why doomsday preachers always say that the world is going to end in the next few years, rather than a few centuries from now.

(Conservative means different things when used in different ways, however. If I were part of a governmental body in charge of regulating AGI, my "conservative" would be the earliest possible date I thought it was feasible. If I were planning for retirement, however, my "conservative" would be much further in the future.)
