Yeah, I'd like to join the other comments in saying - I've used 2030 as an absolute earliest possible date for a while now. Experts seem to tend toward 2045 as the >50% point, at least the good ones (and bad ones fall even later.) Even Kurzweil, who underestimates everything by ~7 years, guesses late 2030s.
