  What does my original fiction matter? What does my education or pretty much anything I can do matter?

Well, the way I look at it is that you might as well ask "Why do doctors matter when people are just going to die?". Things are going to change, but stuff still needs to get done until that point. Also, I can't imagine a future that's going to erase your literary works.

The biggest point being, don't fall into a false dichotomy. It's not "no value" or "eternal value", we do things because they're useful right now.
