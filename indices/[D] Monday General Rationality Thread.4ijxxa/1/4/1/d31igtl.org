  Assuming Moore's Law keeps working (and there are those who think it won't)
#+end_quote

It's already stopped. Intel officially cancelled Moore's law, they're now doing process shrinks every 3 architectures (ie, 2-2.5 years as opposed to 1.5 years). And that's just to stretch out the time before they literally run out of atoms to shrink - you can only make a silicon transistor so small.

The fact is, barring a breakthrough in photonic computers, graphene, or other completely new substrates, in a few years (~2020) we will be at the point where we'll only be able to make silicon-based computer hardware more computationally powerful by making it bigger and require more energy.
