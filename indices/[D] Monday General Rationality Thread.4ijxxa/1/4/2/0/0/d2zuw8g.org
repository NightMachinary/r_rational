In addition to everything [[/u/Dwood15]] said, "Moore's Law" once referred to the clock speed at which processors could run generic serial programs. Then it started to refer to how many parallel cores you could put on a chip, as clock speeds topped out between 2-3 GHz for affordable processors and 4GHz started to require increasingly advanced cooling systems.

Now it's started to refer to stuff like power consumption. It's great that chips are still improving at a regular pace - we all want to use less juice - but that doesn't mean they're improving like they once did. For non-specialized applications where stuff like GPGPU computing doesn't apply, the exponential speedup in /how fast your average CPU-bound application can run/ driven by chip development is firmly over.
