That may be, however, Moore's law is typically associated with transistors, and my comparison was merely for the sake of performance in a desktop machine. At this point, we will not reach the mythical "power of a human brain by 2045" in a desktop pc (though you mentioned cash, I assumed standard PC as that's what the comparison is generally used by in sites like waitbutwhy), and that's the point I'm addressing.

As to the cost: think of it more like a logarithmic style curve instead of an exponential one. At one point, the cost will reduce to a minimum profitability level where Intel/hardware manufacturers will be unable to make cash if they make it any cheaper (though we aren't even close to that yet). Assuming no innovations in the hardware being produced, the processes to create the hardware can only be streamlined and improved so much so I would guess that we'll see the cost side of Moore's law slow down.

Also, Intel not having any competition from AMD on the desktop market isn't helping things either.
