  Assuming Moore's Law keeps working (and there are those who think it won't), a $1000 computer will have the processing power of a human brain by 2045.

This kind of estimate depends strongly on how you're measuring the processing power of the human brain. I don't think most estimates are very good, since they don't take into account that the brain is:

- Natively stochastic: cortical micro-circuits are theorized to implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, or something like them.

- Natively parallel: we don't know precisely what sort of algorithm is used yet, but we think that spike trains encode surprisals, and so long-distance connections in the brain are some kind of message-passing of surprisals between different probabilistic models.

So the brain ends up able to do /certain/ things very quickly even while lacking a lot of serial processing power.
