I would argue that the general theme of the film was that Beast's attitude improved dramatically after he saved Belle from the wolves and she showed gratitude; as the song goes, there was "Something there that Wasn't There Before". He was spoiled, selfish, and unkind in the backstory, and grew angst and frustration from his curse, but as he and Belle spent time together, he gained affection and a willingness to compromise and control his temper.

I agree with your assessment in that he was /obviously/ a better option than Gaston of course, and that she acted at least reasonably much of the time, if not optimally. I merely pose objection to your somewhat harsh treatment of Beast's character post-character-development.
