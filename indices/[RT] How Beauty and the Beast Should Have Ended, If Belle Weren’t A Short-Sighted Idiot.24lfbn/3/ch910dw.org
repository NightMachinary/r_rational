Belle's antagonist is Gaston. A man who is intent on having her, but who belittles her and is guaranteed to be emotionally abusive, likely to be physically abusive, and rather certain to restrict her from her hobbies. This is his modus operandi during normal, unstressed living.

Beast is an alternative. He is not a great alternative. He is abusive during stressful situations. We don't know whether he is abusive during non-stressful situations, but his behavior toward Belle seems to match his behavior toward his servants, who seem to think it's his condition causing his violence and attitudes. There is a reasonable chance that he will be kinder and less dangerous when the curse is lifted, though the circumstances leading to the curse are not a heartening sign.

Most importantly, he seems to accept some level of independence from Belle, and he is willing to listen to her advice and humor her. In good circumstances, he is likely to be almost a partner. Gaston, on the other hand, would be a neglectful owner at best.

If Belle is widowed, Gaston (given his misogyny and his society) will possibly see her as spoiled goods. This may cause him to leave her alone. However, if she controls an estate, that might draw Gaston's attention in a different way -- the tables might be turned all too readily, and Belle might not survive that wedding night.

Belle was not short-sighted. She saw a man who would be as abusive as she would normally expect but whom she could manipulate, a man who could serve as her protector. She had a strong interest in his survival and did what she could to realize that. Her situation was far from ideal, but she acted well under her constraints.
