Yeah, seriously. You'd have to be a very weird sort of straw vulcan to find /any/ value in this scenario. It's like the author assumes normal human emotions like guilt, love, empathy and morality don't exist. Even for an evil Belle the novelty of having your own castle with a bunch of animated objects would last... maybe a few days, weeks? after which you just wanna get back to normal life. It'd be more fun to just abuse your emotionally weak husband and real human servants.
