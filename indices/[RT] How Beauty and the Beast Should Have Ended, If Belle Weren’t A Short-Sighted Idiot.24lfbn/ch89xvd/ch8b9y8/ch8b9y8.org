Agreed. Even if Belle were somehow able to step back from her being-in-love perspective to make a purely selfish choice, the author's scenario is seriously subpar. Ruling a moldering castle run by animated objects, that doesn't actually rule anything else because it's blocked off by Evil Forest, in isolated loneliness is not a particularly great life. Instead, she could profess her love, break the curse, gain a husband who loves her, who owns an actually repairable castle filled with /people/, with the potential to re-establish dominion over the surrounding area. I think the writer has made a Classic Error of Ravenclaw, and is maybe seriously morally deficient.
