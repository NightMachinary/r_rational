Entirely unconcerned with the idea of Beast dying and wanting to profit from his death, at least. Beast showed clear signs of being abusive. While it's entirely possible to think his abusiveness was linked to the stress of his condition, that just means he's safe*r* in happy times and unsafe in stressful times.

Drop that sucker like a bag of angry vipers and don't look back.

And be nice to the people working with and for you. They can make your life hell if they choose.
