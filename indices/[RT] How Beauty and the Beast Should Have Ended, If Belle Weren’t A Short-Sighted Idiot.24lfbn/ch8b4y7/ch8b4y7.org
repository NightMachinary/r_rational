This isn't really a compelling theory, frankly. In the story (as in real life) love exists. It has quantifiable effects, especially when shared.

Belle feels honest love for the Beast, which breaks the magical curse, as he shares it.

It is certainly possible that Belle would have still earned the Beast's heart if she had not loved him (which, for this to happen, she could not have). It's unlikely, however, that she could have convinced every member of the castle that she felt that love (especially without the empirical evidence of the curse breaking).

There's no real understanding of Belle's character or psychology displayed here, no explanation of why the castle's inhabitants (who still showed every sign of possessing free will) would act as they are portrayed. I find it much more likely that Evil Belle would have 'accidentally' suffocated one night when her mattress mysteriously flipped, or that a 'tragic' fire in the kitchen would have been her undoing. The animated objects were servants, not slaves, and would have been unlikely to serve an outright abusive mistress.
