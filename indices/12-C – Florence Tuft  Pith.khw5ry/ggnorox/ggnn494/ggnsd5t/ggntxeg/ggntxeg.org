Who are you guys rooting for in this series?

I wanted to root for Anabelle, but she is just so indoctrinated it is painful to watch. She lacks direction and so she latches onto what she has been taught and pushes away or ignores anything that contradicts her world views.

Tunnel Vision has the goals I like the most, but like her nomme de guerre, she only focuses on the end goal and has become a monster. I was really hoping Ana had been projecting her body fraud on commonplace incorrectly and that they wouldn't stoop so low, but it seems like Tunnel Vision has used some unethical fundraising strategies.

I think I'm just rooting against Paragon and the government that is supported/supports it. We've just seen so much abuse by them that I just want it to burn to the ground.
