Ana, please take this idea and run with it. The Humdrums in the navy sure did.

Speaking of, the fact that no one even considered the idea that the largely Humdrum navy might turn traitor for the revolutionary group fighting for (among other things) Humdrum rights is a great example of Paragon's ideological blinders fucking them over. They genuinely can't conceive of their opponents as people making informed decisions. To them, every member of Commonplace is an inscrutable creature with alien values hellbent on the destruction of the Principality for unknowable reasons, so the idea that Commonplace's ideology might actually appeal to some people doesn't even occur to them. Paragon doesn't even think of Commonplace as /having/ an ideology, it's just a barbarian horde, and I laugh every single time that bites them in the ass.
