I'm not really giving the moral high ground to either side of the big picture - I'm just rooting for the correction/vindication of smaller but morally unambiguous wrongs - like, I'm fine with Tunny taking down the echelin reaponsible for the fake narrative that painted (and possibly /made her/) into the Pyre Witch, but I afterwards I also want Ana to take Tunny down because hustling the terminally ill is a big nono in my book.

Also go Tasia, because her plotline seems the most interesting to me.
