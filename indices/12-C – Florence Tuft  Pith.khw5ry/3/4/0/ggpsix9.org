Tunnel vision's goals I feel are a net positive to the harm she is doing, but it's not just conning a few civilians. The chapter where Maxine murders the bright eyed newly admitted Paragon student was tough to read. The domestic terrorism is also despicable, but I'm not sure how much of that was actually the green circle and how much of it was Paragon to discredit their cause.
