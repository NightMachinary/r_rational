I think Jun was recently in a redemption camp, right?, meaning they're still in practice. So Grace's Path to Victory is probably still freeing everyone from the redemption camps. But I don't think it's been explicitly confirmed that this is the case, so there might be a twist

Purely ideologically I think Commonplace is right vs Paragon and the Epistocrats, but both sides have done completely awful things that it makes it hard to unequivocally root for either. I think it's probably easiest to root for Queen Sulphur but as pov characters it's easy for a reader to be biased towards them. Or maybe Tasia but she's kind of a cop-out answer since she's not a major player
