I am rather honoured to have been recommended.

W.R.T. suspense, the setup for the MLP Loops with regard to that can pretty much be expressed twofold. 1) Most of the time, it's kind of cracky and the lack of effective opposition doesn't matter so much. Apparently defeating a cosmic evil by bribing her with ice cream, say. 2) When there is a serious threat of some kind... well, I quote the expert, Rincewind, on the occasion he was given a virtual-reality suit. "What does not kill you can give you a really big headache." A threat doesn't have to be existential to be a challenge, IOW.

Anyway. Glad to see people like the fic.
