  Fundamentally, Harry Potter's canon plots is part of that group of stories where if you know the ending and who the villain is and what their plan is, it has very little capacity to threaten you.

I think this view might be mostly based on how a lot of Harry Potter time loop and Peggy Sue stories have /godly/ powerful protagonists right from the start, or because the author has a very uninteresting view of powerleveling magical skills, thus making solving things with magic uninteresting and the canon villain unthreatening. But if the main character has Harry's skills even as of the ends of the stories, and it is hard to gain more without great effort, they aren't actually equipped to deal with Voldemort level threats once things roll off the rails, after which their knowledge means a lot less.

Does knowing how to beat traps that three eleven-year-olds can solve anyway really help keep someone safe and Voldemort as a shade in the first book? Remember, that year Harry literally has Voldemort as a teacher. That's a big threat.

Does knowing what is in the chamber really help in keeping the hero and other students safe, even if they /try/ to tackle that one early? There are consequences to the actions they'd have to take in those situations, and it leaves a lot of room for an author to add in their own gap filling stuff.

They kill it with a crowing rooster, great. Does that mean the Diary is just going to roll over and die? What is everyone's reaction when they start killing giant snakes and Horcruxes? The protagonist is still a little kid, and there are actually governmental bodies based on making sure they don't use magic outside of school, so they can't just go around themselves whacking Death Eaters and Horcruxes. Unless the bonehead author decides to give them an out on that dramatic plot point.

Ultimately, the original plot is so full of plot-armored near misses that would be fatal to any normal character that it doesn't seem clear how to get through to a good loop without a lot of work. Which would be the story's challenge. You can make a realistic, nearly no-win /environment/ the Death Star if you have to, especially if the main character isn't protected by plot armor anymore.

Sure, the original plots die a quick death, but the world goes one. /That's/ the story.
