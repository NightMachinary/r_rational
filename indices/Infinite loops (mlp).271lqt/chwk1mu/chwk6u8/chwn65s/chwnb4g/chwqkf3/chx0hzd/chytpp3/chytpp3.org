  the woman in that story thought she was designing a Friendly AI
#+end_quote

Nah, she just thought that going with the not-quite-a-paperclipper was safer than waiting, in an environment where /she personally/ slew an AI dedicated to making people suffer horribly and then die, and the underlying code was available and being built on by both the military and script-kiddies for various unsafe purposes.

If only she'd thought to implement the 'friendship and ponies' clause as a temporary instrumental value, to spread by making the game do well...
