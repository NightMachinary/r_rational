The sad part is that this logic makes perfect sense when dealing with processes governed by entropic decay instead of entropic optimization. When dealing with entropic optimization, you need to be damn sure to /get it right/.

EDIT: Also, it occurs that this may have been what was meant when it turned out the Lone One had a purpose in the world after all. Entropy turns out to be a far more sophisticated invention than death, when you look into the science of it.
