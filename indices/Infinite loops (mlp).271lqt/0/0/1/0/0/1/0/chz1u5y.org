I really need to get around to reading some of the Bureauverse stuff at some point. And to be honest I might agree with you, if I had to choose between the two. The main thing that put me off from the idea of uploading was the idea of Celest-AI systematically destroying the universe to allow herself to optimize the experience of the uploadees. The being a convert still allows me the possibility of studying the true blue universe. Of course if either of these options came up in our world I would most definitely start rallying the forces to fight against these two +all powerful+ +terrifying+ +unholy+ I don't think the English language has words for these two creatures.
