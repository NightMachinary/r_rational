I'm quite fond of this one myself - granted, it's largely a "what if" gimmick and one-off gags, but that's a lot of fun in and of itself. When it takes the time to delve into short-story territory, it gets quite fun. Also, it has Pinkie Pie as Slaanesh; what's not to like?

It's not in the LessWrong group over on Fimfiction though, I notice.
