  The Infinite Loops, also known as the Innortal-style Time Loops, are an ever-expanding genre of Time Loop fanfics.

  The premise is that something has happened to Yggdrasil, the World Tree computer that contains and runs the multiverse. As a result, the various universes have been put in 'safe mode', time-looping until Yggdrasil can be repaired. Each universe's loop is maintained by the presence of an Anchor, a core person from that loop who is the first to notice their universe is looping. There is always an Anchor in a Loop.

It's just a massive collection of short stories. Great time sink, if you're into that sort of thing. Still managed to be fun even though it really shouldn't be able to be fun for that long. Don't expect hard sci-fi, or even anything too rational. Vaguely related to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/][fun theory]]?

Some readers might compare Yggdrasil to the computers in permutation city. There's not a whole lot in overarching plot though.
