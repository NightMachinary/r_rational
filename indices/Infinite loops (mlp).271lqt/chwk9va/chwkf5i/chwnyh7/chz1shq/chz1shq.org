[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past]] (warning unfinished) is quite a good read, but heavy on the titular +angstfests+ nightmares. It's made interesting by virtue of the titular future being /worse/ than the one in the books.

Wastelands of Time was a pretty good read but lost me with its ending that I found rushed and stupid with no resolution at all. A shame the sequel was never finished.
