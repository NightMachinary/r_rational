Fundamentally, Harry Potter's canon plots is part of that group of stories where if you know the ending and who the villain is and what their plan is, it has very little capacity to threaten you - year 1 knowing Quirrel and the mirror and the puzzle rooms, year 2 knowing about the chamber and it's details, etc. Most of them are not difficult because of lack of power of people on the protagonists' side, but because of lack of knowledge. So giving them that foreknowledge puts them squarely into the problem of "Frodo just got a lightsaber, where's Sauron's Death Star?" as paraphrased from something Yudkowsky wrote somewhere. There's lots of time travel fics with reasonably OK writing - it's usually the absence of tension in the plots that kills them, more than anything else. If you're trying to sell me on a dramatic confrontation between good and evil, it is vitally important that this confrontation have meaningful results if the protagonist loses, rather than retrying infinite times without penalty - if they just keep retrying, it basically ends up as the viewer watching someone play a videogame they are not good at, and, well...

Even just having foreknowledge without repeatable timetravel loops is enough to wreck many stories with only canon opposition, to be honest.

There are multiple fics which found solutions to this problem:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] (Naruto) made there be antagonists with the same looping power as the protagonists and the ability to affect people across loops via mind-control abilities, which are both demonstrated fairly on in the story, which maintains power levels and tension.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]] (HP) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5409165/1/It-s-For-a-Good-Cause-I-Swear][It's For A Good Cause, I Swear!]] (Naruto) both by Sarah1281, take the approach of making absurdity and humor the focus of the fic, over conflict with canon antagonists.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time][Harry Potter and the Wasteland of Time]] (HP) takes the approach of increasing canon antagonist skill/power by a huge amount and also by introducing nonlooping opposition.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]] (HP) makes looping ennui itself the enemy rather than a canon antagonist.

- [[http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/ngp/][New Game Plus]] (Haruhi, oneshot) is a straight comedy that doesn't rely on tension to hold together the story.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8942429/1/][Back Again]] (LOTR) has Bilbo losing allies and doing fighting non-canonical challenges a lot.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3248583/1/][Groundhog Day]] (HP) is basically just straight crack/comedy, as is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] by the same author.

There are a lot of looping timetravel stories which are technically reasonably OK on the writing side, but lack all tension because there hasn't been a presented way for the protagonists with time travel abilities to possibly lose in any sort of serious or permanent way.

For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] has bad stuff happen occasionally, but nothing ever permanently affecting or persistent through loops - so there is no real question that eventually through sheer perseverance and luck they will win through (or would have, if the fic wasn't deader than a doornail). I guess maybe the H/Hr romance subplot is supposed to be a reader's interest, maybe, but that plot is so slowly developing that it's almost unreal.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7820743/1/Naruto-Ramen-Days][Naruto: Ramen Days]] (Naruto) loses a lot of dramatic power because of absence of meaningful ability to lose at anything, but there seems to be some developing antagonism/etc between new looping people which may lead to actual meaningful conflict eventually so I'm not going to write it off wholly just yet (mostly because the author's written other good stuff, than because I necessarily think the fic as-is is showing it's going to redeem itself strongly)
