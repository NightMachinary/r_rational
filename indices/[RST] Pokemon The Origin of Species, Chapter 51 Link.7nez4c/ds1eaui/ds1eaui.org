Fun fact about electrical attacks: electric eels have to be impedance matched to their surroundings. In the ocean, with salt water having high conductivity, all their electrical cells are "wired" in parallel to deliver high current. In fresh water which has higher resistivity, they put them in series to increase the voltage; the increased internal resistance is matched to the increased external resistance.

Obviously this is a species by species thing though, not something they can reconfigure.
