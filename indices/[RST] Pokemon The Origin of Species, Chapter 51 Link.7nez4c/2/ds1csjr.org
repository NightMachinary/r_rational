This development with the psybond is nice.

You can see how he's pondering and attuning with pichu to to gauge attack expectancy. Then using that info to attack more judiciously and tip the battle odds.

Then he links with charmander and its new revelations because charmanders different and aggressive, little bloodlusty; but thats kind of his nature.

Let charmander "drive" while battling? Is it cool to override their instinct? Safety of all? Long term trainable/ untrainable: types? Specific pokemon? Specifics within specifics? Through evolutionary lines?

Red is a rennasaince man: virtuous, always striving to get better, reflective. Then modest and wants to propel world forward in information, understanding, safety.

Red is awesome.
