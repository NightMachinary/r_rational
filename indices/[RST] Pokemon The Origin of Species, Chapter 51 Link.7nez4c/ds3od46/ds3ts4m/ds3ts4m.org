Their instincts definitely aren't optimized for every battle encounter: the point is more that their response time and decision making is more fluid and adaptive than waiting for a command and then following a somewhat rote attack order. I may not have made that as clear as I could have, but it's definitely not the case that a wild pokemon will always be more effective at combat, and trainer intelligence and strategy is still way more important in the long run.
