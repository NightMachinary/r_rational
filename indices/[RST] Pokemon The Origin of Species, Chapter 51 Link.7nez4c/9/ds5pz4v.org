This whole chapter was basically Pokemon theme song lyrics earning their place in the setting. I'm talking about “You teach me, and I'll teach you,” [[http://www.metrolyrics.com/pokemon-theme-lyrics-pokemon.html][from the show]]. Red is learning from his partners' instincts and experience. I'm onto your scheme!

This diabolical plan to write great chapters...you'll never get away with it!
