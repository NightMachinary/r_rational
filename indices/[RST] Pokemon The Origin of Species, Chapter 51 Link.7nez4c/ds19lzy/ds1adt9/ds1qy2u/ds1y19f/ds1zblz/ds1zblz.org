Playing Witcher 3, it always made me feel weird to help some family with a monster problem, not accept a reward (for the occasions when they were really poor and clearly needed the money more than I did), and then be able to rob their house of its valuables... which often amounted to more than the reward, the cheapskates. If they'd coded in even a couple of lines like "Hey! We need that!" or "How could you?" I probably would have stopped, but there are so many valuables tucked away in all the crates and drawers and barrels around the world that it's hard not to grab them when the game treats it like it's expected.

Though, fun story on that, recently was accosted by a taxman in a city who asks if you've been engaging in certain activities that are exploitative to account for "unreported income." One of them is stealing people's stuff, which I copped to. Geralt even brings up that "no one's objected," which the taxman astutely observes is hardly an excuse.
