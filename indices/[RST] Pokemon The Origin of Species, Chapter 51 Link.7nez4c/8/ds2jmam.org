I hope Red isn't disappointed when he finds out the only way he can get his hands on an Electric/Psychic Pokemon is a trip to Alola for him and Pichu, and then a lot of fluffy pancakes.

Of course he could always go looking for one in [[http://capx.wikia.com/wiki/Neureka][fan]]-made [[http://pokemon-uranium.wikia.com/wiki/Neopunk][regions]], but those sources can be a bit [[http://pgenvp.wikia.com/wiki/Dubus][dubious]].

Evolution still strikes as one of the most "magical" things in this rational pokeverse. Definitely tells me that the answer to Red's question of where they all came from cannot simply be descent with modification through natural selection.

Red is showing a bit of a knack for battling, and maybe even the inkling of a passion for it. Maybe we will see him a lonely former champion silently leering over the peaks of Mt. Silver yet.
