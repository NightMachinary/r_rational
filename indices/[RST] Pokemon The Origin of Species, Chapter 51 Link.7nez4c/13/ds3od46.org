I don't like the idea that pokemon have good instincts for fighting. I mean, it makes sense that they would, but given that you'd think they'd be told "attack" instead of being given specific attacks. My headcanon is that they don't have a full understanding of types, especially with pokemon they don't interact with in the wild, so being told what to do is actually helpful.
