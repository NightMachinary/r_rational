To put it another way: Ohm's Law is quite clear, voltage = current x resistance.

If electric pokemon have the ability to shift electric charges around with effort (basically, by expending chemical energy), then it's easy to see how they could produce different voltages by shifting different amounts of charge. However, that would also alter current in proportion. The only way to vary one without changing the other would be to change the resistance of the circuit. Something like the earlier suggestion of ionising the path to the target, perhaps.
