I thought the current was the amount of electrons being transferred and the voltage was the speed at which the electrons are traveling? I know that's still using a metric relating to time, but isn't it normal to refer to that by some standard interval, like discharge amount of the whole battery in an hour (leading to the ampere-hour)? Or is there a better word for the amount of electrons available to be transferred, like just "charge," measured in coulombs?
