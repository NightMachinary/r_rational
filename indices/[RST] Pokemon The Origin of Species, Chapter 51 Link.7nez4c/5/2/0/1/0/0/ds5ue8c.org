  current was the amount of electrons being transferred

More or less.

#+begin_quote
  voltage was the speed at which the electrons are traveling

No. Voltage is the difference in potential between the start and end of the flow. It's basically pressure, but it doesn't translate to velocity in the way that water pressure would.

If you increase the charge differential (voltage), then you get proportionally more electrons (current) being pushed through the same resistance.

The only way to vary one, while keeping the other constant, is to adjust the resistance.

Edit: Also, according to Wikipedia, a 1-amp current represents 1 coulomb of charge being transferred per second. So, an ampere-hour represents a charge transfer of 3600 coulombs.
