Ahh, okay. So it might make more sense to have the pokemon able to somehow adjust the resistance of the air between them and the target, as [[/u/u___v]] says.

  Also, according to Wikipedia, a 1-amp current represents 1 coulomb of charge being transferred per second. So, an ampere-hour represents a charge transfer of 3600 coulombs.

So it would be better to just say that pokemon run low on "electric charge" or "capacitance," and measure it in coulombs?
