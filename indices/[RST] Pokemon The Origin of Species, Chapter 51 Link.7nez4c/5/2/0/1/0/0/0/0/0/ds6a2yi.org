  However, the combination of the two would indeed allow for tuning of voltage and current separately.

Could you explain this more?

  No, pokemon can't store their entire electrical capability as a static charge in their bodies.

I meant as a shorthand for what amount of charge they're capable of producing through whatever chemical or quasimagical biological methods they use to "store" it.

Like if you wanted to say that a pokemon was running low on charge, you wouldn't say they're "running low on their ability to use chemical potential energy to generate more charge," it would be implied by just saying "charge" that this was what you referred to. Or did I miss your meaning?
