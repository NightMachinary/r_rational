I think mechanically of electric pokemon like batteries that can change their voltage and slowly recharge over time: they have a certain amount of current available that can be measured based on certain specified conditions (like how much voltage they're using and what medium they're channeling it through) which does usually looks more like a result of a process of discharge, but reflects an internal available amount of current. Does that make sense, or am I missing something?
