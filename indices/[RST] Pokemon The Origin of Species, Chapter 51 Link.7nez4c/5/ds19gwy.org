Happy new year everyone! For those of you still waiting on the next Guardian chapter or Rationally Writing episode, CFAR and holidays kept me busy this month, but I'm hoping to get back on top of my other projects in the coming weeks. If you have an RSS feed, my site will inform you as soon as they're up.

Lots of fun facts about electricity in this chapter, which probably means a lot of errors, large and small. If you spot one, please let me know. All other feedback also welcome, as always, and thanks to all my readers and patrons for still being here, year by year.

May the new you that woke up this morning be the best culmination of every you that came before, and the start of an even greater future self.
