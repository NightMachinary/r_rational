Love this update.

Just a minor tidbit--voltage hurts, current kills. People always think about the big voltage numbers as being super lethal, but it takes a remarkably small amount of current (half an amp) to reliably stop your heart, and even less to have a chance to do it, so long as the electricity passes through that part of your body.

As dangerous as the idea of giant rock monsters or bloodthirsty flying fire-breathing dragons might be, I'd be far /far/ more afraid to live in a world where a random rat chewing on wires in the walls could /accidentally/ kill me.
