Why would there be?

The Mon world is far less industrial than ours and less populated than ours, thanks mostly due to the existence of the Mon themselves and an occasional "great war" that lowers the population drastically (the one back in AZ's day, and possibly the fan-theorized one Surge served in).

That's without even consideration that such a thing isn't even agreed upon in the /real/ world.

What gets me is that a group of powerful trainers doesn't get together to stop one of them. The Elite Four, perhaps. There would be a sort of "snowball effect" once a /really/ powerful or Legendary Mon is captured, as it makes it easier to acquire another, and then another, etc.

That means either nobody has tried (unlikely), that any sufficiently powerful group can't agree and trust each other to decide which person gets to keep it should they succeed, that at some point a powerful group of people did so and failed in such a fashion that it became well known and laws were put in place to stop unsanctioned attempts, or that such a process is currently underway but the one who is doing it hasn't achieved that stage in their plan yet (ie: Giovanni with Mewtwo. I'm not spoilering that, it's a thing since Gen 1). Actually, the last two can both be true at the same time.
