  The mind merging has a shatoshi-gekkouga vibe that is opening some (maybe rule of cool) possibilities

I've always thought that things like that should be possible between psychic trainers and their pokemon :) I never watched the anime past like the second season, but heard about this of course and saw a few clips on youtube. It seemed a bit too shonen for me, lots of just "be stronger through more willpower," and I'm hoping to make this more cerebral and strategic.

Thanks for commenting, looking forward to any more in depth reviews :)
