  Could you explain this more?

Well, if pokemon are able to expend effort in order to create charge buildups, and are also able to expend effort in order to reduce the target's resistance (eg creating ionised channels in the air), then they can indeed "tune" their attacks in the ways the chapter suggested, aiming for high voltage (focused on building charge) or high current (focused on lowering resistance).

Though ultimately, the resistance of the target, rather than the air, is what really matters. If that resistance is constant, then voltage applied to the target and current flow through the target will remain strictly proportional.

  I meant as a shorthand

Fair enough. Yeah, just calling it "charge" works. We talk about charging batteries all the time; doesn't have to mean an actual static charge.
