I think that their abilities would need to include some level of spontaneous charge generation, not just lowering resistance. Even a superconductor doesn't have any current flow on its own.

However, the combination of the two would indeed allow for tuning of voltage and current separately.

No, pokemon can't store their entire electrical capability as a static charge in their bodies. If one did, it would be immediately struck by a lightning bolt equivalent to its entire potential output for the day. They need to store it in some other form; most batteries use chemical potential energy.
