The important thing is how much current goes through your heart. It takes very little, only 90 milliamps.

Normally your skin is highly resistive, so it takes a lot of voltage across, say, your arms, to create a current inside your body.

If your skin on, say, just your hands is wet, you get a larger area of the same skin resistivity, and less voltage will cause the same internal current. Apparently this can be deadly with even small batteries.

If your entire body is wet or better, submerged, then the current is short circuited around your innards: now you need a large supply of current with a low source resistance to get that critical 90mA through your less-conductive body, even with a large amount bypassed. Think lightning strike on a pool, massive current.
