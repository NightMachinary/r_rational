I don't think electric attacks would reliably work the kind of way you're describing here, but I'm not confident about the exact results.

However, if you're giving electric pokemon a kind of ability to remotely influence the charges of things, a better mechanism for electrical attacks would be to use this ability to briefly ionize channels of air between themselves and the target, reducing the breakdown voltage so they could generate much more prominent arcs, over longer distances and with greater control over the shape than would ordinarily be possible. This would give them the ability to quickly create plasma 'wires' between themselves and their target, making it much easier to run a current.
