Yeah, I'm trying to make something that really shouldn't work make sense, with the main bit of handwavyness being the mysterious way that pokemon choose where the electric discharge is "aimed." I did consider your idea that they ionize the air itself, and I may have that be a specific kind of attack or something certain pokemon can do, but overall I felt it would make the Type itself too strong, since it would provide so much control. If it makes more sense, though, maybe I should find some other way to nerf it and go with that instead.
