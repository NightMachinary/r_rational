According to Chp 8, the timing is not completely random.

  "Yeah, each one is seasonal .... The exact days vary, but Articuno usually becomes active in the winter, Zapdos in the summer, and Moltres in the fall .... They've been spotted flying around at other times, but they don't bring the storms. Or maybe it's better to say the storms aren't around to attract them".

So there's a seasonality to their movements. Red doesn't seem to know about any sort of spatial pattern, so sure, they're probably not migrating equivalent to birds IRL.

But /if/ they're attracted to pre-existing storm systems which they then enhance somehow, then the regional climate likely has some measure of control over where their rampages occur. Then if the regional climate is somehow disturbed by anthropogenic activities, then the behaviour of the local storms would begin changing, and... uh oh. [[/u/daystareld]], have any climate/Earth scientists in your Pokemon world identified evidence of anthropogenic climate change?

Alternatively, if the birds generate their storm systems from scratch (which means they're a lot more powerful), then their paths may still be influenced by biological needs, like food, or fleeing predation... and mating, maybe...? (They don't breed in the games except in Pokemon Snap, but a one-individual species should not exist unless there's some parthenogenesis, or something even stranger, happening).
