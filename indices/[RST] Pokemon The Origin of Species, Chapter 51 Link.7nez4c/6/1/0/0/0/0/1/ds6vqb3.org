I agree with everything except the last paragraph. The legendaries are pretty "magical" in the show and the games, and even if you make them rational and a biological force (albeit a superpowered one - even when compared to other mons), they are still the "ultimate" threat - the Bird Trio has nothing to fear from nature except Lugia I guess, so the fleeing predation point doesn't matter. Maybe they somehow absorb nutrients and stuff from their respective elements ? Or from the Earth itself when they are resting (aka in their off-seasons) or hibernating.\\
And maybe they genetically can't breed, and however they were designed or came to be (be it Arceus or whatever) made them in such a manner for a particular reason which hasn't been unveiled yet.
