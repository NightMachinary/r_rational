This is perhaps one of the more beautiful Pokemon theories I've heard of in a long time. I've seen many 'Humans are Pokemon' theories on Reddit, but they're almost all about how the humans in Pokemon differ from us physically (e.g being able to take repeated electric shocks and be fine, being able to spontaneously resuscitate after drowning, etc..).

But this is the first theory that may explain how Humans Being Pokemon might influence them psychologically, and therefore influence their culture on a large scale, and I think I like it so much that I'm accepting as part of my own personal canon. In fact I love it so much that I'm going to basically graft into every anime universe I know of - it would explain why so many anime characters (from basketball players to chefs to ninjas) are all so dedicated to their crafts; they're all Pokemon and Pokemon want to compete.

Also is the whole Humans are Pokemon theory part of this rat!fic? Because I've always wondered where a rational fic would go with that premise. Would the psychic and ghost people just be evolutions on the Human Tree? Perhaps humans don't evolve because the conditions required for it are just so subtle/rare/mysterious that only a few exactly fulfill them and gain abilities? Endless possibilities!
