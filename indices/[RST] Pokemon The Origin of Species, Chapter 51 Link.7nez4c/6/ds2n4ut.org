Pokemon get stronger and even gain large boosts in strength (evolution) when they fight. It seems like stronger and more evolved Pokemon would face less predation and less resource and reproductive competition. If Pokemon have to be their highest evolution to be sexually mature and reproduce, that puts an even stronger pressure on Pokemon to get stronger.

It means that Pokemon relationships with humans are more symbiotic than the rights activists might think, because trainers boost their Pokemons' growth and fulfill their Pokemons' natural drives. It certainly shapes human society to have a very strong paradigm centered on self-improvement through work and competition. It also could have some implications if the 'humans are Pokemon' theory turns out to be true.

I think that if Red keeps spending time in his Pokemons' heads, he could be affected by this mindset. What you were doing with Charmander in this chapter seemed more about natural carnivorous instincts and expanding the concept of the conditioning Pokemon go through to not be wild, but I'm also interested to see if this factors into the mysteries of the Storm Birds and Mewtwo.
