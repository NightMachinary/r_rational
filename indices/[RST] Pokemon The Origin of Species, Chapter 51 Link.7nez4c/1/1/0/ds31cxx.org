From the author's bio:

#+begin_quote
  Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  The story basically has 3 arcs, and I finished two as of chapter 54. So I'm about 2/3 of the way done.
#+end_quote

My guess is that this last arc will end up being by far the largest one though. My guess is that we have 15-40 more chapters left in it.

The large variance is due to taking into account time skips (or months that are heavily summarized) and being unsure of how detailed the out of loop iteration will be. Any type of afterword could be quite long.
