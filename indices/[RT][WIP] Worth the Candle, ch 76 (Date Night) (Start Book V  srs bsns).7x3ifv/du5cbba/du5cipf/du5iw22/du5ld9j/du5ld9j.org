I really hope so because the alternative is some rather gross and ethically questionable acts just so he can finish the quest. Which presumably carries a significant reward, in games in this genre, companion quests provide a /significant/ power boost. Even moreso because in this game, all his companions can be fielded at once, there's no party size limit. Also at least in other games in this genre, if you don't do key loyalty missions, you will be forced to sacrifice a companion during the main quest...
