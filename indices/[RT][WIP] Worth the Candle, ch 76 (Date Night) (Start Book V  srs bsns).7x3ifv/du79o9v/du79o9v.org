Short question: Is Val actually elvish? Or are non-anima a separate race (because race is transmitted via the soul, not genetics)? As in: There would be one "non-anima humanoid" form, regardless of parents' races.

I'm asking because Val's parents should both be elves (except if Fallatehr has run a pretty long breeding program and she is half-elven; and I don't think this could work out, because he only got control over the prison once all the non-elves died off).

Then, one would next ask about the physiology of non-anima: teeth (elven-style or human-style?), aging (elven-style or human-style?), heredity, sexual organs, etc.

Naively I would have expected her to be physiologically elven (except for the eyes) and significantly older (choose a random age between ~100 and 0, which is the possible time-frame for the start of Fallatehr's non-anima experiment).

Hence, Val's age appears narratively determined: Out of quite a long time-frame, they happen to break out Fallatehr in the short interval where his one (guesswork) non-anima-daughter is in a fitting age bracket. Make that plus one for retro-causal messing of the DM (practically ret-conning, just like a human DM; even a mighty simulator cannot be expected to solve pspace-complete post-selection).

...and now I am sad that Joon didn't call her Null, star of the void, instead of Valencia the red. Or he could have tried for a Bobby Tables style name (I name thee "root", 'of the screamin' WHERE 1=1').
