  Shadows, Glimwarden, and Metropolitan Man,
#+end_quote

I loved MM, it seems I have two new stories to read.

What confuses me slightly is this: Alex has said previously that WtC is a self-insert. Which would indicate he is 18-19 in the real world, right?

Am I wrong here?

Metropolitan Man was written in 2014, which would put him around 14 at the time of writing it. Unless he has used his past-self as a self insert, it is pretty incredible how great an author he was for such an age.

I mean, it's great story regardless, I enjoy his writing in any case, but for a teenager to be this good, that's incredible.
