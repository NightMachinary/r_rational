  What confuses me slightly is this: Alex has said previously that WtC is a self-insert. Which would indicate he is 18-19 in the real world, right?
#+end_quote

It's a loose self-insert, largely because the story involves a lot of people that I wouldn't be comfortable directly copying in a written work, and if I was going so far as to change /them/, then I might as well change a few things about /myself/ so as to provide some plausible deniability and give a thin veneer of privacy.

(I'd rather not answer any questions about what's true, what's adapted, and what's made up, mostly because I'd end up having to talk about my issues, and part of the reason I'm writing this is because I would rather do that in prose form.)
