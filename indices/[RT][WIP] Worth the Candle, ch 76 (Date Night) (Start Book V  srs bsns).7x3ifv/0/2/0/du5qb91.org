  Using a pseudonym is interesting: I tried and failed to get into one of your other original stories, and didn't like it, so if you used that name for this, I might not have read it. (I also probably didn't try hard enough to get into your story. Maybe one day.) Maybe not, because this kept getting upvoted a lot, and I'm in a constant state of trying to find something to read.

This is one of the nice things about using a pseudonym that's not connected to your other pseudonyms. People don't come in making comparisons or with preconceptions of how you write or who you are, and the work stands by itself without that much of an authorial presence aside from what's on the page for that specific work.

(One of the ethical questions I think about is that by depriving people of information, you're preventing them from making an informed choice about what to read. I'm hoping that no one feels really bitter about being tricked into reading this story because they'd made a vow not to read anything I'd written ever again, but those were the dice that I threw.)
