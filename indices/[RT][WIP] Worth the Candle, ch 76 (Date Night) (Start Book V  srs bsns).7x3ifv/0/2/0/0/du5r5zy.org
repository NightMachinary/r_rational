I think that, for the most part, you're ethically fine. If you were evil, and so I choose not to read your work, it wouldn't really be a big problem. Free works mean that just by reading it, I wouldn't necessarily be supporting you (and thus evil). Donating, on the other hand, is more morally dubious.

Still a little stupid to debate, though, because any free will you took away is so unbelievably miniscule in comparison to many other common things we experience. I'd argue that the good the work itself does more than balances out any evil you committed by using a pseudonym. So don't worry! :)

That silliness aside, I like how you handled the pseudonym here, in comparison to the Waves Arisen. We still don't know if that's Eliezer or not, and it would be nice to have the author confirm or deny that prediction.

Around now was perfect, imo. I don't know if I'd want you to use a pseudonym in the future though, because I'd want to make sure I read your future works. (Past works are not as important, because quality increases over time. I did enjoy Metropolitan Man though.) It would not be a big shame to bamboozle us again, but it would be a bit weird. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Ponder it; I don't have a strong opinion either way.

I suppose it's less weird to do it on purpose than for lolz.
