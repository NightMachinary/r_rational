  This is one of the nice things about using a pseudonym that's not connected to your other pseudonyms.

FWIW (the candle!), it was the opposite for me: I found the description unappealing and started following it pretty late.

If I had known that it was you, then I would have followed it from the start; you earned sufficient trust that I will give anything you write a try, regardless of genre/description.

Well, this way I got positively surprised once I actually got around to binging "worth the candle"; there's always a silver lining.

(and then I got disappointed because alexanderwales and cthulhuraejepsen funge against each other wrt output)
