It was mostly successful. 8/10. I don't believe I have any stories that aren't cross-linked, but in some cases you'd have to trawl through months or years of comments in order to find the link (it's something that I should probably work on, even stories under the Alexander Wales pen name [[https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/36o0mm/stuff_thats_not_on_my_website_fictionpress_or/][can be a little bit decentralized]]).

I'll probably do it again, but not for anything as long and involved as /Worth the Candle./
