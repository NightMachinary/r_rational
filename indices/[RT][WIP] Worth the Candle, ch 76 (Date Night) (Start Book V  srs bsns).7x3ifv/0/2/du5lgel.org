I swear half the stuff on this sub is written by you.

But seriously, I remember seeing some post a little while back about how 75% of the stories are actually written by you, Eliezer, and maybe someone else. I can't remember. Something like that is legitimately true. We need some sort of productivity statistics for rational authors/stories.

As another person stated, I'm disappointed because the amount of people actually writing rational fiction is lower than expected. One author less than we thought. *We could have had Alexander Wales and cthulhuraejepsen combined!* But it's really only one person. ðŸ˜ž

I got totally bamboozled.

Using a pseudonym is interesting: I tried and failed to get into one of your other original stories, and didn't like it, so if you used that name for this, I might not have read it. (I also probably didn't try hard enough to get into your story. Maybe one day.) Maybe not, because this kept getting upvoted a lot, and I'm in a constant state of trying to find something to read.

I'm glad I read this though; this is one of my favorite original stories, and your early update rate was insane. This is an awesome story.

Once I actually get a revenue stream (I'm a college student), I promise to donate something to the Patreon eventually. I need to pay back to all the creators I like, and you deserve it especially for the bamboozle.

Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ You're amazing.

I keep just getting this feeling of amazement and that feeling that you just got played hard. Man. Props to you, so much.

Alright, I'm gonna read the chapter now. I wonder how much the character of Juniper maps onto you. He's an incredibly well developed character.
