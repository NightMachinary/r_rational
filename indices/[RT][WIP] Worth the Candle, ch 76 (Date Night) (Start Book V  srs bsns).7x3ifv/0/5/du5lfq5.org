Wow, I absolutely did not see that coming. I really loved your work as Alexander Wales (especially the dark wizard of donkerk - why wouldn't you publish it, or at least add it to your site, btw?), but still somehow did not recognize your style here.

Worth the candle is top notch. It keeps me awake at the late hours of the night as only the very best books does. I think I will donate some humble amount, as a token of my appreciation. Cheers!
