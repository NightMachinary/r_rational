I keep meaning to go over /Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ to at least do a first editing pass ... but I like writing a lot more than editing. Enough people have read it now that there's not really a point in trying to keep it as a separate thing with caveats about quality and/or having been written under a different-than-normal process.

(Seriously though, I don't like editing. It's still my dream that an agent or publisher will come along some day and say "hey, we'll get you an editor and pay them to edit for you", but that's not normally something that happens to people.)
