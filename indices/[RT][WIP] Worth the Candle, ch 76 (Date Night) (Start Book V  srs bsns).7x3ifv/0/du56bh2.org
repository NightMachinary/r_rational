If you're wondering where ch 75 went, it's just a character sheet and some screens that are on it, mostly for quick reference/refresher, titled "Stats for Nerds".

This web serial now has [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][a functional Patreon]] under my Alexander Wales pen name, but I'll still be posting to reddit for stuff related to this fic using the [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] pseud. You can read the About section on the Patreon for more information.

Thanks for reading!
