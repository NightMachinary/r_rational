I'm more surprised by the name revelation than I should be, given that I've enjoyed all your works. It seems obvious in hindsight, but such things often are. Anyway, I respect the desire to keep something as personal as even a pseudo-SI quarantined under a pseudonym and hope that the experience has proved rewarding.
