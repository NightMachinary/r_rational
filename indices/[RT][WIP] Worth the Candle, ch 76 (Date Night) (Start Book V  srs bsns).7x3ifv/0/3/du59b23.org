More seriously this is surprising, and in a weird way disappointing. I don't mean that as a criticism of you, it's just that there's apparently one less author of rational fiction whose work I enjoy.

I used to live in a world where cthuluraejepsen and Alexander Wales could both be writing a story independently of each other. Now the potential amount of good, new rational fiction per unit of time is decreased when compared to that perception.
