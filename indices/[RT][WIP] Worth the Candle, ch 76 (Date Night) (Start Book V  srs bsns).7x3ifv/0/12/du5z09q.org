Holy shit

Now that you've mentioned it, we /should/ have guessed! Nobody is this impossibly articulate about (meta)narrative other than the author of Shadows of the Limelight!

I have to say, WtC is your best work so far. Probably the best part is the highly intelligent characters chatting, yet in very identifiable and distinct voices.

My only regret is that I thought we had another excellent new author to the fold!
