The terminology might be a little bit off, given that was written from memory (as it should be, in character).

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_set][Smith set]] is the smallest non-empty set of all candidates who have pairwise victories over all candidates outside the set. For example, if you have three voters voting for three candidates:

#+begin_example
  A>B>C
  B>C>A
  C>B>A
#+end_example

... then A loses to B and C in pairwise elections, C wins against A and loses against B, and B wins against C and A, meaning that B is the only member of the Smith set.

Normal instant-runoff voting sometimes selects a winner outside the Smith set, which means that it doesn't meet the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_criterion][Smith criterion]]. By first finding the Smith set, then doing IRV within it, the winner will always be within the Smith set.
