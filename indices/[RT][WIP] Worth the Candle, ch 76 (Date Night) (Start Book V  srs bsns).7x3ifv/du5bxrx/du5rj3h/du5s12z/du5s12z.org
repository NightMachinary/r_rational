Okay, those words answer my confusion. I was concerned that if A B and C formed a Smith set, someone could rig a Smith set with just A and B, unfairly excluding C. "All" answers that. I was also concerned that there might be other forms of arbitrariness in privileging one possible set over another, but in a vague way that is reassured somehow by the word "smallest". Thanks.
