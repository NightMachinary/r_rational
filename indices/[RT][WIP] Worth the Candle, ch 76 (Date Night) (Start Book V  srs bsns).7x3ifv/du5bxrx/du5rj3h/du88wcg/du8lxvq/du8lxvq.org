The biggest problem with Smith/IRV is that once you're within the Smith Set, you're still doing IRV, and all you've done is cut out the worst possible cases. That leaves the problems of:

- Favorite Betrayal: sometimes a strategic vote would have you ranking your first choice lower than first rank
- Participation: sometimes it's better for your preferences to not cast a vote
- Later no harm/help: if a candidate X is ranked 1st, then changing the ranks of the 2nd and lower candidates sometimes harms/helps candidate X (which it ideally shouldn't)

/But/ because you do the Smith set pruning, this kind of strategic voting becomes much harder to do, and I think that tends to minimize these problems (given that you don't actually know how the voting is going to shake out, everyone should vote honestly rather than strategically).

Of course, the bigger problem is that it's complicated and not super-intuitive, and selling a change in voting system to the electorate is hard enough even if what you're proposing is simple.
