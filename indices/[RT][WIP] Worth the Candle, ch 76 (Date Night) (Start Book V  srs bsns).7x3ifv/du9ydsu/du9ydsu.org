/Technically/, you only need two (hey, constant space complexity!) and you can make your plan significantly less* insane.

- Copy ally's soul onto a Doris.
- Copy (a distinct) Doris appearance onto ally.
- Heal ally to Doris appearance.
- Copy ally soul back onto ally. (*Do not* heal them.)

When you're done you should make sure to copy the template Doris back onto the hold Doris. Good practice.

Pros: If anything goes awry after this point, conventional healing resolves it. Juniper is not particularly required. There will be questions, but ...

Cons: Forgo healing while disguised[[https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Disguise#Gameplay_while_disguised][.]]

*Professional programmer. Closed course. Do not try this at home, +soul+ school, or work.

That means-- /Juniper, NO./
