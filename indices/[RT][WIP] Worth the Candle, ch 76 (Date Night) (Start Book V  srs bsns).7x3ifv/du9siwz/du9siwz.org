Can I just say I really, really, really dislike the "harem" angle that keeps getting pushed? This is a wonderful story, and I'll still read it... but I'm going to stop recommending it to friends at this point. It's somewhere between "distracting from the best part of the story" and "borderline disgusting."

I've been DMing since I was 10, and I really enjoy both the concept of being in an amalgam of created worlds and the idea of the game overlay. Your writing style is also just downright satisfying.

But... damn, man. I really wish you hadn't started ridiculously playing up the angle that overshadows the reasons I like the story in the first place. It feels like that time someone in my games /insisted/ that they play a class from The Book of Erotic Fantasy. D&D isn't a great place to solve sexual dysfunction. The worlds just don't mesh well.

Edit: Well, looks like a lot of people here just really enjoy reading about a man surrounded by women who are at risk of being devolved into nothing more than a variety of fucks. Which is a shame - their characters are interesting, and playing out a harem fantasy is really doing them a disservice.
