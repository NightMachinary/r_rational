I don't /predict/ that it's going that way. I have /already observed/ the manner in which the "harem" concept is being used specifically to cheapen characters.

It's the web fiction version of "oh no she tripped over me while coming out of the shower and now her towel is on the ground and we're on the floor together."

Instead, it's "I met a new girl who is bound to me for life, is my age, attractive, enjoys being naked around me for a contrived reason, and regularly ensures that I know she is available for sex."

It's... out of place for such an otherwise well-written bit of fiction.
