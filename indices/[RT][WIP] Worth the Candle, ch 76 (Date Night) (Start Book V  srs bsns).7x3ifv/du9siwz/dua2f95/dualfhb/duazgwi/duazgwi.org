I don't understand where you're getting the idea that the characters are being reduced to sex objects, when it seems to me that the author is taking great pains to do the opposite. Yeah, the harem trope has been brought up...so that it can be very forcefully and explicitly deconstructed/subverted. I get that you might prefer a story where it wasn't touched on at all, but this is a story about narratives, and this is a pretty common narrative that is worth addressing. If you see the characters as nothing more than "sex targets" that might be more of a problem with your interpretation than with how they are actually being presented.

And to be clear, I would completely share your objections if I thought this was actually going to turn into a story of Joon and his harem. I just don't think that's happening/going to happen, although I could very well be wrong of course.
