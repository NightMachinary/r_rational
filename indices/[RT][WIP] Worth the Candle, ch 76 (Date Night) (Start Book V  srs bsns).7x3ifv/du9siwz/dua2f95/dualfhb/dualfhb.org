You and I have differing views on the concept of how much an author is beholden to the situations they create. You seem to be pushing the perspective that it is not the fault of the author for these tacked-on character traits. He is only responsible for Joon. That seems overtly wrong. The author has created this world full of fascinating concepts, interesting rules, and... oh, wait, is that a new female companion? Looks like they'll be naked and ready for sex all the time.

I bring this up because I just read through the whole thing again, and I couldn't help but notice that it was easy to just meet a new companion and assume that they would both have a reason to be naked near Joon often ("they're just quirky", photosynthesis, demon possession, even "I can see them naked via the soul") and would be a potential sex target (history of insecurity, free love, political reasons, or obsession). If you remove those tacked-on artifacts, they're all fairly interesting characters. Which makes it grate when the world seems to be trying to actively reduce them into "something to be fucked" (which was my intention with the phrase you mentioned). Even Grak doesn't actually escape that harem pattern, achievement aside, because he serves as a token sorta-male without being sexually threatening.

Since the topic of anime and isekai style has come up, it reminds me somewhat of the divide between women designed to be "sex targets" and ones that are full characters in their own right. Mikasa from Attack on Titan is a great example. When asked whether Mikasa would ever be in a relationship during the series, the author said something like "it's an insult to her character that you assume she needs to be with someone by default - she is her own person, and it would distract from who she is." I don't think that is necessary for every character, but tacking on a "being naked near my self-insert character" and "being ready and willing for sex with my self-insert character" for EVERY member of a team makes this story into something that it really, really shouldn't be trying to be. It's overtly distasteful, and I can't in good conscience recommend it to friends anymore.

At this point, it's distracting so much from the story that even if the final twist is something like "the DM is actually Arthur and he's taking a sort of revenge on Joon for what he views as a betrayal with Tiff," it wouldn't exactly matter. It would just read like an excuse for having a tit-shot and an implied offer in what feels like damn near every chapter.
