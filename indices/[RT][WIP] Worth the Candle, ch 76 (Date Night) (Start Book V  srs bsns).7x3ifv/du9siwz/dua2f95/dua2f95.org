A tabletop group I was part of a few years ago had a DM who... let's just say, was quite a bit less mature (and several years younger) than many members of the group. Usually it was fine... until he would do something that just made us go "Dude, wtf?" And not in a "Oh, I'm delightfully horrified at the implications" way, but in a "Why do you think including rapey slime monsters was a good idea?" It was a conflict between players and the DM, where the DM wanted to add some sexual stuff that the players (and our characters) had nooooo interest in. We managed to bypass most of it, but boy was aggravating.

I see this story as something similar. The meta-DM has its own values and prompts - it clearly is pushing the harem angle. The characters though?

- Juniper clearly wants no part of it. He's been Team Fenn since they first got together.

- Fenn clearly doesn't want it - it makes her insecure.

- Mary clearly doesn't want it, but had resigned herself to possibly needing to do so until she found out about the symbiotic loyalty link. They had a great chat discussing exactly why she would put up with being a love interest, but was relieved it didn't have to happen.

- Grak... ha, no. Considering Grak left da nad hometown to avoid a Kiss (Cloacal-style) with da nad bondmate? Nope. And even if Grak was down, Juniper clearly isn't.

- Six-Eyed Doe? No way. Juniper doesn't want it. And we have no idea what SED wants, or if it can even express it.

- Val is like a child, and despite being Juniper-bait, he's made it clear that he's not interested in pursuing/taking advantage. She simply doesn't know any better.

I feel like the "harem angle" is being deliberately denied by the characters despite a DM that pushes it, and deconstructed in the cases of characters like Mary and Grak (and even SED, for laughs in this last chapter). If this is a self-insert, CRJ is Juniper, not the DM. A good player counters a bad DM.

Your edit says: " women who are at risk of being devolved into nothing more than a variety of fucks." I am honestly curious, after 76 chapters, whom do you see Juniper "fucking" besides Fenn? I feel like you're reading into this something that, so far, has not happened and has shown no chance of happening.
