If I map this story-and-comment onto HPMOR, my response would be 'You do know that Yudkowsky is not Harry, right?'.

That response doesn't work so well for a LitRPG self-insert story. Instead:

  I was still pissed off at the game when I woke up in the morning.
#+end_quote

The author insert /objects/. It seems to me you're confusing the author for the /mysterious game layer/ instead of the protagonist. This isn't even the first time the game layer has been less-than-ideally-aligned.

(To be clear, at the object level I think I agree with you that I don't desire to see the story go there, but I disagree with the claim that it's already done so or overshadowed anything.)

Mapping this back onto HPMOR again, maybe this is a hint at the nature of the game. A deep and thorough simulation, populated by a sophisticated world-builder (and what it could take from our protagonist), adequately grafted with an RPG-type skill and combat system, and with achievements generated in the ... how did [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7x3ifv/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_76_date_night_start/du5cbba/][reaper7876 call it]]... isekai style?

My other response is 'this is a serial, maybe later developments satisfy your concern'.

I anticipate such a low chance of this happening. Especially if you mean something the author does wrong and not just something weird happening to the game-within-a-story.
