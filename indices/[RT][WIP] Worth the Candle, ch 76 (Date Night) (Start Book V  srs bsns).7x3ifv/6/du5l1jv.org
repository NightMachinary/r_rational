This chapter, more than any other, felt like it was written for me specifically. I like the concept of the full harem pairing as a source of humor, and seeing it used as a source of drama is even better; I love the concept of the Boundless Library (I've written a story about something similar to that) and unlike some in this thread I do actually like the reveal that cthulhuraejepsen is Alexander Wales. Why? Because WTC is your best work yet (of those I've read), and in the context of an already excellent body of work this is far, far more impressive, because it means you're actually /still improving/. Kudos for that.

(Was the Boundless Library a reference to Borges, or just a general unrelated idea?)
