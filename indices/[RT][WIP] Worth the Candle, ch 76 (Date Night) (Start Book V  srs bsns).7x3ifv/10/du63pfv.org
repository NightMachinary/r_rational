The interesting question for Joon's strategy here is "what do I do with essentialism 100?". Each 10 levels has given upgrades for most skills. If level 20 is a PhD, I expect level 40 to be world-class, and 60+ is pretty godlike. I'd expect the power ramp to be crazy.

That said, it seems like high levels of essentialism will give stronger soul defenses, as well as more options and possible faster control. I would expect to see:

- Respec skills at extremely low cost (every level at essentialism 100, perhaps at will for essentialism 101+
- Respec attributes permanently (he likely can do this already, but there is likely also the same cost, and it is most likely to be cost-free now)
- permanently store extra data in the soul (Fallatehr had pre-prepared modifications of his thralls which he activated on command, faster than you would expect from modifying de novo)
- modify bones directly, instead of just copying (upgrade own/others bodies; combined with storing extra data gives great options)
- read, modify or copy memories at will
- understand how to manipulate a soul such that its modifications are more permanent (-> modify Fallatehr to be permanently loyal)
- presently resist modifications to the soul
- Injecting a soul which lacks a body, into a living body (revive Solace)
- Extract information/understanding from bones (they have soul information, may be able to merge it with Joons own bones in an intelligent way to give super-healing)

In light of this, it would be good to get all your ducks in a row for this golden chance of upgrading your team.

- Level up with points in MEN. Move an attribute point from PHY to MEN, as well as those two ill-placed INS points into MEN. Being a mage is the real way to pick at the corners of this world, and he might as well take advantage of it (just one point lets him keep his lvl20-perks, which drives that choice)
- Discuss with everyone about any potential changes they might want to have applied, and any additional animals which they might want to have on hand for snatching skills. Perhaps get your hands on some elf bones?
- Go out looking for trouble (someone else to rob you), kidnap one of them, so you can rip his soul and apply Solaces (plus her bones = living solace in her own body). Do the same for Fallatehr, but mind-rape him into compliance first
- rip the soul information from the unicorn bones which confers super-healing and disease resistance, possibly also the temporal super-power. Apply them to yourself
- mod the skills and attributes of your companions per their requests
- fix the deer, of course
- get someone to design scars for Fenn that actually work. Mod her scars to heal to that configuration, and store a copy of that data in her soul, for reversion on command. Do that for everyone. If this doesn't work (or there isn't enough time), just clear the scars for her

Currently, he loses one skill point per five minutes if he over-skills. I believe that will happen even faster at high skill levels (emulating an inverse exponential curve). Perhaps every 2.5min at double his nominal skill level, and every 1.25min at 4x nominal. So his window with uber-essentialism will be very short indeed. That will limit how many of these ideas he can enact.

Thoughts?
