  if pushing Essentialism up past 100 will end up breaking the simulation in some fashion.

I was originally of the opinion that these messages were communicated intentionally to the player, but now with the 4th-wall break of Valencia, I suspect that they are a seam in the game which can be pulled on. It is likely that we'll see a bit more through Essentialism or Spirit

#+begin_quote
  For example, what if Jun getting 100 in soul magic lets him respec his stats in such a way as to allow him to enter/exit the "forge frenzy" state at will?
#+end_quote

It could just let him do that directly. Or perhaps Arthur (who did successfully do this) simply leveled his essentialism, and then grabbed some poor sap who was in a forge frenzy, read his mind to find the necessary state, and imposed that state onto himself? After all, he was king and could do damm near whatever he wanted.

On a related note, other plausible options at Essentialism 100:

- Force unlock of skills + level them up -> Spirit, Library Magic, etc (perhaps this is temporary, in which case he might be able to get hints about how to unlock them for real, or how useful/worthwhile they are)
- Add extra bones, or increase bone mass in various places. Whatever it takes to get extra kick out of them!
- Hack your body to have higher metabolism, if it means more energy / some other advantage
- Inspect Fallatehrs goons -- they surely have some soul hacking going on, learn from what was applied to them.

Another random thought -- Fenn can now do the same bone magic trick, too. If she can't copy her bones over, she certainly can let Joon do it for her.
