After poking around a bit, it seems like this question doesn't have a short and simple answer. Relevant Wikipedia articles for example are fond of moderately large tables comparing various voting methods against various criterion, and no voting method scores perfectly across the board. I've yet to see Smith/IRV in such a table, but that pattern seems to hold.
