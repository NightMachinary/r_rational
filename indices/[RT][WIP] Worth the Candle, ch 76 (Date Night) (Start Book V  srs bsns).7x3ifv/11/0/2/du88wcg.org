The Smith set(/'top cycle') filter is very exciting!

Once down to the Smith set, how to select the runoff method? Assuming one-elimination-at-a-time to avoid simultaneous elimination of consolidatable options (but what to do when two are tied-for-elimination?), choosing by 'least love' (fewest first-choice), 'most hate' (most last-choice), or something else? (The Minimax Condorcet thing, here choosing to eliminate the one with most 'losses' in any pairwise comparison (within the set of remaining candidates)?)

Finding that my electronic feet have followed Threesan's same path, what criteria don't the Smith/IRV approach satisfy, and/or what variations could be carried out to satisfy some or all of those criteria? (Wanting to understand the failure states better... at some point I should also try to better understand Arrow's Impossibility Theorem...)

Pleasant to imagine an AI non-interruptingly scanning all human brains, for all known humans as candidates, to select a Smith set. (That said, doing that in order to choose a representative for representative democracy might be self-defeating, compared to allowing all to separate into distinct inviolable universes. And then we're back to the question of atrocities and cases of a majority restricting a minority for better or worse, where 'better' and 'worse' are wholly subjective...)
