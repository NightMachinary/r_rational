This chapter was interesting, but chapter 75 actually interested me more. But first, having all that game layer info compiled in one place is a really good idea, but a lot of it is still missing. The Achievements, like that the Petit Mort and Key for seven locks mentioned in the next chapter. (the Key achievement really have to be sex with each companion, or is the unlock requirement context sensitive to the type of relationship Joon has with each one)

The Primary and secondary stat requirements are spread out all over the chapters. Also the virtues he has gained for the various skills.

But mostly, I want to know more about the things the quests have been hinting at been discussed previously? The Celestar has been brought up several times, as a land mark and the place the elves came from in multiple waves. In the world, it's not a secret. And I know nothing about that part of the setting. That is something I do not like about how the detail this story goes into. What I like about another story, Mother of Learning, is you read it an go, "that is a world you could make RPG supplement for, a world someone could run a campaign in"

It has a depth this story lacks. This story go so far into omitting 'unnecessary' detail, that the world comes off as piecemeal and broken. where everything outside the casts immediate area is just an empty facade.

I don't know what the celestar looks like. I don't know if it was a natural moon that was once habitable but now isn't, or if it was an artificial worldlet that was broken beyond repair. I know know why the elves came down in waves, and why each wave of refugees is considered a different type of elves. I want to know all these things more than I want to read about a date.

I want to see the exclusion principle gone over in some depth. How are things excluded, why are things excluded, what things can and cannot be excluded? Are things excluded for political reasons (as opposed to an existential threat to the world), what happens if people disagree with exclusion, can you reverse an exclusion?

If 'Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle' is in an exclusion zone, and things excluded cannot go outside the zone, why should anyone outside care about the Z-word being his? What does it being 'his' word mean in practical terms? Something people living in the setting would be aware of, something the reader doesn't.

Things like this make the story seem like the Writers of Lost got involved. They hint at a deeper intracy to the world, and deliver nothing but a lot of hanging threads.

Not something that we should already know, but something that should be investigated, Luck. How does it work, especially in relationship to Joon? That not picking up a sword, until you finally do, then using it perfectly sounds like gaining a skill at its skill cap from 0. That sounds really good if he is playing around with skill level swapping. Since he can raise his luck score is that something he can do? he can see Fenns character sheet, and his own. He could find her luck represented on the sheet, and his, and figure out how much luck it takes to have the luck she does.

The Doris, Issue, Instead of soulfucking her, what about Looking at a Doris, finding her probabilistic magic in the soul sheets, and copying it onto yourself as a temporary adjustment? Also, did you mean an area a thousand miles square (1,000 miles x 1,000 miles), or a thousand square miles? 1,000 square miles is less than a 32x32 mile area. That seems small for over 9 million Dorisis. I don't know if that is possible without modern infrastructure and supply lines. How does she feed herself? Unless Doris's are being created as food for other Doris's?
