I agree with the general thrust of your post that Essentialism is probably going to end up being analogous to transhumanism/directed body modification.

But I'm also kind of wondering - in keeping with your lvl 20/40/60/etc power creep statement - if pushing Essentialism up past 100 will end up breaking the simulation in some fashion. We already saw the game layer get breached once early on when Jun pushed his mental stats too high (too fast?) and the admin had to rebalance things.

I could see Essentialism possibly breaking the game in either the whole "Neo in the Matrix" sense (allowing for more and more direct interfacing with the game?) or in a more subtle, in-game munchkinry sense. For example, what if Jun getting 100 in soul magic lets him respec his stats in such a way as to allow him to enter/exit the "forge frenzy" state at will? Maybe all those "useless" crafting skills we saw earlier in the story were actually a Chekov's gun.

Wresting away control of the magical item creation process from your current DM is kind of the definition of game breaking. Plus this would allow the narrative to neatly sidestep the party's general inclination to run all around collecting Mary's hand me downs like a bunch of magpies.
