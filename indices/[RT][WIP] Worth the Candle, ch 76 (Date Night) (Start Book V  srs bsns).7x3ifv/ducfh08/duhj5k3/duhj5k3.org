I think i brought up something similar in terms of world being disjointed. This being pseudo D&d helps, but also cripples the story in some ways. party getting a teleport stone early on, world being many sizes bigger than Earth and Aerb being a literal amalgam of Junipers notebooks\stories, does make it seem like a collection of unrelated places that would not function in any reasonable sense.

I only now thought of this, but it's pretty ironic that people will argue about smallest unexplained thing in character motivation as being irrational and not fitting rational fiction. But i don't think Aerb being disjointed amalgam has being brought up that often.
