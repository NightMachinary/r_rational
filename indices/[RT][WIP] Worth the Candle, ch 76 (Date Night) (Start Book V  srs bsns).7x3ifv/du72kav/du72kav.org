Ever since he met Solace I'd been wondering how long it would take for the pseudo-intelligence injection to overcome Joon's crippling fear of his own sexuality and let him figure out that he signed up for a harem game and was playing it all wrong.

Turns out the answer was never, he had to be clued in by his girlfriend and the One True God. Sort of funny, sort of sad.

He just happily derped along, recruiting miss Posthuman-AI-literally-created-the-most-attractive-girl-in-the-world-especially-for-you, miss Contemporary-earth-girlfriend-with-pointy-ears, miss(?) Explicitly-down-with-the-experimental-coitus, miss Shameless-old-hippie-chick, and miss Worships-the-very-ground-you-walk-on... all without ever stopping to count the number of penises in his kharass.
