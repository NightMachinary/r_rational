I would certainly prefer it if that turns out to be the case (edit: not entirely true, on further thought. The conflict between Joon and the game is compelling, and this adds to it), but keys and locks are a fairly common anatomical metaphor, and by Joon's reaction, it was the coitus that caused the quest update; if it was about love and acceptance for Fenn, I suspect he would have received a progress indicator sooner than that.
