From last time, seems to me that Jun's instinctive lie to /not-mary/ is indicative of something important. Either the narrative, luck, or some hidden companion sense.

Also I cannot believe Jun is still going around splitting the party, not wearing his armor, and worse, expecting Fenn to leave Sable. Fortunately she's smarter than him.
