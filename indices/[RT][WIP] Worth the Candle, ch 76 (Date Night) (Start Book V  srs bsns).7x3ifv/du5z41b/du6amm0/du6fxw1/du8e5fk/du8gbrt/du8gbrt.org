There are types of magic and other weird abilities that threatened the fabric of reality or were too OP, or something like that, so they were "excluded" from the main rule set/general overworld, and only function in certain areas - "exclusion zones".

Why exactly they exist, who makes them (if anyone), and how they come about has yet to be revealed.
