#+begin_quote
  could rephrase it as a the point of diminishing descriptive utility
#+end_quote

as a the point -> as a point

[OR]

as a the point -> as the point

#+begin_quote
  She her sigh was visible in the chilly night
#+end_quote

She her sigh -> Her sigh

Also this probably isn't a mistake, just concise writing but I noticed:

#+begin_quote
  [Star war was] condensed down into a little over four and a half hours
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  It was late when the play let out, which was no surprise given four hours of runtime and two intermissions.
#+end_quote

seemed like slight contradictions.
