  Can I just say I really, really, really dislike the "harem" angle that keeps getting pushed? This is a wonderful story, and I'll still read it... but I'm going to stop recommending it to friends at this point. It's somewhere between "distracting from the best part of the story" and "borderline disgusting."

as the other replies have said.. the harem thing seems more meta than something the author actually intends.

remember, this story is extremely rational, if it were going to end up harem, there would be a VERY sound, rational justification for that happening in the end.
