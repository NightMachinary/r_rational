It feels like you're pushing your personal aversion to harems and more specifically polyamory onto the narrative. You're preemptively assuming every group member's only purpose is "something to be fucked" because the narrative is throwing poorly disguised sexual tension at Joon at every corner (and a reminder that he is a teenager here). Also, the bastardized concept of 'harem' isn't just a contrivance found in lousy wish-fulfillment literature or anime. Why does it have to be a cheap road to sex rather than an interesting exploration/deconstruction on sexual tension in a typical harem situation? The harem angle and interesting characters aren't mutually exclusive.

You opine that "D&D isn't a great place to solve sexual dysfunction" when D&D is actually a great place to solve anything. It is a /social/ game in an open world: you can stage any type of discussion you like.
