  I loved MM, it seems I have two new stories to read.

Shadows of the Limelight is complete (though IIRC it leaves space for a followup). I actually liked Glimwarden better, but it's on indefinite hiatus :-(

  Alex has said previously that WtC is a self-insert. Which would indicate he is 18-19 in the real world, right?

He gave a bit of an explanation for what he means by self-insert before in a comment, I think. Let me see if I can find it. The jist of it was that the self-insert title has more to do with original character creation and gets a bad rap; they're not meant to be literally the author. Like Bella Swan from Twilight was a self-insert from Stephenie Meyer (she's said as much), but no one thinks that's /actually/ her. It's a projection of the author into a character (often idealized as a Mary Sue/Marty Stu by bad authors).

I highly doubt he's a teenager any more, but he was at one time and probably used some of the experience to craft Juniper to some extent.
