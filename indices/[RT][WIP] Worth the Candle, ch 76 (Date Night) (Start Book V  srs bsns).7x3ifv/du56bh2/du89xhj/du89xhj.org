Huh. /Huh./

Well I certainly didn't see that coming, although looking back I guess I can see commonalities. It's sort of interesting how my view of the author changes my view of the work.

But yeah, big reveal! I've got to say, I think WtC is far and away your best work, at least of the ones I've read (side note:this is good motivation to read the rest of them at some point). I think a lot of that is how good the characters and the character dynamics are, but really I enjoy most everything in this story. I'm glad to see a Patreon set up for it.
