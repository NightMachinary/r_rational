1. /Worth the Candle/ got to the point where it was successful and visible enough that people would have formed their opinions on it, meaning that the pseudonym holds less value.
2. Given the above, the pseudonym began to lose its value as a baggage-less handle, since it had its own baggage, spoke with its own authority, etc. It was created as a pseudonym that didn't bring in past associations or conceptions, and developed at least some of its own associations and conceptions. If it's not serving the status-cloaking function, it's less worthwhile.
3. Running multiple active accounts can be kind of a pain in the butt, especially if they're doing the same thing. I wasn't terribly careful about keeping up a firewall between the AW and CRJ ones, but I did put some token amount of effort into it, and eventually that effort got annoying (I'd say a few months ago, probably).
4. End of one book and beginning of the next seemed like the right time.
5. I really didn't want to go to the effort of setting up a second Patreon/PayPal for this account, and really thought it would have been ethically sketchy to take money from people without cross-linking, especially given that /Glimwarden/ is on indefinite hiatus -- it would have felt to me like abandoning a web serial and then spinning up a new account so that I could dodge responsibility for that, which wasn't at all the intent.
