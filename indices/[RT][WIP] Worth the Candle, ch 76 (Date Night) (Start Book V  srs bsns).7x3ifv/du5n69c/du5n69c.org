  The problem was, that plan started to sound more evil the more I thought about it, and beyond that, more complex than I wanted to count on. “Just thinking,” I said with a sigh. “Amaryllis, your objections have merit, Fenn, your objections have merit, Valencia, I should have considered your feelings more before making that suggestion.”\\
  Loyalty increased: Grak lvl 9!

I was really amused at this, and feel it a small gem of subtle humor. Everyone else gets consideration, which (but of course!) increases Grak's loyalty, rather than any of those other people. I don't blame Juniper for being bewildered and confused by him.

On my part I'm guessing that Grak appreciates kindness and fairness in general, while being naturally distrustful of kindness and fair words directed at himself. I wonder if he would NOT have increased loyalty, if Juniper had also said something nice/polite/considerate about him, since then instinctive mistrust might have been the reaction.
