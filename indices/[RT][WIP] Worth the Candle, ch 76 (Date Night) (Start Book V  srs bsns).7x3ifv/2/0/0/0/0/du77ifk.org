To the point of actively arguing against saving its life? And Solace's? He actually quite liked Solace, despite their differences.

I kind of hope there is more of an explanation, He literally just took the time to save people who tried to mug him, but then wants to ignore the locus/Solace for some nebulous narrative reason?

Maybe some deep-seated unhappiness with resurrection? An "Arthur couldn't come back, so why should Solace?" kind of thing.
