I think contrasting Joon's saving Valencia in the prison to the ignoring the locus now is instructive. The best I can guess is that Joon has a deep aversion to being obligated to save those he doesn't have a connection with. In previous discussion it was mentioned that he is pretty classical neutral, e.g. only saving somebody he doesn't care for when threatened by the Cowardice affliction. My guess is that his reflection on not getting the cultural baggage with the locus translates to "I don't really care much" and that that translates to resistance to getting involved. Note that not only was Valencia "Joon-bait", but his saving her was likely heavily influenced by the now-absent levelup compulsion.
