Ohh, I think I read the original, and liked it. Wasn't great, but was definitely good; excited that it's gotten a redux.

Update:\\
This is *amazing*. I remember the original, and the core idea is the same (including Taylor's "powerset"), but the approach and writing are all immensely improved. It almost reads like a Culture novel, I'd say.
