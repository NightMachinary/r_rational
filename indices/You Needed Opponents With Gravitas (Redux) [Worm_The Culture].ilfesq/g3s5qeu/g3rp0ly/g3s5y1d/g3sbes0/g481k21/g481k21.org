After reading the available chapters of this (Redux) story, I've become more intrigued by the prospect of the Culture novels--previous encounters in the form of synopsis-perusal have consistently given the impression of vast dramatic backdrops overshadowed by petty storylines. Do the novels themselves have scenes resembling Taylor's use of suites to predict (the actions and stances of) and interact with clueless authority figures who have no idea how they're being puppeted? (Any perspectives of Minds setting up Chessmaster-like plots?) If so, I may urgently need to revise my evaluation of how interested I should be in reading said original novels.
