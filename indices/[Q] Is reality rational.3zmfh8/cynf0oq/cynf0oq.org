It can be rational, it can be rationalist, or it can fail spectacularly.

Depends on the people featured in the story. In general reality is a good setting for a rational story because yes, the rules of the world are very much what we call consistent. Generally people in the world are not "good" or "evil" but rather a shade of gray and act at least semi-rational. However, people do not always act rationally, and what's more, some people are rewarded for their irrational behaviour. It's called "luck". It makes a nice story, but it makes an irrational story.

For example, in a perfect rational story there is no America. Columbus sails West and dies to starvation or, more likely, mutiny. In reality, his clearly wrong ideas about circumference of the Earth lead to a lucky discovery.

As for what constitutes rationalist story, the sidebar makes it pretty clear, I think. Rationalist story is problem solving using certain techniques, with no relevant information being withheld from the reader.
