Yes, reality is the most rational thing we've ever seen, it's just too big complex for any one person to understand all dependencies, so it may appear unreasonable if you don't take it into account. If someone seems to act "irrational", it is mostly because observer has no idea about his reasons.

If we go by points in the sidebar:

- plausible reason - it is always there, duh. It is just that getting to it sometimes requires literal ages of smartest people of the planet to find this reason.

- Again, duh. It's obvious that everyone has his reasons.

- Sort of. Characters are /trying/ to solve problems through intelligent approach; first, they can be wrong, second, their opponent is not any less intelligent and thus those over-the-top-complex Lelouch-like plans don't really work; third, there is no full or perfect information, so again, over-the-top-complex plans don't survive contact with reality. And a lot more reasons, I guess.

- Physics, duh.

So, basically, reality is fully rational, it's just too deep and complex to really understand why without getting a degree about this specific field.

And difference between rational and realistic fiction is that realistic one depends on quality of pieces of fiction; generally, I feel, realistic one does /not/ simplify reality to a degree where everything is perfectly reasonable; it is, but getting to it should require years/decades/aeons of research, not "I thought for 5 minutes after skimming through handbook and discovered relativity theory". Same with reasons behind people's (err...) actions: psychology is /hard/. Like, centuries of research by really smart people and getting PhDs and lifetime of hard work to understand fraction of it hard. If you understand it without deep research, you only understand some grossly oversimplified part of it.

TL;DR: whether some realistic fiction will be rational depends entirely on this piece of fiction; reality is as rational as you can get; reality may seem irrational if you don't do your research because science is hard and no human being can do enough research to understand all of it; difference between rational fiction and reality is, as far as I've seen, in the proper research taking really small time and giving almost no error and being all too easy in rational fiction, and in character almost always having access to unrealistically good information.
