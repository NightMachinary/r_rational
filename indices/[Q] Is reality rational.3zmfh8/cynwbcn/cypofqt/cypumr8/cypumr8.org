Err...I thought that setting having well-defined rules without contradictions is enough to call it rational; as setting does not have neither any intelligence nor behavior to speak of, it is impossible to tell anything about (un)intelligent behavior of it.

No, I'm afraid I can't. Emotions serve some evolutionary purpose - for example, ensuring social bonds that improve chances of survival of a genetic strain. Just what is the purpose of emotion is deeper biology than I know, but they developed through rational and mostly understood processes and thus can't be called "irrational". Calling laws of nature and their consequences "irrational" is generally bad idea(purpose of rationality is improved modelling of reality), and emotions are byproduct of evolution.

Now that I think about it, I probably don't understand something about rational fiction, because in my head it loosely equals well-defined setting, where anything not in the rules is derived from them in rational way. So I don't see any problem in irrational agents as long as whys and hows of their actions are rational(so, existence of mad person is rational because it does not contradict setting, even if his actions do not seem such). So there seems to be miscommunication due to differing definitions of rational fiction, and mistake seems to be on my side. Sorry.
