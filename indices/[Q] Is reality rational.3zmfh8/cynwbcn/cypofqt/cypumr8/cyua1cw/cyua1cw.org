Huh. I meant to respond to this days ago. Anyway....

Evolution is a rational process, in that it follows clearly defined laws (the laws of the universe) It's not an /intelligent/ process, strictly speaking, but I can acknowledge it's rational in context of what we, as people, consider rational. However, that doesn't mean that the actions of the agents spawned from such a process is a rational one. Of course, emotions serve some sort of purpose. That doesn't make emotional decisions, in and of themselves, rational. A rational decision is one where you consider, to the best of your abilities, the truth of a situation, and make a decision that (again, to the best of your knowledge) will lead to the truth you desire most, based on whatever utility functions you may possess. Emotions naturally inhibit such a process. They make it much easier to distort the truth of a situation, and cause us to act in ways that our logical selves would consider irrational. This isn't always a /bad/ thing, per se. But I simply can't call emotions, in and of themselves, rational.
