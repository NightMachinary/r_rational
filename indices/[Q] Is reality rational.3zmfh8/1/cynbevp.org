I think part of what makes rational fiction rational fiction is that it's portrayed realistically, and characters make decisions that they would actually make if they existed in real life. A very very large portion of fiction that takes place in the real world doesn't do that. Of course, if it were just this, stories like Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes might be considered rational fiction for its time. But clearly Don Quixote isn't quite rational fiction and not just because it is a bit deathist at times or because it was influenced by christianity. Don Quixote does have pretty consistent worldbuilding and realistic characterization. Getting some things wrong, even if it is significantly wrong, isn't enough for a work to not be rational fiction, because that would cause a lot of works of rational fiction to possibly suddenly be no longer qualified for the genre just because some more people come along who are better at it or some new knowledge overturns prior perceptions, etc. People can have different priors, or simply live in a time where it would never occur to even the best of people to question certain common-sense assumptions. If a work of rational fiction has an unrealistic ending given the premise, then it should be because of information that the author wasn't aware of or didn't notice, not because their methods for deriving their ending from their premise were wrong.

Here is the reason that Don Quixote doesn't quite cut it as rational fiction. An important part of rational fiction is not just that the worldbuilding is consistent, but that there are rational/intelligent characters, and that rationality/intelligence is portrayed realistically. In rational fiction, your protagonist wins on their own merits and by thinking things through, rather than on being chosen by the gods or having some powerup or special item or genetically inherited ability etc.
