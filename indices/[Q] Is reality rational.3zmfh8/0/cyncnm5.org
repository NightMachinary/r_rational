Reality fails on the first bullet point on the sidebar, then continues to fail its way through all the rest.

#+begin_quote

  - Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

If you were just asking about reality, maybe I'd give this one, because reality doesn't have a plot. But if we're talking about directly transcribing reality into story form and presenting it to an unsuspecting reader, people fail at having plausible reasons for their actions /all the time/. You don't need to look much further than the "crimes" section of your local newspaper to see that. Actions and consequences just happen with no conscious thought given to them. Maybe the reality-story still doesn't demonstrate a plot, but much of the time people would be acting in ways that were apparently pointless and arbitrary. At best, we might say that they're governed by hidden brain processes that aren't part of conscious thought.

#+begin_quote

  - Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

I can sort of give reality this one. Internally, a lot of people honestly believe that the world is made up of good and evil, so I suppose this criteria is saying something like "people might behave as though there is true good and evil but the story makes it apparent that this is a construct of their mind"? Also, lots of people in reality /aren't/ driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, they're driven into conflict by those same hidden internal processes. When two men get into a fist-fight in a bar, this is usually not reducible down to beliefs and values. It's just two people looking for a fight. There's a lot of conflict in the world that just happens because people behave irrationally; it's the sort of thing that's frowned upon in a rational story.

#+begin_quote

  - The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

This is sometimes true of reality, but there are lots of times that problems get solved through luck, outside agents, or just go unsolved. If you were transcribing reality, you'd see all sorts of things that look like deus ex machina. And conversely, you'd see people fail even though they were doing everything right. Worse, you'd see people using /obviously/ suboptimal solutions that their resources and knowledge should allow /them/ to realize. Strictly speaking, I suppose I'd have to say that reality passes this criteria, but only because it doesn't say that characters /exclusively/ solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

#+begin_quote

  - The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Strictly speaking, I (probably) have to give this one to reality as well. But most of the "rules" that you can see at the human level of reality aren't actually rules at all, they're just things that are agreed upon, emergent, or are useful fictions that people keep up. Most of the rules that people use in everyday life aren't really rules at all, so by that metric reality fails. But this leads right into your next question.

* What's the difference between realistic and rational fiction?

  :END:
I'm being slightly contrarian above, but part of what I'm getting at is that it's really a matter of /what the story is/. Rational fiction is, to some extent, about peeling back the layers until you can get to the source. It's not /really/ a matter of whether things happen because the plot requires it, it's about whether the frame hung around character decisions is one that allows for the reader to understand. That's why you see reframing done in rational stories quite a bit; some stories just don't expose the internal thinking of a villain, but just by dipping into their head and getting a look at the facts known to them, we can make a story (more) rational without changing their actions.

You could write a story about a real life dictator that made him out to be a cartoon villain who was innately evil. You could even do this without fudging any facts. Or, if you were being similarly selective in what you put into your frame, you could explain everything that he did, the source of his beliefs and values, how he saw the world, etc. The "correct" framing is subjective, but I believe that increased information usually results in increased complexity. Rational fiction isn't about increased complexity per se, it's more about selecting a frame that maximizes how much sense things make.

Often, this moves fiction closer to reality. But I think that it can go the other way as well, moving reality closer to fiction by framing it as more sensible than it really was (even without changing any of the salient facts).
