I disagree with calling reality itself rational. It has rules and constraints imposed on itself, but it doesn't behave intelligently. Neither do its agents. People always have their own reasons for things, obviously, but rarely are those reasons consciously determined by the agent. You can look at almost any emotionally driven reaction as irrational. Increase the number of agents involved and the situation is almost guaranteed to progress irrationally, irrespective of what should happen. Although, once the number of agents is large enough, it then becomes dictated by trends that can be researched and found within the sets that the agents belong to.
