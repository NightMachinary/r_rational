Two saving options, assuming sufficient organisation:

1) Money is fungible. To a certain extent, the Koschei-gold can be used to fund consumables and construction, and in doing so allow all /current/ resources to be funnelled towards capital investment.

2) "Below market interest rate": fixed or variable? This much foreign investment being dumped on the Alliance should push interest rates towards zero, and possibly even into the negative (see: Switzerland). Failing that, the Alliance almost certainly has tighter control over their financial markets than Koschei does, and can probably manipulate them to the same end. A massive negative-interest loan could be used to generate no-strings-attached income until eventually repaid in full.
