I wondered about this very thing when I was writing this, if the plot was too obvious to be plausible. Then I told myself that economic growth and debt cycles are a relatively modern concept, and for most of history GDP was probably pegged to population.

BTW, your HPMOR Gringotts chapter on uncoupled economies was what got me interested in economics based fantasy stories. So, thank you!
