It's sad to think that through most of human civilization, most of the countries would have fallen for this. Maybe that's still true. It /feels/ like anyone ought to be able to work out the problems in their head, but of course, you can't really unless you're part of a civilization old enough and wise enough to have the right concepts cached.
