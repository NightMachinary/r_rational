Late feedback: I didn't identify anything as obviously stupid or implausible; (though I didn't know about debt cycles; I've watched the video in your linked). I did find a few things kinda weird about the coalition's reasoning:

- That they would accept a loan from an enemy that surrendered to them; even if he couldn't pay the money they needed, couldn't they just get him to pay a lesser amount, pay in low-liquidity goods (like land or paintings or whatever) or just pay the reconstruction over a long period of time, Versailles-style?

- That they would build stuff like palaces and military fortifications with that money. If you can't afford them now, you won't be able to afford them years from now, so they'll crumble. Unhealthy inflating of the economy aside, why would you spend your one time occasion to be ridiculously rich building palaces that are doomed to disappear twenty years later?

- That they would accept any magically-enforced kingdom-spanning contract with a Dark Wizard without spending at least a few weeks thinking it over. Even without unintuitive economic effects, there are hundreds of way he could screw them over with that contract. They're basically telling him "All you have to do is keep us unable to pay for one day (for instance, by hiring mercenaries to steal or destroy the money the Alliance intends to send to the Dark Wizard) and you'll destroy the entire infrastructures we've been building for the last few decades".
