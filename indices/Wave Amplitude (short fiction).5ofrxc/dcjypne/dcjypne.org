I really like Vasilisa. She's more humanized than the protagonists of rational works often are, while still impressing me as someone with the intellect and determination to stand up to Koschei. She feels like a person rather than an allegorical device, which can be hard to achieve in an allegorical story! I'd love to see a continuation of her struggle against Koschei's machinations.
