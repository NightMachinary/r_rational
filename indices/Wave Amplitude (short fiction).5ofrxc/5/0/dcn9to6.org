It was supposed to be a conditional surrender from a stalemate, with a negotiated settlement supposedly benefiting both sides . The winners avoid maintaining an expensive siege, and the loser avoids enforced isolation of his kingdom. The loser is supposed to be powerful enough that defeating him on home turf is impossible. Sorry for not conveying that convincingly.
