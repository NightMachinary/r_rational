Also, I think that Koschei is able to manipulate the Alliance during the negotiations. For example, by giving them two options: 1) loan of X gold, 5 years, use it however you want or 2) loan of 10X, 10 years, no capital investments. They might be naive enough to go for the latter.

Additional speculation:

For Koschei as the creditor, luxuries are more convenient investment. I imagine it is far more easier to locate 10 palaces and crumble them to dust than locate ten million brand new hoes and destroy them. So it makes sense for him to say "either you build palaces or I request all your mages and virgins as hostages/collaterial". (The possibility of military spending doesn't quite fit, however)
