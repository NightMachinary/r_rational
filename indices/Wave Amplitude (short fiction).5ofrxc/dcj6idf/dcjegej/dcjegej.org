Ha ha, thanks for the encouragement. Economics isn't my area of expertise, so I need to do a fair bit of reading to keep it plausible. That being said, I have ordered a copy of a popular-economics book by Charles Wheelan which looks promising. That should give me some ideas to continue this plot line.
