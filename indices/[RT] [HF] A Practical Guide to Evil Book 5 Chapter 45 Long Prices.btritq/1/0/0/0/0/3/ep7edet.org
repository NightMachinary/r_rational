Yeah I can see why you'd have trouble with it. Worm has a somewhat similar scale of escalation to Pact, in that the Rocky montage doesn't kick in until very late in the story - and even then, the beatdowns continue. I still recommend it obviously, based if nothing else in how it gripped me hard enough to blow through 800k words in 4 days the first time I read it, but I totally respect that you feel it's not your kind of story at this time.
