As much as it may see me lynched on this subreddit, I never read Worm or Ward. I've never read comics, and don't really care for marvel/DC movies. Reading about costumed heroes/villains doesn't really hold much appeal to me. After Pact I feel even less inclined to try and start reading them.

I picked up Pact since the writer is recommended so often, and while it is really well written, I still ended up dropping it after maybe thirty chapters or so. Reading it felt too much like watching a little kid just get stomped by a bunch of adults, it felt like the setting was decided first, the story written as realistically in it as possible, and no changes to either were allowed to make it enjoyable to read from a plot point of view were made. It might end up less like that further on, but the metaphorical kid kicking lasted too long for me to tough it out.

PGtE is *much* more palatable to me, like watching a little kid get stepped on by adults who don't even see them, followed by a rocky montage and then a couple scenes from Punisher. I could see it coming about as a concept of interesting and satisfying characters, and the setting created to support those characters coming into existence. It scratches all the right itches, while the setting supports satisfying outcomes and the outcomes are still realistic to the setting.
