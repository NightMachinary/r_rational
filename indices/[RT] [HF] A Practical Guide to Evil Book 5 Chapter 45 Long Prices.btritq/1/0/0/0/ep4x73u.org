Ward is a very different beast to Worm, I very much enjoy it, because Wildbow is an even better writer now than he was while writing Worm, and while you are kinda right, though I still think Ward has it's moments, Ward is also far from done, and most of the serious 'oh shit' moments in Worm, especially the early arcs are in Worldbuilding and scope escalation.

Ward is a Sequel which has its advantages and disadvantages, comparison to its predecessor being both, I Very much enjoy Ward as well, and intend to do a re-read and catchup pretty soon. Which the existence of the Audiobook Project makes goddamn Delightful.
