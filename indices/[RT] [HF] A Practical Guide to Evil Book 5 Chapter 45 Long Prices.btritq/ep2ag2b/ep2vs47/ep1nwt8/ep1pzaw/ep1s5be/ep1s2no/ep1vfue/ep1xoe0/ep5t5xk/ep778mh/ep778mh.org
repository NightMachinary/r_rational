I wonder what the rest of the world outside Calernia is doing. Even if the Dead King subjugates the entire continent of Calneria, can't the Heavens just send Heroes from across the sea? It's often been mentioned that Calneria is a primitive backwater, Dwarves excepted, when compared to the rest of the world. So even if the Dead King conquers the entire continent, there's still an entire world of stronger people the Heavens can send.

I wonder if EE is ever going to expand the scope beyond Calneria, or if those bits of worldbuilding were just for flavor. If he does, the power level will jump up just like in a xianxia when the MC ascends to a higher realm.
