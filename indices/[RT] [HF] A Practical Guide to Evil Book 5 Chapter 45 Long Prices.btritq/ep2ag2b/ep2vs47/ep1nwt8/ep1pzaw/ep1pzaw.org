W.r.t. the Dead King, I think the reason he keeps invading is that he /has/ to. If the living stop whispering his name, he loses his Name. His apotheosis gets reversed.

So, in the end, his choice is either trying for an eventual victory and risking a final defeat, or a prolonged fading from existence as the Dead King becomes a legend, then a myth, then an indecipherable reference on a paper written in a dead language, and then nothing at all.
