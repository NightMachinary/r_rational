Finally caught up! And God am happy I waited, I sucked out to wait back in the everdark, and only read bits and pieces since, to see if I should jump in. I couldn't hold back after a chapter title like /Small Slights/, and I'm happy I didn't starting from the beginning again I made my way to the /Long Prices/, and golly was it worth it.

This story is a goddamn master piece of storytelling, EE's understanding of stories is just fantastic and this isn't any more clear than in their use of Three beats, they are the motif and the theme that make this story amazing, twice has Catherine died in This city, twice has she fought devils in its streets, and twice has she been offered a sought a Crown there.

Each of these unfinished stories is the windup for the arm that she is going to slug the dead king (and likely the wandering bard) in the face with, I'm not certain how but I can't wait to find out.
