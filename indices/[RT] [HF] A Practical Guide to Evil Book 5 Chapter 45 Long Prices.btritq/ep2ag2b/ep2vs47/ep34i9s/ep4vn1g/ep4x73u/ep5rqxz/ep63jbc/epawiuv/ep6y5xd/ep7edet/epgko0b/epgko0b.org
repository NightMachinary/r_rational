Worm was great, and I could barely get through Pact. It was well written but it was just torture to read, there just wasn't ever much of a light of hope.

Worm isn't like that at all. It's more one of the stories where the world is dark but the main character is so great you always have hope that she'll probably figure out a way. Pact never quite managed to do that, somehow.
