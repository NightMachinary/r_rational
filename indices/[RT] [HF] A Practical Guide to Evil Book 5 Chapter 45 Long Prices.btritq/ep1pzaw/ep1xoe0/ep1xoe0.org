I think he's aware of the fact that as long as he does not have complete dominion of Calernia the Heavens and the Intercessor especially will eventually spawn a Hero capable of killing him. This entire invasion is a risk, but one he is willing to take because waiting millennia for a chance to take over the continent is likely to lead to a situation where he has a good possibility of succeeding.

But at the same time every year that goes by has a small chance of seeing the creation of a Heroes great enough to kill him. This small chance is /almost/ negligible for such a short time as a dozen hundred years but with an infinite amount of time it becomes inevitable. He has to conquer Calernia because he wants to be undying and a free Calernia is the Heaven's blade against his throat, one he never knows when it will stirke.
