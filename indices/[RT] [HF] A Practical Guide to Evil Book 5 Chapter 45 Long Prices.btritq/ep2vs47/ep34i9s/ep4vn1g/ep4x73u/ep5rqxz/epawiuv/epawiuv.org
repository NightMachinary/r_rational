Honestly as someone who loves /Worm/ and /Ward/ I had almost the exact same experience with Pact, the only difference being I didn't last as long as you and dropped it sooner. That's kind of just how Pact *is* and I didn't enjoy it.

I would still say you should give /Worm/ a try. Like you I never read comics much, though I do like the movies. At it's core /Worm/ is in many ways a repudiation of Marvel/DC style costumed hero's and villains. I think quite often people deeply invested in those would dislike /Worm/.

The big difference I found between /Worm/ and /Pact/ was that while both have an unrelentingly harsh world in /Worm/ the protagonist is competent and ruthless enough that the world needs to be as wary of her as she needs to be of it. In /Pact/ the protagonist just isn't up to it and gets steamrolled.
