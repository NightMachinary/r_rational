The danger isn't necessarily with the Heroes themselves but the situation at large. There is near infinite potential for stories where it's feasible that anyone be they Hero, Villain or other kinds of beings kill him. The danger isn't so much that a Hero capable of killing him appear, there are probably some every few generations. The danger is that his defenses aren't perfect because he isn't omnipotent nor omniscient. There is always a chance that the Intercessor or Catherine or some random self insert Mary Sue will get the drop on him. The Heroic band of five with the White Knight, Saint, Pilgrim, Champion and Witch are already capable enough, they just need a story and an opening. The Dead King has been playing wack-a-mole for more than a thousand years but he only needs to miss /once/.
