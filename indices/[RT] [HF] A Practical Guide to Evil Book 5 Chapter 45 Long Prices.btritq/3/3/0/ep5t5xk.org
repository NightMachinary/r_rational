If that holds true it leads to a couple interesting questions, are Saint, Pilgrim, and Cat really powerful enough he's worried about them growing in power and becoming a risk? Or are they still considered small fish who don't really have a chance against him? If the latter, how much more powerful could Above and Below make Named beyond a swordswoman so singled minded she's literally Sword, a blessed pilgrim who can literally resurrect the dead, and the very complicated, kinda sorta still a (lowercase) god, Black Queen?
