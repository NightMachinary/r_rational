In a world where agurs who can see the future are common, and it's common to meddle with predicted events to get a more desired outcome, you've gained an ally augur whose predictions are accurate even after attempts at meddling.

In other words if a regular augur predicts your horse will lose the big race next year you can create a better training regimen to get the horse closer to winning, or prevent sabotage. If your ally augur predicts your horse will lose, her prediction will usually come true no matter what you do, because her power accounts for how you will respond to hearing the prediction.

How would you munchkin that ability to prevent one of her predictions from coming to pass?
