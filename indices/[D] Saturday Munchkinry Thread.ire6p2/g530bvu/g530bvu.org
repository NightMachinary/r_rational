You have the power to tell how any coin you are touching was oriented 24 hours ago.

When you directly touch the coin, you can sense an orientation, relative to the current orientation of yourself. (So you can't use this power to tell which way is north, but you can tell if a coin is in the same orientation that it was in a day ago.)

This ability has an accuracy of a few degrees. Items that are kind of coin like will have lower accuracies associated with them. So you cant tell anything about the orientation of a washer, but you should have a rough idea for a fake coin. If the coin is a good enough fake for it to be hard to notice the difference, your powers will be about as accurate.
