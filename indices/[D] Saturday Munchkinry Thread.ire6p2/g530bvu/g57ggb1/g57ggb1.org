You could use this as a poor man's GPS tracker. Find the car you want to track, measure its tire circumference, tape one coin vertically to the undercarriage and another to the inside of one of the car's tire rims. The next day, retrieve your coins to see where the target went. If you put your feet on both coins then hold a roadmap in front of you with a pencil and ruler, you could fairly accurately trace out where the car went and how long it spent at each location. Each revolution of the tire rim coin is one tire length traveled, and you'll know which direction the car went based on the undercarriage coin.

You could also use this as a secure form of encryption. If Alice wants to send you a message without any risk of it getting intercepted by a third party, she could encode it in coin turns which form a binary representation of her message and then deliver the coin to you so you can decrypt it on your end.

You could use it as an after-the-fact break-in detection system. If your doors and windows are hinged (rather than sliding), place a coin on (or in) each of them. If something goes missing and you suspect someone broke in to steal it, you could retrieve all of your coins and wait until you sense one which turned. This would also confirm which door or window should be tested for fingerprints to identify the culprit if you have a few likely suspects in mind.

You could also use this as a poor-man's day-in-advance alarm clock. Keep a coin with you and spin it on a table at whatever you'd like to be aware of tomorrow. Then, place the coin somewhere it will stay in contact with you and you'll be able to sense when it started spinning yesterday.
