I am repurposing a spell from warhammer fantasy roleplay which works on any one weapon, probably only on metal weapons, but I suspect that I can replace a lot of parts with knives, spears, swords, shields etc since they would be indestructible in operation.

I would prefer to avoid casting the spell more than once a day honestly since the chances of spells going awry in warhammer and the consequences thereof are pretty bad.
