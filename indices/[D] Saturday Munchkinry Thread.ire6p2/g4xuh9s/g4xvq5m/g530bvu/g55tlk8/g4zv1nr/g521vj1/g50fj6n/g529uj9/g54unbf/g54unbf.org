How large of a part? How often can you make it indestructible?

An indestructible container makes nuclear fusion pretty easy. No need to magnetic confinement. Start up the fusion process, make the containment vessel indestructible, harvest power, wait until shortly before the 30 minute time limit is up, and stop the fusion by venting the plasma into a larger container that's big enough that the hot plasma is diffuse enough to not melt it. Whether this is useful depends on the startup/shutdown time, and how often you can restart the process.
