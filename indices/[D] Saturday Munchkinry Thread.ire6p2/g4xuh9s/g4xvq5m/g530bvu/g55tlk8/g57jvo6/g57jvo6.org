If you make the basic stipulation that the augur has to accurately say their prediction, it should be really simple. Just remove chaotic elements from the prediction. The augur predicts you will raise your left hand in the next minute, you raise your right instead. They predict you leave the room out of one door, you take another. The augur would need some fairly obscene and obvious reality warping to make simple choices actually turn out in such a way that you /couldn't/ choose any other way than the observed one.

For stuff that's less in your control, it depends on how much improbable stuff is caused by the prediction. If you try to wear a different colored shirt than what the augur saw, it would be fairly difficult to make that be inevitable in a way that seems natural, especially if you do the same experiment multiple times.
