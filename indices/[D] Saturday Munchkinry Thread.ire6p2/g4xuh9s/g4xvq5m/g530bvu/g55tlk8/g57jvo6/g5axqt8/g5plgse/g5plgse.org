Is she intentionally wording predictions to minimise backfires from absolute and inflexible wording or is it part of whatever source is dolling out this knowledge?

If it's the former, work out the manner which her predictions are normally structured and plan for that. Stressful situations could help. For example, stage an obvious assassination attempt that invites a prediction about surviving immediate harm, while covertly administering a slow acting poison to the target. A prediction about "experiencing no negative effects from an assassination attempt" would be too broad to likely be made for example, so just make her make predictions that don't matter.

Tl;dr misdirection
