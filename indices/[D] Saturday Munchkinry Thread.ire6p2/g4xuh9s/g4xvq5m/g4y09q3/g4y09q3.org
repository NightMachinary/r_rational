This is a late-game idea which needs some seed capital, but what about engaging in high-frequency trading?

Visit all the main stock exchanges and buildings for sale nearby them. Open up portals and run cables through them to transmit stock information between the branches of your trading firm faster than light. This gives you an unbeatable advantage compared to other firms and should let you make money rapidly and reliably.

In terms of legalities, high-frequency trading is generally legal, and can be rationalised as making the prices of stocks more accurate or protecting the markets from shocks somehow. As for maintaining a facade, you just need to claim that your proprietary hardware and algorithms give you an edge in predicting the markets. With the money you'll be making, you can probably afford to employ a load of quants to explain how you gained your advantage.

As an aside, it might be worth considering the answers to standard questions like what reference frame the portals are stationary relative to, what happens when you open one on a moving train or in space, whether you can cut anything with the edge or so on.

Your control over what can pass through could be very versatile, and putting two portals right next to each other would effectively make a stationary filter. If you can select types of objects, you could sort through trash quickly to recycle efficiently. If you can extract chemical elements, you can pull gold out of seawater by opening a portal in a part of the ocean with a strong current that transmits only gold to your stores. If you can select isotopes, you're a one-person nuclear enrichment facility.
