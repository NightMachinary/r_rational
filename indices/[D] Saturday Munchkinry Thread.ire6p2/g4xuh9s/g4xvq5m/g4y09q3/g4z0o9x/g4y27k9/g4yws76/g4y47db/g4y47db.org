For short-term illegality, the easiest approach seems to me to be setting up portals which transmit cash only. For example, target bank cash vans on the motorway by setting up a cash-only portal in front of them. Filtering out everything else should even remove any of the security measures like dye packs. I'm not sure how best to explain that windfall, though, so traditional money-laundering might be necessary.
