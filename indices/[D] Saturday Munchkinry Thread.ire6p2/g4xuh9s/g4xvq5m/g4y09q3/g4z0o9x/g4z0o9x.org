Disagree with the undetectability of the stock market idea. I it is possible to detect FTL communication after the fact - I believe (but don't have a convenient citation for) a journalist who was investigated for releasing some market announcement in two cities both at exactly 6:00:00.00pm when the announcement wasn't supposed to be released before 6pm.

I acknowledge that you could explain consistent better-than-market performance, but it'd be highly suspicious if your proprietary algorithm/hardware never messes up.
