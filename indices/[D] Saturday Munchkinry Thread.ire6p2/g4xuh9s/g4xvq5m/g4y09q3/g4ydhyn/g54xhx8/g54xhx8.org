How smart/selective is this? Can I make a portal that only transports cancerous cells? Executives that have knowingly engaged in insider trading? A specific chemical from a low-yield chemical process? Spoons from universes where the nature of dark matter is [blank]?

Cancer - Faith healer that actually works. Maybe get someone else to be the front man / miracle worker so they draw the scrutiny when word gets out.

Executives - You can yoink rich people who've committed crimes into a dark room, blackmail them for money, then send them along their way.

Chemicals - Make an industrial chemical filter that consists of an interesting but nonsensical device, like an EmDrive, containing a selective portal to make it actually work. Sell it at a high cost, knowing you have a monopoly and are immune to industrial espionage.

Spoons - You can brute force hypotheses about the laws of physics and get a confirmation when the spoon goes through the portal. A binary search scheme would help. Once you have a correct novel theory, you'll have to do actual intellectual work to prove it, but knowing the end point for certain sure helps. Once you've won your nobel prize(s) in science, you can make honest money on speaking fees and appearances. Also go harvest the millennium prize puzzles.
