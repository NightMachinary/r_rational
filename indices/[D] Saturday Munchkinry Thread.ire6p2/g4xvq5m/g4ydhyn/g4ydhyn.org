Gold panning might work. You could probably place a large portal across a river or stream in the middle of nowhere. The gold is almost entirely in the sand/gravel, so you'd need a way to get that through a portal, which would be easy if you can move portals. Otherwise I think you'd need to dump the river somewhere else so it'd move the stream bed with it, then filter it, then bring it back. Dubiously legal, and dubiously effective, but it should work pretty quick if it's gonna work.

As an excuse for where the gold came from, you could sell it off slowly and claim you and some friends have been panning for a while and you're just now selling it off.
