Money-laundering would be a lot easier when you can cross borders with impunity and nigh-instantaneously, just pick a currency that sees use across a wide geographic area like the Euro.

Alternatively, you could yoink some lesser impact drugs (Marijuana) that would otherwise fund particularly dubious criminal enterprises and sell them to less dubious ones across the globe. The criminal nature would make anonyminity in the transaction more acceptable.

Or you could just remotely loot some criminal safehouses. Hell, once word gets out, there'll be a race to the bottom as orgs (and cops) seek to leak each other's safehouses for comparative advantage. I have a hunch laundering $100 million without being caught gets easier if you pay someone $20 million to do it for you.
