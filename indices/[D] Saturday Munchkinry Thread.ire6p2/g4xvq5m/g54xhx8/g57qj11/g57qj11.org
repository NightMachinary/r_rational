Wow! The spoons thing was a really creative one. But no, I was thinking more of a semi permeable filter of sorts. This was more of a thought experiment I was having; what if you wake up one day and find out you have this amazing ability of creating portals? What would you really do with this to increase your wealth or standing in this world without informing anyone of this ability.

The obvious thing that comes to mind is being able to listen in/observe people anonymously. Since the portal is selectively permeable; One could fashion two in front of their eyes. Photons would go one way only; so no ambient light from the other side would spill.

The faith healer thing is nice except the portal would work on your knowledge of the subject. For example, you could choose for sea water to pass through without the salt and other material giving you fresh water but you couldn't really pass an individual without their cancer cells. How would you define a cancer cell? Unless you know exactly what to look for?

I think the chemicals idea is a real world application. You get to maintain the pretense of a legitimate product without having to reveal the proprietary filter.

Great food for thought!
