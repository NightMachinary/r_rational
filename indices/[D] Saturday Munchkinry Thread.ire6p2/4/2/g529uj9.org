You could make a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_electromagnet][Bitter Magnet]] with an infinite maximum magnetic field strength. I have no idea what you could actually /do/ with an arbitrarily powerful magnet, but it would probably be something neat.

Running an atomically thin metal wire between two blocks of metal would allow you to make the entire thing indestructible and cut through basically anything. There's probably some really good uses for that, but cutting through blocks of stone is what came to mind for me.

Depending on how loosely you can define "metal part", you could make pressure reactors for chemical processes that are ordinarily prohibitively expensive to run at high pressures. Not sure if this one is actually feasible.

Exploding a nuclear bomb inside an indestructible sphere with a single small outlet would be interesting, though I again have little idea what you could actually do with that. Tunnel boring maybe? Wait, no this would actually make a really good rocket if anything could survive the insane acceleration it would provide. It would also be an absurdly strong weapon, admittedly.
