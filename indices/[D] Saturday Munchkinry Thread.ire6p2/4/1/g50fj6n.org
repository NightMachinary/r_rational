Drill bits, cutting tools, dies on hydraulic presses. Sharpening and replacing tooling is a massive expense for any business that makes metal parts. Preventative maintenance that involves swapping out parts every batch with freshly hardened ones is expensive but it also means you can use much older and cheaper methods to hold modern tolerances, simply because your tools don't need to be replaced.

Explosions are used for certain kinds of welding too. It's all just a matter of what you want to make.
