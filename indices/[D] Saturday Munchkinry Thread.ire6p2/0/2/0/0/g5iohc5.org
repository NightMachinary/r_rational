You mean manga author or me?

I see a lot of issues with that 'shinigami eyes', and the one of the ways I'd munchkin it (no one mentioned it here) is "get" a person, make a commitment to kill him if certain stock go up, and check his remaining life span with shinigami eyes, and then based on that invest in this stock or don't (or use third person for this, because my own knowledge and will might meddle with prediction)
