Are you able to use this information to change people's lifespans? What happens if you try to kill someone early, or save them from an untimely death, or just butterfly effect things by flinching at the surprise numbers when you first get your power?

Options:

- Use the inside knowledge to make money, for example through life insurance, claiming to be an undetectable assassin but only taking contracts on targets you can see will die soon anyway, or predicting the deaths of CEOs to play the stock market

- Improve medical research by observing the lifespans of people in clinical trials to find out the long-term effects of a drug as soon as it's administered, or even beforehand

- If you can't change people's lifespans, you can at least inform them of their new time horizons so they know whether to save up for a lengthy retirement or to make the most of their remaining lifespan now

- Predict disasters by recording the times of death you observe and looking for clusters in timing and geography
