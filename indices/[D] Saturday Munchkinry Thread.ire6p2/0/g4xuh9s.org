You've been given a magical power called 'shinigami eyes' which lets you see the remaining life span (down to minutes) of every person you look at (directly; not through camera, mirror, etc).

(Idea is from death note anime series/manga and should work as there)

How and why would you use it? Can you find any tricky uses for that?
