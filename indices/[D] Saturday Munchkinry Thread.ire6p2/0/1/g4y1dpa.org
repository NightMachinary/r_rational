I guess every choice a person makes would influence their remaining lifespan. Off the top of my head I would probably try to find out the answers to the important questions that we're all asking:

- Marijuana vs Tobacco

- Does a Keto diet actually make a difference?

- Do Flat earthers live longer than the rest of us?

I would probably be an amazing safety inspection manager.
