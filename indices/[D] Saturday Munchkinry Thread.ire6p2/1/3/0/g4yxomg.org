[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule][Manganese nodules]] are sea floor growths that are reasonably valuable and would be relatively easy to harvest given the portals described by the OP.

There have been talks in the past about mining them, but in practice the extreme capital costs tend to make it a questionable investment. The highest profile attempt turned out to be a CIA deep water espionage operation, but other companies have looked into doing it for real.

Unfortunately the "must have visited" qualifier means you still have startup costs, but getting a manned observation vehicle to the bottom is much cheaper than building a deep sea mining ship, and requires few continuing costs once you have a portal.
