You have the power to open portals to any place you have been before. The portals may be as small as a hole in a watch-strap; or they may be as large as a building. You may open multiple instances and you may also control what can pass through them.

You are a person living in <Random Country>. You want to become rich using your power, but do not wish to reveal it to any other individual. You also don't want to indulge in anything illegal or suspicious that would raise flags with any governing body.

How do you use your power creatively to accumulate riches while maintaining a facade of a having earned this wealth through legal methods?
