This is some good rational material. The background changes and justifications as well as other character behavior is both rational-ish and in character with their original canon.

Arc 3 really kicks into high gear with Thinkering and power legality/rulings and classification.

Be warned that MC might seem like a Mary Sue due to excessive power usefulness and application, and of course the resulting character changes that would prevent silly mistakes like canon characters making decisions for plot. This is a good thing in concept, but the execution sometimes dips into fixfic territory.
