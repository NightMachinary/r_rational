It looks like this is pretty popular on spacebattles, but I haven't seen it linked here and it definitely should be. The fic provides an interesting take on the internal workings of Cauldron ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/agent-of-cauldron-worm.345669/][Agent of Cauldron]] is also good for this), and generally the non-combat-oriented side of Worm. I was consistently surprised by how reasonable everyone in the story is (even Danny! Even Piggot!!), but this doesn't get in the way of the tension or conflict (which is largely but not exclusively political). The writing is strong, particularly in representing long, complex trains of thought in a compelling way and in quickly setting up relationships that seem honest and even heart-warming. All of the struggles are well motivated; everyone is competent; and Taylor reminds me of HPMOR!Harry in a several subtle and not so subtle ways.

A++ would recommend. (So I did.)
