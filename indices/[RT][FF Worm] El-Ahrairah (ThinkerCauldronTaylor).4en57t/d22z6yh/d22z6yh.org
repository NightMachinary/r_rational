It's cool story, but it strikes me as kinda aimless. See taylor powerset is a world level thing, which is an awesome change from the standard worm fanfic, but we really have very little info on the world stage of Worm. Agents of Cauldron as previously mentioned is a good comparison, it went the direction of large amounts of original content, El-Ahrairah has up till now largely worked in the boundaries of the canon worm, despite taylor's goals and methods require her to work outside said boundaries. You can argue narrative reason of why this is, but the author has yet to demonstrate the ability to paint a larger world, which is crucial to the story's long-term/completion viability.
