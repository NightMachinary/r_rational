This is a fair criticism. The story works for me because 1) I find the characterization and interpersonal relationships interesting and entertaining and 2) the story seems to me to be going somewhere. It's relatively young, and everything points to an expanding scope; the plot/conflict we've seen so far makes sense to me as the first set of challenges for this Taylor and she's an ambitious enough character that I expect the plot will continue to progress well.

That said, Agent of Cauldon does an amazing job of expanding the world with original content, and I don't expect this fic to meet that standard.
