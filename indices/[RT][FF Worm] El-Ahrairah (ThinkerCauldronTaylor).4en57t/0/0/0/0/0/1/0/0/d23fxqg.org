Should do, yeah, in the way that most things about a fic of that length improve as the fic goes along. It's been a long time since I read the whole thing, so I can't exactly give a fair comparison between the start and the where it is at the minute. I don't know if I'd say the dialogue ever becomes its biggest strength, because that's the combat, the storyline and the tinkering, but it does improve.
