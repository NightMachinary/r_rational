Have fun!

I've found that with most philosophical or worldview texts, it's hard to get a lot out of a re-read unless you spend a good amount of time digesting in addition to reading. Make sure you give yourself a good amount of time to discuss and analyze the text to get the most out of this.

The first time I read Marx and Engels, I got a lot out of the experience. The second time I read their essays, most of my gains came from reading the essay, then sitting and thinking about it or writing my own analysis and reactions down. The actual read-through was very valuable, but only useful because it let me take a second, more in-depth and critical look at the work.

Make sure to draw lessons from other non-fiction rereads (like the GEB one on this sub) and other rereads of Yudkowsky's essays on other subs so that you get the best out of it.
