Might we want parts of Rationality: From AI to Zombies instead? I don't know the differences, but I'm under the impression that some articles in that are rewritten and better + other things not in the sequences. On the other hand, it misses things like Metaethics. Also, the sequences are easier because they're web articles, not chapters of an eBook, and thus has a lower starting cost.

I'm all for a daily thing, though. My readings of the sequences are very scattered.
