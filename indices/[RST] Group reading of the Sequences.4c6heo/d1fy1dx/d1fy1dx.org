Neat! Ok, sounds like there's interest in a weekly something. I can try to make that happen. The next question would be....

What usually keeps your interest? What usually loses it?

The goal here, for me at least, isn't to have a good discussion, it's to /get through the sequences/. Discussion help with that. To that end, here's an idea:

OP should be a summary, then: a thing I don't understand and would like someone to explain, a thing I do understand and think I can explain, what you have to look forward to next week.
