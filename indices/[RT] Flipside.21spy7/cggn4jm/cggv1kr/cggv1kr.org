It's a bit hard to describe; if I had to call it anything, I'd call it a philosophical fantasy webcomic. Different characters collide in a medieval-ish setting, and their interactions revolve around trying to fix various messes by doing the smart thing. The nsfw material is soft; there's a bit of nudity, and I think a sex scene or two, but all in the service of examining romance philosophically, and trying to optimize it.
