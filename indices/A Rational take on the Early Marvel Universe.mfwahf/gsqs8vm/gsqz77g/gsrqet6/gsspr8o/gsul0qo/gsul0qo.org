I guess my question was more around the concept of in-universe people asking... any questions at all? The core "irrationality" of a lot of comic books and comic book stories is an intentional disregard for the concept of "this has implications beyond first-order effects" (because the stories would quickly stop being in any way recognizable as "our world but with superpowers" which a lot of people are less interested in).

I'm not saying that's a problem, but one of the conceits of rational fiction is "people behaving in a way that makes sense" and so if you have characters who see and can predict things like "oh this is going to change materials science forever" and then... it doesn't, for day to day lives, then either the premise quickly turns into a weird fourth wall breaking "what is this world controlling conspiracy that is controlling everything to seem more like a story than people trying to make sense" or you've just given your characters the ability to make observations without retaining a working memory.

Not saying it couldn't work, but it does feel like the premise of "observe universe and comment as though you're a real person" would be very difficult for anything long-running. (See the HPMOR continuation fic Significant Digits to see where the logical "second book" of essentially that premise in the HP universe could plausibly go - it's good, but exceedingly /weird/)
