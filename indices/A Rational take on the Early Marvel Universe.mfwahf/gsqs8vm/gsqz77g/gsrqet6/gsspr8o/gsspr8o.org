The premise is that we do not have full information. We don't know the stuff happening “behind closed doors” and the stuff we see and/or hear about we filter through skepticism.

So when Thor says he is “Thor” our questions are around: Is he someone who got powers through experimentation like the FF and picked up a hammer and is calling himself “Thor” or is he really the Norse god of thunder? Evidence suggests it is the former (at least initially). We talk about what that means and why he would lie that way.

Then as more facts come out (like a battle in NY with his brother Loki) we debate whether our first assumption was correct. Maybe he really is the Norse god? If so, what does THAT mean in terms of our understanding of history. We're the Norwegians the only culture that “got it right”? Why didn't the Norse gods go to other countries? Why isn't Thor based in Norway now? Are the other ancient myths also true? Or have elements of truth (Thor the superhero has a bunch of differences from Thor the ancient god - we talk about those differences including things like “hair color and a beard” and “the ability to fly”)

When the Baxter Building gets taken into space and then brought back to earth and “returned” we talk about structural integrity of the building and how what we saw was possible. We end up hypothesizing that it was built with similar materials to the new uniforms. And then ask how it will change construction going forward around the world.

And so on....

Because we are not privy to most of what happens so far we have been able to make our questioning work. It may grow thin once we get to the 1970s (“can we talk about how Franklin Richards does not seem to be aging?”) but so far we have only recorded a little over a “year” of content so the fact that unstable molecules have not changed the world of firefighting has not been a big issue yet.....
