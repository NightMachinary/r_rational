It's the audio, not the summary.

The show takes the old Marvel Comics, but then asks, what would a rational outside observer think of the stuff that is happening?

The second episode is maybe a better introduction for this crowd:

It explore the ramification to an otherwise normal world of the introduction of super powered individuals. What does it mean for the space race? Can we mass produce super powers? What will the Soviets do? Will they commercialize unstable molecules? Is Ironman a good use of shareholder capital? Etc...
