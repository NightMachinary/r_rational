Totally fair.

I think the longer it runs the bigger this problem is.

We point out the logical issues with what we are seeing, but then we attempt to explain WHY those logical inconsistencies might be happening (usually guessing wrong, as the "real" answers are not logical at all). We come up with explanations for what is happening that seem satisfying (again, even though they are wrong).

Sometimes our theories are proven wrong by the public stuff that happens next. It happens in the first two episodes. The first episode tries to explain why two monsters (Thing and Torch) attack the city, and how the military responded so quickly. The next episode happens after Reed Richards explains everything - and we clearly got it wrong. But that just opens up a bunch of new questions (and leaves some unanswered - like why does Johnny Storm appear so similar to an android from WWII? And if Reed was a military contractor, why did the military attack the torch? What is being kept from us?)

Eventually all our theorizing may come crashing down, but we are 40 episodes in and it hasn't happened yet... I expect it will, but it may be a while...
