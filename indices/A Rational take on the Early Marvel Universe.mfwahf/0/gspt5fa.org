I have loved this sub for years now. It was how I found things like HPTMOR, Darker Shade of White, the rational takes on Superman, Terminator, etc.

I had an idea to do a rational take on Marvel Comics for almost as long as I was aware of the genre. I finally did it.

A friend and I have launched a podcast where we are radio personalities in the early 1960s. We assume that everything happening in Marvel Comics at the time is really happening, and we comment on the implications based on what we can observe from the outside (ie we don't know that SpiderMan is Peter Parker, but we do know that he just appeared on all the late night TV shows and he is funny and witty)

We ask questions like: - Will there be a super powered arms race with the Soviets? - How do we replicate the creation of super powered individuals? - Is ironman a good use of StartCorp shareholder capital?

We have recorded 35 episodes so far. We just dropped the first four this morning. I linked to the newsletter, but it is also available on all the regular podcast players.

Would love thoughts from this community. We might even be able to incorporate your ideas as we move through the 1960s.

(We are currently recording February 1963 - almost to the introduction of IRONMAN. But Dr Strange, Avengers, X-men etc are far into the future recording schedule...)
