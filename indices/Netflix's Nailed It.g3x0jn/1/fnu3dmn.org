My suspicion would be that there's rules against them using it during the last [X] minutes of the show; the fact that literally every contestant has done that is a good indication. Plus, in reality TV, the advantages generally have many more rules than are revealed to the viewer. (/Survivor/ fans will pause the show to read the full rules of advantages as written on the parchments the players get, and they are far more nuanced than you'd think).
