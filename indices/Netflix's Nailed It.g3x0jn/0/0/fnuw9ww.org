Making something burn after baking is what I thought of too, ruining it after it's already baked would be a huge time cost. You would have to plan on long bake times to try to make 3 minutes not totally ruin it, and you could try to fake out the other team so they use it when you aren't actually ready to take it out.

If the power up didn't have any secret rules everyone would just ensure they get everything plated/decorated 3 minutes early to guard against it. I can't think of many other good opportunities besides the oven, if they use a mixer, or if they do icing or layers that are very specific.
