Most cooking shows are heavily edited. If every challenger just barely spends the last 3 minutes to barely finish in every episode, they most likely did not. They probably finished at reasonable times and the show was edited to make it look like it was down to the wire.

If you finish the baking process uninterrupted, everything afterwards is fluff to improve upon what has been baked. A last 3 minutes button would just cut into the fluff, and they most likely would have already did most of the best they could do.

The most opportune time, with my limited baking knowledge, would be when they are in the middle of mixing cake batter or right before they want to take something out of the oven.
