Just a quick note of interest. There's little evidence to suggest that DNA samples suffice, even if you have /all/ of them. DNA is the program, but a program is useless without a computer for the language it's written in.

It's theoretically /possible/ that one might be able to go from DNA to everything else, but I'd bet that doing so is extremely hard. Chances are you need an at least somewhat sophisticated environment, in which I'm including both high level things like wombs and low level things like cellular machinery, to produce animals from DNA.
