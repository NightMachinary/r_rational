Exactly. The video's host makes a few too many claims for my taste. If a ship with living aliens popped up in our solar system tomorrow, all we really know is that they have some way of traversing space. That's it. We don't know anything else about their tech, their values , etc.

Really, the host would've been better served pointing out that the odds of a human being becoming familiar enough with the aliens' software (or their equivalent) in that time to craft a virus is ridiculously unlikely. It's like someone being dropped into a Chinese airport and expected to become competent in spoken Mandarin by reading signs. Only even more unlikely than that. At least Chinese people are humans
