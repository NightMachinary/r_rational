Interesting take and I agree with a lot of what he said but I do think he was being a bit arrogant/presumptuous about what we can reasonably expect from an alien civilization. Reasonable explanations are all about context and we have almost none for alien races. Intelligence doesn't always equate to a human definition of reasonable.
