Sludge Preformation is, as far as I know, ended. Judging by its meta-narrative and writing style, there was a chance the author was pulling one on us and the story could actually continue, but that doesn't seem to be the case since the author deleted their profile and the website shut down. A shame because it was one of the few well-written fiction in its particular genre.

I have a backup of that story if anyone's interested. I could PM you. I got it from someone on one of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s previous weekly threads. I don't know if it's right to just freely distribute it, but since there is no word from the author yet I think it's a fair game.
