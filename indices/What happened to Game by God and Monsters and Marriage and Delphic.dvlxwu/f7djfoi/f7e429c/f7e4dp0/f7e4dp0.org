I had only read Game By God after it was finished. I thought it was in-serialization when I peaked in to the Table of Contents. Imagine my feelings when I found out it actually ended on 3.02. I liked the meta-narrative. Meta-narrative is so easy to fuck up and hard to do it tastefully. My only nitpick is that 'wildbow almost becomes a minor character' in that story.

I'm yet to read the other two but I have a backup of them so I'll get around to it someday. Sounds interesting.
