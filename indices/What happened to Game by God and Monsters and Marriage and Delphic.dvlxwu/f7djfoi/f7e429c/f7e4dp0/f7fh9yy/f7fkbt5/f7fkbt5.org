we-ell, turns out it's a little more complicated than I thought. A few users in [[https://discordapp.com/invite/Ha3FUvP][Alexander Wales' Discord server]] put together various backups of stuff (search *from:150445824587988992* *has:file* there to find the most comprehensive one), but I don't really think they're complete and their presentation is pretty damn far from how they looked on the site. We did actually archive Serial Infringement when it came out (minus a single teaser post IIRC), so you can view the surviving pages [[https://archive.is/korridor.rip][here]]. A few of us had subscribed via email to the site and so still have all the posts sitting around in our inboxes, but they obviously exclude any corrections which were made after posting and so aren't really a great source from which to reconstruct the stories

the precedent is that every time the site returned after being taken offline, all the old posts were made accessible once more, so I expect (well, hope) that that'll be the case if the site comes back again
