a brief history of Korridor:

- /Game By God/ was about a web serial writer who competes in a /Danganronpa/-style murder-mystery elimination game. It was put on hiatus a couple of chapters into its third arc because the author thought it was too ambitious
- /Ship Poster/ was about a virtuoso violinist hired to play for a luxury cruise ship that rich people go on to live out their final days. About two-dozen chapters were released in total before the story was also put on hiatus for reasons I won't repeat here (they were given in a blog post titled "You Fooled Me Once")
- /Serial Infringement/ had a really cool twist on a superhero premise, but only one chapter was released before the site (and the author's various accounts) went offline

of the three serials, /Game By God/ was the one most relevant to this sub, with the other two kinda shaking off the pretence of rational storytelling and becoming more surreal. They were all loosely connected by a broader meta-narrative, with the author posting meta interstitials in the gaps between stories

this all kinda paints a grim picture, but these stories were genuinely really great on a chapter-to-chapter basis, even to the point where I'd say they're still worth reading (we have archived copies of all the text, although you're losing out on the comments and other pages from the site, which were a big part of the experience at the time) despite their abrupt endings. At the time there was a fair bit of intrigue surrounding the site as the writing was good enough that a lot of people were convinced that it was all being done by an established author here. Whether they were or not, I personally figure they'll probably be back at some point with another new and weird thing
