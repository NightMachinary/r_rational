  You can't, say, overthrow the gods, because they have prophecy and Fate on their side, and you can't trust them to be nice, because they're Greek gods.

You can *totally* overthrow the Gods, though. Fate doesn't /protect/ them, just warn them via prophecies. There's literally a prophecy in the books about the protagonist possibly overthrowing the gods IIRC.

Also, it's a major plot point that the gods have, themselves, overthrown the last batch of gods (as is standard in Greek myth.) Maybe they actually started out as humans/demigods? That would explain a lot, actually.
