That's... a good point. But the books keep mentioning how overthrowing the gods would be terrible. And if you do fight them, they have prophecy, control of the afterlife, and the ability to kill you on the spot. If you succeed, Western civilization collapses. They don't seem to have started out as demigods - excluding Hercules and Dionysus, the god-god/god-Primordial/Primordial-Primordial pairings seem to be the only way to make gods.

And overthrowing-gods plots are both immensely cliche and miss the point of Greek myth. The universe sucks, it's run by entities who are shitty, and you're not going to overpower them ever.
