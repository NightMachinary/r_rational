Artifacts that may work against the gods:

A Gorgon's head. There are two immortal ones still out there, and Medusa's head worked on Atlas. Writers are split on whether the other two even have the petrification ability, but if they do then it might work on the gods.

The Hydra. It has an immortal head still producing poison. Heracles buried that on the road between Lerna and Elaius, and helpfully marked the spot with a big rock. Digging it up is probably suicidal (when it was alive, its /footprints/ were poisonous enough to kill) but if you can manage to use it, it might work on the Olympians. Can't directly kill 'em, but it permanently incapacitated Chiron. (Chiron: Zeus' half brother on one side and Athena's cousin on the other. Should be high up the superpowers chain.)

Hades' helmet of invisibility: Used in battle against Titans and Giants, it almost certainly works against Olympians too. It's held by the nymphs of the Styx, who have given it out to mortals before but only with a direct command from a god. Hades lets mortals walk into his domain (/out/, not so much), but he will know you're there. If you can steal this helm, you'll probably be able to get away. Then you can steal...

Hermes' sword. Usable by mortals and absurdly sharp. If you slice a god into pieces while invisible and seal them in multiple bronze jars, they'll stay out of play.

Eros' arrows. For if violently dismembering the enemy is too harsh. May or may not only work on opponents of opposite gender.
