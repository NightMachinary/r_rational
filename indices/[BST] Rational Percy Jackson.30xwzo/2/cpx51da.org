Making mortals p-zombies is a bit depressing.

How about just making it so that magic is required to get anywhere in the world.

The mist prevents mortals from seeing monsters and magic. That means that any magical being can use their powers freely. Suppose a non magical person tries to gain power in an army. A magical being can put on their magic mask and beat the crap out of them, or twist their senses and drive them insane.

This is a world of entrenched power structures. Magical beings held every position of power in society, were at the top of every social pole with few exceptions. To get anywhere in life you need magic so you can see through the mist and tackle the problems you face in life.

As to why you can't overthrow the gods, that doesn't seem irrational. They're much more powerful than mortals and have dominance over most social structures, the camps included, so to defeat them you'd have to be immensely powerful and rally every weaker being to your banner. They have control over the fates and control over every major position of power.

How about a story where Percy allies with Kronus to save humanity from the gods?
