Rational!Hades would be able to deal with that, I'm sure. >:]

I'm not sure how things are in the series, but original!Hades was definitely the nicest of the Top Three, and I'd support any motion to set him on the throne. He didn't hate mortals, it just happened to be his job to rule over the underworld, and it was the way of things that mortals were gonna die.

Now, there /was/ the Rape of Persephone, but (1) we're comparing this against the far greater number of assaults committed by Poseidon and Zeus and (2) some early versions of the myth contest the idea that there was a kidnapping at all, and suggest that the problem was just that Demeter couldn't deal with her kid growing up.
