I like this.

I'm not familiar with the series, so does this make Hades more powerful than in canon, because he has access to the sum total of human knowledge? And not just that, but its best problem-solvers, &c &c.

Is there a war on? Well, just let Hades get together all of his copies of the world's greatest generals. &c.
