That's true, but it also feels weird. Computers and animals don't have souls, why would humans?

Hades still has all the dead heroes and villains, if he wants. Maybe he created his own automata ("ghosts") that act like mortals made of underworld stuff, and the ghosts we see in series are basically those. (I guess that's sorta what you meant?)
