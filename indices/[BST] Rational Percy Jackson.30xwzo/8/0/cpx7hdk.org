Yeah, think of it -

The gods are truesapient, and they keep seeing these naturally-arising machines going around, modifying their behavior sometimes, and sometimes not doing so. They're not people, really - they're more like works of art. And some of these art pieces are ones you find interesting, or beautiful, and you /want/ them. It's not like you'd hesitate to take an unowned rock from the ground, so why would you hesistate to take a p-zombie from the Earth when no actual person has claimed them?

Sometimes your family steals art you wanted, or your husband gets too obsessed with the weird hobby, so you get mad at them, but the art? It's worthless compared to family, just set it on fire or something so they stop obsessing over it. If it annoys you a little? Destroy it, another nice one will come along soon. Finished admiring it, and got bored? No reason to keep it near you.

It's amazing how much more the books and myths make sense if gods don't think of mortals as people.

The weird intersection is demigods - they're a bit like you, but a bit like mortals. And monsters/nymphs/etc, of course, which are truesapient but weak - maybe they're just puny gods.

It'd also make it a little less horrifying if mortals didn't have souls - they don't get sent to Asphodel and Punishment. The flipside's that Hades would seem a lot weaker.
