This is a really interesting idea. The Percy Jackson world is very grim if you start to think about it. Its nice that souls exist and there is a verified afterlife but it all goes downhill from there. The majority of people get their memories wiped and sent off to Aphsodel (sp?) Only the truly exceptional get admitted to Elysium which isn't really most people.

The worst part is you can't really overthrow the gods. They are deeply conceptually tied to western civilization itself and have authority over domains such as fate, wisdom, war etc. Good luck getting one over them.

The p zombie idea is interesting but I find keeping the mortals sapient makes the story more meaningful because there are real people who are suffering.

Maybe instead of your protagonist trying to overthrow the gods to bring about change they can work within the system. Maybe try to convince the gods to be less assholish and maybe convince Hades to be nicer to the recently departed. It would be nice to see a rationalist deal with a universe where all their assumptions about how the universe works is basically wrong.

Good luck with your story.
