How do you define fate? Do Gods control fate or does fate control the Gods? If fate is just the inevitable course that history takes, is it inevitable BECAUSE the Gods are making it that way? Or does it just happen to be consistently inevitable in the Gods' favor?

If it's the former, thwart the Gods manipulations by figuring out how the Gods ascended in the first place so you can ascend other humans. If it's the latter, you might be able to do the same, depending on whether fate favors all Gods or just the first ones. If you can't, find a way to escape to another world or universe where the gods don't have jurisdiction. Otherwise you're just screwed. If Fate is actually a character and one of the gods, then that makes Zeus a figurehead with Fate as the real power behind the throne, so to speak. Keep in mind that none of the Gods are all powerful. They can be outsmarted, since their minds are still human.

That being said, I haven't read the Percy Jackson series, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.
