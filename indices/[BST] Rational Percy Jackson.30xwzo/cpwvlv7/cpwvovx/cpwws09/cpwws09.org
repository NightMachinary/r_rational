Not to mention that's actually not the way it happened in Greek mythology. The Olympian gods came to power after overthrowing their predecessors, the Titans, who had come to power after overthrowing the primordial deities. And according to Plato, the Demiurge shaped the material universe, including the Primordial deities, out of ideas. The ideas themselves could be unmade platonic ideals or something. Maybe the Olympian gods just want people to think that they're invincible and have always been around
