I'd imagine whoever replaces Hades continues the Fields of Punishment. In fifty years, people find out about Hades on a quest in fifty years and Percy gets sent to the Fields. Hades is now really, really pissed at his imprisonment, and just sends everyone in Asphodel to Punishment, because fuck trying to be merciful at all. There's a much larger conflict between the Big Three which dwarfs World War II.

It's not Greek myth if your flaws don't fuck you up, and Percy should know this. Rational Greek heroes would be constantly watching themselves to make sure they didn't do anything unjust to the gods, because it would absolutely screw them over.
