If you can't convince Hades to revive the dead, you might at least convince the other gods to give him more space and resources so he can make the afterlife a nicer place. Maybe try convincing him to be a little less harsh in punishing evil people.

In the worst case, Percy could just choose not to tell the other gods that Ares was the one who really stole the Master Bolt or frame Hades for some other crime. Then he could get Hades thrown into Tartarus and replaced with someone more malleable.
