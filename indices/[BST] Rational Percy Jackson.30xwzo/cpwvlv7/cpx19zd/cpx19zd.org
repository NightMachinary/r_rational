I don't know about in the Percy Jackson series, but in canon fate beats Zeus. It's why he's legitimately threatened by prophecies like "Thetis will have a son more powerful than his father," threatened enough to /actually keep it in his pants for once/.

See also Aeschylus:

"Who then is the steersman of Necessity?

The three-shaped Moerae (Fates) and mindful Erinyes (Furies).

Can it be that Zeus has less power than they do?

Yes, in that even he cannot escape what is foretold."

They don't actually rule the world. They could, if they wanted to, but (mostly for Doylist reasons) they don't. Zeus is ruling in his own right and not on anyone else's behalf, and that's fine, just like the President of the United States doesn't become a figurehead for not being able to ignore gravity.
