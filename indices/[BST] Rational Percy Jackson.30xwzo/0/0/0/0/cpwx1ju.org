no. However, if the HPverse was only hogwarts and some scattered magical creatures, then you would at least give a watsonian reason for this, if not add a larger wizard society. Plus, in the PJ series, the god's true forms are physics destroying monsters that nuke their surroundings just by existing. They could easily be re-interpreted as personas designed to let the underlying entities interact with humans.
