In canon everybody knows all the mythology that we do. The demigods are familiar with pretty much the same mythology that you'd find in a textbook. Percy Jackson's world consists of a.) the real world, the same one we live in, plus b.) the hidden world where Greek mythology is real (and so is Roman and to a questionable extent Egyptian as well, though that may have just been an easter egg to a different series the author wrote). It's like Harry Potter in that aspect.
