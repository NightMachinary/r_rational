In the version /I/ heard, Hades plays Jerkass Genie and says "Your wife can come back to life if you don't look at her before you're out of my kingdom", Orpheus exits the underworld, looks back at his wife, and Hades turns around and says "No no, I meant /both/ of you being outside my kingdom." and takes Orpheus' wife back to the underworld.
