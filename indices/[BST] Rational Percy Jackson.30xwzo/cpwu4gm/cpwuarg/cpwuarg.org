I've only heard of the series, not read it, but the thing that's so great about Greek gods and myths is that they /are/ human, not just embodiments of abstract things like in so many other mythologies.

Edit: well, that and the fact that the things which are metaphorical, like the arts being the daughters of memory, are incarnated observation rather than bullshat explanation.
