I think most of the other gods get a tithe of souls, for people that belong to them strongly. In canon, Ares got Confederate skeletons crewing a ship as minions for his daughter without going through Hades. It'd make sense if other gods got their own souls as they died.

Hades might get last pick of human souls, which pisses him off the same way that he was pissed in canon - no respect at all, even if he doesn't have to manage a hundred billion people. He gets a bunch of demigods who couldn't ascend to godhood and whose parents wouldn't keep them, but no decent mooks.

Thing is, everyone's a demigod, and he'd have them all - George Washington, Alan Turing, etc. But he wouldn't have any menial labor drones.
