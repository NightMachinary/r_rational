At one point I started working on this, then sort of forgot about it when the idea for NaClO got into my head.

General advice:

The gods shouldn't be outside the realm of science, but they should be /really fucking complicated/ physics wise, or else Athena-cabin would have reverse-engineered godhood in like a week.

Luke should be smarter and more rational than Percy. Obviously.

The gods are pricks. Even the "nice" ones like Hermes are truly monumental arseholes who abandon their kids and fuck with human lives for fun. Seriously, they're narcissists at best and omnicidal at worst. Treat them as such.

Base it on the books, not the films. People will be extremely angry if you don't.
