I'd think requiring magic is much more depressing. Imagine if literally every successful person on Earth had to have a superpower, and you could never get that superpower yourself. You can't understand why what the superpowered people are doing is done, because illusions.

What really horrified me when I read the books, the way Dementors horrified me as a kid, was this. At the end of your life, you're judged by people you didn't believe in to see how heroic you were. If you were a dick, you get sent to Punishment; if you were heroic - and you're a mortal, so you're not - you get sent to Elysium or the Isle of the Blessed. If you're a monster, you reincarnate as a plant or as a target. Everyone else gets sent to Asphodel, where they promptly do nothing forever.

So you live your life not understanding the real universe because of the Mist, and when you die you just stand there forever. Unless you were shitty enough to be punished.
