There are a number of other gods, the egyptian and norse ones in particular, greeks and romans aren't the only ones. Not all will be in the same afterlife.

Also, having most people be zombies is personally depressing for readers. They have family members, most of whom are statistically likely to be non magical. This story has a premise that feels like stage one is to slay almost everyone every reader loves. It's personally depressing. Random people who they don't know are less depressing.

Plus they can be saved.
