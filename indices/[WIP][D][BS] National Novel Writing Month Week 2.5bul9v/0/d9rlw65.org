I'm still going strong on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]. I'm kind of amazed that I'm already up to 28,000 words, including 5800 words so far in today's binge. I expect my word-rate to drop sharply, though; I'm just about at the point where the story starts getting complicated, as some long-standing near-isolation falls away, and I expect I'm going to have to start keeping track of a lot more characters and won't be able to keep the plot as abstract as it's been.
