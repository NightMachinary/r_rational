I've barely broken 2k, but at the very least I have managed to do something I've never done before. Written something!

The annoying part is that my antagonist is so much more interesting than the hero that they've switched roles. Jackie is the one I'm going into detail about and has massive amount of power compared to Alan who is shy and insists on being mysterious.

So I'm switching the two and instead of watching a rationalist out-think a very arrogant character, we're going to be watching an arrogant protagonist get beaten by a rationalist and hopefully learn something important from him. Note that neither are actually meant to be "evil" but one of them is more impulsive than the other.

The prologue is really short, but the exciting bits of scientific experimentation is about to start! I plan on actually detailing out how professional researchers actually hypothesize, test, and analyze experiments in a live lab setting.
