I have a couple dozen thousand words... mostly in the form of my protagonist talking to himself and being paranoid.

You might want to consider explicitly writing down what your goals are, the reason you're giving NaNoWriMo a try in the first place, and then measure how well you're doing against that criteria rather than worry about any vague discouragement. For example, my main goal is "get into the habit of writing daily"; and even when I tried to take a day off, I ended up writing a couple thousand words of worldbuilding, so I'm pleased, even if the novel I end up with is so abstruse that almost nobody else ever wants to read it.
