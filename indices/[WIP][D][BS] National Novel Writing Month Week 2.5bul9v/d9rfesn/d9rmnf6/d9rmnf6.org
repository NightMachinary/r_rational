I'm not an /obsessive/ outliner, but I do think stories go better (if not faster) when I have points that I need to hit. Every scene remaining for NaNo has a one sentence description that says what the scene is; if I were better at outlining, I would probably include things like what the scene is meant to accomplish and how it ends (and ties into the next scene in the chapter).

But looking back on my original outline, now out of date by two years, I haven't stuck all that close to that original draft (which I think was a tighter story).
