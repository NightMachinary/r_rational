I gave someone a magic item without knowing what that magic item does. /Ideally/ everything that the heroes gain along their journey gets used by the climax. The problem comes with creating a climax that uses all those Chekov's Guns that were placed earlier; I think I really need to sit down and figure out which guns I left lying around, though most are accounted for. That doesn't solve the problem of /this specific gun/, whose form is not yet known to me, and which I will have to try to slot into the quickly-approaching finale. Not sure whether it makes more sense to build the gun first, or the gun's target.

(Making sure that all setups have payoffs is another one of those things that tends to be easier to do /after/ all the writing is done.)

(The magic item was something done on a whim, probably good for the story, and /by itself/ offers a different kind of setup ... but a bracelet made from a river spirit needs to both set up a rule /and/ have its own payoff.)
