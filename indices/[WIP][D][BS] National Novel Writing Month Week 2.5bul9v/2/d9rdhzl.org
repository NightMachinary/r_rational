Just passed the 15k mark last night. Tomorrow I'll be flying from the west coast to the east coast, and thus losing 3 hours. Hopefully I'll be able to get all my writing finished on the plane, because there's no way I'm going to be up for it after the flight.

The story is /finally/ picking up - recently wrote a pivotal scene that I've had in my head since I started the story last year. I'm planning on continuing to write 2k words a day after NaNo finishes, until I finish Part Two. I want to have this book complete before the summer, revisions and all. Also need to learn how to write a query letter.
