Hit the halfway point ahead of schedule by a few days, but behind my all-time NaNo pace (where I was at 30,000 today).

Finally, after two years, I'm pretty much at the bottom of the second act, when our characters are at their lowest. Though the story was actually plotted out using story circles, which puts me at around 5 or 6 (of 8). Step 5 is "Meeting the Goddess", Step 6 is "Meet Your Maker". S is /metaphorically/ at meeting the goddess, but /literally/ at meeting her maker ... I think the element of /choice/ comes in at confrontation with the V/M/C trio (who probably need another scene or two of fleshing out, but I can do that in post). Movement beyond the landing of the crown must be of the character's own volition.

In the original sketch of this story, the protagonists went down to the castle, got their asses kicked, regrouped, and then saved the kingdom together. I'm now sort of thinking that this is too much of a reversal of momentum so late in the book and I might be better served by just cutting out the "asses kicked, regrouped" part. But there were a lot of things that I wanted to write that would have led up to a final assault, which I think would maybe have to be done away with? I'm trying to find a way to have my cake and eat it too here.

(I don't think the actual ending is up in the air right now, but the implementation of it is. Which is kind of scary because I'm a day or two away from starting on the ending.)
