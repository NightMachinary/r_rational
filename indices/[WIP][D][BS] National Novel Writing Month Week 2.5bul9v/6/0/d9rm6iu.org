I've tried outlining everything in advance - and haven't gotten around to starting to write the actual story. I've tried winging most everything - and ended up with sprawling stories that I haven't ever finished. I've tried taking a dream and building a world around it - and [[http://www.datapacrat.com/weirdtopia/index.html][Living in Weirdtopia: Week One]] seems to have been generally positively received. I don't know that there's any useful advice that /can/ be given on this.

The prompt that I've found most appealing, though I haven't quite gotten the knack of sticking to it: "Write just the most awesome parts."
