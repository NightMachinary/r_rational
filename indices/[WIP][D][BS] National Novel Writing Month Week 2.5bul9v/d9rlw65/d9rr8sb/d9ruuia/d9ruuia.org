That's... actually a bit tricky to answer. Short answer: "Yes".

Example; I just did a big of digging, and found what may be my oldest surviving piece of fiction: "[[http://www.datapacrat.com/Art/Fiction/STORIES/REALITYS.TXT][Reality Slips]]", which I posted to a mailing list in [[http://www.datapacrat.com/Art/Fiction/STORIES/SLIPS.TXT][1996]] (which I'm still [[http://lists.integral.org/listinfo/tsa-talk][subscribed]] to :) ).

You'd need an account at the site to see the NSFW content, but most of the items posted to my gallery at [[https://www.furaffinity.net/user/datapacrat/][FurAffinity]] were written, or at least scripted, by me. I've been posting various pieces of original content there since 2011 (most of which were drawn by other people to my specifications); from about 5 to 2 years ago (when I started SI), I was focused on building a fairly-hard-SF(-but-furry) universe.

In the large time gap between, IIRC, most of my creative efforts went more towards role-playing games, particularly PBeMs for which no public record exists. But there could easily be some scattered items I've since forgotten.
