I remember hearing him talk that going into Twig, he wanted to improve his ability to humanize characters in peaceful moments with lightheartedness instead of in the midst of the stress, conflict, and pressure he's so accustomed to (and good at).

I've read the whole thing, and I think he succeeded greatly there. Sylvester's life isn't always nice, far from it, but you can /feel/ just how much he values those moments, how important they are to him.

It's not the magnum opus Worm was, but I can attest that Twig was better at getting me to feel emotional and connect with the /characters/ just as much as I resonated with the conflict at hand.
