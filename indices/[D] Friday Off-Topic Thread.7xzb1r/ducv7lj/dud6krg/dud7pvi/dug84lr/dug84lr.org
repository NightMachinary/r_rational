Worm didn't feel GrimDark at all to me until Leviathan and really the S9, after which it was pretty steadily grim.

But that was after I was already invested.

Pact felt grim from the beginning, before I was ever invested in the characters. Twig, likewise, though not as extreme as Pact.

In general I think Wildbow erred slightly on the side of GrimDark entering too quickly with his recent work. Or maybe I just happen to have a lower interest in Grimdark than most.
