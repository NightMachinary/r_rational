So I finally got around to reading [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/taking-root-1-1/][Twig]], by Wildbow, and I have to say, I'm enjoying it a lot. Without spoiling anything, I would characterize it as both:

A) The most implicitly rationalist work he has done, with a main character whose entire "superpower" is basically in thinking things out from many angles and understanding/predicting/manipulating people, and

B) The least "grimdark." The world itself is often nightmarish, like Worm and Pact, but the feeling of an unending grind of negative events, of constantly hopping from one bad situation to a worse one, is absent, thanks to 1) more variance in the intensity of subsequent arcs and 2) a stronger sense of the MC having control over what's happening that's even better than Taylor's talismanic determination was at keeping me from noticing said "grimdarkness" while reading.

I'm still only about halfway through the story (it's massively long, as usual) so maybe that eventually changes, but as of now I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Worm or Pact but were turned off by said grimdarkness in them.
