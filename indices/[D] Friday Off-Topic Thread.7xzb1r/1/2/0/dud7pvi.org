Yeah it took longer for me to get invested than it did with Worm or Pact. I think I really sank into it by the end of arc 3.

As for its grimdarkness, I can only assume you're referring to the world itself rather than the events? In which case yeah, it's definitely the world I'd want to live in the least of the 3, but the characters and plot are really much more up beat.
