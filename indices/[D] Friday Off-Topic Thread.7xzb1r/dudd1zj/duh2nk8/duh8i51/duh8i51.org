[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwSvkR_Co3o][What I'm doing with it]], if you're interested. I'm mostly just playing around with sounds at this point.

There's some problems with the "fixed" version.

It wasn't fitting in time properly so I tried cutting off part of the "sss" at the beginning of the first word to fix it, and the fix ended up being that that slice needed to be moved a single step backwards to just before the beginning.

Also, the last three words have a very wobbly quality to them because they were much longer than the rest of the notes but I smooshed them into being the same length as their counterparts in other lines, I'll need to re-stretch them and time them differently so the last word starts at the beginning of the next measure.

There are other little problems with it, and I'm not happy with the overall tonal quality, but it should serve to illustrate the difference. Every beat in the measure is typically the same length, and the length of the beats in the original was all over the place. I said "28 slices" the other day because that's how many slices are in the final product, but it was actually over 40 because I thought I could cut up whole words and I ended up having to re-slice every full word into its constituent syllables because it was just /that/ loose.
