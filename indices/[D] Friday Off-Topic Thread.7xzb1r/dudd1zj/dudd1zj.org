Has anyone else used phenibut?

The second time I used it, I took too much (on purpose, /for science/) and it caused a weird sort of intoxication that felt somewhat like drunkenness, but I took it appropriately the first time I used it and just felt a mood boost and /focus/ and /motivation/, like, I spent two straight hours cutting up an old vocal sample that was recorded without a metronome (Stay Awake from Mary Poppins) into 28 little slices (ie every syllable in the verse) and stretching them all and reconstructing the verse to force it into maintaining a consistent tempo. I've done that sort of thing before (I'm pretty sure metronomes weren't invented until the mid '90s (/that's sarcasm/)), but it's very boring and I'd typically work on that part of the project a little bit at a time over a period of days.

It seems useful. You can only use it once every few days because tolerance builds up quickly (like, if you take the same amount three days in a row you might feel literally nothing at all the third day, so you're only supposed to take a recreational dose once a week or a therapeutic dose two or three times a week), so I'm not going to be able to take it again until Monday or Tuesday, but I'm pretty satisfied with how it affects working on music so I'm going to try working on writing the next time I take it.
