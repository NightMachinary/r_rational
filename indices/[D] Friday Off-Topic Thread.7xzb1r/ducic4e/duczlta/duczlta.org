[[/r/datahoarder][r/datahoarder]] lives and breathes for this stuff, if anyone is interested.

  Reminder: A hard drive can fail at any time. A hard drive also can be stolen. Back up your information to a secondary internal hard drive /and/ to a portable hard drive, or resign yourself to the eventual fate of begging on 4chan for a pale facsimile of the decade's worth of pornographic images that you've irretrievably lost.

This is insufficient for any data that you really care about. RAID can make backing up to a second hard drive automatic (basically), and a disconnected portable drive makes accidental deletions rather difficult, but if you don't have an off-site backup then you are still vulnerable to fire, theft, flood, or other calamity that affects your physical location. Cloud backup services are rather popular, and if that doesn't work for you for whatever reason then you can also store a hard drive in some off-site secure location.

I'm toying with the idea of storing a hard drive in a local bank's safe deposit box, but that's still in the planning stages for me. If anyone has feedback on that, I'd love to hear it.
