Speaking as an author who has written and published something on the order of 2,000,000 words of entertainment (most of it free) for you, this subreddit, and/or the internet at large: I find your post intensely offensive. Saying that authors "cannot be trusted" to leave work online implies that you have a /right/ to that work. You do not. We do not have an obligation to create it for you, nor to ensure that it continues being available.

I suppose I should check: Do you understand that you do not have the right to compel me, or any other author, to write free fiction for your entertainment? Given that fact, why do you feel you have the right to compel me to make fiction available online?

As if the above weren't bad enough, your insinuation that an author is 'cowardly' for taking something down borders on the delusional. It's possible that you have some specific knowledge of this particular author, but that is not implied in your post; far more likely is that you're making assumptions. You have no idea what might be happening in the life of an author that would inspire them to take a work down. Perhaps their pseudonym has been doxxed, they are applying for a job, and they don't want something embarrassing being attached to their name. Perhaps the work was something from early in their career and they don't want its poor quality to turn people off from their later works. Perhaps the story featured a clear expy of a prior sweetheart and the author's new sweetheart would prefer it not be out there. Perhaps they got a warning from the site mods for violating site policies and they don't want their account banned. Perhaps they got a take-down notice on their fanfic and don't want to be sued.

I strongly suggest you re-evaluate your feelings on this issue or, at the very least, the way you express them.
