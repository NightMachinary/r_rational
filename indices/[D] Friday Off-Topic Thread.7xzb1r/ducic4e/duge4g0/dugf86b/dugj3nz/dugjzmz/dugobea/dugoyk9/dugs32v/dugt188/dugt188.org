  This conversation has never been about an author sending takedown notices---you are introducing that idea, and I suspect it's in order to move the goalposts instead of engaging with the point I'm actually making.
#+end_quote

- Author removes his story from the Internet but explicitly gives permission for someone else to reupload it\\
- Author removes his story from the Internet but doesn't bother to send takedown notices when someone else reuploads the story\\
- Author removes his story from the Internet and sends takedown notices when someone else reuploads the story\\
- Author removes his story from the Internet and immediately takes legal action when someone else reuploads the story

Sure, you can represent this as moving the goalposts. It's all part of one big continuum.

  You admit that there are valid reasons to take down a story. I'm guessing, however, that you still believe that you should be the one who gets to decide whether something is "the flimsiest of reasons" or whether it's valid.

Definitely. Let's consider the following hypothetical scenario:\\
- Big Yud solicits donations for HPMoR.\\
- Rowling forces him to stop with a takedown notice.\\
- Big Yud notifies people who would have donated to him that Rowling has forbidden this activity.\\
- In such a case, the fault obviously lies, not with Yudkowsky (pbuh), but with Rowling and with Congress. Expecting Big Yud to defy the law would be ridiculous, given the large penalties that he would risk.

However, this line of reasoning can only go so far. Even if people who send whining messages bear /some/ of the culpability for Tozette's removal of /Hit the Ground Running/, expecting an author to defy a bunch of whiners on the Internet---[[https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/285670822264307712][hardly any penalty at all]]---is eminently reasonable.
