  - Alfred has no right to tell Beatrice to destroy her copy of the basketball. Why should he? How does Beatrice's being able to enjoy the copied basketball impair Alfred's ownership of the original basketball in any way?

This conversation has never been about an author sending takedown notices -- you are introducing that idea, and I suspect it's in order to move the goalposts instead of engaging with the point I'm actually making. I have literally said that you should be able to go ahead and download a story. What we're talking about is your belief that /your/ preferences place some sort of obligation on /me/. I'm fine with people downloading stories, and as a general rule I disapprove of takedown notices.[1]

  They have an obligation to not take it down for the flimsiest of reasons, at least.

Ah, good. You admit that there are valid reasons to take down a story. Progress! I'm guessing, however, that you still believe that you should be the one who gets to decide whether something is "the flimsiest of reasons" or whether it's valid.

[1] Authors do /have/ the right to send takedown notices, and there are legal situations that can require sending one in order to not lose certain rights. As a general rule I think takedown notices are counterproductive and in poor taste, but I still support the author's legal right to them.
