I recently had the pleasure of re-reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24337][/Ella Enchanted/]], which is a very fun book. I have to say, however, that I definitely have come to view it in a new light in the decade or so since I first read it. Consider this absolutely /salacious/ passage from the very first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  My first awareness of [the curse of obedience to direct orders that the fairy Lucinda laid on me at my birth] came on my fifth birthday.[...]

  Mandy cut the cake. When she handed me my piece, she said without thinking, "Eat."

  The first bite was delicious. I finished the slice happily. When it was gone, Mandy cut another. That one was harder. When it was gone, no one gave me more, but I knew I had to keep eating. I moved my fork into the cake itself.[...]

  I felt sick, and frightened. Why couldn't I stop eating?

  Swallowing was a struggle. Each bite weighed on my tongue and felt like a sticky mass of glue as I fought to get it down. I started crying while I ate.
#+end_quote

Compare any of a zillion pieces of erotic literature that cater to the "feeding" or "stuffing" fetish* (/e.g./, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/253540][/Feedbag/]], [[http://fav.me/d9sk1u3][/Mari's Most Amazing Stuffing/]], [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/37363][/Cupcakes Redux/]], [[https://komperaklause.deviantart.com/art/Gretel-Part-1-564500523][/Gretel/]]...). If you ignore the first quoted sentence**, it's practically identical! Later chapters of the story indulge in similar [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Fetish_Fuel][fetish fuel]], in similarly-lurid detail: at various points in the story, Ella (/inter alia/) imagines being ordered to cook herself alive, is ordered by one of her future "ugly stepsisters" to starve herself, and is ordered by the fairy who cursed her to be happy about the curse.

*(at least, the ones that aren't just thinly-veiled inflation-fetish material)

**(or if you're a fan of loli hentai)

Reminder: "Content creators" /cannot/ be trusted to refrain from making their content inaccessible. If you care about having the opportunity to reÃ«xperience a story, a let's-play series, or a video review twenty years in the future, download a copy of it. Don't rely on third-party archives like [[http://fictionhunt.com/][FictionHunt]], either---they can go down at any time!

Do you have any horror stories of being unable to find a deleted work? I can remember two stories that I wish I'd saved: /Yes, Minister/ ([[#s][one-shot]] and /The Burning Stone Ruins/ ([[#s][short story]]).

I have in my collection at least one major story that was deleted by a cowardly author---[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9408516][/Hit the Ground Running/]]. I also saved my favorites out of [[https://fimfetch.net/?q=&a=Ebony+Horn][Megapone's pornographic pony stories]] before he deleted his FIMFiction account.

Reminder: A hard drive can fail at any time. A hard drive also can be stolen. Back up your information to a secondary internal hard drive /and/ to a portable hard drive, or resign yourself to the eventual fate of begging on 4chan for a pale facsimile of the decade's worth of pornographic images that you've irretrievably lost.
