  (Just for calibration: you wouldn't actually get 2K readers from [[/r/rational]]; a best case scenario for a "new" work would be 1.5K people check it out, most of them don't read it, you get 20-30 upvotes, and less than 20 comments unless you say something really inflammatory or make mistakes. Posting your own synopsis as a comment when you post the link helps, because a lot of people go to the comments to see whether the link is worth clicking.)

Thankyou so much for your help last month, the thread has now been posted and I am honoured that I have met the "best case scenario" as far as comments and upvotes go that you mentioned! Your advice and support was very valuable so thank you!
