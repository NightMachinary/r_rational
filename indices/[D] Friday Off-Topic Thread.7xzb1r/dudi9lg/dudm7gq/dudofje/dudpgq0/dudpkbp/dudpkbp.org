  Posting your own synopsis as a comment when you post the link helps, because a lot of people go to the comments to see whether the link is worth clicking.

I never would have thought of that, thank you! Should I do a synopsis of the whole story (you know... back cover blurb) each time, or is it more "in this chapter you find out the secret behind Mrs Flogglebottom's strange behaviour..." or is it more "what did you think of the Big Reveal that Mrs Flogglebottom [spoiler tag: was a robot all along]" stuff?
