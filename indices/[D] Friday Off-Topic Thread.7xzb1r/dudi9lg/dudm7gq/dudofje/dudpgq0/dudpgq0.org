Hrm. That's really tough to say. My best guess is that AO3 has about half the audience that FictionPress does, based mostly on comparing "most Favorites" and "most Kudos (Original Work)", which are roughly equivalent and won't double-count users.

The more important thing is where you "advertise"; [[/r/rational]] has 8.5K subscribers, which translates to maybe 2K visitors a day, and that would probably be your primary audience intake (if you posted here), dwarfing the flow of readers that come from within either FP or AO3, especially given the biases against new works (people don't want to risk reading something crappy, so mostly gravitate toward established works).

(Just for calibration: you wouldn't actually get 2K readers from [[/r/rational]]; a *best case* scenario for a "new" work would be 1.5K people check it out, most of them don't read it, you get 20-30 upvotes, and less than 20 comments unless you say something really inflammatory or make mistakes. Posting your own synopsis as a comment when you post the link helps, because a lot of people go to the comments to see whether the link is worth clicking.)
