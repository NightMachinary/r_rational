  The more important thing is where you "advertise"; [[/r/rational]] has 8.5K subscribers, which translates to maybe 2K visitors a day, and that would probably be your primary audience intake (if you posted here), dwarfing the flow of readers that come from within either FP or AO3, especially given the biases against new works (people don't want to risk reading something crappy, so mostly gravitate toward established works).

For the record, my readership on Two Year Emperor went up /enormously/ when it first got posted to [[/r/rational]]. That may have been a function of it being my first story posted online and not having very good marketing, but I suspect about 90% of my traffic came from here.
