Those are two of my favorite, along with the [[https://youtu.be/gai8dMA19Sw][exoplanets songs]]. It's worth mentioning that all the videos have really excellent animation in addition to their lyrical and musical aesthetics. Bohemian Gravity, the first popular song he did, has some extremely impressive video editing. Entropic Time is rather amazing as well, since he did the whole lip syncing backwards, and it still looks good.
