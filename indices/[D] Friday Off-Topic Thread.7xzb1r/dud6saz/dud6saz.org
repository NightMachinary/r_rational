One of the best YouTube channels I know is [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTev4RNBiu6lqtx8z1e87fQ][A Capella Science]], which makes both excellent music and excellent science. I recommend jumping in at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqReeTV_vk][Evo-Devo]], but there are more than a few good choices. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8FAJXPBdOg][The Molecular Shape of You]] is another favourite.
