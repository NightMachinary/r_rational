Okay I've decided - after being inspired by a [[https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/project-management/how-to-overcome-perfectionism][podcast of all things]] - to start posting my still-in-editing-stages supernatural romance story to this sub. I'll be posting it under an author pseudonym account, because I'd like to keep my "writings" seperate from my regular Reddit activity to avoid a Ken Bone situation.

It'll be released one chapter a month with an interlude after each chapter (so every month, a chapter; in the middle of the month, a one-page interlude). This is slow but I want to make it achievable, and if I end up finishing my editing earlier than expected I'll be able to speed up the schedule, and I'd rather do that than wait another ~year before I post anything at all. By starting to post before I've finished editing there's always a risk I'll "fade" but you know... authors have done that before and if I abandon the project altogether I can post my "passable draft" level chapters to give people some closure.

*QUESTION*: So.... where's a good website to post original fiction? Ideally I'd love a platform where you can pick up an audience passively like you can on fanfiction.net or whatever since you know, everyone loves attention. I've got an AO3 account which you can apparently post original stuff on, but I'm not sure it's the best place. Or I can pick up a free blog, or even tumblr(??? do people post serial fiction on tumblr?). Would have to be somewhere that let me retain the copyright though.

It's a romance novel with vampires, set in the 1940s, trying to write it rational (worldbuilding is very thorough, no "LET ME EXPLAIN!" moments), very little in the way of adult content - there's sex but it's the "he held his love and they kissed *** the next morning, they snuggled in bed together" sort of discretion, rather than being pornographic. I have a few pictures (one at the beginning of each chapter), but they're not required, but it'd be good to be able to insert them.
