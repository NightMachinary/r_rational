Thank you very much for this breakdown, I really appreciate it!

Things like sufficient velocity / spacebattles / etc, would they have a problem with me not participating in the community in any meaningful way - i.e. just using it to promote my stuff (and I guess... chat with anyone who comments on my stuff)?

  it may be sort of demoralizing seeing your work lose out against "cheesy self insert wish fulfilment fantasy written for tweens #2423."

I've got one of those I wrote when I was 14! (Well, two: it's the same story from two different PoVs).

Enjoy, if anyone can handle the sheer horrible tween wish fulfillment of it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/269894/Vera3]]

  very specific demographic (LN/WN fans) that might not go all-in on the paranormal-romance aspect

(after googling LW/WN): Does it help that I originally described it as a yaoi but ultimately dropped that because there wasn't enough "shirtless horseback riding" as one reviewer put it? In other words, it's a story with two cute men kissing a lot that's written by a straight woman? (I suppose that's for "the market" to decide).

After all this I think I'll follow your advice and after going over the privacy policies for each site, post at a variety of them and see which I get the most attention on.
