  Things like sufficient velocity / spacebattles / etc, would they have a problem with me not participating in the community in any meaningful way - i.e. just using it to promote my stuff (and I guess... chat with anyone who comments on my stuff)?

Nah, they won't care as long as you stick to the site rules. That being said, you significantly increase the exposure of your story by having it in your sig and frequenting threads you enjoy, so people can see, "hey, what this person says is interesting, maybe I should check out their stories."

  I've got one of those I wrote when I was 14! (Well, two: it's the same story from two different PoVs).

I judge, but I was pretty bad in my time too :P I've since deleted (I think) 2 incomplete, terrible fics, but I've left my complete, terrible fics on my ff.net profile (worldmerge: part 1, worldmerge: part 2) out of some misplaced sense of obligation to my middle school self.

  (after googling LW/WN): Does it help that I originally described it as a yaoi but ultimately dropped that because there wasn't enough "shirtless horseback riding" as one reviewer put it? In other words, it's a story with two cute men kissing a lot that's written by a straight woman? (I suppose that's for "the market" to decide).

From what I've seen, LNs (and by extension, WNs) are primarily targeted towards boys. And certainly, the ones that are are the ones that get the most traction here in the west. If you go to kissmanga.com and just idly look at the covers of the "recently updated" manga, chances are, anything with "isekai" or "xianxia" in its name is a.) a light novel (or WN) adaptation and b.) clearly marketed towards young men via the character art.

From what I've seen, the female-marketed stuff tends to be korean and japanese webcomics such as can be found on [[http://www.webtoons.com/en/][webtoons]] and [[https://tapas.io/comics][tapas]].

No clue where the division came from, but I'd wager it's at least partially from the fact that there are a /lot/ of LGBT friendly and female-targeted western webcomics already (as the print comic market is/was dominated by stuff marketed towards straight males), so the stuff that gains traction here is the stuff that appealed to the preexisting webcomic readership.
