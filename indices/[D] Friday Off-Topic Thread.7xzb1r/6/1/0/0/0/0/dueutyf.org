  I notice you're talking about manga and webcomics now: are the LN/WN sites only for... mangas and webcomics? To be clear this is text-only. Do sites like webtoons and tapas exclusively cater to comics or...?

LNs and WNs are often adapted into manga and anime. The point I'm making is that, if the market the adaptations cater to is representative of the market the source material caters to, then any site with lots of LN/WN readers is unlikely to be in the same demographic your story will appeal to.

On the flipside, if you can figure out where the readers of korean/japanese webcomics (and to a lesser extent, western webcomics) frequent, then they're prime targets for your story.

Though I apologize for letting this discussion get a little bit away from me...
