As alexanderwales mentioned, royalroadl is quite popular, and from what I've seen has a decent publishing featureset. That being said, its readership is a very specific demographic (LN/WN fans) that might not go all-in on the paranormal-romance aspect, so YMMV.

Wattpad, on the flipside, has a readership likely to be much more receptive to your work, as they're generally fans of romance. That being said, wattpad's readership has very, /very/ low standards for quality, so it may be sort of demoralizing seeing your work lose out against "cheesy self insert wish fulfilment fantasy written for tweens #2423."

AO3 has exactly the demographic and featureset you want, although I don't think the "original work" section is frequented as much. Make sure, if you post there, to abuse their tagging so people using the search function have the highest chance of stumbling on your story.

Alternatively, you crosspost to a forum in the Sufficient Velocity/Spacebattles/Alternate History Forums/ Questionable Questing network, but keep in mind that, aside from the last one, their mods are infamously prudish, so you'd either have to self-censor to host directly on their forums, or have a thread where you post links to new chapters (as I've seen Omnicron do for their work [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/should-the-sun-not-rise-urban-fantasy-updates-sundays.41717/][Should the Sun not Rise]] and simply don't post links to chapters that would get mod attention drawn onto you. The target demographic of your work will be few and far between on those forums, but it's a relatively low-effort way to promote and get discussion for your work.

And of course, since it's your IP, you're not required to stick to one posting location. I crossposted my fanfic across AO3, fanfiction.net, and SB, with my readership split about evenly across ff.net and AO3 (favoring ff.net of course), and a readership a fifth of the size of my AO3 reading on SB.
