AO3 is great, with the exception that you can't instantly create an account, which I think limits readership to some extent. FictionPress (and the sister site, FanFiction.net) have terrible UI, weird quirks, and are generally unpleasant to use. The workflow is, simply put, bad, and the options for formatting are extremely limited.

Posting to a blog hides your work away somewhat, and probably won't have features that a lot of web fiction readers have come to know and love, meaning more work on your end to get it up and running. It can work, if you want to put in that effort, but you still don't get to tap into the larger audiences that you'd get with a big site.

Royal Road is one of the other big sites, but I don't use it, either as a reader or a writer. It's fairly big, and other people seem to like it, so ... included here for the sake of completeness (though I'm leaving a lot of the other platforms off).

Other than that, there are a few big forums like Sufficient Velocity, Space Battles, Questionable Questing, etc. where people gather to read and talk about fiction. I generally stay away from them, because I spent a decade growing to hate almost everything about how phpbb tends to work in large communities. Might be for you; cultures vary between them.

*tl;dr: I'd recommend AO3.*
