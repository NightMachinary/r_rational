Yeah, back cover blurb, two or three sentences, don't spoil anything too major. The first chapter you post is the most important to have that for, since that's where people have almost zero information. You can use the same synopsis every time, since it's mostly there for the undecideds that are coming to the comments for a more objective take on what the work is about and whether or not it's worth reading. You don't really need to worry /that/ much about hooking the people who have already read the first chapter.

Ideally, you get a snowball effect, and people will start reading because /other people/ are reading, there's some activity in the comments, or people have seen it posted enough times that you can finally catch them when they're bored, or they've just been exposed to the title so much that it's sticking in their brain.
