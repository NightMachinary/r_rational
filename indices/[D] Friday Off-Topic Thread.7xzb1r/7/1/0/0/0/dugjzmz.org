  You failed to comprehend my point: *You do not have a right to this story.* This story is not yours in any way.

Once the author has made it publicly available, /he/ has no right to the story. It becomes an entity totally independent of him.

  Imagine the equivalent in a sports setting: "If you bring a basketball to the court so that we can have a pickup game, then you have to leave the basketball on the court permanently."

El oh el! Since when are basketballs infinitely reproducible? Let me fix that metaphor for you.\\
- Alfred has invented a new pattern of basketball skin that makes the ball easier to grip.\\
- Alfred uploads the pattern to the Internet.\\
- Various people download the pattern and use their 3D printers to enjoy using it.\\
- Some people berate Alfred for uploading the pattern in a format that's incompatible with their 3D printers.\\
- To avoid the harassment, Alfred takes down his copy of the pattern from the Internet.\\
- Beatrice notices that the pattern can't be found on the Internet, and reuploads it (still crediting Alfred as the original creator).\\
- Alfred tells Beatrice to take down the pattern.\\
- Beatrice tells Alfred to go fly a kite, because the benefit of keeping the pattern available for people to use obviously outweighs the detriment of Alfred's having to delete abusive messages from his inbox /by a vast margin/. Just because she's feeling nice, though, she deletes the attribution from her copy of the pattern, so she no longer is contributing to any annoyance that Alfred is experiencing.

(People laugh long and loudly at metaphors of the kind that you just spouted when they're used in discussions of copyright, if you weren't aware.)
