I barely know how to respond to this post...you start off by saying that once an author releases a work he loses all rights to it, which is exactly wrong. You follow up with a metaphor that is incoherent and not related to anything we've been discussing as far as I can tell. You finish with a point about copyright, despite the fact that your entire thesis is that authors do not have the right to control distribution of their works, which is exactly what copyright is. Note that copyright even goes farther: copyright means that not only do I have the right to stop distributing my work, I have the right to tell /you/ to not redistribute it.

Just to check that there's no miscommunication:

- My understanding of your position is "authors are allowed to keep their work completely private but if they ever put it online then they lose all rights to the story and have an obligation to keep it online, for free, permanently."\\
- I think you probably understand that this is exactly opposite to how the law works.

Given the above, I guess you're making a moral argument? "I think the world should work like this because it is more in accord with my preferences for receiving free entertainment that I can enjoy whenever I want for as long as I want"?
