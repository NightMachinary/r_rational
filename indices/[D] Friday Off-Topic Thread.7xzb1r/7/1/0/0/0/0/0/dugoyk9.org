  You follow up with a metaphor that is incoherent and not related to anything we've been discussing as far as I can tell.
#+end_quote

It seems pretty relevant to me. Here's a better version (since I think I accidentally wrote an example rather than a metaphor in my previous comment):\\
- Alfred brings a basketball to the playground.\\
- Beatrice uses a replicator to make a perfect copy of that basketball.\\
- Alfred has no right to tell Beatrice to destroy her copy of the basketball. Why should he? How does Beatrice's being able to enjoy the copied basketball impair Alfred's ownership of the original basketball in any way?

See also [[https://i.imgur.com/BmvXY3j.png][this 4chan screenshot]]. It's surprisingly accurate:\\
- Beatrice makes a clone of Alfred's ten-year-old son Charlie-1, with the intent of locking Charlie-2 in her basement and torturing him.\\
- Alfred has no right to demand that Beatrice release the clone to Alfred's custody. Why should he? How does Beatrice's torturing Charlie-2 impair Alfred's ownership of Charlie-1 in any way?

  My understanding of your position is "authors are allowed to keep their work completely private but if they ever put it online then they lose all rights to the story and have an obligation to keep it online, for free, permanently."

They have an obligation to not take it down for the flimsiest of reasons, at least. I wouldn't say that, if FanFiction.Net deletes a story for its own arbitrary reasons, the author has to reupload it elsewhere. In that case, it's FFN's fault, not the author's, that the story was made inaccessible.

  I think you probably understand that this is exactly opposite to how the law works.

[[https://questioncopyright.org/what_we_lose_when_we_embrace_copyright][More or less.]] A system that allows Rowling to send copyright notices removing all copies of HPMoR from the Internet seems pretty pathetic.
