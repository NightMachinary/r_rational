Also, who said anything about "free"? I've paid many hundreds of dollars for DRM-free GURPS PDFs and GOG games that I could have pirated with ease. Contrary to what you apparently assume, I don't even know how to /use/ a torrenting application.

I probably would pay $20 to ShaperV for /Time Braid/. I /did/ pay $7 to +Big Yud+ MIRI for +HPMoR+ that e-book that so conveniently was released right after HPMoR ended.
