  I never suggested that creators had any obligation to create. Likewise, I don't think that a creator has an obligation to make his works accessible (though it's a closer case). However, I tend to disdain a creator that, having once made his work accessible, tries to take back what he's already given.

The level of entitlement in your post is beyond belief.

You failed to comprehend my point: *You do not have a right to this story.* This story is not yours in any way. You have no legal rights to it, you have no moral rights to it...you have no rights to it, period. You have no stake in it and no say in what happens to it. It is not the author's obligation to create it, or to post it, or to maintain it online. If you want permanent access to it then you can download it, but you do not have the right to infringe on the author's liberty because you're too lazy to click the 'download' button.

As to the case of Tozette: no, that is not even close to cowardly. Imagine the following equivalent scenario: you walk up to Tozette on the street and say to her "Hey, I've just created this email account for you. It's going to be flooded by whining, demanding, unpleasant people every day. I insist that you sit and read this account and if you decide you'd rather not then you're a coward." That's what you're claiming here: That Tozette is a coward because she doesn't want to put up with insulting messages from the internet. And, before you claim that the messages weren't insulting: think again. Having actually published things that people wanted a continuation to, I can say with certainty that the average internet denizen does not, shall we say, make requests in a constructive fashion.

Honestly, your assertion leaves me slack-jawed. Imagine the equivalent in a sports setting: "If you +post a story online+ bring a basketball to the court so that +people can read it+ we can have a pickup game, then you have to leave the +story+ basketball on the +internet+ court permanently."
