  Do you understand that you do not have the right to compel me, or any other author, to write free fiction for your entertainment? Given that fact, why do you feel you have the right to compel me to make fiction available online?

I never suggested that creators had any obligation to /create/. Likewise, I don't think that a creator has an obligation to /make/ his works accessible (though it's a closer case). However, I tend to disdain a creator that, having once made his work accessible, tries to /take back what he's already given/.

  As if the above weren't bad enough, your insinuation that an author is 'cowardly' for taking something down borders on the delusional. It's possible that you have some specific knowledge of this particular author, but that is not implied in your post; far more likely is that you're making assumptions.

IIRC (I searched for any explanation made by the author when I noticed that the story had been deleted---though I may be misremembering what I found, since this occurred a year or three ago), the author in question (Tozette) specifically said (IIRC, on one of her multiple Tumblr accounts---though, again, I may be misremembering) that she'd deleted the story (which ends on a cliffhanger) because people were constantly demanding a continuation. Deleting /an entire story/ because of /whiny messages/ seems pretty indisputably cowardly.
