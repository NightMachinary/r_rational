last place i expected to see easy allies brought up.

well maybe RL is last place, but still. close.

But I can relate pretty well to that sentiment. And oh boy what a backlog you have now. i just feel like writing this stuff dont feel particularly inclined to read it

- The podcast is probably the most reliable content they produce, but it's meant to be topical (about news) so idk how much you get out of it.
- Easy Update is probably the most swingy, with some episodes being a bit dull imo (gameplays and walk&talks) with others being some of the best content they've put out imo (animal crossing, OY, the interview)
- Any of Don's videos is gold (don's discount gaming and don the beat), but there aren't many
- Hall of Greats has become a central element of the EZA mythos
- Reviews are reviews
- Brandon Plays Pokemon is a really great and unique /experience/
- Betting specials are as good as ever
- Huber +hype+syndrome was never my cup of tea, but its still enjoyable
- tabletop escapades was really good for a while in s1 but i think it dragged on a bit (just my opinion). s2 is brilliant so far.
