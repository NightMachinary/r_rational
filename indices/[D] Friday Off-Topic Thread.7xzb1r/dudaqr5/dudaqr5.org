Just minutes ago, one of my friends on Facebook posted [[https://youtu.be/K7Kf5NeAJ-k][a short video about Ni No Kuni 2]] by the YouTube channel [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZrxXp1reP8E353rZsB3jaA][Easy Allies]], which I had never heard of, and I want to talk about how much discovering it means to me. Btw, it's a good video and I think the game looks promising even as someone who didn't like the first Ni No Kuni.

GameTrailers.com was my introduction to gamer culture and game analysis, I followed their reviews religiously during my teens and I was heartbroken when they shut down. Now it turns out that the voice of their reviews, Brandon Jones, has been here all this time and is still doing what got me into gaming in the first place. Hearing him again is like reconnecting with an old friend.

Not only do I get to hear him review games again, with a backlog of hundreds, there is a whole community to dive into that includes podcasts about anime and tabletop gaming...so was this handcrafted specifically for me or something? It feels like I was just handed a homemade gift by someone who knows me better than I know myself. I'm still in shock.
