That was a really satisfying conclusion, but I can't wait for more.

I'm glad Tasia's back again, I like her character and want to see more of her. She was sort of peripheral character this volume since she, while she was important to both Ana and Wes' character arcs, she wasn't involved in all the shady merc stuff. She's definitely clued into things now, though, which means I suspect she'll be a more central character in the second volume. Plus she brought Cardamom with her, which is nice.

Speaking of Tasia, I'm noticing that Ana's still refering to her as "Tasia" and using female pronouns. Normally, that would be the correct thing to do, except I don't know that Tasia actually identifies as female? She wore a female chassis and took a female name because she was replacing Wes in the role of "Rowyna Ebbridge's daughter," but in her interlude she seemed to identify pretty consistently with whatever chassis she was wearing, and she's currently wearing her original male body. This is an understandable thing for Ana to do, of course, since she only got to know Tasia after she'd ousted Wes, but it's still probably something that should be addressed. Funnily enough, Tasia probably has/had a similar issue with Ana, since she only knew her as "Ernest."

I am super fucking hyped for this. Don't get me wrong, I've really been enjoying the political elements of the story and the revolutionary drama, but in the wake of Commonplace's failure and all the main characters deciding "actually, fuck Paragon," I am entirely ready for the story to shift gears and focus more on the background weirdness of the setting. We've had repeated hints of weird shit in this world that everyone actually living in it seems to take for granted (oracle snakes, the lack of stars, everything about the ocean, etc.), and every one of them has only made me grow more and more curious about what the /fuck/ is happening. It's about damn time people start looking for some answers.

On the subject of weird background shit...

  Above, to the two moons shining overhead. Two full moons, or close to it.

Have we seen mention of the fact that there are two moons before? It's such a subtle thing that it might have come up before and I just missed it.
