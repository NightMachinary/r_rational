I remember something of two moons before yes.

Edit: Some google-fu gives me several mentions of it "I stared up at the night sky, and the *twin crescent moons* overhead." from 10-B "She stood over me, a shadow blocking out the *light of the moons*." from as early as 1-D Also, 8-B and C, and 12-C mention them, and those are from Grace and Florecen's POVs
