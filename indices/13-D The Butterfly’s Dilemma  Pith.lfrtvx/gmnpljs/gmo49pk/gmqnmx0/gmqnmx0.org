Nixing protection rackets seems like an incredibly bad idea. Because the concept runs both ways, with the business also being protected from criminal rivals. By getting rid of them Ana risks either:

a. The businesses getting snapped up by rival gangs and mobs, leaving a power vacuum into which violence can flow. The winner may have a far less normal-people friendly mentality than commonplace. Or Paragon might clamp down and in doing so increase their hold over society. Both options will leave a ton of collateral damage and risk rising tensions on the streets.

b. The businesses turning harder to the government for protection, handing Paragon even more political support, with a socioeconomic class who have historically been some of the key demographics of nationalist authoritarianism and militarism. (From a more useless perspective, keeping protection rackets might help surpress this political dynamic)

Honestly, this highlights how the squeamishness towards illegal activity held by... centrists (I guess?) like Ana can be real unhelpful. Because sure, on the spherical cow face of it organized crime is bad. But at the same time if you have a government that wants to increasingly jackboot the lower classes, with no bottom-up power building tolerated, what are normal people to do?

Now aiding and abetting a mafia is one thing, but the general mentality of washing your hands of people who resist oppression the second they break the law, even if it's the only way their resistance can survive, inherently biases your perspective and actions towards the government whether you want it to or not.

Also for fuck's sake if you're worried about exploitation of prostitution change the structure of it to give the actual sex workers more control. All nixing it entirely does is dump a lot of them out in the street to be snapped up by other gangs.
