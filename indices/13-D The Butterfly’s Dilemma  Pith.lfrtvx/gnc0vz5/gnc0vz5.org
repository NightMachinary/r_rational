  The Butterfly's Dilemma
#+end_quote

Let's talk about this title. The Butterfly/Caterpillar's Dilemma.

What the hell does that mean?

The point of the anecdote is that, no matter what you do, sometimes you're in a situation where you've have a very high probability of getting preyed on before you can get into a good situation. It's a great metaphor and all.

But how is it a /dilemma/? It's not the caterpillar can choose /not/ to go into a cocoon and potentially get eaten, can it? So why this specific name?

The people demands answers!

(although I just noticed the symmetry of arc titles and it's great; I thought the author had just reused the same arc title twice)

  I leaned back, bathed in warm sunlight, and Left-Hira massaged shampoo into my hair, just like they did in fancy salons. [...] Her experienced touch felt relaxing, easy.
#+end_quote

Reading paragraphs like this, it's a little hard to remember that Hira is actually an incompetent slob when she's not actively leeching skills from various experts.

  Thinking of those last two made my chest ache. Wes won. He'd become Lady Ebbridge again. And I wouldn't be seeing him again for a long, long time. If at all.
#+end_quote

Why? It would be easy enough to arrange a meeting through dead drops.

  “So be it,” I said. “I don't want to be a mob boss. I don't even know if I want to take Tunnel Vision's identity.”
#+end_quote

Yeah, honestly you haven't taken any of the steps that would be necessary to make the transition smoothly. It feels like Hira is a lot more attached to the "impersonate Tunnel Vision" idea than Ana is.

  “You want to get your throat slit?” said Left-Hira, running her fingers through my hair. “Want to get your eyes put out and your skin pan-fried with onions?”
#+end_quote

Nah, you could always loot whatever stashes TV had left, steal from the lieutenants' personal mansions, and start over in a new country.

I mean, they already considered doing that a few chapters ago, and most of the reasons they couldn't (eg Ana dying) have been fixed.

They do need to save Jun, though.

  “Grace kept good records, right?” I said. “We can use those to determine the most morally bankrupt members of her organization.”
#+end_quote

Okay, so let's get this straight:

- After an encounter with a known illusionist, Tunnel Vision showed up brutally injured, then dropped off the map, and nobody has been able to talk to her, except a few henchmen who only get to talk to an unknown lieutenant who nobody has seen before but knows all their secret codes.
- Most of their funds have been sunk into a revolution which, if I'm reading between the lines, a large part of the mob wasn't that ideologically attached to. Most of their money-making activities are on hold while TV is giving no sign of life.
- After recovering, TV's only moves have been to buy a train ticket, get a haircut, put up missing cat posters everywhere, and talk to a low-level lieutenant. She has made no visible attempt to contact Maxine Clive or any of her allies.
- Ana now intends to start methodically murdering members of her organization, and hope that the others don't react or demand that TV protect them.
- And she also intends to tell them to cut most of their revenue sources for ethical reasons after they spent all their money backing a failed revolution (and apparently some lieutenants have lost everything they had).

Keeping in mind that Ana has neither the personality of TV, the callous violence required to keep a violent mob in line, nor the ultra-powerful vocation to pull of the kind of plans that TV could do...

I'm having a really hard time imagining how Ana can possibly hope to fool lieutenants that have known TV for years, secret codes or not. Some of them have to be pretty pissed they still haven't gotten orders or news while Paragon is cracking down on them.

And even if she fools them, I can't see her maintaining their loyalty for any length of time. The mobsters so far have been described as mercenary, motivated by profit and by fear of Tunnel Vision; even if Ana starts murdering anyone who steps out of line, they'll still want to work for someone who pays them.

  “The Symphony Knight.” According to a local newspaper, Lady Corbin was already planning a live concert for the piece she'd composed during that battle.

Bits like this remind you how disconnected from it all Paragon is.

  The Neke had a tradition, with the invention of fabricated bodies
#+end_quote

Is it really a tradition if it's less than 20 years old?

#+begin_quote
  This was like that. Even though the language fit, even though the words and sentences seemed normal, I couldn't understand any of them. When I squinted at them, I could sometimes make out individual letters, one at a time, out of order, but couldn't string them together into anything coherent.
#+end_quote

Interesting.

I wonder if you could brute-force your way out of that, SCP-style?

You could try to decode one letter at a time, in a way that lets you figure out words.

I'm not sure what the exact mechanics are. On the one hand, the magic has to be in the information, not the printed book, otherwise the Spirit Block wouldn't work.

On the other hand, the Spirit Block doesn't block /every single word/ that figured in their holy text; like, presumably, if the 99 precepts include the world "you", then people can still say "you", just no in the concept of reciting the precepts. So you could still transcribe individual words.

Maybe you would have to do it with multiple people, so that each of them doesn't hold enough information that the magic knows to censor it?

  Even today, just one storm kraken could still rip apart merchant ships, and the occasional military submarine. Anything less than a battleship, and captains needed to steer clear of hurricanes, and the monsters that came with them.
#+end_quote

I love that bit of worldbuilding =D

#+begin_quote
  They'd been laid out in some sort of strange pattern. Tentacles and eyes and chunks of their bodies had been sliced off and rearranged.

  Together, they formed a massive triangle. Then, a smaller triangle, of the same shape, flipped upside down and placed inside, dividing the larger one into four separate triangles.

  Even smaller triangles had been placed in those ones as well, dividing them up. And triangles within their triangles, and so on, getting more and more minuscule, as far as the eye could see.

  The sky was full of oracle snakes. Hundreds of them, maybe thousands. Small ones, the size of a man, and massive ones, larger than this house. Larger than most ships I'd seen. They wound their flat coils back and forth under the night sky, silent, floating high above the ocean. Each of them had Akhara's Triangle on their scales.

  The oracle snakes were looking at us.

  All of them had turned in our direction, staring down with tiny, pitch-black eyes. Not at Elmidde, not at Paragon Academy. Towards a small beach house on the coast of the mainland.

  Were the oracle snakes getting closer to us? They drifted in our direction, slow at first, but constant. Inexorable.
#+end_quote

I won't lie, that entire scene was chilling. Amazing.

#+begin_quote
  And then, the oracle snakes froze midair. In unison, they turned north. Gazing back towards Elmidde and Paragon Academy, still dark after the attack. /They see something there/.

  The army of snakes scattered like cockroaches. They shot away in a hundred different directions, flying back into the thicket of clouds, soaring away towards the open ocean.
#+end_quote

Reminds me of that scene in Endgame, where everyone goes "Wait, did the ships that were bombing us all turn towards /something in the sky/?"

#+begin_quote
  I turned my head leftwards, and gazed at the darkened Paragon Academy, the dim lights of Hightown. I saw the cable car station, far in the distance. The place where I'd clipped one of the trees near the peak, during my frantic descent to chase after Grace.

  I'd imagined myself looking at that view, sipping mulled cider in one of Paragon's common rooms or its banquet hall, with my newfound friends. I'd imagined soaring through the air.

  But this was better. This was so much better.
#+end_quote

I want to make fun of this scene, because how corny it is and the textbook linking of early foreshadowing with Ana's closed story circle and all...

But honestly, these tropes are popular for a reason. This is /really/ great.

This is a good story.
