That was a pretty great ending for Ana's arc. On to the next page!

The twist with the Lavender book was pretty cruel, albeit practical. An extra layer of security if it every falls into the wrong hands.

It looks like the gang is going to have to find a way to save Wes and Jun. Tasia/Nell joining is going to be pretty neat, though his(?) research still hasn't been mentioned, whether it becomes relevant is TBD I guess.
