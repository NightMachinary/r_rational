Thank you for your kind words. I do try very hard to capture voices, using the advice of Andrew Hussie:

  i think writing in voice is pretty simple. its mostly about consistency. choosing a set of parameters and committing to them absolutely. it can even be a shitty set of parameters and a crappy character. but if you keep hammering away at that voice, people will say, damn that's some pretty good characterization there! i mean... they might be WRONG. but theyll SAY it.

  the advantage is being so obstinate with the profile you choose is then any deviation you make ill be very noticable. this is to your advantage, if you can control these deviations with purpose and precision. such deviations can serve as the pillars for character development. they cant happen without the consistency first. and ironically, without the consistency, they DO happen. for the wrong reasons. because you fucked up.

I take great care to imagine the scenes as they would appear in the show, and to imagine their emoting and speech. I especially had problems nailing down Mr. Maheswaran.
