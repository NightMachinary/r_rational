Again, I'm not saying he should be stupid or "dumb as a brick." Someone can be smart without being familiar with the specific or formal axioms of rationality. Think more Hermione/Draco from HPMOR.

Or my personal example if you've been reading Pokemon: Origin of Species. Red is the nascent rationalist, familiar with the concepts but not perfect at utilizing them yet, Blue has an "evidence only" perspective, only believing in things that are observable rather than using much deduction, and Leaf is the outsider and devil's advocate, challenging and questioning the accepted axioms.

These are starting points to explore different perspectives and personalities, different roads to rationality that still give them room to grow and learn with. None of the main characters should be idiots, but starting someone out as the perfect rationalist also misses the mark in a group-focused story, I think.
