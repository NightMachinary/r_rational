Hmm. You're right, but I still feel like that's what makes him the best candidate for reader insert.

I didn't mean to just keep him as a the "noobie" forever: just that, as the most relatable character, having him come to those realizations and learn those lessons is the best perspective to tell the story and teach the lessons through. Having Rachel as the cold pragmatist works better than just making her a meathead, since it puts her at a huge disadvantage not to get any character upgrades while everyone else does. She can still enjoy the thrill and violence without being dumb about it.

That should be his character arc: from someone who starts as the group jokester to the one that embraces the "bright clear line."
