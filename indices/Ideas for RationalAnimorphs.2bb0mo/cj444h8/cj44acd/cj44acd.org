This could be bolstered by molding some of the main characters to each be avatars of particular concepts important to the rational community at large--Marco is the Hollywood rationalist, cold and unfeeling and more apt to take the ruthless point A to point B approach; he must learn how to embrace his emotions and become a /true/ rationalist.

Cassie is the moralist: avoiding pain, suffering, and death are of paramount importance, but where is the line drawn when you have to eradicate another species to save your own? If a creature walks and talks exactly the way you'd expect it to, is it really any different?

Tobias makes us ask, are we still human when we don't have human bodies? If it's not the physical synapses within our brain that is actually letting us think, what does that mean? Do souls exist, or is it tech mumbo-jumbo that's just copied our thought patterns to some zero-space whatchamacallit?

Jake has to face humanity's destruction while it is happy to ignore it, and has to divide his attention between saving everyone in their current state and finding a solution that lets the most possible people survive the cataclysm.

Aximili struggles with becoming aware of his own mental powers and pitfalls, and controlling them when they fall into old patterns.

Rachel....hits things. I'm not sure what to do with her. Definitely a statement about losing minds after death, but other than that, maybe just having muscle is what's needed.

Anyway, I think that's all the important bits (/whew, two posts!/). In a story like this, determining the rules in fine detail is more important than the particular plot points, and so I've spent most of my mental energy in that direction. While I don't have a whole lot of excess energy to actually spend writing, I would love to bounce ideas and act as a sounding board/reality check for anyone who wants to tackle this project, OP or actual OP in [[/r/rational]] included.
