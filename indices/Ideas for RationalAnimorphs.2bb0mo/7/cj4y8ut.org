If you could get to a certain level of giftedness (Cassie's good enough at morphing that she can actually blend species together, all the animorphs can demorph into skin-tight clothing, and once this female andalite who was a morph-dancer turned into a fully clothed human girl in order to do freaky things with Ax like making out in human form) you could potentially do a lot of a cool things. When I was reading as a kid I always wondered if you can do with weapons what you can do with clothing, but come to think of it there are tons of non-military applications.

It's funny, but almost every single thing you guys have suggested has /actually/ been covered in the series at some point or the other - the convervation of matter, the sentient morphs, the yeerk morphs, the "vegetarian" yeerks... I guess you cover a lot of ground over so many books.

I really /wouldn't/ have suspected Animorphs to be at rational saturation point, but...well...

btw, there's a place with information: [[http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/Morphing]]
