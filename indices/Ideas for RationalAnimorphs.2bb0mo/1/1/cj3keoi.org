  Can you morph into another of your same species?
#+end_quote

I /think/ there was an ethical taboo against morphing into a sentient, but not a technological limitation.

  Figure out what the Yeerks want, and if possible, give it to them
#+end_quote

If memory serves, they wanted to enslave all the humans sheerly because we're so numerous - perfect fodder for an army. So that may be a non-starter of a plan.

#+begin_quote
  Morphing allows for thought-speak, which would be immensely useful, especially if you could morph into yourself.

Or, second-best, buddy up and all morph into each other.
