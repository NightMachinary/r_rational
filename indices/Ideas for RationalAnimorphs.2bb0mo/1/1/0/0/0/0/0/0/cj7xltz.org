I thought 'morphing fixes injuries' meant that you healed injuries any time you morphed to a form or back. I've never read the Animorphs series, so I'm not up on the lore here. Didn't know about the two hour limit either.

Can you just morph again right away, or does it have a recharge? Can it be automated?
