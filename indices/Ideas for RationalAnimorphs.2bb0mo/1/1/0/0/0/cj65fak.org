...Injuries are removed when you demorph.

If you had a morph-capable friend, and you mutually morphed into each other, you could harvest body parts and organs from each other, then demorph and neutralize the damage.

In a world where morphing technology is commonplace, you'd have unlimited supplies of replacement organs and blood and basically everything you'd need to keep anybody alive. At the end of the war, commercial application of organ-duplication via morphing could usher in a quality-of-life revolution and end the illegal organs trade entirely.
