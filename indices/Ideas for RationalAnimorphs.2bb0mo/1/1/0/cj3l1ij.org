Yes. I know David morphed other humans, but the main characters didn't like doing it because when you morph into an animal you have to control the native mind. Doing that to a sapient would be too much like what the Yeerks do or something like that. The Animorphs only morphed sapients when they had permission from the person they got the DNA from. Ax got around it by combining multiple people's DNA to make his human morph.
