Yeerks know that Andalites can share the morphing technology, but have no reason to think they ever would. Only Andalites have it, so when they see animals attacking them they just assume that it's Andalites. Even more so because Andalites are very averse to sharing their technology with other species since because of Seerow's Kindness [[#s][minor spoilers]].

Hybrid morphing could be a thing. In some of the books we see people who are good at morphing (Estrid, Cassie) bend or even break the rules we know about morphing, and in book seven we see morphing that should be impossible happen because an allergic reaction. In another book, Cassie talks the group through a demorph when they're running at or slightly past the two-hour limit. It's possible that the limitations of morphing are a conceptual limitation and not hard fact.

You can absolutely morph into another member of your same species. In canon they try not to for moral reasons, but nothing prevents them from doing that.

Figuring out what the Yeerks want... [[#s][late book spoilers]]

My understanding of thought speak was that it triggered the moment the morpher becomes incapable of speech. A controlled partial-morph to alter your vocal cords should be enough. Not sure how this works when morphing into another human (I can't recall an instance in canon where someone in human morph used thought-speak, but I believe it was done by someone in a Hork-Bajir morph which is capable of speech). Jake uses thought-speak without morphing in the first book, but that was ret-conned out.
