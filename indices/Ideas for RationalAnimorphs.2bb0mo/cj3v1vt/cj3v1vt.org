Ellimist and Crayak's ascension to godhood is apparently replicable. Then there's the little matter of the Time Matrix, which normally just moves the user to a desired destination in spacetime, but can be overloaded to create a universe to fulfill simultaneous conflicting requests. There is almost certainly a reason that the Time Matrix only appeared in the Andalite Chronicles and a Megamorphs: because the series was about kids that can turn into animals fighting alien parasites, not about people using the Time Matrix to build a battle mech out of universes in an attempt to... I dunno, overthrow one or both of our resident god-tier entities?
