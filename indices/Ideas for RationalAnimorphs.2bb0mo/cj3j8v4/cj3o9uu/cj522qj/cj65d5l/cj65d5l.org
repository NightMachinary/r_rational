There's an interesting plot you could do with that. The possibility for a Yeerk to live independently of the Kandrona Rays from the pool might actually be a good way to get a lot of Yeerks to defect; at the least, I could see interesting cyberpunk-esque politics happening, if, say, the Animorphs were to sneak into every pool they knew about and leave these Chee-knockoff bodies.

What do the Vissers do when the entire reason why their empire is so militaristic collapses beneath them due to Animorph/Chee-introduced technological progress? Kill them with kindness, as they say.
