If memory serves, after the Yeerks obtained morphing technology, which could have let them all take on a permanent non-parasitic, non-Kandrona dependent form, they didn't just give up the war.

They may have started the war to increase their quality of life by gaining host bodies. But they'll also take what they can get, without limit. Conquest for conquest's sake.

If you give them all host bodies, that would increase their military might several times over. They'd be in a perfect position to conquer the rest of the galaxy. Unlikely that they'd turn down that possibility.
