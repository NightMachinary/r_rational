  The Chee can produce Kandrona rays, which Yeerks need to live and the control of which is one of the main ways the Yeerk Vissers keep the other Yeerks in line

This suggests a way of giving them a decent quality of life without hurting anyone. Ask the Chee to mass-manufacture bodies similar to theirs, though probably less powerful -- don't want a Yeerk to be able to kill tons of people with impugnity. Omit any consciousness from those bodies and hook up Yeerk-friendly controls. This cuts out the control scheme, introduces a dependency on a relatively friendly body of potential peacekeepers, and doesn't hurt anyone.
