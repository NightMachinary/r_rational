Later in the series an Andalite joined their group and he created a hybrid human morph based on all of the other Animorphs to serve as his human form. As I recall he could have morphed a specific one of them, but he went with the mix so that he would have a unique identity (and be less likely to blow the cover of one of the regular Animorphs due to his weird nonhuman behaviour drawing attention to him). So yeah, I think they could have impersonated other people pretty easily, at least physically. None of these kids were experienced actors, though, so I would think it'd be a big risk to try it in most circumstances.

There actually /were/ "non-evil" Yeerks, in fact there was a secret "resistance" group of Yeerks who wanted to play nice with other intelligent races and only take nonsentient or custom-engineered host bodies. The Animorphs wound up involved in some ops with these subversive Yeerks from time to time. They didn't show up until later in the series, though, you may not have got that far. They were rather tragic, really - the "mainstream" Yeerk culture thought of them as dangerous traitors looking to sell them out, and the Andalites thought the Yeerks were always-chaotic-evil and didn't even recognize that there could be nice guys hidden among them.

Another major secret ally the Animorphs had in their back pocket were the Chee androids. The Chee were super-advanced and super-powerful, but they were also programmed to be absolute pacifists. A rational approach could try to convince them to loosen their programmed pacifism safeguards a little (the one time a Chee android allowed his safeguards to be removed he utterly massacred a large Yeerk battalion single-handedly. He then begged to have his safeguards put back in afterward, appalled at what he'd done, so fortunately the hard programmed limits aren't the only thing keeping them from being monsters, but still definitely a risk IMO) or have them supply the Animorphs with advanced technological tools.

One of the Chee had even infiltrated the Yeerks successfully - he'd built a Yeerk cage into his skull and trapped the Yeerk that tried taking him over, keeping it imprisoned in permanent solitary confinement inside his head in a great karmic payback (and also raising creepy questions of just what "pacifism" entails). So that's really handy. The Chee can produce Kandrona rays, which Yeerks need to live and the control of which is one of the main ways the Yeerk Vissers keep the other Yeerks in line, so they'd be able to supply the subversive Yeerks and keep non-subversives prisoner outside of host bodies. Great allies.
