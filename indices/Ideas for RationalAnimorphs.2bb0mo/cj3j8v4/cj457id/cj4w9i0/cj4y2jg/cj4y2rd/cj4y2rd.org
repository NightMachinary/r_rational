  The *Iskoort* are a strange, capitalistic race that live on a distant planet on the far side of the galaxy. They are divided into castes which live in guilds and spend their lives doing only what their caste specifies. For example, salesman Iskoory sell anything they can-even memories, skin, and hair. There are even Iskoort whose sole purpose is to buy goods in order to keep the economy going.

  They have torsos like an wheezing, veiny pink accordian, vulture heads, and legs that make them look like they're walking backwards. They are actually a combination of two races: the Isk and the Yoort. The Isk were artificially created, and engineered so that they cannot live without the Yoort. The Yoort were likewise modified so that they can't live without the Isk, ensuring that neither of them rebels or abuses the other. The Yoorts were a parasite race much like the Yeerks and who also feed on Kandrona Rays. They, too, took over creatures as hosts and tried to conquer the galaxy. However, after spending so long being forced to enslave others in order  to be free themselves, they came up with a solution. They engineered special hosts that would be most suited to them and could not live without them. In order to be true symbiotes, they altered themselves as well, so that they and their host bodies, called the Isk, formed a single race, the Iskoort, who then built an orderly society on their new home planet. Their society is a strange mix of chaos and order, but they are very important in the fate of the galaxy. The Ellimist and Crayak wage their battle over them because in about three centuries, the Iskort and the Yeerk will meet, and the Yeerks will discover that there is an alternative to their current lifestyle.
