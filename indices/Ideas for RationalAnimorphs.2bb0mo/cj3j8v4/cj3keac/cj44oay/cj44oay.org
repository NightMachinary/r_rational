Ax used thought-speech while in human morph all the time; in fact, he usually was the one that relayed info to Tobias on human-disguise missions.

Also, thought-speech always took a moment after speech became unintelligible, so I always imagined it was at the 50% mark or some other arbitrary percentage.
