With the caveat that it's been a long, long time since I've read the books, and I never read them all, I actually remember the series being fairly well written (at least so far as people making smart choices went), though I might be looking at it through rose-tinted glasses.

- Yeerks don't know that anyone but the Andalites have morphing technology, or that the ability to morph can be given. Keeping that secret is priority number one. If at all possible, the animorphs should keep their existence a secret /period/ instead of doing missions in animal form. (The books did a decent job of this.)
- Acquire all of the best animals as fast as possible, with a focus on infiltration, fast movement, and combat.
- It's mentioned that different DNA can be combined in order to make a wholly original morph. This is used to prevent creating an exact duplicate, but it could also be used to build a "more optimal" version of an animal for each morph, or perhaps a hybrid animal (or even one that's wholly unique and can act as a game breaker).
- Can you morph into another of your same species? I recall that there's nothing that prevents morphing into a human in general, but I can't remember whether there's a prohibition on, say, acquiring a morph of someone important and going around in their skin.
- Figure out what the Yeerks want, and if possible, give it to them while maintaining the survival of the human race at the same time. I would prefer a version of the story where the Yeerks aren't all evil (though I half remember one of the animorphs getting taken over and maybe having a Not So Different moment?).
- One of the things I really liked about the series was that each of the team had their own defined personality - I'd like that to carry over into any rational treatment in the form of values conflict (the best type of conflict).
- Morphing allows for thought-speak, which would be immensely useful, especially if you could morph into yourself. Acquiring it outside of the morph would be even better.

Edit: Honestly, the single biggest limitation is the two hour time limit, which nerfs a wide variety of possibilities.
