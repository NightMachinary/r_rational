Yes, I was misremembering. You are right. Morphing will heal any non-genetic diseases. In the series, a group of disabled teens are given the morphing technology and 3 are completely cured by it. So your idea would probably still work. Although it may have difficulty with things such as cancer, since they might not be seen as damage to be fixed in the same way as an injury would.

I think you can morph again right away, but it takes about 2 minutes to morph or demorph and concentration. So I doubt it could be automated. And there may be issues with mental fatigue, but I don't think the technology itself has an inbuilt recharge period
