  Morphing ares not for your conservation of mass.
#+end_quote

The characters question the conservation of matter bit. Ax says that the extra matter goes into Z-space, and is drawn from Z-space. He also mentions that there is theoretically a chance that the extra mass is struck by a space-ship which was travelling through Z space, and that no one is sure what happens to the morpher if that occurs. (Z-space is called on to explain a lot of the stuff in Animorphs)

  morphing into a human ... might double your brainpower in some sense?
#+end_quote

In canon, that did not occur when they morphed into humans. However, the characters /did/ feel aspects of their human morph's personality, similar to how they felt the natural instincts of the animals they morphed into - like, when someone morphed into Rachel they kept feeling impulses to "kick butt".

I think one of them also reported an eerie sensation of "being watched" during a sentient morph, and had the sensation that they were doing something invasive, like a Yeerk - but I think it was some sort of ape or cetacean or some other non-human sentient.

Relevantly, an /ant/ morphed into a human once. It just started screaming. Conversely, when the human gang morphed into ants, they were almost overpowered by the hive instincts.
