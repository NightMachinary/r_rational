If you take a look at my top-level comment, I talk about my theory that Yeerks subconsciously incorporate the thought patterns of their hosts, which, depending on how it's revealed to the characters (including the Visser), could return Visser Three to his original methodical, patient personality that he had early on, before humans or andalites were hosts.
