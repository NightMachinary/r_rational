  Firstly, everyone should have a Yeerk morph. If nothing else, you can now vet allies perfectly.

I've always wondered what would happen in the event that a yeerk infested a morph-form. It's pretty obvious that during morphing, the yeerk goes wherever the host brain goes and so retains control (however that works), but what about a yeerk taking, say, a human-morphed Andalite? Would they have control? Would the yeerk be killed by the pressure/topological difference if he demorphed, or perhaps transported to z-space with the rest of the excess animal form? Could a human morph a human and thus keep his thoughts shielded?

  In fact, I'm reasonably sure you can acquire a creature that is, themself, an Animorph in disguise.

I don't think that's right, canon-wise, but I've always thought that this limitation + not being able to acquire from dead meat was inconsistent. For instance, book 16 was entirely based around getting someone's blood to acquire from, but then in the dinosaur time-travel they couldn't acquire from the dead t-rex. Both limitations are ripe for fanfic retconning.

  Thirdly, do the Yeerks actually control the government? The Yeerks should already control the government - which has Implications. This should be less of a war and more of a revolution.

I always felt like the way they went about it was about right--start at the local level, understand how human politics functions and what you can get away with, and work your way up the chain as you have enough yeerks to cover everything and once you're confident you won't screw things up ("And you may deride their projectile weapons, but a nine-millimeter bullet will kill a Hork-Bajir host body quite effectively. And Taxxons or Gedds? A Taxxon can be killed with a can opener! . . . Five billion humans, each firing a single bullet, could have missed nearly a hundred percent of the time and still wiped us out!"). Visser One's plan of a Scientology knockoff (that actually produces mental change results, as far as the humans can tell) is also a valid non-linear approach.
