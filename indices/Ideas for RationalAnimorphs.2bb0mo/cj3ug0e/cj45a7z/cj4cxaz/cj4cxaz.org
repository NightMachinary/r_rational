  I've always wondered what would happen in the event that a yeerk infested a morph-form. It's pretty obvious that during morphing, the yeerk goes wherever the host brain goes and so retains control (however that works), but what about a yeerk taking, say, a human-morphed Andalite? Would they have control? Would the yeerk be killed by the pressure/topological difference if he demorphed, or perhaps transported to z-space with the rest of the excess animal form? Could a human morph a human and thus keep his thoughts shielded?

... that /is/ interesting. I have no idea. I ... guess they would be dumped into z-space, possibly in some sort of stasis until that morph is used again.

  I don't think that's right, canon-wise, but I've always thought that this limitation + not being able to acquire from dead meat was inconsistent.

I could swear at one point they captured an insect, and it was so awkward to catch and hold the thing that they ended up all acquiring it from the first one to catch it, morphed.

On the other hand, I can actually buy the dead meat thing - it's the blood I would retcon. Morphing tech /has/ to be scanning the target for more than /just/ DNA.

  I always felt like the way they went about it was about right--start at the local level, understand how human politics functions and what you can get away with, and work your way up the chain as you have enough yeerks to cover everything and once you're confident you won't screw things up .... Visser One's plan of a Scientology knockoff (that actually produces mental change results, as far as the humans can tell) is also a valid non-linear approach.

Sure, the Evil Plan is decent, although some of the details are sketchy.

But Controllers can always act perfectly in character, so they should already have higher-ups under their command. For whenever they need funding, cover-ups, even endorsements. (They may actually have this in the books, to be fair.)
