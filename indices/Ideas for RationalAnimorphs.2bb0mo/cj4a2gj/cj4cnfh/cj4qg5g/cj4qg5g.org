IIRC, the sharks received some sort of brain implants, but I don't remember anything about them being used as controllers directly. Of note is that said implants stayed in the Animorphs' heads when they demorphed, without serious side-effects, but if they tried morphing anything too small, it would explode their heads.

I don't remember much about the horse-controllers in terms of intelligence. They exhibited some human-like behaviors (modesty, mockery), and they managed to use a language that could work with horse vocalizations to communicate with Vissor III (IIRC, the same languagd used with the Geds).

(Random trivia the horse episode reminded me of: the US Military did retrieve an Andalite toilet, which was presumably lost during the battle that ended with Elfangor and Ax on Earth. Nothing came of this, but the Yeerks wanted access to it anyway because they thought it might have been something more useful.)
