  I actually think their problem is that they can't convert people fast enough, amusingly. They don't have the population on site, or the infrastructure. Remember, every new Controller needs a Yeerk pool in place to check in every three days.

Not to mention that Yeerk reproduction involves three Yeerks combining and bursting into larvae, which kills all three "parents". I always thought that was an interesting idea that was never explored much: the high-ranking Yeerks obviously won't do it willingly at all, but you can't just keep using nobodies, or you select for poor genes. I always thought that forced mating would be a good punishment for a high-ranking Yeerk such as Visser One.
