In fairness, I think they do break the masquerade eventually.

But personally, I would be leery of triggering a war with a species with higher military tech, at least at first. They can plausibly destroy secret Yeerk bases etc. But can humanity really win an open war with the Empire? (Would the Empire be willing to nuke cities from orbit, for example, even with host bodies in there?)

Still, they should tell /someone/. Just, you know, make sure you tell them over the course of three days.

  It's astonishing that the Yeerks were taking so long on their invasion in the first place.

I actually think their problem is that they can't convert people fast enough, amusingly. They don't have the population on site, or the infrastructure. Remember, every new Controller needs a Yeerk pool in place to check in every three days.

(Plus, you know, their stuff keeps getting smashed by elephants.)
