Yes, they do eventually, though I don't remember the specifics that well...

Anyway, you have a point about it being dangerous to bring humanity into the war, but I think giving the Yeerks another year or two to corrupt earth's higher-ups, then have those controllers fight it out with the Andalites would be even worse.

And once it becomes clear that the Andalites aren't even coming anytime soon, waiting to reveal things even a day longer makes little sense.

Presumably constructing Yeerk pools in every location they want to infest someone takes doing, true.

But it also seems as if they have genuine difficulty infesting people in power. One book is based around them trying to get their hands on a governer running for President, which means, at the very least, that the President is beyond their reach. But you'd think that it wouldn't be too difficult to capture a number of the people working security at the white house, then use them to do the job.
