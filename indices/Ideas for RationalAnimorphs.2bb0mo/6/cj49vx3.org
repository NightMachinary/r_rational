Frankly, It's astonishing that the Yeerks were taking so long on their invasion in the first place. Nigh-unlimited mind control should give them the power to do almost anything they want, so long as they aren't discovered.

So naturally, the obvious main goal for the Animorphs should be to reveal the Yeerk invasion ASAP. It doesn't matter how competent their little group is, a whole world fighting against the Yeerks is gonna be about a million times more effective than a mere 6 people fighting them.

The Animorphs seem at a loss for how to accomplish this for most of the book series proper, fearing whoever they tell might be a Yeerk, but a very obvious method presents itself.

Just morph into animals, then use thought-speak to tell everyone in the city about the Yeerks. When thousands of people all start getting the same phantom message, they'll start acting on it. Especially if this plan is complimented by gathered evidence, such as the location of the Yeerk Pool. The Yeerks can't cover this up, and will be revealed before long.

So were I doing a rational fanfiction, it would become an open conflict fairly quickly. Not sure how the Animorphs would fit into it once that happened.
