Wasn't the Ellimist born as a Ketran? I don't think he thought in the same way as an AI even after the intelligence enhancements, and the same goes for his enemy. I don't know how you would munchkin the morphing ability that the characters didn't in canon, where they used the stronger morphs to fight, birds and dolphins to travel, and small morphs to spy on the enemy and infiltrate things. Maybe work with Ax to figure out ways to use the Z-space principles of morphing or the morph cubes for other things? Morphing involves stowing away mass in Z-space. If they could put something large enough away, it might be possible to use it as a weapon to destroy Kandrona Ray towers and the Yeerk mothership, killing all the Yeerks on Earth from Kandrona Ray starvation. Still, I think the majority of the changes from rational fic conversion would probably be from improved strategizing on how the war is conducted. Especially earlier on, when the Animorphs were less experienced, it seemed like they were frequently risking their lives on low-yield objectives.
