Ellimist was originally a human-like intelligence, but he underwent several upgrade cycles. The neural-network fleet of ships was ultimately his most powerful phase before he accidentally fell into the glitch in the universe that turned him into a full-on reality warper.

(There was also a curious sense of identity in the neural network phase. He spawned a copy of his consciousness in an Andalite body to just spend time with the Andalites and see if there was anything worth doing. Yet, as he's losing nodes to a black hole during a battle with Crayak, he's lamenting that he's losing some of his original bodyparts from his days as a Ketran. He becomes nigh-omniscient almost immediately thereafter, but it was an incredibly human sentiment for a superintelligent neural network actively defending itself from attack.)
