Yeah, the shark-implant not going away when morphing was a bit inconsistent with other aspects of morphing. Tight clothing works, loose clothing doesn't (until very late in the series). Yeerks forcing a host to morph works, keeping the Yeerk with the host body. But suddenly the implant, that is imbedded in the head (like a Yeerk), is non-organic (like the clothes) suddenly isn't allowed to work. Boy, I hope no one had braces or pins or anything like that.
