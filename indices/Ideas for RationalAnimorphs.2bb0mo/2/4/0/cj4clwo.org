  I think you just get genetic instincts, but I don't remember. No, I'm wrong. There was a housecat of a family friend and they morphed it and retained its knowledge. Hm.

Ah, I didn't read that one, but yeah, that seems to happen other times too (the dog morph in book one, notably - Jake's first morph.)

I'm pretty sure the ability to process sensory information is learned, so it would /have/ to access more than "instinct" to function; at least, it's definitely learned in humans.
