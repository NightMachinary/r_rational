Re: Plants - I've been assuming that the morphing technology requires animal-like cells (no cell wall, etc), but it's ability to interface with the brain is impressive enough that this seems like a bizarre limitation on reflection.

The biggest weakness in the Yeerk invasion is probably Vissor III himself. He's a lot like the sociopath CEO who stops optimizing the corporation's value as soon as he's backstabbed his way to multi million dollar bonuses. He gave himself rank when the ranks were new and poorly moderated, bullied and murdered subordinates, got lucky enough to find a passed out Andalite to infest, and clearly failed to understand why Vissor I wanted to keep the invasion of Earth more covert. Vissor III effectively lost the war single-handedly the instant he got promoted to Vissor I, since the US Military was no longer a "neutral but might be ours eventually" force.

Meanwhile, Vissor I was, in fact, actively trying to subvert the military from within, and the Counsil 13 exists primarily so no one will ever find out who the emperor is. (We learn more about the Counsil 13 in /Vissor/ than in any other book, and what we learn is practically nothing, other than their hosts and a couple names. Another book implies that the Counsil does have rotating membership, since the Inspector fully expects to be promoted to their ranks.).

If anything, making just one of the Counsil 13 or the top Vissors smart enough to propose reforms to the power structure would go a long way to making the Yeerks more formidable opponents. Vissor III and the Inspector are powerful weapons, but horrible leaders.
