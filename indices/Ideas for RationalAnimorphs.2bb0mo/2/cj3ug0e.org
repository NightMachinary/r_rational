OK. Munchkinning powers, take one:

- Firstly, everyone should have a Yeerk morph. If nothing else, you can now vet allies perfectly.

- Second, there is no reason why everyone has different morphs. Everyone should have every morph. In fact, I'm reasonably sure you can acquire a creature that is, themself, an Animorph in disguise.

- Thirdly, as the characters themselves figure out fairly quickly, the intelligence-gathering applications of being a fly on the wall are insanely useful.

- Fourthly, you can absolutely morph an animal, cut off a limb, then demorph. Morphing cares not for your conservation of mass. In fact, the whole "you heal when you morph" thing is amazing, and there has to be Applications.

- Can you morph into a plant? Clearly, the brain of the animal doesn't need to be able to support your mind, and if it can handle aliens then the biological distance should be relatively small. It wouldn't be able to move, but OTOH no brain to fight you for control.

--------------

Now, more speculatively ... how does the morphing technology deal with brains?

Andalites themselves don't fully understand how it operates, IIRC, but still: it unquestionably grabs some data from the already-trained neurons of a creature, effectively duplicating them and plugging their knowledge and instincts directly into your brain. There is simply no way you can get these things from pure DNA extrapolation.

If morphing into someone let you read their mind, that would be insanely broken, though. Enough so that I would expect the characters to have put aside their ethical qualms and used it. At a guess, those occasions when what are clearly memories and learned habits "bleed through" are closer to the sporadic memories Yeerks retain than full access to the cloned brain.

Still, this seems to have infiltration applications, ironically enough. Morph a Controller, you should pick up enough of their strongest habits and memories to at least sneak into the Yeerk pool and plant a bomb.

Also, morphing into a human ... might /double your brainpower/ in some sense? In addition to granting telepathy, which can apparently directly alter moods, magically persuade people you are telling the truth, and do direct infodumps without requiring you to explain concepts and terms.

Villain powers:

- Yeerks seem to use the host's brainpower; indeed, there's no reason to assume they're sapient in their native form- they probably evolved to parasitize fish. So the obvious rationalist thing is to /find smart hosts/. ** Our heroes probably can't out-think the top 0.0001% of humanity. But! Yeerks are terrible people, and their society uses Klingon Promotion. Tactician Controllers would be a great help, but you don't want your underlings to be /too/ smart. (This is probably the main reason they lose.)

- Secondly, there is no reason to engage in fist-fights with apex predators when /you have guns/. Sorry. Especially when those guns are super-duper ray guns that can disintegrate people.

- Thirdly, do the Yeerks actually control the government? The Yeerks should already control the government - which has Implications. This should be less of a war and more of a revolution.
