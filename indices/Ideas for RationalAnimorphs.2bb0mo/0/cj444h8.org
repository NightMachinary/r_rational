This is a memory dump of some of the ideas that I have thought about over the months and years. Animorphs was one of my favorite series; I own copies of all of them and still regularly grind through the series every few years. Some of these changes I would make aren't so much changes as they are codifying what happened in the series as having a real reason. Here they are, ordered from most to least canonical (or plausibly canonical):

Item the first: Yeerks unconsciously absorb and incorporate the personality traits of their hosts.

While still on their home planet, they only have access to a non-sapient species that presumably were bred for stupidity (no personality to absorb), the Hork-bajir were engineered to be stupid and non-challenging (barely any personality to absorb), and the Taxxons have a pure animalistic instinct (need to be consciously fought and so the Yeerks are on guard to prevent any intellectual "leakage"). As soon as we see Yeerks take over more intelligent species, however, we see Face-Heel Turns and other drastic personality changes within individual Yeerks.

Esplin 9466 (Visser Three) goes from cold, calculating, cautious, and awarely respectful of his enemies to arrogant, reckless, demanding, and downright condescending as soon as he takes over Alloran-Semitur-Corrass; each of these new traits are very obvious in his host's appearances in the Andalite and Hork-bajir Chronicles. In addition, I don't think it was coincidence that Esplin turns from patiently plotting to opportunity-seizing after infesting Chapman in the Andalite Chronicles. Aftran 942 goes from ambitious and bloodthirsty to morally and socially aware after infesting Cassie. Edriss 562 (Visser One) doesn't change much on the surface, but gains a completely out-of-species motherly instinct over "her" children after having babies through her host. Cassie herself has much fewer qualms about resisting the Yeerks after morphing to a Yeerk and infesting Mr. Tidwell, a human member of the Yeerk Peace Movement. The very existence of the Yeerk Peace Movement on Earth, which has no known analog in any of the previously conquered species, at least suggests that enough Yeerks are being changed by their hosts to make this a very plausible possibility.

While this could be explained as, y'know, character development, I think the stack of evidence of basically /every single PC Yeerk we ever see/ points in this direction.

Would this be a plot point, or just something to keep in mind to keep everything consistent? I don't know. In a fanfic exploring rational thought, it could be invaluable in exploring "how does one really change one's mind", though as a positive or a negative example I'm not sure.

--------------

Item the second: the Andalite telepathy is more than "thought-speech" as the Animorphs term it. It is the reverse of the Yeerk's personality-absorption and directly beams not only the user's thoughts but also opinions, expectations, and personality to the receivers. It is also inherently one-way (though this is explicit in the original work). As a result, Andalites in general are very hive-minded without knowing it, as all PC Andalites immediately move to conform to their peers as soon as they interact with them and are thus bombarded with subconscious telepathic expectations.

There are a bare handful of occasions where more than thoughts are explicitly transmitted, the most prominent example being when Elfangor does his data dump in the first book (not just to the recording device, but straight into the Animorphs' heads), where images, memories, and emotions are directly transmitted. The number of examples where Aximili and Elfangor (who both question the moral standard of the Andalite people while isolated) immediately return to form as soon as they are within range of another Andalite's thought-speech is sizeable.

How such a power works between planet-separated species is probably outside the scope of the fic, and can be explained by Ellimist hand-waving. For those of you who did not read The Ellimist Chronicles, the being known as the Ellimist spent quite a period of time living as an Andalite after discovering them, and it's at least implied that he manipulated their evolution as he saw fit. As a running theme, he himself probably did so unconsciously, at least at some level.

(This particular item in conjunction with the next makes the idea of Andalite "words" such as /aristh/ and /shorn/ to be kind of a ridiculous concept.)

--------------

Item the third: Andalites, as a side-effect of the hive-mind mentality (or perhaps a contributing cause of it), are able to read thoughts, but only when the being in question is attempting to communicate outwards (a non intrusive mind-reading, as opposed to the intrusive mind-reading abilities the Leeran have).

This is perhaps the most speculative of the plausibly-canonical ideas I've had. Being as Andalites themselves can all communicate via thought-speech, the only time such an ability as passive mind-reading would become apparent is when communicating with other species, which when combined with Andalite isolationism, slow rate of scientific discovery, and the fact that First Contact appears to be a relatively recent thing (the Yeerks broke free of their home world in about 1966, and based on the fact that such things such as "don't give unknown undeveloped species advanced scientific advancements" wasn't a thing yet, I think it's safe to say that Andalites are new to the whole Where No Alien Has Gone Before thing, so they wouldn't have much opportunity to realize they can fuzzily read thoughts), I think it's reasonable to think that Andalites themselves do not fully understand how their powers work.

I've constructed a scene (in my head) of Elfangor and Abron first meeting Chapman and Loren, and inquiring what gases they need to breathe. Loren answers "Oxygen", but she doesn't know anything about it besides the word used to represent it and that it's dangerous when concentrated, so Elfangor receives the message of "volatile gas". When Chapman repeats it, Elfangor understands "gas with 8 protons and 8 neutrons" based on Chapman's own knowledge, and so actually understands he means Oxygen.

This would result in a fairly major departure from canon, but would make things such as Ax's culture shock less fish-out-of-water and more "I literally cannot understand your metaphor".

--------------

Item the fourth: More intelligent creatures operate less off of instinct than less intelligent creatures, and so morphs into those creatures take more learning time to master.

This is a large departure from canon, but I think it's superior to the "well, we're creating a creature and then enslaving it, so are Yeerks the real monsters?" weaksauce moral conundrum that canon uses to avoid morphing intelligent beings. If instead more intelligent beings have fewer hard-wired instincts to guide them, the morpher has to mentally explore their new body and grow used to it. Human to human would be mostly easy, but human to Hork-bajir or hawk to Andalite would take a ton of relearning how to walk, fight, and speak (Ax suddenly knowing how to use vocal English bugs me perhaps more than it should; Elfangor tried to fake Taxxon and got completely exposed for it).

--------------

This leads up to perhaps the biggest concept, one that I think would be fairly major in a rationalfic:

Item the fifth: humans are unique in the magnitude of their ability to change their minds and thus to adopt rational thought.

You may have noticed a theme of unconscious abilities or decisions, and items 1-3 discussed above could be explained as social pressure rather than telepathic pressure. If I were to write an Animorphs rationalfic, I would include humans being more able to become aware of their own thought processes, and thus change their thinking than any other discovered species.

Aximili was downright /shocked/ to discover that humans went from heavier-than-air to landing on the moon in sixty years. One lifetime, give or take. This may be due to economy of scale (humans definitely outnumber just about every other discovered species so far), but Ax seems more troubled in the understanding that implied. Perhaps it took the Andalites so much longer, not because they couldn't find the evidence, but because they became so attached to unsound principles that it was much more difficult for them to admit when they're wrong--coupled with the passive hive-mind telepathy above, this would make propagation of new ideas among Andalites very, very slow, taking generations at a time for a single new true principle to fight its way to acceptance.

When Edriss discovers humans and first infests one of the Iraqi soldiers in the Persian Gulf War, she is baffled to find what she termed two brains in the same head (the two halves). She also noted that such a mind allowed its user to argue with itself, which she decided had to contribute to such a massively populated species being so technologically backward, which is of course at odds with Ax's conclusion.

Both of these point to human thought being a strange and different way of doing things to both of these species, which would of course be expected in any fiction, but in the case of a fanfic specifically focusing on how to think rationally, it could be a vehicle for a number of topics.
