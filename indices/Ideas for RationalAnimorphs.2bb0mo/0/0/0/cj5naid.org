This is all great :) Animorphs was one of the top IPs I considered before going with Pokemon, and I think it could be done really well.

One thing I would change is reverse the roles of Rachel and Marco: she always seemed like the cold pragmatist, and I wouldn't want Marco to lose his defining sense of humor.

Make him the one newest to rationalism, have him act as the "reader insert" for explanations and wish fulfillment. There are a lot of for-fun things someone could do with shapechanging powers that the books barely touch on, and Marco always came closest to using his powers for fun.
