Thanks! :)

The reason that I peg Marco as the "cold" rationalist is because of this passage from the original series from Marco's POV, which I've always liked:

#+begin_quote
  People don't understand the word ruthless. They think it means "mean." It's not about being mean. It's about seeing the bright, clear line that leads from A to B. The line that goes from motive to means. Beginning to end.

  It's about seeing that bright, clear line and not caring about anything but the beautiful fact that you can see the solution. Not caring about anything else but the perfection of it.

  That's what had happened. I saw the way to take both Vissers down. And that's all that mattered.

  But I wasn't going to explain all that. Other people's pity just messes with the straight line. Other people's pity makes you think things you can't think about when you are seeing the line.

#+begin_quote
  "We take out Visser One. We take out Visser Three. We leave the Yeerks believing they've erased the free Hork-Bajir colony. The free Hork-Bajir end up much safer; the Yeerks end up leaderless."

  I avoided looking at Cassie. From Jake there was just the briefest flicker of sadness. But Jake, too, is addicted to the bright, clear line.

  Rachel kept her eyes down, focusing on the dirt-and-hay floor.

  Rachel's not stupid. She knew anything she said would just make me mad. And I guess she, like all of them, was putting herself in my shoes. Wondering if she could do it.
#+end_quote

(Context for non-readers: one of the Vissers he's talking about taking down has infested his mother, so that means killing her to take out Visser One.)

Marco was always the most genre-savvy of the group, the loudest, the funniest, but he was also the one who had the firmest grasp on what was at stake, who lost the most the soonest. He covered up his understanding with jokes, but his reluctance was always a symptom of knowing better than the others what it meant to try to win.

Rachel, on the other hand, was very Jekyll-and-Hyde, who would revel in the blood while fighting, would push for whatever course of action led to the most open conflict, but never thought things through, and when the consequences of her actions caught up with her, it always blindsided her. She always went the emotional route, whether that emotion was bloodlust or fear for her family.

Both would kill to get their goals. Both would trade the few for the many. The difference is that Rachel would see that solution in the moment and then hate herself later once she was down off the adrenaline high, whereas Marco would have thought of it a week beforehand and accepted it as valid, even if it hurt him personally. And then he'd crack a joke.

So, when I say Marco is the cold one, I mean what he actually /is/, and not what he /appears/. And he tries to cover it up because he knows if it comes down to math, he /will/ make the rational decision, and he's not sure if he wants that.
