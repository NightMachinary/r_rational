I feel like with five (later six) of them, there's no need for a straight-up insert who's dumb as a brick where it comes to rationality, especially not the one that was probably the most intelligent and informed besides Ax in the original. I feel like each of them can be the insert of their own particular spectrum, leaving no one person carrying all the ignorance all at once.

If anyone, Ax himself has the most reason to be separate from the human's strange ways of looking at things, but like I say, I don't feel he'd need to be the only one learning new things for the sake of the reader.

I do agree with your statement about Marco's general arc, and Rachel /does/ need some sort of tuning, I'm just not sure what. A Harry's-Dark-Side-like intelligence when she's morphed and in battle? That might be interesting.
