I was brainstorming explanations for medieval stasis in a fantasy setting, and I stumbled upon this: what if there just isn't enough metal?

Here are the rules I have in mind:

- Very little iron and copper.
- Very little of [whatever other chemical ends up causing trouble; for now I can think of sulphur].
- Earth-like amounts of other elements. (Not sure about lead; on one hand it doesn't ruin medieval stasis, but on the other hand its overuse in place of iron and copper would make lead poisoning super common and that's icky.)
- Som /non-smeltable/ fantasy materials (troll bone, ironwood...) that are as hard as iron and somewhat common.
- Some kind of magic I haven't decided yet. Might be used (sparingly) to fix unwanted aspects of the setting. Definitely no magitech.

Here are some consequences I can think of, after the setting has matured for millenias:

- No industrial revolution. No engines. No small or complex machines.

- Movable type is doable. If lead is scarce, tin should do it. That means you can have a scientific revolution, mass literacy, newspapers... It just doesn't translate into that much wealth-generating technology.

- Cloth is the one sector that could quite possibly reach industrial-revolution levels. Water-powered looms should be buildable without iron.

- Tools are a big bottleneck. You can carve them out of troll bone, but that can't be mass-produced or recycled. In the specific case of knives, there's a regression issue (can't carve a troll-bone knife without using a better knife) which has to bottom out in /highly/ coveted metal or magic knives. Probably a lot of flintknapping for everyday use.

- Agriculture is hampered by a lack of cheap tools, but accumulated knowledge of e.g. crop rotation means it's still very productive, supporting many specialist jobs.

- Plumbing can be done using either pottery or soft metals. Given the accumulation of medical knowledge (and bricks), large cities most likely have sewers, maybe even running water.

- Glass is not /cheap/ but still fairly common (because of the larger pool of specialists).

- Spears, arrows, and maces are more economical than swords.

- No chainmail; you jump straight from leather to ironwood plate.

- Gunpowder may be widely known, but without affordable sulphur it's just a curiosity. (Banning iron alone isn't enough; the heavy use of grenades would twist the setting too far from what I want.)

- The food surplus allows fairly large professional armies. But lack of guns (as an easy weapon to teach) prevents mass conscription.

- Armies use hot air balloons for scouting. (If we add some wind-control magic, they could also be used for travel by rich individuals.)

So, without having to turn your brain off, you get a world of classic fantasy that avoids the grim'n'gritty "everyone is a pustulent dirt farmer except nobles and tacked-on adventurers", and has a few exotic anachronisms (in both directions). That sounds like a fun place to adventure.

It also gives lots of options for "mundane loot" that is non-magical yet exciting, which I like.

Thoughts?
