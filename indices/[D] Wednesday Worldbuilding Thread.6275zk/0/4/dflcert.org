There is a minimum environmental iron necessary for human life, though, with 1-2 milligrams a day required. The body further has about 4-5 grams of iron. Since chemistry is still a thing that can happen in your world (and glass is far far more important than iron) it might be a project for an empire to refine iron out of biological sources. In fact, that's exactly what [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=P73REgj-3UE&feature=youtu.be][Primitive Technology]] did when he smelted iron. Bog iron is the same thing, just fossilized. Earth gets a lot of it's color from iron, from oarange, red, and yellow to brown and black.

Sulfur is also a problem. Namely, it's water soluble, so it will almost always form deposits. It's also even easier to obtain from organic sources, since humans need almost a gram of sulfur a day to survive.

Of course, both of those facts make iron and sulfur harder and more expensive to produce. However, it proves it's not impossible to accumulate iron and sulfur, and you should take that into consideration.
