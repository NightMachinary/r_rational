  Of course, both of those facts make iron and sulfur harder and more expensive to produce. However, it proves it's not impossible to accumulate iron and sulfur, and you should take that into consideration.

Yeah, good point. I don't think it's a big issue because the R&D costs would prevent anything really smart done with them. But we might see some noble houses owning an ancestral iron armour, fully lacquered and obsessively maintained to prevent degradation (an extreme version of Japan).
