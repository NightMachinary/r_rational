  Why can't you make a steam engine from stone?
#+end_quote

I'm hitting the limit of my engineering knowledge here; maybe you can.

Granting for the sake of argument that you could build a stone steam engine /if you knew exactly what you were doing/, I still don't think they would be invented. Steam engines went through a lot of R&D work, miniature prototypes etc. which is fairly cheap with abundant iron & copper but a massive barrier to entry if you're working with stone.

  Clockwork from tin?
#+end_quote

Doable. But nothing too complex (bump your watch and it's bricked), and nothing under high pressures. Not a ton of applications left. Astrolabes and sextans come to mind.

  Cables from silver?

Sure, but that seems very expensive. What purpose did you have in mind?
