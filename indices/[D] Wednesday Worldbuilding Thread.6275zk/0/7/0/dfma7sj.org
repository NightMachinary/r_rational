[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2711433/][See this paper]], "The Role of Iron in Neurodevelopment". The tl;dr is that iron is really important to the brain and if you want an alternate version of the brain that doesn't use iron the work required to make it so probably means that you're better off just saying "magic".

One interesting "tell" you could use to indicate that these people are different is that they might have different colored blood. Blood is red mostly because of the iron in hemoglobin, so you could have blue, copper-rich blood that uses hemocyanin (like a horseshoe crab) instead, which would greatly reduce the body's need for iron.
