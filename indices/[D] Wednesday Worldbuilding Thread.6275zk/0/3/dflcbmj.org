Uh, what about blood? Humans, and most other creatures with blood use iron as part of that biochemistry. We need a bit of it in food to not be anemic, which means we need a bit of it in the soil for it to get into the food chain, which means we need iron in our planetary crust, which undercuts the whole concept.
