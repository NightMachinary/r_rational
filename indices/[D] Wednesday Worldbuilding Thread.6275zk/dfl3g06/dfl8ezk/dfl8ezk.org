Cool! A few ideas/thoughts:

Wasn't this kinda the plot of that one weird Orson Scott Card book?

Obsidian is much more valuable for arrow tips than IRL.

Ceramics are definitely a place to explore, they can be sharp and strong and are pretty basic in material. Ceramic studded leather could work kinda like a modern bulletproof vest, etc.

Salt trade unaffected, basically.

Nicrome alloy wire to make ceramic composites

Gold Nickel alloys seem promising.

Basically, I think Ceramics are pretty powerful here.
