So, on the "humans need iron to live" issue ([[/u/callmebrotherg]], [[/u/buckykat]], [[/u/CreationBlues]]): this is true in our world, and means that a transplanted human would wither away. But a life form that evolved in this low-iron environment from the start (or one intelligently designed by gods) should do fine. Unless iron is absolutely necessary for higher brain functions somehow?

(If so, I'll just call magic on this. There's going to be snake-men and firebreathing lizards, I don't think iron deficiency is the hill to die on.)
