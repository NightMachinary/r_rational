Adobe is a mud brick. It's not fired, just dried. The adobe bricks are then held together with mud used as a mortar. It still has essentially all of the same benefits and disadvantages of wattle and daub construction. It's a weak material which rapidly erodes in rain, though the erosion can be managed with a shingled ceramic roof. It may afford you some brief protection in combat, but simple stone tools will chew through it easily.

Fired clay bricks would offer better protection, but you're not going to have affordable cement mortar to bind them together. You could use mud for mortar, but then you return to most of the same problems you had originally with adobe bricks. It would be tougher than dirt, but still wouldn't stand up to much abuse compared to a stone wall.

Very large clay bricks (like 6 ft. long by 3 ft. wide, by 2 ft. tall) would be about the toughest barrier you could make, although the sheer size would be very challenging. Pottery tends to explode when there's moisture trapped in it, and I have a hard time imaging how you'd make such a large brick and get it thoroughly dried for firing. It would probably also take a very long time and large amounts of fuel to fire bricks that large. The cost of all that might be enough to make it pointless.

The best cheap fortification I can imagine would be a wall made with clay bricks with shards of broken glass sticking out on one side, and a moat immediately in front of the wall. Even with smaller bricks and mud for mortar, you could still probably make that wall about 15-20 feet high. As long as the moat is mostly at least 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide, I suspect it would be a fairly challenging defense to overcome.
