Too expensive. You'd need to locate a limestone quarry and get people with metal tools to start collecting it for you. You'd need other people with metal tools to craft and maintain wagons and/or ships to transport the limestone. Also, you're either hiring very rich people who own their own metal tools, or you're buying the tools and hiring guards to make sure that your workers don't run off with the tools.
