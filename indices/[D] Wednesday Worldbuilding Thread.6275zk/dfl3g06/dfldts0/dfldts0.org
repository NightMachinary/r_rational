I like this a lot. A few thoughts and potential problems:

- Carpentry will be rudimentary and expensive. You can either buy extremely expensive cutting tools like saws and chisels, or be stuck working with stone axes. You can almost forget about nails and ironwood. Rudimentary spears made from branches should be easy enough though.

- Expensive and less common wagons and ships, due to the carpentry issue. This makes traders richer, but prices for everything will tend to be higher. Military logistics will have to rely heavily on locally sourcing materials as needed.

- Little limestone. Limestone quarries seem unlikely without affordable metal tools. This means that cement will be quite expensive.

- Expensive masonry, no castles. Stones that can be hand-manipulated and fractured against other stones will be fairly easy to shape. Arrowheads and spearpoints, no problem. However, large stone blocks are not going to be very feasible to carve out without extremely expensive metal tools. Without large stone blocks and cement, you're not going to have large stone structures. Bricks are also unlikely to see much use without cement.

- Ubiquitous wattle and daub. About the only materials which are plentiful and easily worked with affordable tools would be sticks and mud.

- Slings and oil-based incendiaries are also likely to be significant weapons in this setting. Slings and their ammo are dirt-cheap. Ceramic flasks of oil with lit rags should work well against the occasional noble with metal or ironwood plate armor.
