I think this might be the diagram?

I may have misinterpreted, the rotation itself may not have been symmetrical.

Edit: This is a 90 degree rotation, not a 45 degree one. 45 degrees looked weird, and by the time I went back and reread to make sure, I had flattened the layers already. Maybe it was supposed to look weird, but also considering they started rotating with respect to each other, it looked like this as some point.
