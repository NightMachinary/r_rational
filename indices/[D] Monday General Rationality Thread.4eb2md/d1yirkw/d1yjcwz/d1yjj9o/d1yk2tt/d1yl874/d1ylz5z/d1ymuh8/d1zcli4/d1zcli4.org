Yes it does say something about genetics? Granted it doesn't say quite as much as the platonic ideal of a perfect experiment where we can afford to throw ethics to the winds and abduct a pair of twins then keep them separated on the off-chance that they might develop schizophrenia, but that's not something scientists are allowed to do and would introduce other problematic variables besides.

Presumably your alternative explanation would be that schizophrenia is socially transmitted? Or perhaps something to do with how one is raised. Or that schizophrenia is completely randomly distributed amongst the population. In all three cases you would expect to /also/ see ~50% incidence of schizophrenia in one non-identical twins so long as the other twin has schizophrenia. This is not the case, in fact:

Therefore, schizophrenia had a great deal to do with genetics.
