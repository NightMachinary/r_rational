You misunderstand. In order:

No, because that is not a fundamental invalidating flaw. What you described are called confounding variables and can be controlled for using a reasonable sample size.

I believe I understand why you refuse to acknowledge it, I just don't think you have a good enough reason to throw out an entire field regardless of whether or not one part of that field has issues in your estimation. Nor is it pertinent to the singular point I was trying to make: that schizophrenia specifically and mental illness in general is at least partially genetic.

Relevant, yes. More important than other considerations? No.

Relevant to the treatment of schizophrenia, yes. Relevant to the question of whether or not it is at least partially genetic, no.

Obviously a rationalist should be convinced by a correct argument. I am not convinced you have one: you have not shown me one.

It is not a valid excuse, but it is how these things work, and I was trying to help you to understand this.

Yes: frankly I don't care about your claims of hypnotism. It is not relevant to my field, it is not relevant to my point. I care only about whether or not schizophrenia is at least partially genetic.

You also remember our previous argument, and yet you followed exactly the same path as last time. The path which has led, once again, to you convincing no-one and wasting your time. I am trying, this one last time, to help you realise that this method is doomed to failure. Understand: until you actually take the time to understand science you will not understand how to convince people such as these. You will also not understand how to tell if you are actually correct or just someone who has been suckered in by a charismatic speaker.

I know you think you know whether you are right or wrong already, but you do not. Just as teenagers we thought we knew everything, and we did not.

Learn to be more than you are, or do not. I care not. You now understand the outcomes each choice will lead to, and I will not make your choice for you.

If you want to talk more, I will talk only about whether or not schizophrenia is at least partially genetic. All other avenues of conversation will be unproductive.
