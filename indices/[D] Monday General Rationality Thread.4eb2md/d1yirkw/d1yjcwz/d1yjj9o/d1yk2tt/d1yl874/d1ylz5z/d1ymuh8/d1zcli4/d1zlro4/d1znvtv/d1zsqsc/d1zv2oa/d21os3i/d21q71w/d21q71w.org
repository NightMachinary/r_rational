  If you then carry on pretending you're looking at pure genetics, increasing the sample size will only make you more confidently wrong. An invalid study does not produce valid results.

To clarify: I have not at any time said that it is purely genetic.

I am curious, what kind of study would satisfy you? What experimental setup that is possible to implement would give a result that you would accept? How exactly would you control for environmental factors in order to meet your required standard of proof? Obviously such a standard exists, because you've been convinced by it, so what exactly would be required?
