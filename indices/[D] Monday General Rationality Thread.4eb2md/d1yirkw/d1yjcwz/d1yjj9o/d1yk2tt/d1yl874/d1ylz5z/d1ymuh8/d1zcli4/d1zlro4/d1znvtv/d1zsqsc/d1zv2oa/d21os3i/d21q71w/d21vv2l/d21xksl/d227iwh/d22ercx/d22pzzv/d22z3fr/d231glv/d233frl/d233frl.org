  I'm not entirely sure what you think you just did, but once again, you have completely and utterly failed to convince me that your silly little delusions have an impact on my life in any way, shape or form whatsoever.

It's not /supposed/ to impact your job. It's supposed to sit there and be true. You said:

#+begin_quote
  "How was it proven that schizophrenia is a hardware problem"
#+end_quote

And then later,

#+begin_quote
  "It's a catch-all label for vaguely superficially similar problems that implies exactly nothing about the underlying causes"
#+end_quote

So I decided to sit down and prove that to a certain extent that it is a hardware problem which can be predicted by genetics. I think that's what I did. Nothing more, nothing less. You did not make it easy for me. Maybe after however many years this type of research will get you the test you're after.

Edit: I suppose the most relevant way it impacts your job would be if you're talking to a patient and they ask about their odds of having kids who also have schizophrenia, you can now confidently turn around and say "13%". Presumably you don't want to go around mis-informing your patients about things which have a major impact on their lives.
