You're not wrong about any of that, I just left it out because of reasons ;P

[[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10813800/][Basic study:]] find some identical twins and some fraternal twins where at least one suffers from schizophrenia, figure out the likelyhood of both twins having schizophrenia /given that/ at least one has schizophreia. Notice that identical twins both have schizophrenia ~25% more often that fraternal twins. It's a fairly straightforwards study, rather hard to misinterpret though I can only see the abstract.
