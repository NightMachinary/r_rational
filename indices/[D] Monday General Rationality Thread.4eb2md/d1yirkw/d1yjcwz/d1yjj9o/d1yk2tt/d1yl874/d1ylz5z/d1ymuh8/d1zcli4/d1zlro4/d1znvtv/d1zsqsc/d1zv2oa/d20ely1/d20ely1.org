"whether or not schizophrenia is at least partly genetic"

- I place a VERY low p on the induction of schizophrenia in a person with no brain... with any environment what-so-ever.

- I place a non-negligible p on the (at least occasional) induction of schizophrenia in /people/ by means of arbitrary environments.

Therefor, I say with very high confidence that it is something about humans with brains which makes them, but not the brainless, get schizophrenia.

Less robustly, I suggest that it would be possible to genetically engineer an human which developed normally, but without a brain, and thus that the difference between brainless and typical humans amounts to (in this case) a genetic difference.

Thus, I say with high confidence that the propensity to develop schizophrenia is genetically determined.

:-p

But, more seriously, while it is true that confounding arises from sparsely populated experimental designs, which could have very few total tests, it is not generally true that increasing the number of replications of a design "unconfounds" the results.

For a trivial example, if the people running a study don't record the height of the participants playing basketball (at all!), they are going to have an awful time if they try to go back and determine if height makes you better at scoring.

For a less trivial and more relevant example, if you only record the scores of two groups:

- Those who are tall AND born on a Monday

- Those who are short AND born on a day other than Monday

...your study has no power to distinguish between the two effects. I mean, you'll reject the "Monday" hypothesis, because your prior for that effect is very small, and your statistically significant effect is ALSO explained by a variable that you have a large prior for... but that's different.

In a sense, then, all a twin study can do is make the alternative explanation for an effect sufficiently absurd that "genetics/womb environment" gets the nod...

...so, what particular flavor of twin study are we talking about in this schizophrenia study? There's different types, ya know...
