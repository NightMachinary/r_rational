That's great and helps me understand your job, but we weren't talking about your job and it doesn't really answer my question. Unfortunately, personal experience is notoriously bad at allowing professionals to make predictions outside of their very specific area of practical experience, while inflating their sense of confidence in their ability to make predictions. Inside of their area of expertise, they're golden, but as soon as they step outside that area even by an inch, it's no longer the case. You clearly believe in evidence at least in some forms, because you accept the evidence of your senses while improving yourself in your profession, and have been convinced by that evidence that your approach is correct. Tests are simply a standardised form of that.

All these politicans answers and skillful misdirections are making me think you don't actually believe the point you're arguing. You seem to be afraid of taking a testable position because you know that you'll then be proven wrong. So, we're talking money down, cards on the table, no weaselling out of this one. Name a fair test that would give an answer to this question, and predict what result we would find if your theory is correct.

To my current understanding your theory is that shizophrenia is 100% environmental effects - that is basically everything except genetics. This means that in your theory none of it is because of genetics. If this is not your theory, then don't hesitate to tell me.

For the record my theory is that shizophrenia is around 50% genetics and 50% environmental effects, +/- 30%. There: I've put down my testable prediction. If you are in fact right, then it should be simplicity itself to name a fair test that will prove it to be so, and I will then accept that you are correct.
