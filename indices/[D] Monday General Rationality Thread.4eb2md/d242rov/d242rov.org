I get the feeling that this is a question that has already been asked a lot, buut I also get the feeling this thread is all about people asking the sames questions over and over again, so here we go:

Do you know a good place to start for meditation? I'd feel dirty if I talked about "rational meditation", so I'll say I'm looking for methods to concentrate on myself for a given period of time that actually improves my thinking patterns in a quantifiable or verifiable way. Anyway, I'm looking for beginner techniques that can be understood without learning any jargon or fringe theories of the "your body is made of interconnected energies" type.
