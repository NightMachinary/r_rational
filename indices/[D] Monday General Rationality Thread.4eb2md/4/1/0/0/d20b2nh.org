You demonstrate a great level of introspection and self-understanding, that sounds extremely useful and hopefully it will help you! What can be the next step after understanding yourself? I have trouble imagining for example what I'd do to avoid the freezing you mentioned. Also do I understand correctly that you've been having daily sessions?
