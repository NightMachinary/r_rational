This is very much the case. Some people have bad reactions to certain antidepressants; I used to be on Zoloft and felt... pretty much nothing, neither sad nor happy, any time. Got off 'em a few years ago and seem to be doing just fine, which is good. On the plus side, it's made me more sensitive to the subtleties of my emotions, which has been quite useful.
