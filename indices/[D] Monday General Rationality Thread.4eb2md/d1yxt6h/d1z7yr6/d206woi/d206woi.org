And just today I realised why I perceive going into an unknown group so threatening, and why I am often confounded by seemingly simple opinion question (whats your favourite food? ----FREEZE----).

Had an emotionally unstable parent and I needed to model her perfectly to avoid setting her off. So anytime I go into a group I need to model all of them perfectly without any knowledge of them, which is of course not possible.

And the brainfreeze on opinions then is because I am frantically searching for the answer that will be able to appease the asker; since that task has no solution, I get the null response.
