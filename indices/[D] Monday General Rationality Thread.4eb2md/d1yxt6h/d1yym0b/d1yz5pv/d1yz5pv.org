My most obvious example is being whiney, eg. friends would often remark about me talking more than other people about small pains, headaches etc.

While writing my therapheutical/emotional CV or autobiography I stumbled upon the fact that both my parents were excellent physical caregivers. Always a bandaid at hand or ready to feel for fevery temperature with a hand.

However they were pretty bad at other positive types of care, esp. emotional, so of course I'd get positive feedback for being whiney, which pattern consisted well into adulthood.

Or the anorexic girl who is food-phobic.Being helpless about eating does give her a huge ton of positive attention; during dinner everybody crowds around her with her very visible symptoms and wants to help her.
