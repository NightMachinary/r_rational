  like how much of maladapted behaviour is misinterpreted attention seeking.

Could you give some examples. I sometimes have mild struggles with depression/social anxiety but I currently can't imagine anything that I do related to that that could be construed as attention seeking behavior.

Or do you mean being in actual need of positive attention and having those symptoms due to a lack of it?
