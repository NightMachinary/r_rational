Pretty sure that wouldn't work. In my experience, trying to motivate yourself by concentrating on a known motivating stimulus (inspiring figure, people you want to impress, etc) will only make the stimulus less motivating.

My vague understanding of it is that there is some sort of conservation of motivation going on, whether you call it willpower or energy or whatever, and that your best bet is better investing your motivation and making fallback plans for when you run out, rather than trying to make motivation appear when you don't have any.

This is all based on my own experience and that SSC article I read once, so I'm not actually sure any of it is true.
