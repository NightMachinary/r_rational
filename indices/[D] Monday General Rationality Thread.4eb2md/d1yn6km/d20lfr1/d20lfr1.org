Fuck. That sounds like a really good idea.

My go-to alarm technique: switch up the alarm sounds every few weeks. I find it's easier for me to ignore a noise in my sleep if I know it's an alarm. My brain is an arsehole.

Another thing I've been contemplating is sticking a picture of someone you want to impress (Thomas Edison, your six-year-old self, whatever) where you'll see it if you go to procrastinate. Then you have to imagine yourself explaining to that person why you're dicking around on reddit again instead of being productive. Obviously I haven't tried this yet because, well, here we are, on reddit.
