My entropy estimators really suck, and I have to switch to new ones, but having a first simulation result made me rethink what I was doing. Namely, I was doing it all wrong, measuring the uncertainty in the model rather than the information in the data. Now I've found better estimators and have a much better idea of what I really need to measure.

Yay.
