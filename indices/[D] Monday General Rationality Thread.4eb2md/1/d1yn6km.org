I'm thinking of starting a *Hell Week*. Read abut it on [[/r/getdisciplined]] and its a technique for avoiding procastination and dealing with bad habits through intensive avoidance of distracting stimulus.

It seems to work best when its a deeply ingrained bad habit. I think I may resort to this due to having spent all weekend watching Flash rather than working on productive stuff. Anyone knows of any other techniques to be more productive?

I tried Pomodoro but I always find a way to avoid using them and thus render them useless. Same with my alarms in the morning, tend to learn ways to crack them and fall asleep again...

Here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3ngae9/method_hellweek/][Hell-Week]] technique for those interested.
