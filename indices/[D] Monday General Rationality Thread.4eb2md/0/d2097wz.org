Rational fiction has ruined my enjoyment of standard media. I got two free tickets for the cinema this week, so I used them to watch Deadpool and Batman vs Superman. Deadpool was still fun because the jokes were fantastic, but I kept noticing plotholes. BvsS was a disaster for me. I spent the whole damn movie thinking about plotholes and characters holding the idiot ball, to the point that I didn't enjoy it at all.
