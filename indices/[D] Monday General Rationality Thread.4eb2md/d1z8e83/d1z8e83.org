I'm just wondering, how comfortable are people here talking about politics such as the current presidential election? I know that people don't want top-level posts, but would there be interest to talk about it in the Friday Threads?

I'm asking here and now, because it's related to the question, how should one start a potentially uncomfortable discussion that many people may not want to talk about such as personal issues or difficulties one is having in school/work/money?
