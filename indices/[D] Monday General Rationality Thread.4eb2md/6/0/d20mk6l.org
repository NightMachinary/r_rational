Ugh, it was so bad. Especially when compared to the first book Dune, which I was unaware was written by a different author when I started reading it. The villains in particular, were so comically evil that it broke my suspension of disbelief. It was like reading big, 30 foot high letters spelling out "THESE ROBOTS ARE EVIL, YOU SHOULD HATE THEM, THEY HAVE NO REDEEMING FEATURES!". I couldn't take them seriously.
