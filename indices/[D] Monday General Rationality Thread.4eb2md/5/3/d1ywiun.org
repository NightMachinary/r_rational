I follow a more ad-hoc approach than "go to gym and spend time at gym."

I leave a pull up bar propped against my bathroom door - if I could, I'd put it in a doorway permanently. I sprint instead of walk, and stand instead of sit. I also used to do random exercises should the mood have caught me - if I died too much in a multiplayer videogame, or the theme song to a show I was watching came on. I don't do this as much currently; once I became strong enough, I started working progressions to harder exercises that are fun to do, maybe once every few days.
