Casual workout partners are just as prone as you to skipping workouts for frivolous reasons.

What has worked best for me is to find an activity that I look forward to doing. Personally, I think [[/r/bodyweightfitness]] is great because it really scratches my "look at the cool shit I can do!" itch, and that keeps me coming back for more after every workout.
