I've been trying to form a habit of doing stretches and some simple excercizes for about ten minutes after waking up an before bed. Once I'm used to that, I can try gradually increasing those times.

Aside from that, I'm hyped for pokemon go because, among other reasons, that'll give me another reason to walk around.
