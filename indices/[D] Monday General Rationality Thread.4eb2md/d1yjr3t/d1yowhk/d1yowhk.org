First, it has to be something you enjoy doing. I enjoy heavy weight lifting, so that's what I do. I don't like running, so I don't do that. I despise organized sports of any sort, so I avoid them like the plague.

Second, the schedule and facilities should allow for no excuses, excluding injury. I have a gym I go to, which is close to my house, so there's no reason I can't go. It's indoors, so weather isn't an excuse. It's the first thing I do in the morning, so I can't claim I'm tired.

The only other advice I have is make it at least 3, if not 4 weeks, and it really does become a habit. You'll miss it when don't go.
