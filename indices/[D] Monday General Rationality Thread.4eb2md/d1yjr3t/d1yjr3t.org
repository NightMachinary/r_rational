What are good ways to motivate yourself to exercise regularly and consistently?

I have had trouble keeping a regular schedule. I may get 3-4 sessions in over a week as I planned, but invariably something happens to throw off my schedule, or I'm too tired or overworked one day. And then I find more excuses why it's ok to skip this one. And then I stop altogether, until I can work up the motivation to start again, sometimes a month or two later.
