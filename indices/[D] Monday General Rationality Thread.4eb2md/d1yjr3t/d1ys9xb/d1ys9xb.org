Start small and progressive overload it, dude. What you're trying to do is build a habit of exercising, and once that habit is built it becomes mostly effortless. But trying to jump in the deep end all at once is tricky, since getting proper exercise can be hard, especially when you're tired and overworked. So don't try to get "proper" exercise to start!

Instead, for the next couple weeks, put on your gym clothes and go to the gym, but don't actually do any exercise -- go get a drink of water and leave. This is a fairly trivial task and doesn't require much effort, so you should be able to properly motivate yourself to do it, even when you're not feeling like much. I mean, you're just driving to the gym (or w/e), it doesn't take long and you can do it even when exhausted. Then, once that habit is built and the action feels automatic and effortless, incrementally add another step -- now, instead of just going to the gym to drink some water, take a few minutes to do a few light stretches -- nothing strenuous, just roll around on the yoga mats or something. I personally like Joe DeFranco's Limber Eleven, but you can do the Agile Eight or the Fast Five to start, and slowly work your way up to the full Eleven. Once you finish stretching, go home. Do this for a few weeks until it too becomes an ingrained habit. Then slowly add a few exercises in. Consistently do those for a few weeks. Then add more exercises in, and more and more, until you're regularly and consistently doing whatever full workout routine you wanted to build a habit of in the first place.

Program your progressive overload in a way that best suits you. If consistently going to the gym in your workout clothes is too difficult and you can't keep it up for a few weeks in the first step, deload a bit and just put your workout clothes on at home, then take them off immediately after. Then upgrade it to going out to sit in the car for a minute or two, and then just drive to the gym and back, and then do the water at the gym thing, then walk around the gym aimlessly, then do stretches, then walk on a treadmill while listening to audiobooks, and so on. Baby steps, bro. Ease into it!
