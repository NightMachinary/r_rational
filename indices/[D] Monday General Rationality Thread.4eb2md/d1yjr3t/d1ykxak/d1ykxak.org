Two ways.

Find someone to be accountable to. You can either get an exercising buddy you don't want to disappoint by not showing up to the gym (you can even hire a trainer if you want this badly enough), or have a friend who you pay $20 every time you don't go as a punishment.

Another option is to make the exercising fun and engaging enough that you find yourself looking forward to going back again. This would be sports, martial arts, yoga, or some sort of activity you do as part of a group. This shifts your motivation from extrinsic (I'm only doing this because I want something else which is to be healthy) to intrinsic motivation (I'd want to keep doing this even if I don't get any benefit).
