I only watched one episode, but yes. In this episode, he /begins the episode/ by leaping off cliffs, and only survives because one of his buddies thought to bring a net. Later, he leaps off a similar cliff /while chasing an enemy/ and after complaining that he hadn't improved at all.

Flash is a moron and it's a wonder he hasn't exploded into a pile of blood and bone yet.
