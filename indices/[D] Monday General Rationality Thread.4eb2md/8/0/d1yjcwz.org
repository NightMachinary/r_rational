I took several psychology courses back at uni. One of them as evolutionary psychology. While nothing in psychology is as hard and immutable as parts of biology is (Haven't taken any physics/maths, which I hear are the hardest of the hard sciences), the evo psych isn't far down from the rest of the field, and considerably more based in reality than Micro Economics.

Also, genetics has plenty to say about psychology outside evolutionary psychology. Nature & Nurture interactions is a very real thing.
