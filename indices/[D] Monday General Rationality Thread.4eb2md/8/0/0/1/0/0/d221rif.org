Why wouldn't you be able to fix genetically-predisposed or determined cognitive issues with talk therapy? Phenotypic plasticity doesn't disappear just because your brain is involved.

Genetic counselling works by going over your DNA and your genetic predisposition for certain traits in combination with your partner's, to determine what your offspring's chance of having certain traits is (usually severe illnesses, because it's generally too expensive to use for small stuff). A genetic counselor helps people (usually as couples) weigh up their risk of having a kid with a particular trait and plan on how they'll go with caring for the kid.
