For some things, sure. If your biological relatives have schizophrenia, then your own prospects are considerably worse than mr random in the general population, whether raised by your biological parents or adopted at birth.

The brain is a machine. Your genes are the blueprints. You can have shitty hardware, you can have shitty software, and you can have a combination of the two. It's an extremely /complicated/ machine, to the point where psychology is going to remain its own field for centuries if not millennia, but ultimately it's just a slab of matter. Just like height and eye colour runs in the family, so does a wide variety of behavioural quirks and personality traits. That doesn't mean nature plays no role - for many things your genes provide the slate and life and the people around you paint it.
