You've proven that you hate being wrong, love to sling shit, and are allergic to debating honestly. I can tell I'm not, because when talking to other people with actual evidence I get proven wrong all the time, and I accept it when that happens.

You said up-thread you're an engineer? I'm an actual engineer. Engineers take the answers science gives us and apply them, you're a mechanic. You take a broken system and try to find a way to make it run again, and that's great. It's useful.

But you don't understand science, and you don't understand engineering, and so far as I can tell you don't really use rationality as anything other than a bludgeon. You pretend to, but it shows when you take the words for things you don't understand and use them anyway without knowing when it is and isn't appropriate, then get offended when people take you to task for the equivalent of holding a hammer by its head and using the shaft to hammer screws.

That's why you're on -8 up-thread. That's why you can't convince actual scientists.
