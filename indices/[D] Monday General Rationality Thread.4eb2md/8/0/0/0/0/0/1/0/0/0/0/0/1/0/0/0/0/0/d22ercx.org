That is not actually a fair test for a number of reasons. First, you know that no such test exists at the current time. Second, to prove your theory wrong you would need far less than 80% accuracy. Third, since 80% accuracy is on the highest end of my own prediction you're actually asking for me to show a greater effect than I in fact predicted. Fourth, because the various risk factor genes are are well... various, it is perfectly possible to show that individual genes are responsible for higher rates of schizophrenia while still not having an effective diagnostic tool, simply because people have not yet had the time to identify all of the risk factor genes.

So quit fucking around. I just asked you to give me a test that shows petrol can be used to move a cylinder, and then you asked me to show you a working internal combustion engine before you'll believe me.
