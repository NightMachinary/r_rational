  And since nobody else in this rationalist thread is willing to give a testable prediction

I made a testable prediction, and then I tested it. I did not know whether fraternal twins would have the same incidence as identical twins when I wrote that line, and then I looked it up (tested it), and it turned out my theory was correct.

I don't know why you seem to have decided that for your hypnosis thing to be right /the entirety of science/ must be wrong. It's quite confusing. Especially since we were just talking about schizophrenia and then you decided to go on an extremely long and completely irrelevant rant about hypnosis for no adequately explained reason.

We've had a similar conversation before, even. You appear to be repeating this pattern fairly frequently and it never convinces people, which would probably be quite frustrating. So I'm going to identify the things you need to understand to be able to convince people. From what I can tell:

You need to understand science, because you don't.

You need to understand how statistics works.

You need to understand how proving things works.

Because this? Even /if/ you were right, your current mode of argument is indistinguishable from the rantings of any number of internet denizens, and that makes it completely unconvincing to rationalists. Not because of who you sound like, but because it signals that you do not understand and thus we need spend extra time checking over all your conclusions before accepting any of them. You don't need a PhD, but you do need some understanding of how the truth-seeking part of science works.

Until you get that, you will bash your head into this wall again, and again, and again.
