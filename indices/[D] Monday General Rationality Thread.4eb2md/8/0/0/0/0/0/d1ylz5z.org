  You can't raise someone to be taller than their parents. When all three of your children grow up to be taller than you, that's a paternity suit. That's a genetic trait.

Or you grew up in pre-ww2 Japan and your kids had access to more and more nutritious food than you did growing up.

As for schizophrenia, [[http://www.schizophrenia.com/hypo.php#genes][twin studies]] show that if your identical twin has it, your chances are around 50%. Which is magnitudes above the general population.

It's seldom /100%/ biology. Typically it's a mix, where certain genes are associated with elevated risk. There are also non-genetic biological factors, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder][Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder]], which /will/ make you more aggressive, impulsive and short tempered, and usually lowers your intelligence to boot. That's a transformation of your psychology that just plain sucks, and it can't be cured. You just have to work extra hard to help the child work around their behavioural problems if they are to have a decent life and not end up in jail for hurting someone they were angry with.
