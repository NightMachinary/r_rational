Downs is caused by a second copy of chromosome 23 and almost no environmental factors at all, it should be no surprise that you can detect that pretty easy. Since as you've noticed Schizophrenia seems likely to be an umbrella term referring to a number of different disorders with different genetic factors all of which leading to somewhat similar-ish symptoms, it should also be no surprise that this is a more difficult proposition.

Still, distinguishing that it is genetics at all, /that/ I can do:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v18/n4/full/gim201584a.html][People lacking a section of chromosome known as 22q11.2 have a 20-25% chance of Schizophrenia.]]

I think you'll find graph 2 on this next one quite informative:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.schizophrenia.com/research/hereditygen.htm][Those who have a third degree relative with schizophrenia are twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those in the general population. Those with a second degree relative have a several-fold higher incidence of schizophrenia than the general population, and first degree relatives have an incidence of schizophrenia an order of magnitude higher than the general populace.]]

Hopefully I've proven my point, these next ones are less proof and more just there to give an idea of the number of different genes that seem likely to have a causative effect.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Genetic][Many genes are believed to be involved in Schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. Many possible candidates have been proposed, including specific copy number variations, NOTCH4, and histone protein loci. A number of genome-wide associations such as zinc finger protein 804A have also been linked.]]

  [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15263907][Other genes that are associated with Schizophrnia include including neuregulin, dysbindin, COMT, DISC1, RGS4, GRM3, and G72]]

Finally a note from Schizophrenia.com on the best current methods for calculating risk:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.schizophrenia.com/szgencounsel.htm][Calculating the recurrence risks (or the risk that schizohprenia will re-occur in a family - either in future children a couple may have, or in other existing family members) is complex. It is not yet possible to test whether an individual has specific genes (though this is changing quickly), which would increase their chances of developing schizophrenia. Therefore genetic counselors must use empiric data (figures obtained by counting how many people with schizophrenia also have specific relatives with schizophrenia), coupled with their knowledge of the client's family history. Specifically a genetic counselor may calculate risks of developing schizophrenia by using a Bayesian calculation (a type of statistical estimate) on the basis of empiric data and the client's family mental health history, alternatively it may be possible for a genetic counselor to see a clear inheritance pattern from the family history. Generally, the family history review will try to look back for three or four generations.]]
