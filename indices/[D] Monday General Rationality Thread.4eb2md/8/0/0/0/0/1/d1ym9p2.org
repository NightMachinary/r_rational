You can definitely have children grow up to be taller than both of their parents, I don't know what gave you the ridiculous idea that you couldn't. Height is not just genetics (which will be more complicated than simple, Mendelian models anyway), it's affected by nutrition, injuries, and other stresses on a child's body as it develops.
