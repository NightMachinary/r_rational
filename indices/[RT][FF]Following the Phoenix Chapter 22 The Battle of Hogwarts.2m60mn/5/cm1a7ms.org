Why don't they just disillusion themselves?

Seems way smarter than doing the whole area protection thing, speaking of which, since when could you know that you'd been moved or turned around by that?

Why was there a military brigade moving through that forest anyway, and why aren't they capturing wizards to interrogate, they're clearly on the downside of information warfare, couldn't they see that if Cornelius could do that then shouldn't they assume anyone can teleport into the middle of Parliament and kill them all? Unless they can trace wizards attacking is pretty pointless.
