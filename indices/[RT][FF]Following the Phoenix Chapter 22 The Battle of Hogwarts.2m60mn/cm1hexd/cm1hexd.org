On a related note, I think the Author is forgetting that this fic operates on Harry Potter time, in 1991.

In 1991, computer technology was /significantly/ (on the order of [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Transistor_Count_and_Moore%27s_Law_-_2011.svg/667px-Transistor_Count_and_Moore%27s_Law_-_2011.svg.png][several thousand times]]) less powerful than modern hardware.

So the computers involved are running on 20 megs of hot ram, and use 5 1/2 inch floppies for storage.

People do not carry ubiqutous cell-phone cameras, the average camcorder is shoulder mounted and records on a VHS tape.

No modern drone-carriers and instant facial recognition software.

No nation at that time had the ability to instantly check through satellite imaging to find a ~1 acre square in Scotland which showed up on a computer map as blank terrain but showed to human eyes as normal. I'm not even sure that the resolution and software is good enough to do that in *under a week* /today/.

In short, this whole chapter just torched my suspension of disbelief.
