I can assure you, the author is entirely aware of the time period (even if she missed certain unfortunate details about the GPS program).

  So the computers involved are running on 20 megs of hot ram, and use 5 1/2 inch floppies for storage.

You are assuming that the military uses the kind of average PC that's sold in a shop, which is quite an assumption. :P

  No modern drone-carriers and instant facial recognition software.

The word "drone" was badly chosen, and obviously facial recognition isn't used here. This is just meant as a missile or somewhat like that.

  People do not carry ubiqutous cell-phone cameras

There is no part assuming they do. I guess this refers to some tiny fraction of the billions of people on earth managing to videotape the events? Given the situation, I'd imagine that there would be plenty - my family certainly had a handheld camera at the time, and there were security cameras in shops.

  I'm not even sure that the resolution and software is good enough to do that in under a week today.

Whyever not? Depending on the map format and exactly how "blank" looks to the computer, and assuming there exists a programmer experienced with running terrain scans on it, I'm fairly sure it wouldn't take much more than an hour to wite the C-code, even if it must be fast enough to work perfectly well on the computers at the time.

The question is, of course, how they knew what to look for in the first place, but I imagine the military has been aware of anomalies in their satellite data for a while - if there's mysterious places where the terrain doesn't look the same to the human eye as to the computer, they're probably going to notice that such places exist in Russia first, and either assume that someone tampered with the satellite data or that there is strange technology going on.

I do realize that many things, like GPS, were restricted to the US military at the time, but I made the assumption that they shared it with their allies in the cold war., especially the ones who held nukes and might be called upon in an instant to join them in an attack.
