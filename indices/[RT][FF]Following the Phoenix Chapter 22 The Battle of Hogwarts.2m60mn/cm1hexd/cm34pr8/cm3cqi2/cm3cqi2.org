GPS wasn't just restricted, it wasn't finished until 1993.

The military is not that far ahead of the commercial sphere. General wisdom is about 2-4 years ahead tops. That's still not good enough for the amount of computation this type of plan would require. GUIs were mostly greyscale.

But, don't take my word for it. Luckily, we have actual historical record! Because if you remember, there was a war on at the time. The Gulf War - Desert Storm.

  A total of four imaging intelligence satellites were operational in orbit during the initial phases of the Kuwait crisis: three Kennan KH-11s and one Lacrosse imaging radar satellite. All of these satellites have a 24 hours capability, with night coverage is provided by some type of image intensifier system. These satellites use some sort of starlight scope -- the same sort of night vision goggles that helicopter pilots are used. Or the satellite sensor can blend the pixels on the CCD to increase the gain to deal with the lower ambient light in the evening.

I assume these are only the ones near Kuwait.

Here by the way [[http://fas.org/irp/imint/kh-11.htm][Link]] are examples of photos taken by a KH-11 satellite. You will notice they are all greyscale.

You will also notice that:

  The optical satellites are flying at an altitudes of from 400 to 800 kilometers have a swath width of from 600 to 1000 kilometers to either side of their ground track. The Lacrosse imaging radar satellite is flying at a little less than 800 kilometers, and is taking pictures as much as a 1000 kilometers off of their ground track. When these satellites are flying over Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, the optical satellite is going to be able to photograph the area between Kuwait and Baghdad, and the radar satellite and the higher flying optical satellites can photograph Baghdad.

Plane change maneuvers are expensive in terms of fuel and take a while:

  In general, these satellites have maneuvered very infrequently for drag-makeup, usually at intervals of several months, and as a result of tracking by amateur astronomers, precise orbital elements for five of these seven satellites have been made available for use in this analysis.

[[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/grayspc/dstorm/dstorm.htm][This]] suggests satellites were better ( and I trust this source more), but still not below 5M resolution on the best state of the art types (Meteor Prioida advertises 5 meter resolution, but that is a Russian bird) They will have had advanced imaging satellites at the time as well, with better imaging than the KH-11's. It is specifically mentioned that there is a tradeoff between resolution and area covered.

There simply is *NOT* a worldwide system of surveillance satellites in existence at the time with the ability to survey the ENTIRE globe, even if there was the technological capability to go through the data. They were mostly in oribits around potential hotspots and intelligence targets.

Changing this takes months.

The assumption that an Unplottable spell makes something just appear as whitespace on a map is idiotic. That defeats the whole purpose of the spell, which is to HIDE the location of a thing. A giant white space on a map is a flashing alert sign. It would be more likely for it to appear as undifferentiated natural land.

Then, we have Muggles being able to notice and ignore Someone Else's Problem Field type spells, simply because they know about them, despite /those same spells being noted as being effective on wizards who do know about them/ in canon.

Then, even if we assume that a worldwide surveillance network that wouldn't work with even early 2000's level technology base actually does work, we need to assume:

1. It operates so fast that it can detect a small area in a random forest in England in several hours.

2. The teachers escaping from the school were idiotic enough to use the same type of ward - *which they knew had been compromised* - again at the new location.

3. Some of those teachers had already survived a decade of guirella fighting between wizards who were actively trying to murder them, and yet they did not post proper guards, did not react first while the muggles spent minutes fucking around at the edge of the wards, did not have prepared safehouses when they knew Voldemort was back. In short, they were all holding enormous idiot balls.

4. Random Group of Skinheads #54678, in England, where gun control is the order of the day, have access to heavy ordnance, and military intelligence so advanced that the mere *knowledge of its ability and existence* would be a state secret.

5. Said group of drunken hicks managed to then get the drop on said guirella fighters.

6. Harry does nothing effective, does not object to any of the above, and generally acts shell shocked in a situation where we normally would see him resort to his dark side. Thus, even our protagonist holds the Idiot Ball.

Then, if we accept all of this, we still have to believe that either Hogwarts was destroyed by a conventional missile, or a government authorized a nuclear launch on its own soil. I could tell you about the results of nuclear fallout from a detonation in Scotland, at a high point in the hills, well above sea level such that it is unlikely to settle and more likely to be carried away, and the likely trajectories of the wind-borne poison therefrom, but I think that would be clear.
