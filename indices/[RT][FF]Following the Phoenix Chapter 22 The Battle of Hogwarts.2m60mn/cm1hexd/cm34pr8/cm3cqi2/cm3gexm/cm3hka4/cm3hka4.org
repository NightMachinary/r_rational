Again, we can't do that now. You can program a computer to find, say a white space of a specific type or repeating pattern, if that is what shows up, but if it is not regular or consistent it is still a difficult task. And by definition they can't know what they are looking for, because /they can't see it./

Most intelligence photos of the time were still printed out and analyzed by actual people, intelligence agents, ostensibly because the technology was not as advanced as it is now when it comes to image recognition.
