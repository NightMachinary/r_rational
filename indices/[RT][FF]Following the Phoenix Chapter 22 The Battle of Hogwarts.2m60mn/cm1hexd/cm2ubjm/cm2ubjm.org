3^{1/2} inch, not 5^{1/2} (which was not a size that existed anyway AFAIK. 5^{1/4} did). By the time 386s were around, 5^{1/4} floppies were all well on the way out, 3^{1/2} inch was practically standard; By the time 486s were reasonably common (1991, which is about the time that 20mb of memory became plausible, if rather high end), 5^{1/4} inch floppies were practically relics.

A rough landmark is Windows 3.1, which was released in 1992 and was only available on 3^{1/2} floppies.

5^{1/4} floppies belong chronologically to the 8086 and 286 era.
