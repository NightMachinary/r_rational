Okay, so you're a violent mob which has little-to-no understanding how magic works, and you want to kill some wizards. Any wizards, you aren't in the mood to be specific.

Do you target:

A. Magically warded undetectable wizard schools in the countryside.

/or/

B. The local occult curios store (which you have no idea that it is actually run by clueless muggles), which you've always suspected to have politically questionable clientele.

We have to remember that if the HPMORverse even moderately resembles our own, for every real wizard out there, there are a lot of things which just /seem/ vaguely supernatural, and these are easier to go after, both politically and tactically. Indeed, if you are a scared real wizard who wants this to just go away, strategic manipulation towards fake targets keeps a lot of pressure off of you while the muggles kill themselves.

And now, let's say you are a nigh-immortal wizard that could survive a nuclear war (e.g. Voldemort). The few things which could kill or incapacitate you are exotic muggle disasters in the relatively near future (runaway superintelligent AI, etc.)

Throwing back the wider world a few centuries, while preserving knowledge among yourself, and possibly, but not necessarily, your easily-controllable proxy could be tactically advantageous, buying much needed time to validate that your techno-magical singularity won't go foom or be disrupted by something out of your control.

You would have already started the war and taken over the country, but the dementors were a problem you couldn't quite handle until HJPEV showed up. A wizard-ruled world that you don't have to manage on a day-to-day basis, because it is paranoid and focused on control of muggles, is a significant, time-saving bonus.
