Yes, good point too about the gun control law. I've really enjoyed this fanfic but the more I think of it, the more I feel that this chapter needs some tweaking and editing to bring it to the level of the rest.

The mob/group of skinheads come out of nowhere and there's no explanation for them to be there or to have this amount of weapon. Even if Quirrel influenced them to come there, it seems unlikely he would have access to Muggle weapons to equip them. It's also very risky and seems out of character for him. Too many things could go wrong for this to be his plan.
