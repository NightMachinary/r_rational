Yeah, and gun control in England is pretty much /yes/. To the point that most /police officers/ do not carry sidearms.

I am not seeing how a group of 'skinheads' have that much heavy ordnance, and connection to sources of military information, and happened to just by chance be going by the forest where the students were. And just happen to kill two people very important to both of the main heroes.

Unless we assume Quirrel did it, but it's becoming a bit much at this point, that excuse.

I cannot see Quirrel doing all of this. For one, in canon he very clearly /does not want/ the Muggles to use nuclear weapons ever, and the level of paranoia and fear at this point would almost necessitate it.

Also, as the top comment here indicates, this seems like a great way to accidentally get Harry killed.

Significantly more than 2 things had to go right for this plan, is what I'm saying.
