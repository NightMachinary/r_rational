Thank you for the information about satellite images, that /is/ useful. :)

However, just a few points as to the rest of the remarks:

#+begin_quote
  The assumption that an Unplottable spell makes something just appear as whitespace on a map is idiotic.
#+end_quote

Not if it's whitespace which the human mind completely refuses to register and automatically fills in with a continuation of the terrain around it.

#+begin_quote
  Then, we have Muggles being able to notice and ignore Someone Else's Problem Field type spells
#+end_quote

No, they are able to tell their computer 'find something that seems off and tell us nothing more than coordinates".

#+begin_quote
  The teachers escaping from the school were idiotic enough to use the same type of ward - which they knew had been compromised - again at the new location.
#+end_quote

Of course not. Nobody's claiming that the mob found the wizards via satellite images. The only claim is that Hogwarts was found in this way. As for how the mob did, in fact, find the children... is it really so strange that the viewpoint stays with a character who doesn't know for one chapter? :(

#+begin_quote
  Thus, even our protagonist holds the Idiot Ball.
#+end_quote

So you're saying that the situation, which you have just described as /completely blatantly impossible/ with the given information, shocks the protagonist into inaction for about five minutes at most, and therefore he's an idiot? I would say that that is rather unfair to him. :P
