As a small factoid supporting this, GPS wasn't fully operational (24 satellites in orbit) till 1993, and wasn't complete til 1995 (when they had the specified 3 spares). And even then the accuracy was significantly reduced for everyone but the US military till 2000 when they turned off the encryption.

Google, the company, didn't exist till 1997 and didn't introduce google maps till 2005, even if we let the military have a 10 year head start on digital maps/satellite images they're still 4 years too late.

The only way I can see this making sense is if Quirell is behind it and as others have pointed out it is a huge risk. If he is worried about nuclear war, mind controlling the military into missile attacks is probably not a good idea. Risk to Harry may be mitigated by time travel, full military control would likely take more than 6hrs.
