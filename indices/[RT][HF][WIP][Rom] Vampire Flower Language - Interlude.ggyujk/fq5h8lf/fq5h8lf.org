Nobody made suggestions for what we put in this interlude, so we decided to do William yeeting axes.

Of course, it comes with a side of character development and a teaspoon of worldbuilding.

(Note that I've named the 'universe' that VFL and my one-shot occur in Electrum, so that's gotta be significant, somehow, right? Mostly in my own head, tbh)

Hope you silent masses are enjoying it; there's a discord now (linked on AO3) which, while being really self-indulgent, is actually a nice, quiet little chatroom.
