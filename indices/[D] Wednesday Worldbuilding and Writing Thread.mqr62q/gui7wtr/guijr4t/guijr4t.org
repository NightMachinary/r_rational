Either the King requires more XP per level, or the King is going to level /real/ fast. If the latter and levels have the usual superlinear effect on capability, the capability gap between commoners and nobility is going to be simply ludicrous as a result.

Lone hermits making their own gear and solo-clearing dungeons are going to be gods amongst mortals.
