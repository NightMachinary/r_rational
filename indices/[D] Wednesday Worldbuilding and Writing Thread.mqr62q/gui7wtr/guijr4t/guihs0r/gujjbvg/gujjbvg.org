Healers are hard to quantify wrt to their contribution. Would they steal the XP from those they heal? A smith's share would not be flat of course. What I had in mind was that if a warrior is given The Sword of Ogreslaying and slays a bunch of ogres, most contribution should go to the smith not the warrior.
