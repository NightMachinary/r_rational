Let's consider a full example.

Sir Knightsalot defeated the Monster.

This defeat had the following direct contributors:

- King Rulesalot has made a number of policy decisions over the years that incentivise royal knights slaying monsters, but only if those monsters kill people; monsters who do not kill people are left alone to breed more monsters on their own.
- A peasant left a sign by the road, directing people towards the monster's lair. Three other peasants gave Sir Knightsalot verbal directions during his quest.
- Sir Knightsalot's armour and sword came from the Royal Armoury. He has no idea which blacksmiths made them; there are several smiths working for the Armoury.
- His food was provided by the Royal Order of Knights, who draw the required money from a Royal Account, which comes from the Kingdom's taxes.
- He was trained by the Royal Trainer, a position made by the King to ensure that all Royal Knights meet certain minimal standards.
- He was healed after the fight by a doctor from the Royal Physician Corps; he has been healed in this way after previous fights as well.
- Mage Castsalot, from the Royal Mage Corps, provided three different buff spells and debuffed the Monster as well.

So. That's quite a broad base, already. I'm thinking that Sit Knightsalot would get the majority of the XP, while Mage Castsalot would also get a substantial portion. Next in total XP gained would probably be King Rulesalot; because he has put in place a /lot/ of Royal Institutions which have helped Sir Knightsalot to become what he is. After that would probably come one or two of the Royal Blacksmiths, followed by the peasants who verbally directed him, followed by the peasant who put up the last directional sign. Followed by a tiny XP boost to everyone who paid their taxes for the year...
