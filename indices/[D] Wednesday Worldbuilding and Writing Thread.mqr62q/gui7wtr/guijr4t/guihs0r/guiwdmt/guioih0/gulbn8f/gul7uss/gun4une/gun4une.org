How transparent is this process? If the effect is transparent it gives an effective way to evaluate people further up the XP chain. Would having a minimum XP kickback from people further down the line be needed as a sign of competence? Changing your doctor or prime minister because they are not leveling up enough?

Does XP only come from killing monsters or do non-combat actions produce XP as well? Feudal society would be very different if monster killing was the only XP. Everyone supports the local knight/adventurer to be his best but the knight would be seen as neglecting his duty if he doesn't slay monsters to level up everyone else. Kingdoms that periodically go to war to level their populations? Would it be better to be a peasant on a knight, wizard, or cleric's land? You can live freely in some places without leveling or choose to be a serf and level. A "stock market" of investing in potential heroes? Everyone puts a bit of polish on the knights armor to get some XP in the coming battle? That could be effective or symbolic action. The lady gives her favorite knight a token to inspire him in the coming battle but gets no XP back so she accuses him of being unfaithful?

Does the effect diminish over time? Does the smith that made the sword get progressively less XP from it just because? Does the smith get less XP as the warrior carriers around the because the warrior is maintaining it and taking the sword to useful areas becomes a bigger contribution? Equipment reuse and heirloom items to keep XP in the family/group? Would the smith get less XP is there was a near by stick the warrior could have picked up instead even if the warrior never notices it? Does a sandwich maker get less XP if the sandwich becomes stale and less tasty or less nutritious?

How fair and all knowing is the process? Does it measure what is useful and effective contribution or does it measure time, effort, and involvement? Should you try and involve yourself in every stage to minimize XP lose? Can I run a lawless town so my law abiding friend and neigh can gain XP by recovering "lost" goods and arresting law breakers? In short can the system be gamed by making problems or allowing problems to exist? Can a king make small changes to a laws so they get the XP rather than his predecessor or ministers? Can you loophole yourself into the process at a low level? If you teach someone to read or walk do you get an XP kickback for everything they do involving reading or walking? The king technically owns all the land so he gets more XP than in a different system where everyone owned their own land? Why does the king get XP for something they were not involved in anyways? Because they think they were? The gods support monarchy and made it so? Because the king created a system of laws and institutions that were effective and benefited the end XP gainer directly or indirectly?

Is it rude to offer help because you take someone else's XP or rude to refuse help because you deny the other person XP? How do people (and the system) react to unwanted help?

Are non-contributing members of a community shamed, shunned, or exiled because they do not add to the value chain? How are low level people treated? Does the society as a whole want everyone involved? Are you only consider to be a member of the community when you gain XP from contributing to the local hero/knight? Monsters that give XP are both a threat and a resource to be managed for the community.

Or is the XP chain for each warrior closely guarded? Secret mines and fields to supply the hero so no one can sneak in and contribute. Large baggage trains of goods and support personnel follow each warrior to make sure no "leeches" steal XP?

Does a master swordsman keep more XP because he depends more on his skill then the weapon? Or does the quality of his gear have set XP drain regardless of his own skill?

Squires and apprentices maintain their masters' equipment to get their initial levels by XP drain. Is apprenticeship over when your master sees that you are giving more XP then you are draining?

Any institution that interrupts the XP flow between the top and bottom would be heavily regulated (if possible) by those at the top. Historically guilds, person, or titles that had rights to produce or sell certain goods were a big deal, the desire to control such activities could be greatly multiplied with XP in the mix.

A selfish teacher teacher tell you what he knows for maximum XP kickback while a good teacher put you on the path to discovery so the student keeps the max XP possible.

Are gods people that have just been on the top of the XP chain for a very long time? Do pray to gods for help and give them thanks because that creates the XP funnel to the gods?
