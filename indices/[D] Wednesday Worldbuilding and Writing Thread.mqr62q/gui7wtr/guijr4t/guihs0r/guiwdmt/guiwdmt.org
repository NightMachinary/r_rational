If people are aware of the XP gain and agree with how it's shared out, it could also serve as a way to decide how to split the loot. To take this to an extreme, if there's an accurate measure of XP available then the state might pay people 1GP per XP for their services to civilization in a reversal of the older editions of D&D where escaping the dungeon with gold earned XP.

If people disagree with how the XP is shared, there might be traditions that evolved to mitigate the issues. For example, if preparation before a fight is overvalued compared to healing afterwards, healers might also take on the role of squires to the warriors so that their XP share better reflects their contribution.

If people are conscious of their XP gain, especially if they can deduce what they earned it for, that could lead to significantly more experimentation among supporters, as teachers can learn which types of lessons earn them the most XP once their students head down to the dungeon, and iterate towards an optimised adventurer curriculum.

On the other hand, it could lead to a winner-takes-all situation: if one blacksmith is five levels higher, they'll get a lot more business even if they earned those levels through luck, and that extra business will only increase their level advantage further.

Do the dead get a share of the XP? If they don't, that incentivises the party to kill anyone who contributes before the earnings occur. If they do, that encourages everyone to come up with new techniques, strike out into new lands, and otherwise avoid relying on previous generations who leech their XP without benefiting from it. That could potentially lead to a justification for that discredited trope of the "hard times make strong men" cycle: hard times means little support from previous generations and so a larger share of the XP, but that then puts subsequent generations in a better position and so they earn less XP until the lack of levels causes society to collapse again.
