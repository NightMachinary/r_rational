If I was the DM or god of such a world, I would probably put in some kind of tax or experience sink to keep the system from breaking. Perhaps the King and the commoners have abilities that use up or sacrifice xp/levels to get something they want or that it is necessary to survive. The world had an apocalypse and normal farming just doesn't work anymore so they have to sacrifice xp to the god of harvest to instantly grow some food. You can sacrifice xp to this god for more youth, for a magic ability to this other god, and so on. Still wouldn't be perfect with plenty of other potential issues but might work.
