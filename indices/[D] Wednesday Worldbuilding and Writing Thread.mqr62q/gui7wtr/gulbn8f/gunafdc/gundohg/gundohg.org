Since this is all hypothetical without an actual example, it all depends on implementation.

With an interface, and logs, then everyone has perfect information. They know where they're getting exp from.

If there's an interface but no logs then it depends on the granularity of your interface. If you have levels and current exp on your interface, it'll be quite easy to determine the transitive exp gains with the assumption that exp gains and distribution is instantaneous. If you only have current level but no current exp, then it'll be harder to correlate that you're getting transitive exp from killing or fighting, but it's still within the realm of possiblity.

Lastly, if there's no interface but levels and exp still exists, then people would figure out that killing mobs makes you stronger than just working out and doing pushups. Transitively gaining exp still exists and people in certain non-combat jobs would get stronger than others. That difference would eventually be explored and understood. People who interact with the "hero" would become stronger faster than others. The exact correlation of slaying to receiving transitive exp may not be discovered, but really, what's the difference? If you interact with strong people, or interact with large amounts of people, you get stronger faster.
