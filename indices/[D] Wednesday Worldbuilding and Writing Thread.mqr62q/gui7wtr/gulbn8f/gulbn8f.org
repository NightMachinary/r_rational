Taken to the extreme extreme, everyone in the world would gain a piece of the pie. Every single interaction is driven by a previous interaction. The guide ate a pie cooked by a baker who received their flour by a merchant who traded for the flour from a farmer who inherited their land from... etc. etc.

The ramifications would depend on the split. If the farmer above gained a small fraction of an exp point, it'd basically be negligible. If the farmer gained 1 exp point, then there'd be a lot more farmers who are buff and high level because their tendrils would affect nearly every single outcome in the world.
