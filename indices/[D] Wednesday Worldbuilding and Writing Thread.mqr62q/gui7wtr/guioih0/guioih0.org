I mean, if balanced properly, this could be a good way to provide non-combatants with XP, and they don't even need to be aware of it. People just assume that it's their natural progression in their careers--eg a successful blacksmith will be gaining more XP as he grows older. He thinks this is because he's being rewarded for doing good work, when really, it's that his products are widely used.
