A party defeats a monster and gains XP. Dividing XP equally rewards freeloaders and dividing by damage shafts support classes. Dividing by contribution makes the most sense.

What happens when we take this idea to its limit?

A warrior kills a monster and gains XP. A portion of it goes to his mage buddy who hasted him. Some goes to his trainers. Some goes to the smith who forged his weapon and armor. Some goes to the peasant who guided him to the lair but stood aside. Some goes to the King who is entitled to a portion of his subjects' XP.

What would be the ramifications and knock-on effects?
