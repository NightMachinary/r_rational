Significantly inspired by [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia][Virtuous Sons]], a xianxia story based off of Greco-Roman history, I've been working a bit on a Norse-Icelandic mythological version, mainly just to see if it takes me anywhere interesting. I have a few notes about it down - berserkers (and the various berserker cults) are one 'path,' the 9 worlds are the cultivation stages, that kind of thing.

From there I've been working on an idea where Ragnarok occurred in the distant past, and the remnants of those killed form the basis of many other practices - the One-Handed God, for example, is Tyr (who got his hand bitten off by Fenrir), and adherents of his cult inscribe the Tiwaz rune (synonymous with war and victory, kinda) on their bodies for increased power.

There are various other aspects as well, but what would you expect to see in a Norse mythological xianxia?
