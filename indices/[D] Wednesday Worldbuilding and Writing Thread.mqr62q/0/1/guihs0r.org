A lot of it depends on any misalignment between the XP weighting and the effort a support class needs to put in / supply of those support classes. For example, if a blacksmith can fully supply 10 adventurers and gets 20% of the XP, then blacksmiths are very powerful folks. That'd incentivize more people to become blacksmiths, which would bring their share of the XP down, but it's a skilled trade that's hard to get into, so they'd still come out ahead.

It's also going to depend on what classes exist / what XP gets you. For example, some of the XP goes to the farmers who fed everyone involved. They're vitally important. But they're also fungible, so we wouldn't expect any one farmer to get a lot of XP, just a world where farmers are a bit more buff than normal. But if they're actually gaining levels in a Farmer class that makes them wildly more productive, then a randomly chosen food item is more likely to have come from a powerful Farmer, so they experience lopsided XP growth. Or if the Farmer class makes their crops somehow preferable to adventurers, then they also experience a lopsided XP growth, the same way blacksmiths do.

Since you specified the king gets a portion of the subjects' XP, that does seem like a candidate for runaway XP growth. It doesn't take any particular effort for a king to rule over two adventuring parties instead of one. And since they're amassing direct personal power in the form of XP, that actually reduces the difficulty of being a king. It's a lot easier to make sure your supporters always have more power than any pretenders if you (your most stalwart supporter) personally count extra.
