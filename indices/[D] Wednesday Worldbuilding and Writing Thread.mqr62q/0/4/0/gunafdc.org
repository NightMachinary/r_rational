The problem I can see with that is how do people work out that slaying momsters, or whatever the xp source is, actually is the xp source? If everyone is getting xp constantly from the actions of everyone else, the world is a very large place after all, pinpointing when your own actions of slaying an ogre contributed is nigh impossible without one guy with a sword having a larger share than the contributions of literally the entirety of society up to this point (even limited to those that are alive still, that is a lot), since everyone is connected to and supported by those around them, and those people the others around them, and so on and so on.

That said, if killing people would count, the growth that occurs alongside a major battle might tip people off, but maybe it would get dismissed as combat xp rather than openning the door to murdering people for xp gain. Although the story prompt of "a major war happened, and full share xp litrpg world had its top brass realise that wars let you grind xp" couod be interesting, replace the "wars" with "massive bloodshed" and you've got people committing genocide for power growth, but that sounds grimdark as fuck though.
