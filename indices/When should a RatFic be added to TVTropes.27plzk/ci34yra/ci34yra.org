/TVtropes, there is no such thing as notoriety./

If you enjoy the work it is well within your rights to create a fanfic recommendation/page to which you can add the tropes you see. Others see it and review the works and make additions as they see it/refine the tropes already present. I was thinking about starting up a page for these works as well, for I keep popping over to see if they have been made.

In fact, I am going to go right over and do so now. Shut up and just do it, as the saying goes.

Edit: Just to update you guys. I am going to create the pages under the YKTTW tab to help make sure that I get the format down for the site as this will be the first time making a trope page and I want it to not crash the site or have bad formatting with naked links everywhere. This should also allow others to help live with creating the page. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/discussion.php?id=lk93fry4nso8o87lzn705bdj][Link Here!]]
