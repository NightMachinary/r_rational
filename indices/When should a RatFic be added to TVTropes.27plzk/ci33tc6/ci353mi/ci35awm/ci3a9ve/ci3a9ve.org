Nowhere, because Worm isn't rational, nor sane, nor well thought out. It was written with speed and regular update schedule in mind, along with author self professed darker tendencies, which itself isn't bad, but the way it was handled in Worm was. Worm started out okay and promising, but then it got worse by decreasing average intelligence of its characters and overall people in its universe, 4D gods included.
