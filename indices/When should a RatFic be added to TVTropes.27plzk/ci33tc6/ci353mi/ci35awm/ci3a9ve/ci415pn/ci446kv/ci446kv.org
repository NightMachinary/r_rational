I don't dislike so much as have a problem with it being considered a rational or even realistic work of fiction. I think this because in a sense it failed to live up to my expectations and because it takes it self too seriously but it doesn't know how. If you were to read any chapter of it and take time to consider at full or even at glance some of the inverse problems, like why Scion is untraceable or why Simurgh's plot are successful.

I have a whole pastebin worth of text (reddit has limit on character comment count) saved on computer. It was written in emotional state and is filled with snark, sarcasm and spiteful words. It contains lots more logic flaws and loop holes that i could think of. So if anybody wants me to post it again i will. But I would like to avoid senseless downvoting that doesn't explain flaws in my reasoning.
