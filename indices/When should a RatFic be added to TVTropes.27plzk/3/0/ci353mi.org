There is no such thing as notability on TVTropes. The only criteria for if something is worthy of being a page or example is that someone thought it deserved one enough to put the effort into making it.

As for the literature/web original debate, that's a lot less clear. My usual inclination is to use WebOriginal for oneshots and still short serials, but move it to literature if the web serial author stays active and makes the serial nice and long.
