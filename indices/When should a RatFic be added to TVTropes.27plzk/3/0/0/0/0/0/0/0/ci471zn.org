I think that's a big part of the disagreement, people read Worm, recognize clever thinking in it, it reminds them of hpmor or similar and then they put Worm in same category. It's okay to enjoy irrational stories and talk about them and even recommend them to other people in your tribe/group without those stories fulfilling the criteria of said tribe/group.
