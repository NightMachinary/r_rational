Welcome back everyone! To clarify, "simulations" in this world are basically our world's "Pokemon" games, from the handhelds to far more advanced versions that we don't have access to due to lack of technology and Game Freak's strange aversion to all of my money. This world has video games too of course, but we often use the word "simulation" for a game that mimics something you can do in the real world with an intent toward teaching, so why wouldn't they?

As always, feedback of any kind is welcome. Enjoy!
