One thing I can't decide on is whether I'd prefer such an action-oriented pokemon game to let you control the pokemon directly, or just control yourself and give commands for the pokemon to follow. The first Digimon World game for the Playstation did the latter well, and I've wanted a Pokemon version ever since I played it.
