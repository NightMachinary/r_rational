Blue's kind of thick, isn't he? He really needs to clamp down on his impulsiveness, but it's good to see that when he thinks to stop and think for a moment, he does the right thing. The world will beat some maturity into him yet.

I'm curious about the straight-up magical absorbing and healing stuff Shroomish is doing. I wonder if Red thinks there's anything curious about it.

Everything about the Shiftry encounter is quite interesting. Honestly, when it first showed up, I expected it to be a fake-out. They were waiting for a pokemon to cut down a tree, here's a pokemon that can cut down a tree, time to get up, Blue. Which leads to the question: How can you tell a wild pokemon from a trainer's pokemon?

I think this is the first time we've heard of a limitation on pokeballs. They evidently have an upper limit on physical size... But then they can temporarily store pokemon above that limit? How? I'd expect the mass-energy conversion process to abort as soon as its buffer is full, and for the pokemon to never go inside at all. Of course, in the games, pokemon go in, the ball wiggles, then they pop back out, but I'm not quite sure if the science checks out. Or there may be something I don't know. I'm sure we'll learn more about how they work when our heroes start outgrowing standard pokeballs, if they do.

The shiftry's behavior suggests interesting things about pokemon intelligence. In our world, the most intellectually complicated predation is to chase the prey into an ambush. These shiftry are significantly more clever than that! They seemed to haved planned to sneak up on helpless prey in the smoke, but then the forerunner got stuck in a losing fight. It nonetheless stood its ground and actually held back, using itself as bait while the rest of its pack got into position. It was either enacting a plan B it had already thought of, or it was improvising a deception using the resources it had. Either way would require a lot of discipline to not just run away when it gets hurt. Very few real world animals could pull this off besides humans. These shiftry are primate-level at least, and I imagine that psychic types are even smarter. I wonder what Leaf would think.
