  I don't understand what mechanism would cause Absorb to manifest as "motes of green light [that] travel between the pikachu and his pokemon's skin". Did the Shroomish throw its regenerative cells at the Pikachu or something, and they crawled back somehow? If it were bioluminescence, I'd expect it to just glow where the contact point is, with no visible motion.

That was my original idea to try and keep some semblance of the game's visual, but yeah, fuck it. Scrapped that and made the glow stay at the site of the wound.

  Of course, I'm also quite fond of the Pokemon Adventures manga, where Absorb looks like this.

Huh. Is that Tangela about to literally absorb the shroomish into its viney mass? Or is it just absorbing its life through the vines? Still good to see a contact-based one.

  which would mean that pokeballs eventually run out of power and release whatever they're holding.

This is in fact the case :) Pokeballs are recharged at Pokecenters, as referenced briefly back in chapter 5.

  Pokeballs only work on things with magic (pokemon) and only those that are not magically exhausted (fainted)

Actually, the games show pokeballs used to store items that you find on the ground XD Why the pokeball itself isn't included in the item you find is never really explained... Maybe it's "locked" to the item it stored, but that just seems like a waste for a single potion.
