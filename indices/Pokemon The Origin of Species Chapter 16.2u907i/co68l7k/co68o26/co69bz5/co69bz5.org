Or maybe they're just listening to the wrong people ;)

But yeah, they seem really intent on keeping the "this is a kids' game" demographic. It's not going to change as long as adults keep buying them, because why spend a ton of money making a pokemon version of, say, Monster Hunter, when that's likely to draw a lot of their customers from the handheld titles?

I don't think they're giving enough weight to the thought that they might actually appeal to new types of gamers if they release a pokemon game that's NOT cutesy and turn-based.

Which I wouldn't mind so much if they didn't so ruthlessly issue takedowns against independent designers who make amazing looking games [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI6AfK2usjo][like this one.]]
