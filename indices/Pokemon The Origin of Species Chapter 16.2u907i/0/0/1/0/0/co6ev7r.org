Ah. So you're basically saying he's a Slytherin haha

Hmm...is it Dark = Slytherin, Psychic = Ravenclaw now? :P

It said most humans were Normal type... I wonder if there are any human Fighting, Dragon, or Fairy types (those being the 5 "abstract property" types, ghost exempt because they're not dead) , and if it correlates with personality in a similar way.
