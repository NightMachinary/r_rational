Bioluminescent repair cells make as much sense as anything. I'd be inclined to ask why they glow, but then I'd have to ask why almost everything has a face. I can accept that they do.

I don't understand what mechanism would cause Absorb to manifest as "motes of green light [that] travel between the pikachu and his pokemon's skin". Did the Shroomish throw its regenerative cells at the Pikachu or something, and they crawled back somehow? If it were bioluminescence, I'd expect it to just glow where the contact point is, with no visible motion.

Of course, I'm also quite fond of the /Pokemon Adventures/ manga, where Absorb looks like [[http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/a0/Erika_Tangela_Constrict_Absorb_Adventures.png][this]].

I don't think that pokeball explanation quite works. If you pump too much water through a hose, the hose will burst. But the bucket that safely contains the water once it's stopped moving doesn't really care about that. If you have a big enough bucket, then you should be able to just turn down the hose, and dematerialize slower. That might make the pokemon move or something, and cause disasterous read errors - but that again means the pokeball shouldn't be able to take the pokemon in at all. Your analogy would only hold if pokeballs have to do something active to suppress the pokemon - which would mean that pokeballs eventually run out of power and release whatever they're holding. (Or release 20 megatons of TNT per kilogram.) Which, on reflection, would be a good reason to store pokemon remotely and beam them to the pokeball when they're needed, which I complained about before...

Okay, maybe it does work.

In the games, it's pretty clear the pokeballs don't work by matter-energy conversion. I'd guess that they hogtie a pokemon with its own magic, which has the effect of turning them into a little glowball. Pokeballs only work on things with magic (pokemon) and only those that are not magically exhausted (fainted). Since it is the pokemon's magic, they can undo the binding and free themselves. It feels like being pinned but not hurt, as if in a dominance contest, so you will only catch pokemon who choose to submit. Obviously, that's a bit more magic than you want in your story, but that's how I'd explain the behavior in the games.
