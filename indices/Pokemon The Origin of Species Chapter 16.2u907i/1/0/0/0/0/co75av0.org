The shellder's fine, more or less. This absorb is just like your leech seed, I think, but with tangela using its own body. It lets it go after it passes out.

  Actually, the games show pokeballs used to store items that you find on the ground

I choose to believe that that is a gameplay abstraction. The overworld pokeball is a generic item, just like the amorphous shadow of a surfing pokemon. In the first 3D RPGs, /Colosseum/ and /XD/, they use pokeball-colored chests instead, so either it's an abstraction, or the people of Orre just decided not to use pokeballs to hold items for some reason. And why would people leave items lying around in pokeballs anyway? It makes sense to drop a potion or something, but not to keep everything in your pack in balls.

On the other hand, a game-verse pokeball costs Â¥200, about $2. Maybe they /are/ meant to be just ridiculously disposable. But I won't let a little inconvenient fact get in the way of my beautiful theory.
