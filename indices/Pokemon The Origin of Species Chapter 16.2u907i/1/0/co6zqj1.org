  Honestly, when it first showed up, I expected it to be a fake-out. They were waiting for a pokemon to cut down a tree, here's a pokemon that can cut down a tree, time to get up, Blue. Which leads to the question: How can you tell a wild pokemon from a trainer's pokemon?

That was partly why I made sure to note the blood on its leaves ;) In normal conditions though, a trainer should be within sight of his pokemon at all times.

  I'm curious about the straight-up magical absorbing and healing stuff Shroomish is doing. I wonder if Red thinks there's anything curious about it.

Yeah, being a Blue chapter means I was more reluctant to get into technical aspects of things :)

So here was how I approached the absorption stuff:

In the games, absorb looks like literally drawing green light away from them, which somehow is supposed to hurt them and heal you: literally, "life energy." In the anime, they shoot a BEAM of light out, which turns red once it connects to them and again, drains their "life energy."

Neither of these struck me as particularly usable in my fiction. I'm okay with having some near-mystical abilities, but am trying to limit them by type, and perhaps some very specific pokemon.

So first, the idea of extracting something through a creature's skin so that it traveled through the air toward you would require some sort of psychic or magic powers, so I dropped that and made moves like Absorb require skin-to-skin contact.

Second, the glow is bio-luminescence on the plant pokemon's part, of particular cells that glow when they work to repair the body. They use biomatter as fuel/basic parts, and can either gain it through contact (basically eating the skin and flesh from something they're touching) or from nutrients Shroomish takes in.

The leech seeds feed on blood to grow, and the plant matter inside the shell is full of the nutrients from the host's blood, converted into the best type of food to fuel the pokemon's regenerative cells.

Does all that make sense?

  I think this is the first time we've heard of a limitation on pokeballs. They evidently have an upper limit on physical size... But then they can temporarily store pokemon above that limit? How? I'd expect the mass-energy conversion process to abort as soon as its buffer is full, and for the pokemon to never go inside at all. Of course, in the games, pokemon go in, the ball wiggles, then they pop back out, but I'm not quite sure if the science checks out. Or there may be something I don't know. I'm sure we'll learn more about how they work when our heroes start outgrowing standard pokeballs, if they do.

This is something I struggled with a lot too.

So, the main issue with the way the game and anime treats this is it makes no sense (as usual) for a pokemon to "fight" its way out while it's nothing but a ball of energy inside. Furthermore, "damaging" a pokemon so it can get caught is also weird: does how "tired" or "hurt" it is translate to having "less energy" somehow?

So I scrapped the idea that any ball can hold any pokemon, and decided to put technical limits on them. The difficulty is in locking on and hitting the pokemon, which requires wearing it down or immobilizing it first. The only way hurting a pokemon can legitimately help you catch one is if it loses so much blood or so many body parts that its mass becomes low enough for the ball to contain it.

The way I see the tech working, they can hold virtually anything, but it wears out the internal matrix that safely suspends the energy the more energy it's containing. If you catch something too big, it overloads it very quickly. Kind of like how you can run X volts through a lightbulb for months, but if you try to shove 3x volts through it, you'll blow it out.

Does that make sense?
