Great chapter! Keep up the good work!

#+begin_quote
  The firebreak is often enough to break it when it goes too far in any direction, but that means it sometimes winds straight against the fire in some areas.

This sentence struck me as sort of clumsy. The first "it" is referring to "the fire" I think, but this isn't really clear. Also, "sometimes... in some areas" could maybe be phrased better.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't know what sense alerted him to its presence
#+end_quote

And this one is backwards I think. Should be "it to his presence" maybe?

Do you have a sense of what length story this will be?
