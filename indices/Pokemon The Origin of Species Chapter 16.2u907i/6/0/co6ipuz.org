Fixed, thanks a lot!

If you mean a rough chapter count, sadly not. I have checkpoints in mind that the story has to hit, and know where it's going to end, but from a chapter to chapter basis, I'm almost as along for the ride as the rest of you. At a rough estimate though, judging from how far along we are now, at least a hundred, easily.

I know that seems daunting considering the publishing schedule (believe me I do, as the one writing it) but at the moment I just don't have the time to write more. Maybe someday if one of my other projects that I can actually make money off of gets finished I'll have more free time to devote to this, but for now a chapter a month seems to be my limit, and only barely at that :)
