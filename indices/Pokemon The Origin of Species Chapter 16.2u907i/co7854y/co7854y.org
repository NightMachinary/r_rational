I liked the Blue vs. Pikachu scene a lot. I'm mainly glad it didn't involve laser-guided karma. A lot of writers would have had his less-than-altruistic decision instantly result in something terrible happening. Yeah, it didn't pan out for him as a trainer wanting a pikachu, but that's enough to drive the point home. I was bracing for the inevitable "AND THAT'S WHY SELFISHNESS IS BAD, MMMK?" moment, but it never came; that was nice.

Loving this story so far, keep it up!
