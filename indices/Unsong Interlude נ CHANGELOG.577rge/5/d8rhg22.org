Can we just use this thread to bash the new Star Wars movie, please?

Rey is a one woman army, to the point where no one else on the team matters. She can fly the ship, repair the ship, use the force, use lightsabers, use a pistol, make sarcastic comment, make persuasive inspiring comments, look cute, outwit mooks, pretty much anything you can think of. Textbook Mary Sue, down to the mysterious abandoned orphan childhood and everything. in contrast, Finn is just treated as the token comic relief black guy because she takes up all the useful skills that exist, such a waste of potential after the awesome tragic first five minutes of the film. Pilot guy is off screen for ninety five percent of the movie, and so does not count as a real character. Was very disappointing to me. It wasn't even bad per se, but the first five minutes were so much better than everything else that I think there must have been some serious editing of the script going on, ruining what could have been an amazing movie based on an amazing premise.
