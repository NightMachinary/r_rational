Things I'm expecting in VIII and IX, and will be disappointed if I don't get:

- More Finn.
- More Kylo Ren.
- Rey's overpoweredness being an actual plot point, with her being the incarnation of some being more powerful than anything seen in the series to this point, rather than just writers trying to make her look more impressive and not thinking about what they're doing.
- Poe being a large number of clones passed off as a single person, one of whom died in the crash.
