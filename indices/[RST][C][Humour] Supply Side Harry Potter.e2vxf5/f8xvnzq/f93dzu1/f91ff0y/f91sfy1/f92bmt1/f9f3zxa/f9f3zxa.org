Break the tradition!

I'd say there's a subset of philosophers whose written fiction have issues. (Though some are worse than others. With the really bad ones, you can tell that each book is a metaphor for something, but you don't have the faintest idea what it is, unless you stumble across another author who wrote the same story, and did a better job or explained in the intro what the book was about.)
