I don't think Cat, even after shedding so much of her humanity, is so much of a monster that she'd see "genocide everywhere but Callow" as an acceptable solution. If she goes that route, the /best/ possible outcome is that the Gods Above cheat to get her dead before she can pull the trigger. I mean, she's a person, not a value-maximizing AI willing to commit literally any atrocity to achieve her goal of an independent Callow.
