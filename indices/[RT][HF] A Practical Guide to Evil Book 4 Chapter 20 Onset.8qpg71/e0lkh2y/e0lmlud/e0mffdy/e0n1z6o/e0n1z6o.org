Yeah well, the problem is that if said spine is broken Hasenbach loses any reason to negotiate. Levantine armies will be joining them, who will be /livid/ with rage if their Grey Pilgrim is dead. And remember this - No man/woman rules alone. Just as the high lords act as a sort of counterbalance to the tower's power, the princes supporting Hasenbach will not hesitate to turn on her if she comes off as weak.

What happens if Cat just "kills them all"? Well all prospects of long term peace with Procer (which is a small part of what she wants btw) goes straight out the window.

Why would Cat do something that would destroy the culmination of /years/ of her work and planning?

"But Hasenbach would realise that Callow is not a country to be fucked with, so she'll sue for peace."

... is not what is going to happen. If Hasenbach attempted that, she would immediately be overthrown by less reasonable princes and Cat will have a fight to the death with the entirety of Procer and the Levant (which will greatly appreciated by /Malicia/ by the way, who you've seem to have forgotten the existence of).

Oh, sure, she might even /win/ that fight. But then she just becomes another card carrying villain, who will eventually be overthrown. Black and Malicia, for all their ruthlessness, only have the fear they inflict to protect their precious institutions. I have no doubt that the next dread emperor/empress who comes along will gut the reforms and cause the downfall of Praes proportional to their victory. Cat wants the shit the does to survive /past/ her. Hell she even considered abdication as an option and seriously considered whether it would have more merits.
