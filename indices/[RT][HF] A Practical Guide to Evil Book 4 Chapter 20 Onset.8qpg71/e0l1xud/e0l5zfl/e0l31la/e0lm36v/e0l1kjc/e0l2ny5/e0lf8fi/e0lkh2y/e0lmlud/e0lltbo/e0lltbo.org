Blood for the Blood God.

Honestly, I rather agree, we're it not for the fact that she claims she's trying to prevent further loss of life.

Still, them saying they can't negotiate in good faith means all of this talk is meaningless.

I'm seriously surprised she hasn't employed a Scry and Die strategy at this point. For all the talk of assassination teams using portals to kill enemy monarchs and generals being seen as a major threat, using it on the battlefield seems to be common sense. Use Masego and the Observatory to locate heroes than can be ambushed or abducted (or their bodies taken, at least, so they can be disposed of with goblin fire). Use your portals (in quick "tied off" forms) to create murder holes in space through which your allies (or remaining repeating siege engine, or Archer) can launch attacks. Oh, the heroes might be able to turn this around? Fine, use it to pick off the sergeants and captains. That'll cause more chaos in the enmy ranks anyway.

Her not knowing Saints location is criminal. Oh, they have a set range you can't put a scrying sensor? Put one ABOVE and use it as a spotter. Or just have some dedicated goblins with spyglasses keeping track of Hero movements on the battlefield.

Cat is using her powers fairly poorly right now, but more annoyingly, she is not using her brain very well. I can only hope it is part of a cunning plot waiting to be revealed. There are enough characters whose actions are hidden from us that this is quite possible.
