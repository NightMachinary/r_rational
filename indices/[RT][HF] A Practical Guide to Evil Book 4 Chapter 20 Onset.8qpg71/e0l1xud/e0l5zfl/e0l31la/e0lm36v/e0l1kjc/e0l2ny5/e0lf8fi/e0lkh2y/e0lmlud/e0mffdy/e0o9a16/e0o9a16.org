This is a *Practical* Guide to Evil, not a Fun Guide to Evil and personally, I like reading about the diplomacy and politics. Also I'm not just speculating and making shit up here either. From Cat herself

  I wasn't sure what Akua's plan had been but it hardly mattered. While it looked like she might have been getting the better of the fight with the heroes, fighting them at all was a mistake as far as I was concerned. Even if I killed a few they'd still get me in the end.

You're not entirely wrong though, there are plenty of reasons to think Cat and Co might be able to beat the Heroes. However there are also plenty of unknowns and a heavy element of chance. Cat could very well best the Heroes, but it's an inherently risky proposition and its just as possible she'll lose.

Maybe you just see her as a character in a book, but from her own perspective she is a person who doesn't want to risk death if she doesn't have to. The Woe are her friends not just combat assets. An all out battle puts them at risk. Furthermore it puts Callow at risk.

But here's the clincher:

The longer the ceasefire, the more she negotiates in good faith, the weaker the Good v Evil narrative gets and the better the chances of Cat winning if everything does go to shit. Secondly, the Procean army is out of food and so the longer this ceasefire lasts the weaker the enemy army gets.

Simply put, even if negotiations fail Cat will still have gained relative advantage.
