This is...really edgy. I can't tell if you're being flippant or not.

Personally I'd rather read a story about a person struggling to succeed at an ambitious cause without abandoning all her principles or sabotaging that same cause in the long term, as opposed to a story about a living wrecking ball gleefully ruining everyone's shit until some hero finally puts her down like a rabid animal. Tyrant is fun, but there's a reason he's not the main character.

I'm also not really following the bit about how losing a loved one should make Cat /more/ inclined to murder a shitload of other people's loved ones. You want her to "shut up and multiply," but only with respect to her own side? "The death of my loved one has driven home that all of my nameless mooks were real people with hopes and dreams and loved ones of their own. Fuck Procer for killing them! I'm gonna kill all of /their/ nameless mooks, and their nameless civilians too!"
