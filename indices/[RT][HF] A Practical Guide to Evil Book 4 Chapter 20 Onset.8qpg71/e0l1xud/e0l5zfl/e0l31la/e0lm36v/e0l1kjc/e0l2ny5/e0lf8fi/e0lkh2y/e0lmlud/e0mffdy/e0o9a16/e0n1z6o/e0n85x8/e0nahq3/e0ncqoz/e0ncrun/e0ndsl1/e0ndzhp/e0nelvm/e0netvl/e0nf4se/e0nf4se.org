I can neither confirm nor deny that I am being flippant.

In the immortal words of a certain professor "Killing idiots is my great joy in life and I'd thank you for not speaking ill of it until you try it yourself." In that vein, give being a wrecking ball gleefully ruining people's shit until you get shot by the cops a try before you knock it. Assuming you survive the encounter of course, teeheehee...

Well I'd rather read that kind of story and the sequel where the dog returns from hell with three heads and breathing frozen fire...

But I guess that is not up to either of us, as well as it should. It's in the hands of EE. Let's see where he takes us, shall we? Should be a treat whatever happens...
