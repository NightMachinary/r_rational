Ah, that pesky humanity thing again. So droll.

Just think of how much fun you could have if you just put ya middle finger to everything and embrace the role of Evil. Look at Kyros, he gets it. Sure those darn tootin heroes would eventually kick your ass but if you do it well, like Triumphant (may she return), you will be able to seriously ruin Procer's shit. Levant too, when they come bitching about their beloved Pilgrim.

Though she doesn't know it yet, if Levant and the rest of the continent take arms against her she'd have the backing of the entire Free Cities under the effective rule of the Tyrant of Helike. Sure he'd backstab her down the line but hey, omelette and eggs. And hey, you might even get resurrected, like Dread Emperor Revenant before you. It even works with the whole Callowan grudge thing. "Not even Death will stop me from having my revenge!" For MORE fun!

So come on Cat, throw common sense to the wind and teach Calernia to fear Callow...

... But you won't do that, will you? It doesn't jive with the reasons you took power, does it? You need motivation.

Don't worry.

I'm sure the Saint will give you ample motivation soon enough, like a dead member of The Woe. Or Juniper. I wonder then, once you've lost someone that close to you and not just the thousands of nameless mooks, if you'd still want to negotiate peace. I wonder if you'd be able to shut up and multiply then.

Because it is said that when we are in most need of our art, is the time when we're the most likely to forget it...

Here's hoping I get to find out soon...
