Chapters like this one makes me understand the actions of Dread Emperors a lot more.

Cat lost her way. She used to be known as someone who'd bring a sword and bottle of cheap wine to the table. Then tell the other party that although the wine is shit it's arguably better than getting stabbed.

Just fucking kill them all, Cat.

Heroes aren't invincible. The Angels aren't infallible OR immortal and The Story is NOT set in stone.

If you need help, scry Black. He's sure to have good advice on handling the Pilgrim. The Saint is not overly a problem since she's old and there are hard limits to her power. The other useless angelic toe kissers already fear her power because she has already sent two of them to their ancestors and it would have been a team wipe had the Pilgrim not interfered.

Replenish your entire numbers by raising them again as Winter Zombies which was proven resistant to the priests' efforts. Their purpose is not to bleed the heroes, but to bleed the Proceran mercenaries and fantassins. Have Larat ride in the back and murder the last of their supply lines. Even if the Heroes got some bullshit second wind, what the fuck can they do against The Woe backed by a FULL army?

Win? No! If that were the case why haven't we seen a single overlord heroic Named? Why does the Grey Pilgrim need an army to wage war against Praes? Why doesn't he simply walk by himself into Ater and topple the tower? Or the Saint, for all her bullshit holy war mantra?

Conservation of Ninjutsu demands they'd both come out victorious, no? Two Old Veterans standing against the approaching Darkness wreathed in Light ONE last time. Fucking hells they'd even have a Story of it. So why haven't they done that yet?

The only reason I can conceive is that for all the heroic second wind bullshit, the dickheads above have limits to what extent they can interfere. Keyword being LIMITS.

Again, they're not invulnerable, they're not invincible. They can bleed. They can die. So kill them. KILL THEM ALL! The BLOOD GOD DEMANDS SACRIFICE!!
