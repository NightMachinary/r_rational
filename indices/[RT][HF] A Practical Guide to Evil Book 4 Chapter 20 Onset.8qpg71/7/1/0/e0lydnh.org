  Still, them saying they can't negotiate in good faith means all of this talk is meaningless.

They said they couldn't negotiate in good faith under the terms of "negotiations between the Kingdom of Callow and the...invading army." Which was their polite way of initiating the haggling session that ended with the "Queen in Callow and mandated expeditionary force" compromise. They weren't declaring a refusal to negotiate in good faith /at all,/ just pushing for a concession on the "invading army" language, which would have put them at a disadvantage right off the bat.

As for the rest--the whole point of this arc is that Cat is trying to achieve her goals without resorting to the kind of villainous escalation that will, per narrative logic, fuck her and Callow over in the long run. If she wants to restore Callow as a lasting, functional kingdom that won't fall apart when she dies, she has to work within the system to an extent.
