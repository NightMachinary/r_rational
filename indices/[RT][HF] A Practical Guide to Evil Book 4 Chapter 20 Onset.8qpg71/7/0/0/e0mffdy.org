"Except those Dread Emperors you mention always die."

They die because they don't deign to make lasting reforms that will survive them, instead embracing their stupid Bond Villain philosophy. They also die because they're surrounded by scheming assholes that live on a bullshit Klingon promotion philosophy.

Black and Malicia are living proof that villains can last long enough to bring about lasting reforms and Cat was a direct pupil of the Knight. My main point in Cat killing them all is to make Cordelia realize that Callow is not a country to be fucked with. Cat forgot one of Black's cardinal lessons in that you never negotiate from a position of weakness. She'd have an easier time getting Cordelia to sign the accords if she breaks the spine of this Crusade and then takes an oath that she would not invade Procer and would provide assistance to the Principate should the Dead King make a return or any of the other forces of Evil. After that's dealt with she can begin implementing lasting reforms that would survive her.

Regarding the Deus Ex Machina, need I remind you that Triumphant and Black have killed a lot of heroic monsters? For all their second wind bullshit they are NOT immortal OR invincible! This is added to the fact that Cat is not even truly a villain! Her Name is weak enough to be non-existent (and Squire is by default a Neutral Name) and unless she delves deep into Winter she doesn't even have a Role so to speak. So she can neatly sidestep all the bullshit stories because remember, stories only care about Named and they don't apply to mundane plebs or "others".

So all those Deus Ex Machina shit you talked about Black undoubtedly already knows and knowing the Carrion Lord he has a plan to deal with that.

"She'll manage to kill all but one, or she'll manage to kill them all but still lose as a Hero sacrifices themselves to defeat the evil queen."

Evil? Is defending your homeland from invaders by killing them all Evil? In what sense is that Evil? Let's not forget who threw the first fucking stone here. Cat in no way provoked Procer. She even offered the Pilgrim free fast travel directly to the REAL capital Evil country but he refused out some bullshit principle. She made every single reasonable concession to avoid bloodshed but the other side are being obstinate assholes. This Story is NOT about heroes heroically venturing forward to liberate a country so they DON'T have the narrative weight. And as I said, raise the dead army to decimate the Proceran forces and have Thief whisper to the mercenaries that there's better pay and less death fighting on Callow's side. For all their powers the Heroes would not be able to stand against an army backed by three Named and the last titled Fae Noble. Replenish the ranks with the dead and mercenaries. Meet up with Hakram and Kegan and join Black at Vale and kick Klaus Pappenheim's teeth in.

But that's the fun thing to do. Let's rather do the boring thing and try to negotiate with the assholes who broke into your house, screwed your wife, broke your flat screen and had the nerve to tell you it's your fault. That is imminently more reasonable.
