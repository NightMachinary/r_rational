Except those Dread Emperors you mention always die.

This world runs on narrativium, and these heroes are numerous and powerful. She might beat the odds and whipe them out, but the heavens cheat and someone will rise from the dead with a powerup or some other BS deus ex machina will go off and Cat will end up dead. She'll manage to kill all but one, or she'll manage to kill them all but still lose as a Hero sacrifices themselves to defeat the evil queen.

The more the Good v Evil narrative is enforced, the worse Cat is fucked. The more it's undercut the stronger Cat is. Playing too much hardball during negotiations enforces that narrative. The more Cat tries to de-escalate, the less people she kills, the weaker that narrative becomes.
