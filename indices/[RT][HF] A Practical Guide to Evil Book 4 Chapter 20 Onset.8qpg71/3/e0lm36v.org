Fail to see how that comment by Pilgrim is a zinger.

Cat: "To protect my nation, it's people, and their sovreignty from an invading force that wishes to occupy, conquer, and divide it. I have made and still offer peaceful terms by which the Invaders can leave, which I will still honor, despite numerous attempts by both Named and un-Named to sabotage the peace process despite their claims to being on the side of Good.

Tell the truth, what is YOUR intent, Pilgrim?"

She can be 100 percent honest here.
