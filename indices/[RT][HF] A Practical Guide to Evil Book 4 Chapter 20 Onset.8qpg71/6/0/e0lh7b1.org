Cat is still Named, she just doesn't have much of Squire left. And Names are powerful Roles but it's not the only Roles that matter. The Gods Below can give weight to whom ever they choose, be they Villain, Hero or neither. Cat's story is tied to Evil and thus she is of the Below until she starts acting for the purpose of the Above. She's no longer as "marked" as a Villain with a Name but she's still Named in the general sense and fighting for Evil. Actions matter more than blessings.
