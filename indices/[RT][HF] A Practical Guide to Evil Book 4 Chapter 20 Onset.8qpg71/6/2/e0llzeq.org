Crackpot theory with (some) evidence: Pilgrim is going to 'unexpectedly' support her.

We know Pilgrim can sense intentions, he can tell Cat just doesn't want more war.\\
In the chapter where Cat returns she rags on Pilgrim a lot, mostly for existing. It seems unfair to her that she's getting shot at, but from his perspective Cat was just wrecking the heroes shit and they're in the middle of the battle.\\
He's the one who agrees to hear Cat first, she assumes the light blooming at the end of his staff is meant for her, but he doesn't call it until Saint starts to move.\\
This quote before he goes to fight 'her':

  “There is no glory in this,” he warned them. “Bards may write songs, one day, and chronicles sing your praises, but this is earthly luster. We march in the spirit of sacrifice, to bring light into the dark. Do not look ahead or behind, only to each other. There is no salvation to be found save at the hands your comrades.”

Added with his conversation to Saint the chapter or two earlier. He knows he's on the wrong side of the narrative.
