Totally not part of the story narrative, but can someone explain this:

Pilgrim thinks cat is a blight on creation by existing, because she is connected to the gods below.

Cat isn't connected to the gods below, having no name.

I just don't get it. She literally isn't a villain right now (by his standards, since heroic and villainous actions don't actually define good and evil apparently).
