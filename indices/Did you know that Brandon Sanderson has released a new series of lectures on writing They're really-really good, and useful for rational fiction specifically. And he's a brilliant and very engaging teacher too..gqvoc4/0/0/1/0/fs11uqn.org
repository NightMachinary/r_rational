The only resource that comes to mind is the short book /How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy/ by Orson Scott Card. Caveats abound: the book was published 30 years ago, and roughly a quarter of the book is devoted to giving career/professional advice about the publishing industry that is long obsolete. That aside, if you're looking for practical writing resources, I can recommend the book solely on the basis of a 15-page chapter titled "writing well."
