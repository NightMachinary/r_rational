You just drastically changed the trajectory of my week. And possibly life. Lol.

I've watched some of Brandon's lectures before this, but you are not wrong about the first 30 minutes of this lecture. This totally connected a lot of dots that were already there in my head on how to continue progressing on my own writing!

I fucking love Brandon Sanderson
