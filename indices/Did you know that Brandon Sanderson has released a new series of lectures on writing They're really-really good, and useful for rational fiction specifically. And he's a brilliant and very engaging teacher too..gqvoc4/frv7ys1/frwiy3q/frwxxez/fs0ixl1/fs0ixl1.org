I've had a similar experience with his lectures.

While they are quite helpful for new writers to get themselves familiarized with relevant concepts like "pyramid of abstraction" or "discovery writing vs outlining", they lack substance. Brandon goes on and on about what you should and shouldn't do. He doesn't tell you /how/ to do it. At least not in any meaningful way.

It's funny because I've learned so much more from a video of him *simply writing*. This is him writing a story while taking requests from a live chat and explaining the process:

Do you have any more practical resources to recommend?
