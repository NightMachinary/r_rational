If you only have a short time to hear Sanderson talk, I think the biggest return on investment might come from watching the first 30 minutes of his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGOodOMBYVk][JordanCon 2010 talk about description and viewpoint]]. (The full video is longer, but the second half is mostly just Q&A, and the best insights are all front-loaded into the first half of the lecture portion.) I've always been interested in the art of storytelling, but discussion of things like plot and characters and setting can often feel abstract in a way that might not feel immediately actionable: like okay, I need to write characters that elicit sympathy, but how does that translate into writing a good opening sentence, or a good opening paragraph, or a good opening chapter? Writing an amazing character arc or a great plot twist doesn't mean a whole lot when a lot of people will, within the first chapter, tend to appraise your work as something that is either worth reading or not.

It feels like there is a lot of writing advice that is focused on "how to tell a good story," and less focused on "how to write a good sentence." That 200-level advice can be great, but it's a bit like having a baseball coach who is trying to teach you how to steal bases and when to bunt when what you really want to know is how to swing the bat. The first 30 minutes of that 2010 JordanCon lecture on description and viewpoint are all about how to write good sentences, which I think might be /the/ most important thing to learn as a writer.

A lot of the joy of watching Sanderson lectures (at least for me) comes from the fact that a lot of the time he isn't really teaching you new things so much as formalizing all of the things that you already intuitively understood but never thought about consciously. Not many of us really need to be /taught/ that "readers like a sympathetic protagonist;" on a certain level, this is something that all of us already know, whether we're consciously aware of it or not. Thus, it can be incredibly enjoyable (and often somewhat addictive) to watch a Sanderson lecture and realize, "Wow, look at how much stuff I already knew about storytelling!" You already have an intuitive understanding of what makes a good story, which immediately primes you for the part of the lecture that teaches you how to translate that intuitive understanding into well-written sentences that form a good story that people actually want to read.

I think that the first 30 minutes of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGOodOMBYVk][that 2010 JordanCon lecture]], more than anything else in my life, are the thing most responsible from turning me from an engineering student in 2010 into a professional scriptwriter (I started getting paying gigs in 2015, and went full-time in 2016). After watching that lecture, I also watched all of his other JordanCon lectures, and ravenously first three seasons of the Writing Excuses podcast that he did with Dan Wells and Howard Taylor. (Perhaps you'd find Sanderson's insights more digestible in that format: the podcasts's motto is "15 minutes long, because you're in a hurry, and we're not that smart.") Listening to Sanderson talk about storytelling did teach me new things, but what really made his lectures impactful was the fact that it allowed me to "unlock" the understanding of stories that I'd been unknowingly accumulating ever since I was a child: transferring that knowledge from my subconscious to my conscious mind immediately made it something that was actionable, and practically overnight I went from someone who had occasionally mused "I'd like to write a novel some day" to someone who was constantly writing short stories and creating plot outlines.
