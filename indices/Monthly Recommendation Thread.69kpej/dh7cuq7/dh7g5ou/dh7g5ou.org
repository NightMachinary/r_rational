I second this as an enjoyable story. That said, I have become increasingly annoyed lately with every good aligned character's reluctance to kill their enemies,when they have no real means to keep prisoners and their enemies show them no such courtesy.

Having a moral system which forbids killing if you can incapacitate is hardly irrational though, merely irritating.
