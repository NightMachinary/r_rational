  Anyone can make a request for certain requirements for stories and I will try to find something that fulfills the criteria.

- Stories in which common premises, usually handwaved, are used as the main conflict fuel.

  That is, a human displaced into another world tries to find out who is responsible for this and hurt them, instead of following typical [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld][Portal Fantasy]] storyline. Or the protagonist notices that the world around him starts to look too much like harem anime, and tries to figure out what reality-warping device or mastermind is responsible for this. Or... you probably get the idea.

  In other words, stories with low-key [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheAuthor][Rage Against the Author]] plots.

- Stories where [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac][omnicidal maniacs]] are /right/: that is, where the world is such that destroying it is the right thing to do.

- Stories with the plot centered around antimemetics. (Well, /except/ *qntm*'s [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five][There Is No Antimemetics Division]].)

Whichever you would prefer. Fanfiction is allowed.
