I spent a while thinking of anything that would fulfill your requirements, but there were only a few I found that meets them:

- Anything by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Watt-Evans][Lawrence Watt-Evans]]. The stories he write often involves realistic people in slightly cliche situations. While it's not to the point of the protagonists being Genre Savy and taking advantage of story telling conventions; instead they simply act in novel ways that are different from what should be expected. [[https://www.amazon.com/Lawrence-Watt-Evans-Fantasy-MEGAPACK-ebook/dp/B06XVFLTBW][Here's]] a collection of his short stories for only a dollar, although I've only read his Ethshar series.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10909255/1/Something-Very-Special][Something Very Special]] is the only story I have ever heard of where the villain has an actually good reason for killing off an significant number of the human population. I don't want to say anything else about the story to avoid spoilers. Unfortunately the author has stopped updating last year and doesn't seem to be continuing the story, but it's so good that I wanted to recommend it anyway. The link I gave leads to the 7 chapter version on fanfiction.net. [[https://sites.google.com/site/shermansplanet/storage/Something%20Very%20Special.pdf?attredirects=1][Here's]] the 9 chapter direct download version. Check out his [[http://www.shermansplanet.com/][website]] too!
