Does anyone know any stories in which the main character tries using rationality (or however it is labeled by the author) for ordering and improving their life, but the whole thing turns into struggle against the “defects” of the human mind instead? E.g. someone with addiction tries to give up but just telling to themselves /“[insert substance here] is bad for you because [insert rational reasoning]”/ doesn't work because it's not the rational part of the brain that is addicted to the drug. Other possible examples: anxiety, apathy, depression, learned helplessness, paranoia, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman][violence,]] etc.

Preferably as realistic and with as little artistic license for wishful thinking as possible.

I'd actually even be fine with [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63697.The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat_and_Other_Clinical_Tales][those books that practitioners like writing about their patients]] (that's a good book, by the way), but only if they aren't ~5% verbatim notes from the patient and ~95% guesswork from the therapist.

I second this. Wouldn't call it a rat!story, but the forest-related bits were rather neatly done.
