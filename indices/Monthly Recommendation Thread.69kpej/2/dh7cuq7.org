I don't think I've heard of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] and being mentioned here before. Its a Harry Potter fanfic with Hermione being the (super smart) MC. It is very well written. I like it because it goes in depth on the muggle vs wizard dispute and the maths used is easy to understand.
