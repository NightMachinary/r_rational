New season of sense8 just came out. It's probably my favourite thing on netflix. It's by the wachowskis and the guy from babylon 5. It's an extremely good show, though it takes about 4 episodes for the first season really to get into gear.

Everyone seems pretty dang competent, though I'm not sure I'd call it rational fiction. Better than most, though. (That said: not terribly scientifically accurate).

The best way to describe it: 8 soap operas happening simultaneously with lots and lots of badass action scenes. People being good at things and stepping back when they're not.

And, uh, one of the first scenes is a lesbian sex scene complete with a rainbow strap on being thrown to the side afterwards, so you might not want to watch it with your family in the room with you because it does have some sexually graphic scenes.
