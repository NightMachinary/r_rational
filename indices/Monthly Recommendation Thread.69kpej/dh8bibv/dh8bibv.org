Democracy 3 is a pretty fun game and the only good government policy simulator I've seen. I'm working on a mod to make some things more realistic (i.e. money supply, all taxes and spending affecting GDP, inflation, etc.) as well as adding some new policies like a sovereign wealth fund and universal basic income. There's something satisfying about seeing a fiscally sustainable policy that spends 1.5 trillion dollars per quarter.
