The notion that trans women are men pretending to be women in order to trick other men into having sex with them is a common trope. Notably, this belief has been used as an attempted defense for the act of murder: see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Gwen_Araujo][Gwen Araujo]] case for a high-profile example.

More generally: I, a cis dude, would probably not be that bothered if someone called me "she" tomorrow -- I'd laugh it off, wonder briefly what was up, and move on. But if everyone was calling me the wrong thing every day, and I needed to spend great amounts of time, money, and effort to get my presentation to the point where people were calling me the right thing /most/ of the time, and I met someone I really liked, and then they looked at me with betrayal and said that they'd never have liked me if they knew I wasn't a man... well, I'd be pretty fucking livid.

tl;dr: you're right that "dude" isn't a slur or insult, but if it looks like a straw is breaking a camel's back, look at what else that camel's already carrying.
