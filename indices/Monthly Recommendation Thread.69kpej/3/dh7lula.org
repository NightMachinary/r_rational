I've been following the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/][Paths of Civilization]] quest lately, and it's been fun. It starts with a hunter-gatherer community and follows them over the generations as they transition over to agriculture, and recently metalworking. The writer seems to have a good grasp on how prehistoric societies function which makes it an interesting read. The voters may not be the most rational of people, however... who would've known that trying to power through a radical and untested tax reform in the middle of a war would blow up on their faces?

The last chapter was the result of the voting over how to deal with a cholera epidemic, and all of the rolls were spot-on. The shamans of the community marched out like Spartans in 300 and punted the epidemic back to the lowlands whence it came.\\
Well, that might be a slight exaggeration, but damn did they get work done. Even invented rudimentary sanitation theory while they were at it.

(Also, on a tangentially related note TIL that "whence" does not need the "from" preposition)
