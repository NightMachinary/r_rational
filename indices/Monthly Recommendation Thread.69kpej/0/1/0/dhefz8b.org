Hey, I just stumbled on another story I read a while ago that I realized sorta fulfills your request about rationality running into the flaws of a defective mind.

[[https://smile.amazon.com/Eden-Green-Gothic-Book-1-ebook/dp/B010ON836U][Eden Green]] is a story that involves vampires and the protagonist is Genre Savy in dealing with the situation. The reviews on Amazon do a better job than I ever could in summarizing the story.

There are a fair bit about dealing with psychological issue on Eden's part and a good amount of her time gets wasted because she just can't convince people that they are making mistakes, and her sanity is slowly eroding away.

Another story that might be up your alley is Peter Watt's [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]] since it involves alien minds and weird human psychologies. It doesn't fit what you're asking for, but there's a relation. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blindsight][TV Tropes]] has a good summary
