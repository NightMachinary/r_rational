It seems like everyone forgot about the recommendation thread yesterday, so here it is a day late. Oops!

I personally can't easily think of much to recommend, so I'm going to try something new.

Anyone can make a request for certain requirements for stories and I will try to find something that fulfills the criteria. However, don't ask for similar stories to what has already been requested multiple times on this subreddit. I mean there's already numerous threads on time-travel stories, Naruto fanfiction, or Harry Potter fanfiction.

Anyway, here's my few recommendations of worth:

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/1931][Slip Hero]] - Involves a doctor reincarnated into a medieval world with magic. Points for subverting the usual reincarnation dreck by having the protagonist not remember very much about his past life (he's not aware that he reincarnated), and involves him actually using what little he remembers of the modern technology as novel ideas invented by him in a slow technological uplift. Unfortunately, while the story's definitely not dead, the author updates excruciatingly slowly on the order of 2 or 3 times a year.

[[http://www.ironteethserial.com/][Iron Teeth]] - What's a goblin gots to do to get ahead in this world? Follow this poor sucker as he attempts to get a life better than being a slave and hopefully evolve into something better. Consistent update rate by the author.
