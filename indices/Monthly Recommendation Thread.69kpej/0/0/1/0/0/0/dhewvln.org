Hm. /Eden Green/ was on my list already, but that moves it a few positions higher.

I've read /Blindsight/ a few years ago, long before I discovered rational fiction at all.

Thank you again, still.

Though that reminds me; I heard Watts' */Rifters Trilogy/* *([[http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts.htm][read-for-free]] | [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiftersTrilogy][TV Tropes]])* contained some interesting anti-villains and moral conflicts. Did you read it?
