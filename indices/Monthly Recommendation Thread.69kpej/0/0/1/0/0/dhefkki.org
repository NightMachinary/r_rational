Hey, I just stumbled on another story I read a while ago that I realized sorta fulfills your first request.

[[https://smile.amazon.com/Eden-Green-Gothic-Book-1-ebook/dp/B010ON836U][Eden Green]] is a story that involves vampires and the protagonist is Genre Savy in dealing with the situation. The reviews on Amazon do a better job than I ever could in summarizing the story. It also connects to your request for omnicidal maniacs.

And just because I'm throwing out more recommendations at you, how about [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]] with a summary at [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blindsight][TV Tropes]]?
