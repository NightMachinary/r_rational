Regarding antimemetics, I've remembered (ha) another one: /[[http://alexanderwales.com/lost-city/][Lost City]]/ by Alexander Wales.

On SCP wiki, there's a few [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/antimemetic#pages][antimemetic objects]], and [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/matterminded][tales]] connected to Counterconceptual Department, another part of the Foundation dealing with antimemetics which existed /in parallel/ with qntm's Antimemetics Division, with neither of them knowing about the other one.

But they don't have the same continuous narrative that /There's No Antimemetics Division/ has, as far as I can tell.
