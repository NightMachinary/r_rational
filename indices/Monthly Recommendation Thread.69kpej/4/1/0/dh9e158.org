I've already added that part but still need to tweak it. IMO it should reduce poverty, increase unemployment and equality and GDP and poor earnings, and piss off capitalists and the wealthy. Later I'm planning to have it increase inflation also. There's actually already a mod for UBI but IMO it has the costs be unrealistically low.
