These descriptions are what I found enjoyable about the stories. For more fleshed out teasers check out the stories themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471700/1/Stargate-Reopened][Stargate Reopened]] - A more realistic take on Stargate written as infrastructure fiction. Manages to function as a reconstruction - as opposed to a deconstruction - as the authors fix issues in the canon while keeping the source material's spirit intact.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam][In Memoriam]] - [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index][Toaru Majutsu no Index]]. Another more realistic imagining of the source material. Doesn't require an understanding of the source material to enjoy.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/stark-transcendent-iron-man-marvel-quest.3513/][Stark Transcendent]] - Marvel Comics forum quest. Apparently handing SufficientVelocity control over Tony Stark results in a more kick ass story -- who would have guessed?

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/officer-of-the-republic-a-sw-si.478840/][Officer of the Republic]] - Star Wars SI story. A fleshed out and realistic portrayal of the jedi.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/shadowrun-imugi.27168/][Shadowrun Imugi]] - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun][Shadowrun]] forum quest. Great storytelling, cute fox. *Note:* I'm biased to like this story for personal reasons that we probably don't share.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/just-another-genius-starcraft-au-quest.514957/][Just Another Genius]] - Starcraft forum quest. Used techno-babble which actually allows for advanced predictions about it's subject. *Note:* This quest is new so it might go downhill soon.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5fdssPqmmGhkhsJi4VcckA][Innuendo Studios]] - In depth video essays on video games as an art form. *Note:* The name is misleading, it has nothing to do with innuendos.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A][Every Frame a Painting]] - In depth video essays on film form from a professional editor. Each video feels like a piece of art all on it's own.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg][Real Engineering]] - Variety of videos on topics relating to engineering from a former engineer.
