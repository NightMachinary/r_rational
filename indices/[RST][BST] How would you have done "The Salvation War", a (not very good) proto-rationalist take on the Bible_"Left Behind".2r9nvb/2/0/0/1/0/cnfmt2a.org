The pejorative "porn" descriptor implies that the focus is far too much on that one aspect. You could take Schindler's List and turn it into "industrial porn" by focusing too much on the manufacturing processes of the factory, even if the story was kept the same. In the same way, you might be able to rewrite To Kill a Mocking Bird as "law porn" by spending too many paragraphs on the legal aspects.

It's the invocation of admiration/lust that gets that label, not the plot/characters. To draw a somewhat crude analogy, it's the difference between fading to black when the two main characters fall into bed together, and showing every sweaty thrust until the point of orgasm.
