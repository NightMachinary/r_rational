  The pejorative "porn" descriptor implies that the focus is far too much on that one aspect.

Hm...I would have phrased that as "that aspect is detailed and front-and-center". I'm using "military porn" in much the same way that people say "food porn" when they are talking about books of food photography.

Hammer's Slammers (for example) is military porn because it lays out very precisely how its tech works, looks at the details, and essentially all the events and characters are military-related. It's a good book (well, a good collection of stories) because Drake is a damn good author who actually served in Vietnam and has the experience to draw on to make the human side of the war feel very real.
