God is an omnipotent friendly AI trying to simulate an infinite number of universes with sentient life, Satan is an unfriendly AI trying to end those simulations by killing all the sentient life. Satan launches a false flag attack that lures the humans into thinking God attacked, they invade heaven which is defended without God (who is mysteriously absent). God shows up after heaven is defeated, and explains that he had infinite universes to take care of and figured that because the humans were so well armed they could defend themselves against Satan's horde in this one.

The humans don't believe him, he says idgaf and tells all the angels to obey human commands before leaving to deal with a universe where "Einstein got killed trying to catch a train and you never split the atom".

The humans, not trusting the angels to actually obey commands, send them into the "vanguard" of the first battle against the forces of hell while they build up the munitions they spent in their invasion of heaven. Almost all the angels are slaughtered and after the humans realize they were actually going to be loyal the whole time said battle is forever a stain on the soul of humanity. In the end humans nuke hell and the forces of Satan are slaughtered, though the fate of the multiverse is never addressed.
