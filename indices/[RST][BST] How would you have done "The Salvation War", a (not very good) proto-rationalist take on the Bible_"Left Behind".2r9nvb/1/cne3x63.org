"And the trumpet sounded, the gates of hell were thrown wide, and a 9000 tonne sky cruiser from the Meitner-Curie works edged through, its sides armored with the scales of the beast, a machine built of steel and the bones of demon lords, and at it's heart a five giga-watt dusty core bottled by lines of magnetism murdered plutonium and from it's back an incandescence of plasma scorched the heavens."

The angels are numbered, as are the fallen. Hell ought long ago have been overrun by the tide of souls from the billions from earth. So, running with that, the realms of hell are mostly run by humans and those of the fallen cunning enough to see the way the wind was blowing in time to defect from the infernal hierarchy - God then calls the end of days, but instead of the apocalypse, what makes emerges is the state of the dead. Almost all the dead. A state of hundreds of billions. And they wish to talk.. trade. /sinister cackle/
