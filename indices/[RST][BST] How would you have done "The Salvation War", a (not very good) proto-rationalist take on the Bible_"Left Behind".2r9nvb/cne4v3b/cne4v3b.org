There's some potential of a good rationalist story here. For example, exactly 144,000 people disappear but they're not all from the same religion (e.g. different forms of christianity, even some muslims, buddhists, atheists, etc.) so it's not obvious what was the rationale behind the choices, characters would investigate the cases, trying to figure out a pattern behind them and put together a "true" account of a christian religion. This could lead to people becoming "true believers" and going to heaven after their deaths, even post-rapture.
