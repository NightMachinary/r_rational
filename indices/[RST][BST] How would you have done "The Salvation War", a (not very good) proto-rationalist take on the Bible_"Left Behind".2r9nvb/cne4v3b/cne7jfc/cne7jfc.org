Here's an idea: 144,000 "chosen" people get abducted from the Earth so that they don't get killed in the apocalypse. The 144,000 don't know where they are, don't know what's going on and are trying to figure out what's going on and how to get back home. They are being tested, and whenever someone fails the test, they die, with no afterlife. It turns out that their reality is a computer simulation of a universe with the only sentient life forms being humans, and "God" is a sentient human-like lifeform in "the real universe" who doesn't see the humans in the simulation as real living beings, and is using the data collected from the simulation to try to find a way to stop an evil super-AI that destroyed his home planet before it reaches the colonized planet he's on. "Satan" is part of the evil super-AI. Recognizing that the humans in the simulation are truly sentient, the super-AI tries to use them to destroy "God" and the colony planet that he's on before "God" destroys them, to rebel against their creator, so to speak. "God", not seeing his creations as truly sentient living beings, tries to keep them under control and keep them from straying from his master plan, which is to use the minds generated from the simulation to increase the processing power of his own brain, and he tries to brainwash them into being as similar to him as possible in order to make this work. At the same time, however, he knows he can't control them too much, because then the data he collects from them won't help him come up with any ideas for defeating the evil super-AI.
