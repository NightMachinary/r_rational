I actually read a few books in the /Left Behind/ series when I was stuck in South Dakota for a few days. They were terrible - like, more terrible than I thought that they could be given how well they sold. And a few chapters of /The Salvation War/, which ... wasn't really to my liking, mostly because of the excessive military/technology porn and the writing style.

I really do like the premise of the Rapture, from a fiction standpoint. There's this mysterious event of global significance, and then everyone has to deal with the consequences. /Flashforward/ was in a similar vein, as was /Y: The Last Man/.

I guess if I were writing it, the Rapture would come and not be completely obvious. It would be obvious that /something/ happened, and while people might throw around guesses that it was the Rapture based purely on the demographics of those taken, no one would know for sure. Your protagonist is an atheist professor of comparative religion who authoritatively finds the answer to which religious mythology is the correct one, just in time for Satan-in-disguise to form a world government. The plot is then a matter of fighting against Satan, who works as a lot better of an antagonist than God, given that it's plausible that he's not completely invincible.
