Given that IIRC only about 144,000 are supposed to be raptured (and there are some pretty strict and obscure rules, like "no tattoos", that would leave many otherwise-qualified people behind) I could see it happening without it being immediately apparent that the "real" Rapture had occurred. Start throwing tribulations and stuff at the world right afterward and there might not be time for a proper investigation.

Of course, /Salvation War/ didn't really show a proper Book of Revelations sequence. It had a custom-made apocalypse very different from the one in the book, wherein God speaks directly to everyone at once and tells them exactly what's going on. That changes things up significantly. Is the question "how would you have done a general biblical-god-ending-the-world story" or "how would you have done the /Salvation War/ scenario, specifically?" That'd make a big difference.
