With the caveat that it's not a good idea to think too hard about this kind of thing, the 144,000 number comes from [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%207][Revelation 7]]:

  And I heard the number of them that were sealed: there were sealed a hundred and fortyfour thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. 5 Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand; 6 of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand; 7 of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand; 8 of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. 9 After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and with palms in their hands.

There are a couple of ways to interpret this. One is that only 144,000 /Jews/ will be Raptured, and all the Christians make up the Great Multitude. One is that there will be two classes of Christians that go to different afterlives (this is what the Jehovah's Witnesses believe). Another is that only 144,000 will be raptured. And some people even say that the number isn't literal - it's just a figure of speech.

There are hundreds if not thousands of flavors of Christian apocalypse, mostly due to the fact that Protestants don't need no stinking central authority to tell them what's true and what's not, and have therefore just created their own variants from whole cloth, so long as they squint at the Bible hard enough.

I think part of the fun of writing a Rapture novel would be to pick and choose which of those beliefs is actually true. In /Salvation War/ the humans get an absolutely enormous boost by getting information about their situation straight off the bat - I think in a rational take on the End Times you would want to spend a lot of word count on the characters trying to find out the truth.
