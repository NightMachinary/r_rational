I'd have probably done a more X-COM style story, where demons and such used portals to abduct humans from various places to hell, sort to mind control world leaders, destroy aircraft. The demons and devils and such in The Salvation War weren't very smart (purposely, they for some reason hadn't checked up on earth for the last 400 years) and for some reason mostly refused to attack populated areas. There would be some initial devastation with moments of light until they started to capture and interrogate a lot of demon species and use their biomagic to take the fight back to them.
