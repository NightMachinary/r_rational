Personally, I love military porn. I am a great follower of the Way of Drake and Ringo is his prophet, amen. Because of that, I actually did slog through TSW.

My problem with TSW is that it's /badly written./ The demons provide absolutely no real resistance; they are mowed under right from the start and never bounce back. It could have been a fantastic fight, technology vs magic with the implications of portal technology driving the war as the humans rapidly scramble to put together sufficient spot defense and enough fast-response units to deal with simulataneous widespread outbreaks of demons. Instead the entire thing can be reduced to "And then demons showed up and the humans killed them. The End.

The resistance in hell was the most interesting part -- that would have been a good story to run with. Unfortunately, the author sabotaged it so that it reduced to "and this awesome resistance fight was happening with smart heroes who were under-equipped, outnumbered, and outgunned and fighting against the literal Hordes of Hell...and then the Army showed up with planes and tanks and killed all the bad guys. The End."
