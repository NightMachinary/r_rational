  My problem with TSW is that it's badly written. The demons provide absolutely no real resistance; they are mowed under right from the start and never bounce back. It could have been a fantastic fight, technology vs magic with the implications of portal technology driving the war as the humans rapidly scramble to put together sufficient spot defense and enough fast-response units to deal with simulataneous widespread outbreaks of demons. Instead the entire thing can be reduced to "And then demons showed up and the humans killed them. The End.

Agreed, Theres an interesting core idea for a short story in "modern technology is actually better than magic" and "medieval style societies are terrible at dealing with threats." But it doesn't sustain a massive multi-chapter novel, especially given the fairly bland characters.

A way of keeping the core premise but making it more interesting would be to make the demons smarter in responding. Maybe after the initial curb stomp battle with humans the original demon leadership collapses and new more innovative smarter ones come out of it, they then start using mind control (which isn't stopped by tinfoil hats because thats just stupid) and portals effectively to make strategic strikes against humanity in asymmetric warfare. Human society is severely disrupted by the massive attacks on population centres and the risk of mind controlling leaders, making this vast new military infrastructure increasingly difficult to sustain. Then you have a real fight on your hands.
