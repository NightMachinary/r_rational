Okay, I know nearly nothing about Christianity and the traditional idea of the Rapture, but I wanted to write about how I thought a Rapture could actually be beneficial for humanity..../looking over my short prose/...I'm creeped out and divided on whether or not the Rapture was actually benefical.

Heebie-jeebies!
