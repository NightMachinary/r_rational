Over the course of days, it became evident that a significant number of the world's population had simply disappeared. It wasn't anything obvious as a flash of light or visible supernatural occurrence. Some people would walk around a corner, into a room, out of sight from the rest of humanity and simply...vanish out of sight.

When the missing persons reports began to pile up faster than normal, the law, government, secret agencies, and other powerful forces of human society began to take notice. A pattern hinting towards Christianity began to appear. Initially mentioned as a joke, the idea that the Rapture had come and gone quickly gained support. Almost suspiciously quick. For some reason, people everywhere were convinced of this phenomenon.

First came confusion at being left behind, confusion at one's religion of Muslim, Buddhism, Judaism and atheism being revealed as a horrible lie, confusion at being abandoned.

Rage came next as people pleaded for a second chance and there was no response. Many screamed about how there was never any signs, that all signs were thousands of years ago. The Church was quickly attacked as the members who had secretly lacked faith remained. But like all storms, the world's rage quickly burned out as nothing changed.

Oddly enough, society continued to function. In some areas the reduction in population was felt, but they were quickly replenished by the new immigrants. People acted more benevolently out of a fear of an all-powerful Lord. The actions weren't done with good intentions, but they had positive consequences for society as a whole. Hunger diminished, wars were fought less often, trade flourished, and Christianity, proven right, grew.

As a whole, humanity continued to function and advance in their sciences. After all, while it had been a horrible shock, there had not been any further signs or messages. But they had proof! It was possible to reach godlike power for if one entity could exist, then there can be more of the same entities. Uniqueness is a very rare (often temporary) phenomenon in nature. Science combined with religious fervor advanced at a new-found pace.

...

Centuries passed, humanity had changed now that they had grown past their fear of Death. If there was an afterlife, then what did they have to worry about? Funerals were a joy, and people smiled on their death beds. If they were Christian that is, which of course boosted a 100% membership. Humanity expanded towards the stars to find fellow intelligences and convince them of the need for Christianity. They wished to become lesser gods to better serve the All-Knowing one. Their loyalty was unshakable and their faith true and pure. All was good.

Amen!
