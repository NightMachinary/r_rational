Yeah, that part would suck, no argument there. Unless you do a hackneyed "Satan is a misunderstood good guy" thing and he ushers in a golden age, I guess.

As fiction, people disappearing and Satan trying to take over are the really interesting angles, more than the plagues and whatnot. That does mean Satan needs specific motivations though.

In some traditions, when you die you become one with God. Somehow that's supposed to be a good thing, but for a rationalist who believes you are your thoughts, that sounds terrible (or at least it's still death). This might be too close to what I just called hackneyed, but a Satan who's trying to get us to develop immortality so we stop merging with God would be an interesting character. Particularly if he has a lack of compunctions on how to get there, or if his motives are partly just to spite God.
