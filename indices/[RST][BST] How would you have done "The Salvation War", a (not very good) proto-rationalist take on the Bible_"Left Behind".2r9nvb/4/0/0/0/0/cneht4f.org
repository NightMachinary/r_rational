Yes you are correct that people are still dying, but since Death previously meant (to rationalists anyway) a permanent loss of the person you once knew, things are different. Eliezer once said (somewhere) that if people truly believed in an afterlife, no one would mourn at funerals and death would become a simple good-bye where you would meet up again with your friends in a few year/decades.

Although...from the way I wrote the story...it feels as if Cthulhu pretended to be a Christian god and brain-washed humanity into worshiping it. Which doesn't make much sense for an incomprehensible Elder God to behave that way. Then again...INCOMPREHENSIBLE!
