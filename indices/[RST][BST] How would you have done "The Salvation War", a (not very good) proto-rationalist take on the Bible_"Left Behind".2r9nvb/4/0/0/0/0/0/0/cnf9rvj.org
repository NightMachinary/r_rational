You get a "perfected" body, free from disease and injury, and immortal. It's somewhere in the Epistles, I think.

In some interpretations your shiny new body is also immune to certain emotions, and possibly neuter, but that's not universally accepted; and there's really no consistent answer for how the mundane, non-harmful side of aging is handled (in children, for example.)
