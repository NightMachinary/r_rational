Except... they are actual deaths. People stop existing on earth, and start existing in the afterlife instead. The only difference is that we don't have any bodies to bury. And that's only if you accept the currently most-popular version of Rapture, there's alternates where the bodies are left behind as well and the survivors do have to bury them.

Basically, Rapture is indistinguishable from Genocide of The Good People.
