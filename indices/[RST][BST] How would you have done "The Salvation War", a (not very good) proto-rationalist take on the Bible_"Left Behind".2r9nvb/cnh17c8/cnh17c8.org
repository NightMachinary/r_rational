Most discussion of the Christian end times focuses on three things: the beasts, the rapture, and the plagues.

Revelation organizes these (well, except the rapture, but it isn't unambiguously even there--that's more the epistles) into three woes. The plagues are the third woe, and the beasts do most of their work as part of the second woe.

The parts that often get left out--which confuses me, for they are metal--are the first woe (the five months of immortal torture scorpion-locusts) and the Two Witnesses (who can cause droughts and breathe fire and fight the Beast of the Abyss, and also resurrect after 3 days).

The locusts torment anyone not sealed to God for 5 months. During that time, suicide is divinely prevented, to stop people from escaping the torment. That's five months in which someone with a high pain tolerance can carry out all sorts of normally suicidal schemes.

The Two Witnesses are old testament-style prophets. So, naturally, everyone hates them. They are, however, protected by their mighty firebreath, at least until they do battle with the Beast. When the Beast kills them, they are left unburied for the 3 days they spend dead.

Have I mentioned the Two Witnesses? Because I'm noticing a distinct lack of fire-breathing prophets in Revelation Fanfiction. I'd find one where at least one of the Witnesses turns out to be an aspiring rationalist (who is not brainwashed by God when given the mission/powers, unless we want possession by the holy spirit to be a terrifying plot-point) interesting enough to look at.

The Rational Witness™ might try pushing the limits of their power/protection, only to get pointed to when the devil tried to get Jesus to do that and Jesus said it was bad. The frustrated Rational Witness™ would, naturally, commit themselves to a psychiatric hospital, which will see loads of new patients after the Locusts come through (and pointedly do not sting the Witness-in-training). Well, that is assuming they are living somewhere with psychiatric hospitals.

Have fun from there. Though I don't see why people wouldn't, after the Torture Locusts, look at Revelation, conclude that things are happening right on schedule, and start converting on mass in preparation for the coming of the Beast. ... Well, and I have a hard time understanding why a seven-headed sea monster would get an even bigger religion around it, just because it recovered from a deadly headwound and had a talking statue built. Talking statues might have been cool in 70AD, but now they're kinda cheap. I half wonder if people resort to calling the Beast a person or geopolitical entity just because "A never-before-seen creature shows up... let's start worshiping it, even though this ancient book tells us exactly how that turns out!" seems like a terrible idea, even for nonbelievers. If there really are enough people who would literally worship a literal beast matching the description from Revelation, a Rationalist caught in this mess would doubtless take a level in cynicism.
