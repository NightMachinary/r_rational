There is an fanfic I'm reading that's a fusion of XCOM, Mass Effect, parts of Eclipse Phase, and a dash of F.E.A.R. Not too sure if it fits into the /rational/ category per se, but the characters are fairly consistent and decidedly rational-acting?

The author tried very hard to not repeat the usual beginning of Mass Effect stories. It's pretty well written, with very nice integration of the various elements. Here's the link if you're interested:
