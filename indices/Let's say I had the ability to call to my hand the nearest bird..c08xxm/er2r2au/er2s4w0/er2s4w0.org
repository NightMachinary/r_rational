  Would the authorities hunt me down?

Depends on where you are, what the bird is, who /you/ are, and how the bird dies.

If the sparrow lands in your hand and expires naturally, well, that's a weird coincidence.

If you're personally snapping the neck of the Bald Eagle on National Park property while displaying your ID, then, yes.

If you have a hunting permit, it's goose season, you're in a hunting-legal area, and you're calling geese to hand before shooting them with a legal gun for hunting, that's a legal but weird flex.
