This conversation encapsulated every great thing about this story so well. The Tyrant of Helike would be a terrible character written by a terrible writer in any other story. Blatant scheming like that should never go unpunished in any well-constructed universe.

Except, of course, this one. The Tyrant is as genre savvy as Catherine, and rather than trying to be a stabilizing force, he's decided to use stories to his advantage to act the raving madman he always wanted to be. They're both fulfilling their deepest desires, and they only get to do that because they've transcended the game and understand who the real players are. In the Tyrant's case, he knows that becoming an end boss is his best path to an amusing and fulfilling life. He also knows that narrative causality won't allow his illness to kill him so long as he is a central figure in so many stories. He's set things up so being the cackling villain is /healthcare./

He certainly knows he's doomed for failure eventually, but he also knows it will be the stuff of legends. And, somewhere, Catherine knows this too. Her best way forward will be to somehow harness the narratives Kairos is spinning and twist them against him, as she has so many times before. I'm excited to see where that takes us.
