Cordelia's perspective, from the Prologue:

#+begin_quote
  She was damned, just as the hard-eyed warlord in Callow had warned she would be. /Let me be damned, then/, she thought.
#+end_quote

Up to no good, establishing that much.

#+begin_quote
  /Dredge it out/, she wrote. /Prepare it. Fire against fire./ The Augur had found a path through, narrow as it was, and it began with a corpse that was not a corpse beneath the waters of the lake at the heart of Procer.
#+end_quote

There's the thing being raised (dredged) - a "corpse that was not a corpse". Interesting. Seems to refer to some kind of undead thing - doubly so, considering the nature of the Dead King (fire against fire).
