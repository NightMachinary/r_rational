  "If someone conquers an empire and rules it with an iron fist for thirty long years, and then some paladin breaks into his throne room and kills him, what do you think he's going to remember as he lays dying?"

  "...That good triumphed over evil?"

  "No, that he got to live like a god for three decades! Sure the last ten minutes sucked, but you can't have everything.

  Somewhere between 'villain of the week' and 'good triumphs over evil,' there's a sweet spot where guys like me get to rule the roost for years. As long as I go into this accepting the price I may eventually pay, then I *win*---no matter what actually happens."
