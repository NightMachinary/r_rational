My understanding of how you lose a Name is that the core driving force that got you Named had wavered, died or changed. The core driving force of Masego was to tear apart Creation to see how it ticked. What sprang from this was his focus on seeing the connections between how magic works (recall how he unlocked witness).

Just because he lost his magic does not mean he lost this drive to see and understand magic. It's similar to a career physicist losing access to their laboratory and equipment. They no longer have the tools to study reality but the will to know is still there and if they're driven enough, they might reaqcuire the tools or obtain something better.
