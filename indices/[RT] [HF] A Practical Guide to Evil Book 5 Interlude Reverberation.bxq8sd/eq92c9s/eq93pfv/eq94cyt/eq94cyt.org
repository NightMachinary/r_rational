One of his POV chapters has him theorising that there are 'two' kinds of magic ability, the one that most Wizards have, and one for High Arcana. Maybe he'll find himself able to develop that, and do nothing but play with High Arcana.

He's already got some ability, but I imagine further development will make things strange. If that theory about it being part of the original language of creation filtered down is true, then something to do with being Hierophant might let him bootstrap himself into something else. We'll have to see if he kept the name properly, or becomes something else entire.
