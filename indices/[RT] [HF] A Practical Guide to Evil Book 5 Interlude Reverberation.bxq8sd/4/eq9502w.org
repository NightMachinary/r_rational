Oof. So was the Dead King playing one level above the Bard or the other way around?

Kinda surprised that Tariq is willing to take the Bard's word that they should spare Kairos on pain of letting him run around any longer and further indebting himself to Catherine. (Anyone remember what their deal was? I'm terrible with these details.)

Masego criticizing Trismegistus' (I love that half the characters in this story have like 4 different names you could use for them) sorcery was pretty uproarious. It felt a bit like watching Einstein slag off Newton as a "natural philosopher". I may be badly wrong about it, but I imagine the loss of his magic won't actually affect Masego's outlook much, assuming Indrani is properly resurrected. I imagine it'll be like losing a limb and he'll struggle to function in its absence, but I expect him to set about restoring it in the same way he's always sought to improve it.
