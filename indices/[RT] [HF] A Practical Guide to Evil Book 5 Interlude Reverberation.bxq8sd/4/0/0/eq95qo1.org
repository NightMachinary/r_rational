Huh... that's... actually quite a coup for Cat if she walks out of this with a three month truce with the Dead King who's now got the knowledge to oppose to the Wandering Bard, a dead Saint and a Pilgrim whose influence in the Grand Alliance would presumably be undercut by forsaking his right to rule.

Still, that trifecta would presumably require Saint to try and kill Masego to give Cat cover to kill her, which seems unlikely given that he's successfully rid himself of Neshemah. Still, 2/3 ain't bad.

And yeah, I may have had my head up my ass about Masego returning to basically his old self considering he still has to grieve his fathers, his relationship with Indrani will have to evolve given what's just happened and the changes in her relationship with Cat, and also that he's now fully blind and without his magic.
