i guess that depends in the definition of best buds, i was not thinking on idk, buddy cops and more thinking more on the line of sam and frodo from LotRs, that trusts each other and say that they love and are pretty much a couple without getting touchy.

and i think archer and zeze already behaved very close to that without the "i love u" part.
