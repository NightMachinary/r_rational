I guess there is, if at all, only a felt difference. But I think that acknowledging that which was already there will still change things, remove a few barriers. Plus, as the comment above said, that change is one of a great barrage of changes.

Maybe it won't come to that and one or both die. But with this story, even that won't really be anything permanent.
