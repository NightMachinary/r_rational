'And it'll be worse if I dissect your shard after finding a way to torture you, I think. So I'll wait': this part made no sense to me (not in terms of disagreeing with the motivation, but that I'm not parsing why Catherine would disapprove of him doing that). That aside, the very end of this section made me REALLY REALLY happy! Very much looking forward to that being communicated to many other main characters!
