My wild fan theory is that this is Bard's play to take a pair of threats off the board: Masego, whose powers are a threat to the playing board, and Catherine, whose goals are a threat to the game state.

How? She takes away Masego's magic and dominos him a solution that involves blood sacrifice a-la our favorite half-Fae ex of Cat's. Killian coming full circle, as it were. And Cat saying no breaks the Woe, and everything devolves back to the status quo.

But obviously A: EE is a better writer than me, so this isn't what's going to happen and B: if it did, Cat would find a third way.
