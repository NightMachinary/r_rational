Trade. You have two completely segregated economies whose only point of contact is this rational person. Find something non-magical that you can bring into the real world from Narnia, find something in the real world that Narnia would value highly, and swap for profit. A fully-loaded MP3 player would cost you maybe $20, and in Narnia would probably fetch an enormous price from a local lord (though I forget how Narnia's society is really structured). Use the Narnian money to buy a fancy sword, which you can sell in the real world for /huge/ amounts of money - quality made swords are hellishly expensive, on the order of thousands of dollars. Tell people you forged it yourself. Or if the economics don't work for that, find something that they do work for. Is gold comparatively more common in Narnia? Is labor cheaper? At any rate, if you've got the only portal into Narnia, you can exploit the fact that you're the only way for them to engage in trade. No one in the real world needs to know where your stuff is coming from.

You can do a lot more if you don't care about keeping the portal secret, obviously.
