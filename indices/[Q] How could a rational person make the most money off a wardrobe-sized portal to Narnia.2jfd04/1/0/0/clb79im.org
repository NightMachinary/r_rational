The sword-collecting community is small, but they don't have any significant muscle or intelligence gathering. So even if they have questions, what the hell are they going to do about it? It /might/ be possible to test the swords for radiation and figure out that they weren't forged in a world where atomic weaponry has been used, but that seems somewhat unlikely. It would be one of those minor mysteries that I doubt would ever go anywhere.

It would also be possible to set yourself up as a smith-savant. And if you wanted to get into the business of selling swords, it would probably be wise to at least learn something about them in order to get the highest prices. If it were me, I would present myself as sort of an asshole that's highly secretive about his techniques - never giving tours of my workspace, never sharing tips with anyone, just taking from the community and never giving back.
