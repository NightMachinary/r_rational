I wouldn't give it a year before the secret is out. I'd imagine the sword-collecting community is small and thus tight ly knit, and if someone began selling high-quality blades without any prior reputation with smiths and dealers, that's going to cause questions, even if only from idle curiosity. You might be able claim that they are simply a family treasure you want to sell, which would get the attention of historians.

I feel like the only long-term method would use low-profile items, but that doesn't seem worth the bother.

And I have way to many hyphens.
