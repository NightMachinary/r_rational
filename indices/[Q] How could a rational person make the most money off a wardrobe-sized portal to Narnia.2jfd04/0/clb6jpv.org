How about this:

Found a corporation inside Narnia selling books, technology, veterinary medicine, and so on. Use that revenue to buy up the land around the portal to Earth, and then start experimenting with monetizing the time dilation effect. Build a generator, run the wires through the portal, and and see if the time dilation results in electrical output thousands of times stronger on the Earth side. Build a server farm, and see if you get orders of magnitude faster calculations. Ideally, so long as you could fit more cables though the portal (and data cables in particular can be very thin), you'd be able to vastly outcompete anyone on Earth in those industries, and potentially make billions.

Of course, it might be tough to keep your Narnia-side corporation in business for the thousands of years necessary to make a major profit on Earth. And, if the Narnian economy developed to the point that the people there would be in the market for electricity or data, it might be more profitable to sell directly to them anyway.

That in mind, it might be a better idea to just get rich in Narnia by setting off an industrial revolution, then take a vacation on Earth for a while, come back when Narnia is more technologically advanced than Earth, and then use that new knowledge to get rich by setting off a new technological revolution on Earth.

Eventually, maybe Narnia goes post-scarcity, and then money wouldn't even matter.
