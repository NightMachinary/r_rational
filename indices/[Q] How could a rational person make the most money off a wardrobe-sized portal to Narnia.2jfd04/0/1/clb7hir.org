The big problem with this is that if you're gone for hundreds of years, you might come back to a Narnia that's utterly fallen, or one that's annihilated itself with nuclear weapons, or some other such thing. This is what happens in the books - the children become kings and queens, start a Golden Age, leave, and when they come back the castle has been completely overgrown and their kingdom is in complete disarray.

You're also at a very high risk of giving away the secret.
