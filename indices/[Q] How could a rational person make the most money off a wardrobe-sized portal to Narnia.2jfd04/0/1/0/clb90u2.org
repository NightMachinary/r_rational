Sure, but unless absolutely all intelligent life on Narnia were killed, which, though not impossible, seems somewhat unlikely to me, you'd have to wait, what- a few years at most for the radiation to disperse and civilization to rebuild, or for the dark age to end. Then, you could try again.

With regards to secrecy, once you had enough money, you could do a lot of things to hide the portal, the discovery of which would be the only thing that could expose such a strange and unguessable secret. You could divert a river to flood the area, bury it under an artificial hill, build a historically significant monument over it. Anything that could last a few thousand years unaltered would probably work to keep the secret no matter how many inexplicable things you did in either world.
