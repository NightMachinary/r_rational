My first thought was to use it for cargo transport -- shift tons of stuff to Narnia, then you only have to move the wardrobe, not all of the tons of stuff. Could be a space launch technique if you can find a way to keep it secret what you're doing. That's not optimal, though.

Oh, how about nuclear waste disposal? Put it in Narnia, go back a few Earth days later to find that it's safely broken down into its final base state. (Tough on Narnia of course.)

Rich people who, for whatever reason, want to disappear from the face of the Earth now can -- for a very large fee.

As I recall, the wardrobe existed in both Narnia and Earth, right? When you went back to Earth, you climbed through the Narnia-side wardrobe? And the wardrobe could be moved in Narnia without affecting the one in Earth and vice versa?

If so, and if you had /two/ wardrobes then you're golden. It gives you:

- Effectively teleportation: set the two up one against the other in Narnia and widely separated on Earth. The time compression means that the pass through the Narnia segment takes effectively zero time.
- Effective space launch: put one wardrobe in space
- Power generation. Set the wardrobes up one above the other, facing up / down; you now have a potential energy difference that you can use to generate hydropower, and the water will automatically recycle back to the top.
- Claim the Randi prize by showing that you can do something faster than humanly possible -- they give you a giant box of Legos and some directions for how to build the Empire State Building or whatever. You step into the wardrobe and reappear a moment later with the completed assembly. Other methods are possible, of course.
- Aging wine, whiskey, whatever else benefits from sitting around for a while
- Make gemstones -- the recipe for (e.g.) diamonds is heat + pressure + time. Use the time compression to handle the time. We can already make fake gems so I don't know if this would be better / cheaper.
