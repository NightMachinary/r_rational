The existence of a wardrobe-sized portal to Narnia implies the existence of some approximation of the Christian God- possibly on the other side of the portal only, less possibly on both. Confirming or disproving this seems to me to be /slightly/ more important than any amount of money, if only because Lion-Jesus is likely to energetically and effectively object to any defacement of his dad's property, which would be inherent in most obvious kinds of moneymaking schemes. My first instinct would be to track Him down and try to get His help in working out what was going on. Though /wow/ would that be an awkward conversation.
