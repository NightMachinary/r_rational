Oh, yeah, kids don't just have less knowledge than adults.

But wait, They didn't loose that experience at all, if they lost the experience that would mean they had forgotten their time in Narnia wouldn't it? They didn't forget. That sounds like death to their old royal selves and I don' think Aslan would allow such a thing.

Is this a discussion about adult vs child intelligence independent of what existing knowledge the might have, or something else? That's that I was getting at.
