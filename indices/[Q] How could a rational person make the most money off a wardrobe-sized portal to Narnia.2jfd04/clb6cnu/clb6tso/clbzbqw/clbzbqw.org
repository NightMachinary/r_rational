With access to Narnian labor, you have the ability to take orders for highly specific hand-crafted items that would usually take hundreds, if not thousands of hours to produce, and ship them out the same day.

You could buy fresh wine and age it for decades or centuries in a day. Same with cheese (to a lesser extent).

If you could set up an electrical generator of any kind (including solar, hydro etc) with sufficiently smoothed output, you could run a 3D printer which finished jobs near-instantly from the perspective of the outer world.

You could set up cell-division/replication vats and have them churn out massive amounts of whatever hospitals wanted. 100% patient-compatible skin, for starters. And strides are being made in growing organs. Imagine being able to offer a medical research lab the ability to super-accelerate organ growth tests; they could run a thousand tests an hour instead of having to wait months on each one to see how it turned out.
