  */A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court/* is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1889_in_literature][1889 novel]] by American [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorist][humorist]] and writer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain][Mark Twain]]. The book was originally titled */A Yankee in King Arthur's Court/*. Some early editions are titled */A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur/*.

  In it, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee][Yankee]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer][engineer]] from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut][Connecticut]] is accidentally transported back in time to the court of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur][King Arthur]], where he fools the inhabitants of that time into thinking he is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)][magician]]---and soon uses his knowledge of modern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology][technology]] to become a "magician" in earnest, stunning the English of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages][Early Middle Ages]] with such feats as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition][demolitions]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firework][fireworks]] and the shoring up of a holy well. He attempts to modernize the past, but in the end he is unable to prevent [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur][the death of Arthur]] and an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdict][interdict]] against him by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church][Catholic Church]] of the time, which grows fearful of his power.

  Twain wrote the book as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque][burlesque]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism][Romantic]] notions of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry][chivalry]] after being inspired by a dream in which he was a knight himself, and severely inconvenienced by the weight and cumbersome nature of his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor][armor]].
