Judging by my faded memory of the books, the clock flat-out resets. First book, the four kids have a long and eventful reign, grow into full adults (and then, over a /decade/ later, head back through the Wardrobe and get de-aged with no time passed).

In /Prince Caspian/, they return - though not through the Wardrobe - and arrive as the same age they've by then become in Earth, rather than as adults.
