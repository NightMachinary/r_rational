I would work on the Narnia side of things. I think I can get more power and profit from using Earth resources in Narnia than Narnian resources on Earth. I would gain starting cash by selling little bits of useful tech like flashlights, ballpoint pens, lighters, or maybe spices if they have a better return rate. Once I have enough starting capital, I would start setting up infrastructure, schools and generally do as the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court][Connecticut Yankee did in Arthurian England.]]I would do this because an industrial society would be more profitable than a medieval society. The effectiveness of this plan is dependent on whether I can give away Earth's existence to Narnia.
