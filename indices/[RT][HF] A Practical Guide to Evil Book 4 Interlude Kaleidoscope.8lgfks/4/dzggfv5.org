Disappointed that Cat is still winning by maiming herself and her allies.

Prince's Folly is likely Amadis insisting that the Procerans attack while Kat is incapacitated despite the Pilgrim arguing for caution. Trudging through an icy swamp filled with corpses will be a very bad situation when Kat awakens from her coma with a new name. I'm curious to see what dilemma Katâ€˜s inner devil and angel argue about during this name dream.
