So camp Evil is down its 2 heroes, and the good army plans to attack once they find that out.

They still need to wade through the march to attack, which is like begging Juniper to crush it, so they will have to rely on hero support.

So what is going to happen? Cat makes a timely recovery? Juniper pulls a genius victory out of her ass. Alternatively, we can get Story shenanigans, but story generally favors good over evil. Like, evil can't get a pattern of 3 (Arguably, the opening move was good's victory, then we call the gate a draw)

or we Oath shenanigans. I'm pretty sure that if the side of good violates the agreement between the pilgrim and Cat, that cat gets to collect her due and bring more of he power into creation. (Like the duke of violent squalls being able to do so if he won the duel.) Now the oaths involve sacking cities, not calling for angels, demons or devils, the treatment of prisoners and the genuine surrender. I can see some of the princes getting antsy after the lake, and violating one of the latter two.
