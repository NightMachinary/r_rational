I actually think there's a chance one of the Woe is gong to bite it. The only characters we know for sure survive the story are Juniper and Aisha (from chapter header quotes) so anyone else is fair game. honestly, one of my few beefs with the story is the lack of real consequences or failures until now. only three important characters have died, one of which turned out to be a traitor. my money is on robber or Archer
