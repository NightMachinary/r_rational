The titles always have multiple meanings, but what struck me most was that the two sides did the same thing (power gambit killing tons of people, a full seventh of cat's host was killed by the wall play) but that everyone in the interlude including juniper sees cats actions as the monstrous and scary ones. The proceran fences were just good tactics, apparently.

It appears to be some named/weight thing, in that the walls were made by lots of npcs and the portal by two named, but the juxtaposition felt very "through the looking glass" to me.

Edit: to add a bit more, it has got me rethinking the setting a fair bit. It explains why Amadeus is so successful, since his whole schtick is making best use of non-named and avoiding weight and backlash. Also explains why the gnomes hate technological advancement, which would disrupt the status quo that keeps the whole continent down, by making named less relevant. Effectively they don't need to police Calernia because the stories enforce stagnation.

I know these thoughts are nothing new, but this chapter has given me a bunch to think about.
