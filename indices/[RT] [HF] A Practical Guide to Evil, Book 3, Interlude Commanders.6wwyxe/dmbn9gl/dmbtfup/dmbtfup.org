I pretty much agree with your assessment. Nauk estimated that the allied armies could beat 30k fae with difficulty. The winter fae drew off 20k. Leaving Cat to deal with 40k summer fae.

3k elite heavy calvary mounting a surprise attack on an unguarded flank is a horror to any commander in the other side. In their initial surprise charge I'd bet they could reduce summer's effective cohesive fighting force by as many as 15k. I doubt they'll be able to actually kill more than 6k in the long term, especially as the summer commanders react and account for their presence. Reducing the amount of soldiers summer is capable of using against Cat too 34k, and perhaps 25-30k for a few crucial minutes.

That's enough to make this a tossup by Nauk's standards.

I'm assuming Ranger's main, and perhaps ONLY role in this battle will be to neutralize the summer princess. Who's an army unto herself. I'm not sure how that'd factor into Nauk's read of the battle, but it's a big deal.

Cat and her allied commanders doubtless have a few other cards up their sleeves, and the force of narrative. Pretty much assuring victory.
