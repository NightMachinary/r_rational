You're right, we haven't seen any battle that killed multiple princes.

i hadn't considered assigning Ranger as the "One", on one hand it kinda fits, on the other, i don't think Cat would risk trying to get Ranger to do anything for her. Meaning she is here uninvited. Which means her plan doesn't feature Ranger.

If Ranger were to do anything in this battle, it be taking out the princess. But if Cat's plan doesn't feature Ranger, then she would have her own plan for taking down the princess. (Though maybe she fucked up and Ranger bails her out. Akua also underestimated the princess)
