That wouldn't be too surprising, defeating Summer / Diabolist is pretty climactic in terms of the story. It would be fitting for Cat to transfer to a newer, more powerful Name afterwards (or even during).

I don't like the fact that the Winter King has some control over her, so hopefully she's able to void that connection in some way sooner rather than later (and in such a way that she gets a baller powerup!).
