Awesome! Ranger is here!

On a slightly more serious note, how do you think powerlevels compare? Cat has 30k forces, Summer is at 60k-ish. Call it 80-90k effective force due to fey being stronger than mortals, and add 5k to Cat's force due to Watch. Knights are another 3k, doubled for awesomeness for 6k effective. Cat is probably 3-4k in her own right especially if she uses her Naming advantages properly, same with Deadhand. Winter is another 20k (more powerful than mortals, but have inherent we-lose-to-summer-in-direct-battle malus, so I think effective number is the same). Ranger is probably another 10k by herself based on the hype. Robber is god knows where, but probably prepares another trap-call it another 2k in power. If Apprentice and Archer join the field (and they are supposed to be reasonably close, I think), that's another 8k. 87k-ish total lead by a marshal of the legions of terror and a Named with the Junior Calamity bonus vs 90-ish total Summer, lead by two people with blatant reasoning biases, before you account for whatever traps Summer might have.

To be quite honest, I think Catherine wins this one easy.
