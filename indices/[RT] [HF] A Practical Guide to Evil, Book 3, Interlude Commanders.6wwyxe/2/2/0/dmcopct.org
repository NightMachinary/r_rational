I really doubt it's that severe. If we were talking against a mortal army, I might have agreed, but this is /fey/. For one, their whole army can just decide to fly up to avoid the charge entirely. That'd still cost them something (otherwise, I don't see why they wouldn't be flying all the time), but it's a possibility. Morale damage is likewise basically nonexistant against them. I think charge will be effective, but not /five times multiplier/ effective.
