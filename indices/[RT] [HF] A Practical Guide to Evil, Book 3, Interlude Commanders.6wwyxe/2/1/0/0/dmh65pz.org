Sure, but there are innumerable stories where she would survive, while her forces would not. Even Summers' own plan allowed for that, with the last through the breach fighting a desperate but doomed defence to save their commander. Even without Cat doing anything she'd survive. She'd just lose someone dear to her (say...Adjutant).

The point is less that Cat's using narrative to save her own skin, than that she's twisting it to /destroy her enemies/.
