There's also the narrative causality at play, since this is Arcadia. Cat's flipped the story from a brave retreat under fire to the Battle of Minas Tirith, where disparate allies join together to beat a previously overwhelming unified force.

We've got the besieged defenders. We've got the surprise arrival of a supernatural army of death (Winter/Dunharrow) flooding onto one flank. We've got a force of formerly-exiled cavalry (Callow/Rohirrim) smashing into the other. We'll soon have the equivalent of Legolas swinging under their unbeatable monsters. All we need now is for one of the royals to have an ambiguous prophecy about their invulnerability.
