Would be a weird ass offer though, can't exactly use a hand as jewelry. And Ranger would probably be able to just waltz into the realm of summer and get it herself whenever she fancied, given that she wanders into the realm of winter every year to grab the eye. Which i suppose is a bit of my problem with Ranger being her at Cat's behest. Cat can't offer anything that Ranger can't just go fetch herself whenever she fancied.

The only thing Ranger seems to care about is entertainment. (Which she seems to be getting now)
