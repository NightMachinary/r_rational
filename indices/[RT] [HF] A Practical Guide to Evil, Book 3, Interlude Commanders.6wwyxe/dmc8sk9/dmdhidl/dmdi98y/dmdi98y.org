  When historians try to pin down Foundling's methods they point to the Battle of the Camps or the Princes' Graveyard, but those came later.

It's pretty clear we haven't seen "Princes' Graveyard" yet. Also the placement of the apostrophe is relevant here(which I messed up in transcribing the quote); "Prince's Graveyard" implies a singular prince while "Princes' Graveyard" implies a graveyard belonging to multiple princes.

  4 armies and one
#+end_quote

The definition that I'm following is the four armies are:\\
* Legions of Terror (Alfobi, Cat, and Ranker)\\
* Winter\\
* Summer\\
* "Callowan" (Deoraithe, Knights of the Broken Bell)

And the "One" is Ranger in the hills.

Edit: Alternatively, the Knights are part of the Legions of Terror (that what their official status is anyway) and the Deoraithe are their own Army. I lean towards the previous interpretation myself. However, you're right there is room in the story for another army if you have all armies under Cat's direct chain command(Alfobi, Cat, and Ranker, Knights) or embedded (Deoraithe) as one Army and only have Winter, Summer, and Ranger left. It'll be interesting to see what happens next.
