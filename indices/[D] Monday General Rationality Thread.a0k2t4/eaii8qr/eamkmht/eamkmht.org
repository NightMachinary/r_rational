It's good. I end up guessing a lot though by the end. Would like to see someone figure out how you can figure out properly the names of the four Chinese sailors or that guy torn in half who I kept thinking was Irish, for example.

Guessing it has something to do with the numbers on their bunks? Or is there a less time-intensive way?
