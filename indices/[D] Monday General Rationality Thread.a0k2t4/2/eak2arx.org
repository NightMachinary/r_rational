From Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill, this quote matches my intuitions about how the world works, but it goes against what I've learned from my exploration of rationality.

#+begin_quote
  Analysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well beyond the million dollar mark, disclosed the fact that every one of them had the habit of REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY, and of changing these decisions SLOWLY, if, and when they were changed. People who fail to accumulate money, without exception, have the habit of reaching decisions, IF AT ALL, very slowly, and of changing these decisions quickly and often.
#+end_quote

Rationality is a tool that should be optimized to reach our goals, so if we reach a suboptimal action/thought/decision, then we are not acting rationally. The attitude I've seen from our sphere has been of careful consideration during decision making, and a willingness to change the decision in light of new information. Napolean Hill wasn't a very sciency guy and it looks like he exaggerated some of his claims, but he clearly knew how to be successful. So what happened here?

Hypotheses:

- People predisposed to making quick decisions have other traits that help them be financially successful

  - Perhaps we are predisposed to slow decisions, and this unintentionally selects for people less likely to have these traits

- Making decisions quickly (and not changing them) has other effects that I am not accounting for (such as minimising distraction, increasing determination)
- The data only accounts for highly successful people, not considering quick decision-makers that have failed or fallen into debt

But these effects would have to be severe to give such a low representation of slow thinkers. If rationality works properly, we should expect at least some bias towards success? So:

- I've missed some key information and I'm misrepresenting rationalists or financially successful people
- Rationalist dogma doesn't account for some detail that affects financial success
