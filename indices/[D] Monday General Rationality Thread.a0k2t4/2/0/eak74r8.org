Napoleon Hill wasn't being scientific, the plural of anecdote is not data, and success isn't a skill.

That said, people who make decisions quickly and change their mind slowly are risk takers and most extremely rich people are, indeed, risk takers. You've realized part of that is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias][survivorship bias]]. I think most of the rest is iterative: People whose risks pay off early become more likely to take risks, people whose risks do not pay off become less likely to take them.

Starting in comfort, or even wealth, also helps: If your consequences for failure are low, you can afford to take more risks before you start getting shy. If you fail, you won't wind up in Mr. Hill's sample.

Now there /are/ people who get modestly rich without taking big risks... by living below their means and investing the remainder in reliably safe vehicles. The old book of choice for that method is George S. Clason's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon][The Richest Man in Babylon]]. Safe investing is still about being slow to change your mind, even if you're slow to make decisions.

So rationalist dogma and wild financial success do not necessarily overlap (as Nicholas Nassim Taleb put it, "If you're rich, why aren't you so smart?") so temper your expectations. A lot of it really is being in the right place at the right time, and being willing to take a gamble and stick with it. None of that requires much in the way of slow thinking...

...and none of it is a guarantee.
