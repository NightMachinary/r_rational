I don't believe you when you effectively claim that financial success is based on luck to such an extent that good decision making is not even a noticeable factor.

Napolean Hill gave lots of methods to promote success in his book, completely unrelated to luck. And there are plenty of other authors with methods to improve the chance of success. It is entirely reasonable for a rationalist to need a large wealth, and would seek out such resources. An effective rationalist could benefit from these more than the 'not smart' businessmen that you've implied make up the obscenely wealthy demographic.

But they don't.

I'd assign 99%+ chance that there's a genius to these businessmen that isn't being fully realised in our formulations for what makes effective decision-making. That is, excluding my main hypothesis that this discussion has already taken place and I've simply missed it.
