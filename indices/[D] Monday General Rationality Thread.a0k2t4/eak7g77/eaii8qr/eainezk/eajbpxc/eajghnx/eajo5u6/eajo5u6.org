There's a really interesting post about the graphics: [[https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.msg1363742#msg1363742]].

I suspect the compression artefacts in the video are interfering with some of the strategies used to reduce discomfort, since video compression is really not built for things like this, but I don't know for sure as I haven't played the game. The videos also look a bit different to the link above, so maybe it has been changed since then.
