Eh, good questions. I understand very little of the topic, but I've seen people claim that /suppressing/ the gene was already a therapy used for HIV. So basically all this is doing is removing it altogether. The main issues with this I can see is:

- errors can happen - did the CRISPR really only alter that gene?

- is there any unforeseen interaction or consequence that can take place in later generations because of this?

I'm not sure whether there would have /ever/ been a fully ethical way of testing this in humans, though. It's not like heart transplants, where even when the technique was rudimentary it was applied to adult people who could consent and for whom it was the only chance at a slightly longer life anyway.
