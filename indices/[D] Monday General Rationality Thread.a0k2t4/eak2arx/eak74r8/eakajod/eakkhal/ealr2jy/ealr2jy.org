Ok, I see what you mean. Let me see if I got you right: There are a lot of unpredictable factors that affect the financial success and the number of savvy businessmen >> savvy rationalist businessmen. The savviness that they exhibit is not consistently reproducible, but people with similar personalities/abilities will be able to to use it, corrupting Hill's sample. The ability difference between an effective rationalist and a smart Hill-like person is not enough to noticeably impact the quantity difference, and so after the filter of luck, the 0.01% is vastly dominated by these Hill-like people.

I agree with your assessment, but I can't be sure that this all there is. It's still entirely possible that some part of their success comes down to reproducible techniques (other than the one you mentioned), whether or not they've identified them. I don't know how to rank my new confidence though, though it's less than my previous one.
