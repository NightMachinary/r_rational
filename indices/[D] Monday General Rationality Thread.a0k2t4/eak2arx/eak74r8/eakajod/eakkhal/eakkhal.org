Both Hill and Clason wrote their first books in the Roaring 20's, both of them lost almost everything in the Great Depression, and both of them tried again and succeeded. Hill's rises and falls were cyclical thereafter, Clason decided to settle down.

The millionaires Hill was interviewing were the business and innovation successes of that bubble era. People flocked to hear their secrets the way people still flock to the words of get-rich gurus like Robert Kiyosaki and Stephen Covey and Tai Lopez. The thing that makes /them/ rich (sometimes impressively so) is those self-same secrets. It operates a bit like the Emperor's New Clothes. If their advice isn't working for folks like us, either we're not doing it right, we're not doing it enough, or we're not really as smart as they are after all.

I don't believe it.

Good decision making /is/ a factor to obscene wealth. These tycoons and innovators aren't idiots. They wouldn't be rich if they hadn't had some good idea at the right time, and not just anybody can do that. People who aren't them could have, though, and didn't. They had that idea too late, or they had another idea that didn't work out for some reason or another. Maybe they started their map business right before the Great Depression. Oops.

*If you want to make money, live below your means and take some smart risks with your excess capital.* If you want to get obscenely rich, go ahead and try to find and foster the next big thing. Be aware, however, that you're not alone and that upwards of 80% of businesses fail. You'll likely invest years in it and have it blow up in your face or just sputter out to nothing. If you really do find the actual thing that people want, there's a chance you'll still be an also-ran as somebody a little quicker or sooner or better situated than you runs off with a slightly more successful version of your idea.

Stuff like that happens all the time to wannabe tycoons and innovators, and very few of us will ever know their names.
