I just played my favorite take on a true detective game (i.e. a game about genuinely deducing stuff based on limited though sufficient evidence). It's called The Return of the Obra Dinn ([[https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/][Steam]], [[https://www.gog.com/game/return_of_the_obra_dinn][GoG]]). A ship lost at sea has returned years later, with no-one on board. Your mission is to find out what happened to each member of the crew. By the end, you have a complete list of 60 crew members (including passengers), know how they look like, and have listed their fate (dead incl. cause of death and possibly perpetrator; or alive incl. where).

HPMoR is a great detective story, with far more satisfying deductions than typical crime novels. This game felt similar. Probably worth a top-level post here.

EDIT: I think [[https://steamcommunity.com/id/alphyna/recommended/653530/][this review]] is a good take on what's so special about the game.
