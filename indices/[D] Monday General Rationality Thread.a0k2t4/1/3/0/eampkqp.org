Regarding the Chinese sailors, there's a spoiler discussion [[https://steamcommunity.com/app/653530/discussions/0/1732090362050477541/][here]]: The hammocks in the night scenes at the beginning of two of the chapters have numbers corresponding to the crew list. You can also check the "who is present in the scene" thing to see that all the ca. 22 people in the hammocks are obviously sailors and topmen, not midshipmen, stewards, officers or passengers. So that already reduces the possibility space by a lot. Some sailors you can directly identify because they're lying visibly in their hammocks; in case of the Chinese sailors, only their shoes / socks / etc. are visible, but are visually very distinct.

In general, the [[https://steamcommunity.com/app/653530/discussions/][Steam forums]] of the game are full of discussions, including what hints there are for identifying each person. I recall a great thread that explained how to identify all the seamen, but can't find it anymore.

Oh, and (more spoilers) [[https://gameplay.tips/guides/3292-return-of-the-obra-dinn.html][here's]] a list of more evidence for all characters. Seems like a very useful resource once one has beaten the game. Though despite what the article may say, there's probably way more supporting evidence for many of the characters than the author found - given the absurd attention to detail of the game, I'm very skeptical about claims like this one: "Hamadou Diom. You can't tell who Diom is by his appearances or his hammock. You can only identify him after you've identified all of the other sailors [...]"
