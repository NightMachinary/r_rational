All I can say is that the graphics didn't detract one bit from the gameplay, for me.

In case anyone is unsure about the game but wants to try it, two options are a) briefly trying the [[https://dukope.itch.io/return-of-the-obra-dinn][free demo]] from 2016 (though given that it's from years ago, it might look quite different from the final product) or b) buying it on Steam and, if it's discomforting or not enjoyable, requesting a refund (if such a thing matters to you, this is also sanctioned by the dev [[https://twitter.com/dukope/status/1052969879572078592][here]]). The latter requires a Steam playtime of <2h, and having bought the game <14 days ago, but is essentially automatic if both conditions are satisfied.
