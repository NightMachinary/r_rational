Paranoia, coupled with the stress of being a high-ranking Visser and being constantly frustrated by his subordinates, could possibly do a lot of damage and hinder Esplin and the invasion. If the author does choose to go down this road, I'd love to see how it's done to fit the AU in a way that isn't some cartoonish, Yeerk-Plan-Of-The-Week type of villainy like in the books. And if there's more Esplin/Alloran POV chapters to come, it could explain Esplin's seemingly irrational thought processes and behavior in a way that's completely rational /to him/ (and the audience) given his circumstances. Would that still count, I wonder?

Honestly though, no matter what the author plans to do, I'm excited either way.
