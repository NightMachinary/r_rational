I didn't think about that when I read it, but it's possible that kandrona has a "flavor" (or subjective experience) that's difference when it comes through a Yeerk rather than in its pure form, and that V3 just likes the taste of it.

EDIT: Esplin refusing to leave Alloran might /become/ a thing, if it isn't already. Was it just maple sugar or whatever that made Yeerks crazy, or did eating Yeerks do that too?
