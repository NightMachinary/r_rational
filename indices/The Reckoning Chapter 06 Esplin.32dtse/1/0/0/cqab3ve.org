I also love stories that give you perspectives from all sides, like this one is doing. I like seeing where they get it wrong and where they get it right.

There's a fic out there from the POV of Lex Luthor, where he meets with Bruce Wayne and has a little conversation with Bruce. "I know the truth: /You're funding Batman./"

And yeah it's wrong but Lex gives his reasoning and... it wasn't silly or anything, Lex was just missing a couple of key pieces of information.
