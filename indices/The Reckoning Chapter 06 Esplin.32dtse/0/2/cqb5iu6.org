If this theory is confirmed, I have to wonder how the Frolis Maneuver will factor in to this AU's altered morphing abilities and what that means to the plot, if it will exist in this fic at all.

Given these morphing developments we learn in these last two chapters, I wonder if that means a Frolis morphed person can access not just the shared DNA but the shared memories of the morphed individuals. I hope we'll see soon when Ax shows up! It could probably cut out a lot of Ax's brand of buffoonery with getting used to Human Stuff when/if he does the Frolis Maneuver.
