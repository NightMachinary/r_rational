  I'm glad that it seems as though Esplin still has starts of being just as paranoid as his book-canon self, if not more so. It's one of my favorite things about post-TAC/THBC Esplin, and it'd just make no sense and be pretty boring if that were eliminated entirely from his character, no matter how competent and confident he is in a rational AU.

I agree. It also seems like a fair flaw for a character with a rational to still have. He is so competent at most things, he can't empathize well or understand his incompetent underlings. He can think of all kinds of ridiculously clever schemes and attacks, so in turn, he is constantly on guard and expending effort on absurd possibilities (actually, this still might be useful if they are anything like canon!animorphs).
