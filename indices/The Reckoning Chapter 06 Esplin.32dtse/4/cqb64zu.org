Wonderful job to the author of this fic, and the authors for this chapter! My only complaint is that the parentheses can be a bit confusing, are they used as an aside for their shared thinking, or are they thought-speaking to each other, replacing the greater-than/less-than symbols? Amazing fic overall, so far!

It's incredible to see the, IMO, very believable breakdown of how their thinking would work in this AU. What took book-canon Esplin three years to realize, only took him three days in this fic... These kids are in some deep shit.

I'm glad that it seems as though Esplin still has starts of being just as paranoid as his book-canon self, if not more so. It's one of my favorite things about post-TAC/THBC Esplin, and it'd just make no sense and be pretty boring if that were eliminated entirely from his character, no matter how competent and confident he is in a rational AU. I'm excited if their shared POV chapters become a regular thing, but if not, then I'm glad we at least got this chapter!

  Maybe some of the lonelier sort would morph and seek mates among the humans, as rumor said had been done during the conquest of the Hork-Bajir, on the homeworld of the Arn---perhaps Esplin and Alloran would give it a try, together?

Hahaha! Oh Esplin, just couldn't help himself.

Though now that this was mentioned... I wonder if we'll find out how THBC and TAC worked out, if I'm understanding correctly, if a morpher loses their personal sapience when they nothlit? Will Toby even exist in this AU? Or can the nothlit issue be explained by there being new and altered Escafil devices by the time Elfangor gives the kids the morphing power?
