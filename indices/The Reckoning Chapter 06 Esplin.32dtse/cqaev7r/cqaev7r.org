Holy shit. Walk through this with me here, because Visser 3 has a horrible, horrible card up his sleeve. And possibly, so do the kids.

  Clearly, the morphing technology took more than just a DNA sample. There had to be some kind of scanning going on during the acquiring process, or else all kinds of things would have been different---I'd read, for instance, that height had almost as much to do with hormones and nutrition as it did with actual genes.

It is confirmed that when you acquire a morph you don't just get the genes.

Now look at this:

  One---the Andalites had successfully replaced a human girl, with mimicry on par with that of a Yeerk. Conclusion: someone else in the Andalite chain of command had discovered Alloran's little back door.
#+end_quote

Alloran has a "back door" and the reason that this is brought up is because an Andalite has displayed "mimicry on par with that of a Yeerk."

Meaning? Acquiring a morph grabs the person's memories as well, and Alloran knows how to access those memories. Meaning that Visser 3 knows how.

Which means that Visser 3 wouldn't have to put a Yeerk in, say, Jake's head to find out everything that Jake knows. He would just have to acquire Jake, morph Jake, and then use the Back Door.

The one silver lining here is that the same goes for the Animorphs and accessing Elfangor.
