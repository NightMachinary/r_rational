  Which means that Visser 3 wouldn't have to put a Yeerk in, say, Jake's head to find out everything that Jake knows. He would just have to acquire Jake, morph Jake, and then use the Back Door.

If Visser 3's backdoor is related to the intereference in nervous systems between two instances of the same morph at once we saw in the previous chapter, it may be possible for him to get at Jake's memories by being morphed into the same morph as Jake at the same time. Any bets on whether Visser 3/Alloran has acquired Elfhangor?
