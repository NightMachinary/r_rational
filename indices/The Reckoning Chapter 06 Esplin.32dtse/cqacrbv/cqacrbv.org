My first reaction to that 'snack' thing at the end was basically "Holy shit, Esplin 9466 Lesser is Visser Three in this one".

Now that I think about it, that's not very likely. Why would anyone tolerate Esplin the Lesser cannibalizing other Yeerks? Why would Esplin the Lesser even need to, if he had access to Kandrona rays?

I could come up with some justifications for that (Esplin refuses to leave Alloran for any reason, even Kandrona, because why would you make yourself vulnerable like that), but at that point complexity penalties negate any benefit for explaining the 'snack' thing so I'm not hinging my hopes on my idea being right.
