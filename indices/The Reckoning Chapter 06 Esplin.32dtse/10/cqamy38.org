This is my least favorite chapter so far, probably because I don't understand Visser 3's objectives as well as I do the human characters'.

We start off with him having just received a report. We, the readers, don't get to know to know what the details of that report were.

Visser 3 takes those details, and at one point suspects that the morphing tech has been revolutionized and that he now has something to blame besides incompetence of the yeerks for all the obstacles and delays they had faced. There's satisfaction and rationalization in this simple conclusion.

And then things get less simple, less rational, more complex, and we still don't know what exactly was in the details of that report. The character is now holding some kind of Omniscience Ball in place of actual problem-solving. What we have now is an very powerful character leading a large organization and making risky decisions off of irrational conclusions.
