  *Occam's razor* (also written as *Ockham's razor* and in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin][Latin]] /lex parsimoniae/, which means 'law of parsimony') is a problem-solving principle devised by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham][William of Ockham]] (c. 1287--1347), who was an English [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan][Franciscan]] friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian. The principle states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but---in the absence of differences in predictive ability---the fewer assumptions that are made, the better.

  [[https://i.imgur.com/iVDoO20.jpg][*Image*]] [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Heliocentric.jpg][^{i}]] - /Andreas Cellarius's illustration of the Copernican system, from the Harmonia Macrocosmica (1708).The motions of the sun, moon and other solar system planets can be calculated using a geocentric model (the earth is at the center) or using a heliocentric model (the sun is at the center). Both work, but the geocentric system requires many more assumptions than the heliocentric system, which has only seven. This was pointed out in a preface to Copernicus' first edition of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium./
