The report Visser Three receives is Ispec's testimony, including Ispec's conclusions regarding what "she" saw. Initially, Visser Three takes these conclusions for truth, because they match reasonably well with what was observed, and (as Cassie pointed out) a morph-capable human is somewhat inconceivable. It's only once Alloran is confused that Esplin remembers to switch on some skepticism, realizes that he can trust what his underling SAW but not necessarily what his underling THINKS about what was seen, and starts trying to reorder facts in a sensible way.
