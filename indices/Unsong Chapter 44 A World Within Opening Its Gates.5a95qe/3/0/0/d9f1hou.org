It was mentioned he had 4 children and 3 daughters...

I've been positive that TCK's son is 'The Other King'. I first started thinking this when TCK was talking to Sohu about how to love all the world as his children, but to still love his own true children uniquely. Something about it.

My theory, which I might elaborate, is that TKC lost his wife (alluded to when Aaron expresses that he wants to be TCK 2.0) to some sort of trickery of Thamiel. (Specifically an attack on the CometCompound during the seige of Hell while Daddy was away. Which explains the instant damage indicator on Sohu.) TOK goes full darkside, starts attacking fucking up daddy's plans and letting/knowingly sacrificing innocents because the ends are justified and a pronounced contempt for non-angelic humans. Daddy tries to intervene, and won't push the fight as hard as his incensed, grief addled son. The remaining commetspawn fight their brother to prevent his tarnishing their fathers' legacy and fight Thamiel to see it completed.

I'll make a full post about this with passage references and rationale tomorrow. It's late and this has been constructing itself for weeks.

Edit: this is turning into a re-read, "tomorrow" was a grossly optimistic estimate.
