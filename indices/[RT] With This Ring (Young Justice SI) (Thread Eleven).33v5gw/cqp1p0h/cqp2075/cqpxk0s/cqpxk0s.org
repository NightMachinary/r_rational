I downloaded the ebook version, and I know for sure it has at least one major missing chunk, I made a post about it but no one said anything. Eventually I just started reading the story only thread, and dealing with having to scroll to the correct part of the page whenever my phone randomly decided to refresh the page while the browser was minimized. Plus the ebook didn't have colored text.

There is a special place of deep hatred in my heart for long story threads that don't have a next chapter button at the end of the posts. Even having to scroll to the top of the post is extremely immersion breaking, especially on a phone. But at least that way I wouldn't have to figure out which of the 25 2k+ word posts on the page I was in the middle of reading. I think the worst are stories where I have to scroll to the top of the post in order to check the chapter I'm on, then go back to the first page to get to the index, /then/ click on the next chapter.
