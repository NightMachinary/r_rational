There's a lot of /potentially interesting/ stuff... However, consider the story's recent events. [[#s][Games We Play]]

The author doesn't seem to have sorted out that just because the main character would logically tell someone something, doesn't mean you have to tell the person /on camera/ and take up a thousand words to do so. You could simply put in "And then, after telling X about Y, I went do actually important and interesting new plot point or plot point advancement Z. and skip the thousand or two thousand words telling X about Y on camera. If, in a scene there is no stakes, no actual opposition, no chance of failure, no new information for the reader... then I would much rather the author elide the scene and go to the next one.
