He provided bad examples to prove his point. A lot of the stuff mentioned either was a set up for a later plot point or just general world building.

After Jacques death the logical conclusion is his family coming home for his funeral. Introducing 7 new characters and mentioning " and then I told my sisters about my semblance and after school activities before training again" is just bad writing. Those chapters served to characterize his sisters and explain their semblances among other things. One of his sister's semblance gives him insight on his own and is revisited soon afterwards. We find out that another sister will be in Mistral which is likely going to be important seeing as Jaune will be returning there for several reasons.

The fight among the arc siblings is there to show several of his new skills and how far Jaune has grown even after his fight with Conquest.

The bar fight provided Jaune the opportunity to meet Ruby which leads to a plot point set up earlier while also introducing Yang and dealing with her without angering Raven.

To say that there isn't any tension since the Conquest arc is a lie. We learn of the Arc family dynamic which does some world building and exposition on hunter families in particular the relationship with Isabella and her daughters. We confirm the existence of one other Rider and speculation on how many more there are and who their hosts could be. The aftermath of the bar fight introduces new information about the Grimm and also ties back into a plot point introduced way back when Jaune visited Mistral for the tournament.

There reasons he provided aren't good examples of his point. A better one would be Jaune's rematch with the Grimm since it didn't really show anything we haven't seen before.
