The author generally skips Paul testing his power, as it would be annoying to either have a long repetitive scene or have a short scene that could have been better mentioned to already have happened. In regards to the monkey thing, the author largely used dialogue from the show that the fic is based on, at least during the early parts. That line about monkeys comes up in the show without any explanation as well, and I'm really not sure if it's ever mentioned again.
