The renegade chapters are a slightly different story where Paul is more aggressive. The two stories do no interact, and you are perfectly able to completely skip them. I've taken to doing so because I don't find the main character as compelling as I do in the main one, although occasionally he has some fun rants.

I'm not sure what you mean by feeling like you miss chapters. Just about everything Paul does in his off time is mentioned beforehand and then you can basically assume he continues doing so. Cleaning the ocean, meditating, and reading about villains is set up, then not repeated because that would be boring. If that's not what you mean, you could ask me. I recently got caught up with the story.
