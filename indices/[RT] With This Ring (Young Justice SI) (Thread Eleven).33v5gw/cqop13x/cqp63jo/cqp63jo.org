You can use [[https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/6187-xenforo-invis-text-multi-reveal][this]] Greasemonkey script to warn you about invisible text on the spacebattles forums.

#+begin_quote
  This script adds a button to reveal invisible text. The button is placed under a poster's avatar, and will only be displayed if there is transparent text in the post. Also, a dotted grey border is placed around any invisible text to denote its presence.
