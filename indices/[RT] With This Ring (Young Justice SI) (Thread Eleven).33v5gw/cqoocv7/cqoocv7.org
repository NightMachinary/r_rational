The [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][Story Only Thread]] is far more convenient for online reading than the version spread over 11 threads and ~2100 pages. The page you linked does have .epub versions for offline access (I recommend reading online if possible, sometimes the author links stuff in-story).

I like the story a lot; Honestly it's almost better if you don't know Young Justice canon, because then the canon rehashes won't bother you as much. The author is now moving into between-season territory (YJ had a 5-year intermission between major storylines) so the dovetailing to the stations of canon should hopefully not be a problem for the foreseeable future.

The author updates very regularly - in the middle of the night for those in North America, every night without pause or break. It's built up a lot of story over time. Pretty much 95% of the updates either introduce important plot points or advance previous plot points - compared to Games We Play, the other major Spacebattles Daily Updating Creative Writing Thread, this is a huge improvement (that story, in contrast, has gone a couple realtime months, e.g. ~60 updates, without anything interesting happening)

The SI actually is trying to explore and use superhero tech and magic logically to help/improve himself and others. That's something I like a lot. Also, there's a lot of genuinely good emotional parts, and a lot of good humour too. The hints of romantic attraction mostly have thus far just served to throw fuel into the shipping in the discussion threads, rather than going anywhere.

The author has also proved fairly responsive to reader feedback.
