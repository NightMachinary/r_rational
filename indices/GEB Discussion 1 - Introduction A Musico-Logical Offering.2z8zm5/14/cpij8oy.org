I also found it intriguing that the author connected the idea of paradoxes with the number 0. I hope he goes into more detail later on that. My own thoughts were that if truth and falsehood were compared to positive and negative numbers, then perhaps paradoxes are the 0 in between. It does not seem hard to think of some truths as being 'more true' than others, i.e., containing more true/useful information and/or less false information. And it does seem that paradoxes like 'this statement is false' contain no useful information whatsoever - so they seem rather analogous to 0.

Do you remember how it was shown that there were certain things 'uncomputable' via Principia Mathematica? Perhaps the authors of PM simply left the 'logical 0' out of their system, much like the ancient Greeks left a 0 symbol out of their number system.

I also recall (from a computing theory class I once took) Turing's proof that the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem][Halting Problem]] was undecidable. The proof goes that /if/ we could write a program A that could tell you, given a program B and some input, whether program B would loop forever, then we could also run program A on itself in certain tricky-to-explain ways and make a paradox. I remembered that even once my mind understood the proof, my heart never quite figured out why it mattered or made sense in real world terms. But now I suppose that it was just the 'missing 0' in Turing's computational theory.

Could it be that all we need for paradoxes to make sense, is to remember to include the '0' in our systems?
