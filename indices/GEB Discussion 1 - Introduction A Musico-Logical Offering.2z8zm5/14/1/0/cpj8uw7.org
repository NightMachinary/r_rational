I may not be explaining it very well, but my hope is that maybe if we just relaxed our assumption that all things must be True or False, and admitted paradoxes (aka trivialities) into our logical vocabulary, then the whole thing would sort itself out. It may have been devastating to the scientists that thought Principia Mathematica was perfect, when they learned it was lacking, but the proper solution is to accept the missing piece and go from there. Instead of proving a system is consistent, can we at least prove that it's consistent across all meaningful, aka non-paradoxical, aka "non-zero", expressions? As a theist, I posit that we just didn't understand yet what "all-knowing" meant in real terms.
