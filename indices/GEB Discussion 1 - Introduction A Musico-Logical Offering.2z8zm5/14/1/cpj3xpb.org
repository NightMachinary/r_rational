I don't think I can do this explanation justice on why the Halting Problem or Godel's Theorem is applicable to the real wold, but to do so, one needs to understand the social context in which Godel thought up his revolutionary idea in 1931.

Before Godel, people thought that every theorem in mathematics and logic would eventually be discovered and that it was possible for any potential knowledge to be proven true or false. When Godel proved that in any sufficiently powerful formal system that there will always be true and false statements which cannot be proven from within the system. This was heart-breakingly devastating to the world at the time. You couldn't trust in the very laws of logic, the science of rational thought itself, to be capable of proving everything. Furthermore, you never could even be absolutely certain that the system was consistent. Godel proved that if a system was inconsistent (holds a contradiction), then it can be proven inconsistent, but you could never prove the system was consistent, or guaranteed to only permit true theorems. Only the fact that mathematics has not been found to be inconsistent for centuries gives weak evidence to its consistency.

The Halting Problem can be viewed as an application of Godel's Theorem to computer science, where given a sufficiently powerful computing machine such as a Turing Machine (a possible isomorphism for a mathematical formal system such as the axioms of number theory) will not be able to compute all possible functions (another isomorphism onto not all theorems are provably true in the mathematical system).

Even though I'm an atheist, I viewed Godel's Theorem as the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. With this knowledge, we have learned not everything is knowable. To be all-knowing is to ultimately fail.
