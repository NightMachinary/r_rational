I'm not sure how much more Godel's Theorem will be covered since I haven't read further on, but I will be very surprised if it doesn't appear again considering that Godel's name is in the very title. Also GEB is known for it's frequent references to previous ideas when it talks about new topics.

I recommend making your judgement on whether or not to continue reading on after chapters 1, 2, and 3.
