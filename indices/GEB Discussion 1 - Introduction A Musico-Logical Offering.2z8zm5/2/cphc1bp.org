This will be my first read-through of this allegedly life-changing book, and I'm curious to see what all the fuss is about. So far I have no idea. Basically all I'm getting so far is:

- "Recursion! Paradoxes! These things sure are weird and neat, aren't they?"
- A lot of dancing around GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem without any clear sense of why it's important or interesting (or for that matter, what it even really means, or how it's proven, which is frustrating since while I'm sure some others on this sub are already familiar with this topic, I am not).
- The most famous of Zeno's paradoxes, with unfunny jokes.

I realize that we haven't even properly started the first chapter, but... someone reassure me. This is gonna get good, yeah?
