Inspired by yesterday's reading, I tried to make a strange loop themed drawing myself - [[http://i.imgur.com/NVojCes.jpg][a man imagining himself.]]

Some general ideas that the reading inspired:

  Such, one imagines, was Bach's intention; but Bach indubitably also relished the implication that this process could go on ad infinitum, which is perhaps why he wrote in the margin "As the modulation rises, so may the King's Glory."

  Implicit in the concept of Strange Loops is the concept of infinity, since what else is a loop but a way of representing an endless process in a finite way?

These parts reminded me of how in the Middle Ages Catholic philosophers and theologians tried to come up with proofs of God and ways to describe God. It sounds kinda similar to "trying to represent an endless process in a finite way." [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%F6del%27s_ontological_proof][Maybe it's not an accident that even Gödel tried to prove the existence of God.]] I believe that for certain types of artists the goal of their art is to describe the "unreachable" (infinity, God, Samsara etc.)

In this section there was a kinda quasi-spiritual vibe. Maybe the reason why Eliezer adores this book so much that he thinks it's "the most beautiful book ever written by the human species" is that the subjects of this book inspire the kind of feelings that are closest to what believers have when they think about God. I'm not sure if it's related, but [[https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/%7Eneum/sciandf/contrib/clari.txt][there are studies say that among mathematicians the number of people who believe in God is slightly higher than in other disciplines.]]

Russell's and Whitehead's attempt to create an artificial multilevel system to get rid of self-referencing reminds me of my own attempts to get rid of anxiety. It sounds funny, but I've had huge problems with self-reference induced anxiety. It's interesting that the same issue can cause problems both in formal systems and in real people. If I start to reference myself too much in my own thinking (like thinking about how I walk, or keep my hands, or what my posture is etc.) I become really really anxious, I become really awkward and I lose the capability to do almost anything. This was one of the several problems why I was put in a mental asylum last year. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/11/going-loopy/][Slate Star Codex further described this particular issue with self-reference.]]:

  A guy named Wegner conducted a famous psych experiment where he asked a bunch of participants to sit in a room alone and try not to think about a bear with sunglasses. Of course, that was pretty much all they could think of. They seem to have gotten into a feedback loop where “desire not to think of a bear with sunglasses” -> “thought of a bear with sunglasses” -> “frustration” -> “stronger desire not to think of...” -> “more thoughts of...” and so on.

  There seems to be an element of this in most anxiety disorders. Someone goes outside, something bad happens. Next time they go outside, they feel anxious. The usual STRONG BARRIER against conditioning upon internal experience is AWOL for some reason. The patient finds the experience of becoming anxiety very negative; therefore their belief that “going outside leads to bad things” is justified. Eventually they are so anxious about possibly becoming anxious that they just stay in their house all the time.
