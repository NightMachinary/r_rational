If you don't believe as I do that Life and Intelligence are innately connected, I can understand why you might reject it as my basic premise.

The specific cases of Deep Blue and Watson can be shown to have less intelligence than that belonging to their creators. I could go into more detail on this, but for now I'll just point out that if a plow is faster at tilling the ground than the bare hands of it's blacksmith would be, it doesn't mean the plow is more intelligent, even if it can be set up to work independently for a while. Chess and Jeopardy turned out to be domains that were well-suited for the kind of sophisticated pattern-matching that computers, as tools, do a good job at.

I do expect to see a continual improvement upon the algorithms and programs that belong to computing, which will naturally render computers more and more capable of assisting in other "intelligence" domains. Watson itself seems to be helping now in clinical decision support for lung cancer. These improvements naturally flow from the progression of the science of computer technology, but they are not hard evidence to the contrary of a Life-Intelligence correlation.
