Strange loop: The idea of actually pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Holding corporations that own each other nontransitively.

Recursion always points to a case simpler than itself. It hits an end eventually, even if you're working with infinite but well-founded objects.

As for paradoxes: truth is truth and is perfect. A seeming paradox is just truth's way of pointedly telling you that your map is imperfect, your glasses lenses dirty - you need to figure out a way to say things correctly. Infinity isn't paradoxical, just so far removed from human intuition that it requires special rules to handle correctly.
