I'd say yes, that pdf you find everywhere is so full of typos I couldn't get past half of the first page (I probably could have with an effort, but it's pretty horrible, especially for a non-native speaker).

This version doesn't seem to have any significant typos, only pictures are over-contrasted.

I don't really know what's the problem with .djvu. Standard Ubuntu Document Viewer and some Android PDF reader don't have any problems.
