I only have one qualm with this otherwise engaging book. The quintessential strange loop would seem to be... the spiral. (!) And as strange as these 'loops' may seem in certain contexts, (such as in Escher's well-known optical illusions,) a finite spiral of rules, metarules, etc. is not going to solve the problem of GOFAI, or 'true' AI. The book so far seems to hold a false thesis in that it disputes the innate connection between Life and Intelligence.

"Here one runs up against a seeming paradox. Computers by their very nature are the most inflexible, desireless, rule-following of beasts. Fast though they may be, they are nonetheless the epitome of unconsciousness. How, then, can intelligent behavior be programmed? Isn't this the most blatant of contradictions in terms? One of the major theses of this book is that it is not a contradiction at all."

No doubt that machines may have the intelligence of their author 'imbued' in them in a way, much as the Internet seems to offer 'intelligent' answers to our questions in searches. But it must be remembered that the intelligence of the machine cannot exceed that of its creator(s), for it is a mere echo, a reflection, with electronic banks of data written much like the ink in a book. While echoes may give rise to further echoes, and two mirrors may reflect one another on-and-on, this does nothing to change the nature of echoes and reflections. A self-editing program, however fun and interesting, is still neither living nor self-intelligent.
