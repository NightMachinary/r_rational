Hmm. It's not uncommon on the internet for a link to link to a page that links back; but it's also not uncommon for connections to be one way. Still, given how much most pages link and are linked to, I expect that most webpages are part of many longer loops.

Might there be any use for a metric of the shortest loop from a page back to itself? Your comment make this thread's autoproximity 1.
