I hope this readthrough is successful!

While Justin Curry and Curran Kelleher are cool dudes and they put together a good course, don't call it an "official university course". Set your expectations appropriately: It was a summer course for high schoolers, taught by undergrads.

There's some notes on the first few chapters that you might find useful on [[http://godel-escher-bach.wikia.com/][the GEB Wikia]]. There are... only two of us editing it so far, but I hope there can be more. (Pro-tip for Wikia: turn on adblock, their ads are atrocious.)

EDIT: off -> on
