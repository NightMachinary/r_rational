  To help, the provided definition is that a strange loop arises when, by moving only upwards or downwards through a hierarchical system, one finds oneself back to where one started.

Does this mean life is a strange loop? You start out as not existing, then you exist and your age increases for a while, until you go back to not existing. My guess is that it isn't, since you don't have existence to look forward to after you die. In that sense, you're not really back to exactly where you started. Or are you?
