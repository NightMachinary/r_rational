I like this a lot - I've been meaning to read GEB for a while. Thanks for helping me getting around to it!

I think to a lot of people infinity and recursion seem like inherently paradoxical concepts - I've heard several times people misquote Russell's Paradox as "does the set of all sets contain itself?" This is understandable - I don't think infinity itself seems paradoxical, but the idea that something infinite can be described in a finite number of letters (such as the word "infinity" for example) can be pretty mindblowing.

I really enjoyed the discussion on the word "heterological". But it seems to me, when it comes to words much moreso than with set theory (maybe just because I'm much more familiar with words than with set theory), that the division of all words into autological and heterological is somewhat of a false dichotomy. It sounds reasonable that words either describe themselves or not - but can't we solve the paradox by simply allowing a third category, those whose self-describing status is undefined? It reminds me of a paradox riddle I've heard - "There is a village with only one barber. All the men in the village either shave themselves or get shaved by the barber. Who shaves the barber?" There, it seems obvious that even though the claim "all the men either shave themselves or get shaved by the barber" on the surface looks like it neatly sorts the men into two groups, the paradox of "who shaves the barber" shows that the dichotomy is not quite real.

Incidentally, I Googled "Sixth Patriarch of Zen" and arrived at [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huineng][Huineng]], who is apparently a very important figure in Zen Buddhism. The Wiki article is sadly lacking, but in combination with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Sutra][Platform Sutra]] which is based on his teachings, I did feel like I learned some interesting - and relevant - stuff. Huineng was of the strong opinion that meditation should strive toward thoughtlessness, not reflection. To quote the Platform Sutra:

#+begin_quote
  In this teaching of seated meditation, one fundamentally does not concentrate on mind, nor does one concentrate on purity, nor is it motionlessness. If one is to concentrate on the mind, then the mind [involved] is fundamentally false.
#+end_quote

This is really interesting. I'm reading it as "purity of thought comes from deactivating the mind, not from concentrating it on 'purity of thought'". So basically, you have to find a trick to stop thinking about what you're trying to achieve by not thinking, a very recursive problem. My interpretation is that Huineng sees recursion as a real problem to avoid. I would very much like to hear his thoughts on Achilles and the Tortoise in the original paradox by Zeno.
