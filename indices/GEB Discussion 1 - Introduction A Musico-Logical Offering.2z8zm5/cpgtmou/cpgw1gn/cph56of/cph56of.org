It's not a terribly /useful/ metric, given that the majority of pages have an autoproximity of 2, and many have an autoproximity of 1. I believe that every comments page on reddit has a link to itself, actually - the link just below the post which (currently) says "23 comments".

The proliferation of these small, mundane strange loops on the internet is a byproduct of how they're programmed - there's no use in having a page link to itself, but this page was created programmatically, and it's useful for "the page" to have a link from specific to general, because sometimes the page is a permalink to a comment, or a context expanded comment chain.
