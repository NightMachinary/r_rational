I wouldn't call them loops.

consider a "perfect" city, that is, a cartesian coordinate plane made out of roads. if you go from one end to the city to the other and back, is it a loop? is it fair to say that any given intersection is part of a loop because of this? we can imagine links the same way- each road being a link, and each intersection being a page. (only with the real internet, each page links to far more than just four others, so instead of a grid, it's more like a web. ...hence the name.)

I suppose, in the strictest sense, it is- if we define "loop" as "the end is linked to the beginning" then yes, it is. ...but only because /everything/ is linked to /everything else/ in fact, there's a game that illustrates this- N clicks to jesus- where you start at a random page and try to end up on the wikipedia page for jesus by only clicking N links or less.
