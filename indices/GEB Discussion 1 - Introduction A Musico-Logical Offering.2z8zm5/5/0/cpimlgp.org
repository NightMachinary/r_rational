  What I'm hoping gets backed up later on is GEB's claim that from these strange loops, a self or consciousness can arise. I understand what Hofstadter is saying, that an AI capable of redefining its own rules based on itself must have a strange loop involved, but that currently feels incomplete. He has the whole remainder of a book to explain it to me, but I really hope he does it.

I have to disappoint you but as far as I remember, he doesn't really prove it. That was the thing that most bugged me when I last read GEB.
