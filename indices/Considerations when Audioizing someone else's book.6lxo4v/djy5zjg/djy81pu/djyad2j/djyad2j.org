You are correct, the part of the work that is 'transformative' and original is technically copyrightable.

The issue is that basically everything in a fanfiction is coming from the original work, and if that use is not covered by 'fair use' or authorized there are certain restrictions applied to it. So the only real part of the work that would be covered would be the plot and prose, so that someone couldn't do exactly what you suggest here. However it isn't clear that, having already published it in a public for free, the author would not have given up the right to control who and how it is distributed by in effect giving out a general license.

That's if the author even gets the normal copyright protections. Obviously some of them would be restricted by virtue of the derivative work.

Under US Copyright Law, the original owners of a work have the sole and exclusive right to prepare derivative works (which fanfiction falls under). In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Stallone][Anderson v. Stallone]]/, the emponymous actor sued a fan for writing an unsolicited script for Rocky IV. In that case the court ruled that, since the author had violated the right of the copyright holder, and the work was unauthorized, /no/ part of the work was to be given copyright protection. If that is applicable, that would mean that a Fanfiction author who fails to prove fair use would have no copyright in their work at all.

Also, fanfiction doesn't really have a good jurisprudential history in the US. From a practical perspective, this is probably due to the monetary cost of bringing a case like this to court - most authors just roll over when the original copyright holder sends a C&D.

Ultimately the determiner is whether a judge finds the work to be 'transformative' or fall under one of the umbrellas of fair use. I don't have the time or the expertise to do a full survey of the jurisprudence, but from a practical standpoint you can really only enforce this kind of copyright if you've got a few hundred thousand lying around to establish a precedent.
