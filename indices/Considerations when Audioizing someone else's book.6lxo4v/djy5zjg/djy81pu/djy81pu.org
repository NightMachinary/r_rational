  while they would likely considered to be 'derivative works' under copyright law, as they were created without license by the original IP, they will not receive the normal protection of copyright.

It was my understanding that copyright protection extended even towards derivative works which infringe upon copyright, though it only applies to those elements which are original to the derivative. Is this not true?

That is to say, someone wouldn't be allowed to take /Metropolitan Man/, make Superman a Captain Erstaz in order to circumvent the Superman intellectual property, and copy my prose/plot wholesale, because I still retain copyright on those aspects which are not derivative.
