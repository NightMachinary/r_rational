You're giving people an alternative to going where the author posts it. I'd say it's highly unethical if the author normally posts it on their own site with ads. Even if they don't do that you're giving an alternative medium for people to be introduced to. If the author likes seeing views, reviews and other things increase they may be annoyed if people who would have used the original use the audio version. I think it's best to ask them.
