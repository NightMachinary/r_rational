If it genuinely hurts no-one and benefits some people then by any utilitarian measure you're in the clear. But I don't think you can make a straightforward assumption that there's absolutely no harm; the author declining permission is evidence that they have (at least in their own judgment) some reason to expect it to be counter to their interests, maybe in a way that you're not considering.

Maybe uncontrolled distribution of their work via your adaptation hurts their prospect of traditional publishing. Maybe they plan to make an 'official' adaptation and don't want any confusion/competition. Maybe they're just a control freak who's distressed by anything happening without their involvement.

Whatever the case, it invalidates the assessment of /zero/ harm (and in the absence of knowledge, the refused permission still suggests there's /something/). It might still be a utilitarian net positive overall, but we do generally treat authors and artists as deserving greater consideration than the next person when it comes to how their work is used - "moral rights" and the like.
