This is true. At the time I justified it to myself with a number of "it's fanfiction, the community itself is based on the free and unfettered exchange of ideas and stories." Which is true, that's a core component of the community. In addition, from years of reading Eliezer's writings, I had a very strong intuition that he would not mind, and might even be tickled. And I was nervous as hell. So I just rolled with it, cuz at the time it was supposed to be just a little thing I did for fun on evenings.

In retrospect, I probably should have asked first. I've asked first for every other thing I've podcasted, including Eliezer's other works. It is best practice to do so.

If it's original fiction in an original world, aduioizing something without permission is violating copyright (at least in the US) and you can be sued. Things are fuzzier with fanfic, since technically fanfic itself is quasi-illegal.
