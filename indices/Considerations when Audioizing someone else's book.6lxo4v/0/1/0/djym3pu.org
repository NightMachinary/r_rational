Well, you can't charge for it any more than the fanfic author can. You're also making a derivative work.

As long as you have it in writing and it is clear, you should be fine. Email is good, but make sure you have a backup either locally or printed. (I am 100% for CYA).

If you explain exactly what you are planning, including how you plan to distribute, and they give that the go ahead, that is sufficient. Not all contacts have to be in perfect legalese.

Half of contract law is implying context from normal communications.
