I'm no expert in morality, but I can at least speak to the legal aspect.

The sensible thing to do is always to ask for permission. The only question is what if you either can't get in contact or recieve a negative answer. If it's a fan derivative work like HPMOR or Alexander Wales' Metropolitan Man, there is no legal issue with lacking permission - while they would likely considered to be 'derivative works' under copyright law, as they were created without license by the original IP, they will not receive the normal protection of copyright.

If it is an original work which has been released on the internet, such as Worm, there is a potential legal issue. While the work has been released into the public (first 'sale' doctrine), transforming it into a new medium and releasing it in that medium could be considered to be a new 'release'. In the same way movie producers have to negotiate with authors for movie rights, converting a book to a podcast or other audio format would require a license from the original IP holder.

This is a very simplistic primer. Also this is not legal advice. IAALBNYL.
