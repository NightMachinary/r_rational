Get a quiet room, ideally one without cars rushing by outside, do something against echoes (e.g. hang blankets around yourself), put a pop-filter between you and the mike, and don't hesitate to record multiple takes for paragraphs. In fact, if your find you need to re-record a sentence, re-record the whole paragraph. I at last can often hear[1] when a new instance of narration began, simply since the narrator sounded differently.

And for the love of god, listen to it yourself. Get comfortable with the sound of your own voice, get a feel for it. Best case, read some practise texts aloud, edit them, gain some experience before jumping head first into the deep end.

Lastly, while practise makes perfect, perfect is also the enemy of good. At one point you need to stop fiddling with the recording and just release your work. Others will listen to it and give feedback (hopefully).

[1] Caveat: anecdotal. I obviously can't note down the instance when I didn't notice. Fairly sure I'm missing a plethora of cases, but still, I can often differentiate when a narration sounds inexplicably different from one paragraph to the next. Best case, you end a recording sitting at the end of a chapter and resume with the beginning of the next.
