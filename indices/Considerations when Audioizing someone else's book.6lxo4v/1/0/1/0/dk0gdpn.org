When you have an established body of work that the author can listen to (if they want), the situation may be a little different than when you are just starting out creating audio productions. Without a work sample, the author does not know what kind of product to expect, and whether they would want to have this new audio version associated with their work. I've just begun doing a few audio recordings, and have taken the approach of recording/editing first, sharing with the author and asking their approval second, then releasing third (contingent upon approval). This would be disappointing if turned down after having put in the work to complete step one, but that's a risk I've been willing to take. Not sure if this is the best approach, but it's the one I've been using so far.
