If it's clearly and uncontroversially to the author's benefit, I would expect them to give permission.

If they /aren't/ persuaded of the benefits, and decline that permission, it seems a little odd and more than a little presumptuous to then say "No, I know best, this is for your own good".

I mean, maybe you still decide to do it anyway, but you'd be doing it for the benefit of your audience and yourself rather than the original author.
