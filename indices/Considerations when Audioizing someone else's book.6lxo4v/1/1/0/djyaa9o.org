I think there's at least a reasonable argument that an author has more of an ownership over the literal text they've written than over the characters, concepts, etc. So it seems to me that fanfiction created without the author's permission is less objectionable than creating an audiobook without permission. Moreover, some authors publicly say that they're OK with fanfiction; I actually do think that if an author objects to fanfiction based on their work, the act of writing it is at least questionable.

The principles that motivated my original comment were (1) the idea that the author owns their work, and (2) the idea that if there's a reasonable likelihood your actions will hurt someone, you should take pains to avoid that (in this case, by taking potential ad revenue away from the author/decreasing the chance that a publisher will pick up their work/etc.). Assuming you agree with either of these principles (which I think are pretty uncontroversial), I think it's pretty clear one is obligated to ask permission.
