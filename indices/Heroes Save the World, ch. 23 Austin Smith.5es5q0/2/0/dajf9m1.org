Thank you! I'm glad that you're enjoying the story.

The "previous chapter" and "next chapter" buttons are located under the comments. Annoyingly, this feature wasn't apparent back when I was first deciding what theme to go with.

I'm currently studying for the GRE and have some other things to do on top of that (e.g. grad school apps), but the GRE is on Wednesday so on Thursday I'm going to look at alternate Wordpress themes, and on Friday I'm going to present screenshots of 3-5 of them for the readers to take a look at (makes more sense for the readers to have the last say, since you're the ones that have to look at it).
