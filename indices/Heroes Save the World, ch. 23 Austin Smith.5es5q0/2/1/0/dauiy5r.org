If it matters at all, I personally prefer lighter text on darker background. And since pure white text on pure black background is supposedly bad for your eyes I actually really like your current color scheme. The best would be to find a theme that is as similar to your current one as possible while relocating the previous/next chapter links either to the top or just above the comment section, preferably both at the same time.

With the above in mind I sadly have to tell you that all of the Imgur samples seem like massive downgrades to me. 'Hero' is white on black and has edgy red sidebar text. 'Affinity' and 'Rowling' are nothing special in any way and too bright for my taste, though that last part is subjective. 'Pique' is weird in that the About section seems to be completely different from the main chapter section and on top of that it's missing the sidebar completely.

If those are your only options I recommend staying with what you have right now. Readers will quickly get used to simply scrolling to the bottom. Or you could manually put previous/next chapter links into the text itself.
