Just got caught up and I've got to say I've really enjoyed your story so far. My biggest complaint is that there doesn't seem to be any easy way to navigate to the next chapter from an old old one and making that issue worse the table of contents appears to be out of date.

Great story so far and great writing though so I hope it gets more attention.
