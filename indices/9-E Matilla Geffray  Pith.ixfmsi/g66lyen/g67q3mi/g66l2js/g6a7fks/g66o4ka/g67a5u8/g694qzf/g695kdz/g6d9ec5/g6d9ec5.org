  Why would you start at the end and not the beginning?

Speaking for myself, sometimes I start stories with the most recent chapter to get an idea how good the story is once it hits its stride. The first chapters are often bogged down by exposition, stations of canon, and meandering writing, especially if it's the author's first major story.

The downside is you get some spoilers, but if the story is long enough then you won't understand them enough to remember them by the time they're relevant (eg someone starting Pith with 9-E would only be spoiled about the Maxine Clive reveal, and it's quick enough they might not even remember it by the time that name's relevance becomes clear).
