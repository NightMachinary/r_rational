I haven't seen it pointed out, but Matilla is the student that Brin told Ana about, the one who was beaten up by a baseball bat after waving around her silver letter, talked about in chapter 1-E. Later she takes Kaplen's place on his team.

I really like how characters who are mentioned in passing end up having their own part to play later on. It feels like every detail matters. I'm enjoying this story.
