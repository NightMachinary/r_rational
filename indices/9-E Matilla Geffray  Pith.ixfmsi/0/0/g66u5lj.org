That's some really good analysis. Following up on it, I think that Commonplace isn't going to be able to meet their goals, at least by their hands. They're an organization meant to promote the rights of humdrums and get rid of the oppressive power structure, but they're full of projectors and the elite. This could be excused somewhat by the fact that you need high level projectors and resources to run a revolution; however, the fact that they're puppetting the humdrum side of the organization means that the humdrums don't have any legitimacy. If they want the humdrums to come out with actual power, the shady projector side of it is going to eventually have to sabotage itself and take itself out.
