I think there's a general underlying rule in Pith where characters are mortal directly proportional to how much they're suffering.

Matilla was having way too much of a good time getting accepted to Paragon- she practically put a target on her back. Even Kaplen was way too cheery when he was cheery.

This is why the main cast survives. Ana is literally invincible by now, Wes isn't far off it. I can use this to predict that Lorne is going to die when Commonplace execute their attack on Paragon. He's an enormous prick but also rich and happy. That can't last.
