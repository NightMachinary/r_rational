Would love some good smart Star Wars fics. I've read the few one shots that come through the sub once in a while about the malevolent force, and those were pretty good but I'd love something with more depth.

In return I'd highly recommend people watch The Good Place on Hulu currently. Not rational but it has rational adjacent themes, how do you design an optimal afterlife? How do you determine who qualifies? Some very basic moral quandries and ethic questions. It's also quite funny.
