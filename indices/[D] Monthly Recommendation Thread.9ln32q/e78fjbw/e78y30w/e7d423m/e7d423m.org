Thank you for the recommendations. I'm familiar with four of them (/Youjo Senki/, /PMMM/, /Fargo/, /Worm/), however.

  I mean, I think your example might be a bit big

It is supposed to be broad, yes. But perhaps I described it poorly, thereby making it seem even broader?

In the kind of story I'm talking about, if the antagonist realizes that the protagonist is a threat, the protagonist will be immediately and absolutely annihilated, with no chance of defending against it. E. g., if you figure out that the cosmic horror exists, it will see you and kill you. If the Matrix Lord realizes that you're successfully rebelling, it will freeze you, read your mind, then erase it and replace you with a less smart fork. If the organization you're infiltrating sees through your deceptions, you'll be seized and executed.

And so on. The protagonist needs to act very carefully in order to not alert the enemy, while still somehow fighting it. It's less about threats' /nature/ (gods, lords, humans, doesn't matter), and more about the protagonist's position relative to them.

From your examples, /Fargo/ fits perfectly, at least from one perspective: Kyubey was up against a nearly-omniscient Homura, who loathed it, was suspicious of it, and planned to erase it from existence if it betrayed her. In response, it covertly enacted a complicated plan designed to look harmless if it failed, and carefully managed her attention and diverted her suspicions while it unfolded.

On the other hand, /Youjo Senki/ fits less: Albeit the protagonist is up against a godlike entity as well, there's no threat of immediate destruction if she permits herself a misstep, or if she makes her desires known to it. It's not finished though, I believe? I hope it'll go in that direction.

/Worm/ doesn't fit as well either. Except from Cauldron's perspective, perhaps? Battles following Gold Morning fit only loosely, since Scion isn't playing to win and the capes don't realize they can't defeat it physically. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][/El-Ahrairah/]], a rational fanfic, is more similar to what I'm describing (and is otherwise great, I heavily recommend it), though it's not a perfect fit either.

Question: Are the characters actually /focused/ on Kayaba? Do they treat him as the enemy, and scheme to escape or hack his simulation in denial of his will? Or do they treat him as a /gamemaster/, and strive to exit the simulation by beating his game the way he wants them to? If the latter, it wouldn't exactly fit. Just as a certain popular rational story doesn't fit exactly.
