[[/u/1101560][u/1101560]] is correct, it's indeed the opposite. The loopers are the privileged ones here: immortal, with access to future information, able to effectively erase their enemies' memory and try out different deceptions until they've manipulated them into doing what they want.

If the protagonist was a non-looper with goals opposing Zorian's (such as Quatach-Ichl or Sudomir), it would have fit perfectly. Non-loopers can only win by ensuring that there's virtually no possible sequence of events the loopers could take that defeats the non-loopers (either in battle or socially), which is quite hard.

*Edit:* Well, on the other hand, if Panaxeth --- an intelligent nearly-omniscient eldritch abomination which plays the role of the gatekeeper --- was more active from the beginning, it would have qualified from the loopers' perspective too.
