It's not really the main thrust, and it's taken ~4 years for the concept to start having meaningful impact on the story, but [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com][The Gods are Bastards]] features a mechanism built into magic itself that will kill anyone who learns the truth about how the Gods came into power.
