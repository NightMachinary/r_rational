*Request:* Fiction focused on a conflict with an overwhelmingly powerful enemy in full control of the protagonist's environment (or where such an entity is suspected to exist).

It's pretty high-concept, yes, and could take many forms. Such as:

- A conflict with an eldritch entity which kills you if you learn of its existence. ([[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][Example]].)

- A conflict with a Matrix Lord from inside its simulation. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Possible example]]).

- A conflict with a Physical God. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Example.]])

- (Kind of.) A conflict with your own creative insanity. (Example: [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-18-dog-eat-dog-story/18-09/][this arc]] from /Twig/.)

- A deep cover infiltration mission into the upper echelons of power of a watchful/paranoid enemy. ([[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][Partial example.]])

I find these kinds of stories extremely engaging. Protagonists can't make any mistakes or they will be crushed, which makes the conflict very tense, and the power disparity forces them to act covertly, which makes it intelligent. There's something very neat about having to pay attention to every little detail in fear of an active and perceptive enemy, too.

Any other examples?
