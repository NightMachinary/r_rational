Can anyone recommend works with very well-written hard magic systems? I've probably read all of the obvious ones, but feel free to recommend them anyway; I'd rather get recommended a book I've already read than potentially miss out on some gem.

In return, I'm going to recommend Malazan: Book of the Fallen. Its magic system is relatively soft now that I think about it, but regardless of that, it's one of the best series I've read and I heavily recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy. Most novels in the series start out very slow, but I implore you to stick with it. The characters aren't always rational but they're still almost always excellent.
