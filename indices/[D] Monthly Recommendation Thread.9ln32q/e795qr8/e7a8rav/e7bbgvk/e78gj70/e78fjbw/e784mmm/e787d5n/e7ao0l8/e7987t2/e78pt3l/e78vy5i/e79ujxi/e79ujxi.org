And Groundhog Day is a romance movie. Time loops can be an interesting twist on the genre. A month is more than enough time for romance to develop (Before Sunrise anyone?) and even reach a satisfying conclusion. But that would be a waste of potential in my opinion. A more interesting take would be to explore the implications of such a situation : experiencing that first magical meeting over and over again in different situations, getting to know someone so well and staying a stranger to them at the same time, exploring all the facets of them by masterful manipulation. Even the act of seducing someone you have no chance of ever being with in real time, by trial and error( sort of like Zach tried to kill that dragon at the start) could be very entertaining.
