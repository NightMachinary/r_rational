I started reading it because [[/u/VorpalAuroch]] called attention to it recentishly in a thread that was about trying to find a story Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote under a pseudonym. I think it feels plausible, based on having read just the first four chapters (I was in the middle of reading another book at the time). At the very least, I think it's probable that it was written by someone who's familiar with the rational community. From what I've read so far, it seems pretty good.
