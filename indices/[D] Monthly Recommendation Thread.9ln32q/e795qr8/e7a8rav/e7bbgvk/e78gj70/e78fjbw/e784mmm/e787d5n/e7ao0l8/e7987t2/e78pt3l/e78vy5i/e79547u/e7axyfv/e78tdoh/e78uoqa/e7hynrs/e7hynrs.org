Protip for googling: Say you only have "MOL" and no clue at all what is it. But you know context, "rational" in this case. Googling "MOL rational" (here and below search string should be without quotes) Search result get us "MOL Theory on... Everything?". Looking for names in an article.

"MOL Zach". Facebook accounts. No dice.

"MOL Veyer". Some science articles. No dice.

"MOL Sovereign Gate". Fourth link to Mother of Learning wiki for Google. New reddit article with a link to the story for DuckDuckGo.

I used TOR to completely ignore search history.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying "just google more". It's a tip for similar situations in case you can't ask a question (like if a post is archived).

Side note. Googling just "Sovereign Gate" will get you Mother of Learning in the first link. But googling "Veyer" will give you Might and Magic and "Mother of learning Veyer" will get yo "Veyers", note "s" at the end. So be careful.
