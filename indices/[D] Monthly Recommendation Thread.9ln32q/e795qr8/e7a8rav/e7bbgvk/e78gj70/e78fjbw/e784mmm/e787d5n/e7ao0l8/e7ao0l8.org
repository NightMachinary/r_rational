*The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement*

A novel about a factory that's on the brink of being shut down. Fascinating read. Lots of cases were conventional wisdom and Campbell's Law made the characters make terrible decisions, which they only realise when thinking about what their goals actually are.

A frequent argument:

"We should do X."

"But that completely goes against principle Y!"

"Y is a terrible principle, because Z."

"But that's just common sense! Of course Z implies X"

"So we can do Z?"

"No! It completely goes against Y."

*The Phoenix Project*

Inspired by The Goal, basically an IT version.

*Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War*

True story. A fighter pilot who wanted to understand the principles behind fighter planes. He stole $1,000,000 of computer time to build his theory, which proved that American planes were pretty shit, despite being much more expensive. He then set out to build the perfect plane, but was stymied by the politics.

It's inspiring to watch his dedication to the truth, and heartbreaking to see him battle against the insanity of the system and the careerism of the people in it.

Alternates between being "porn" and horror for rationalists.
