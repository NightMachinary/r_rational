40k Years of Cultivation is probably the best Xianxia I have read. The author updates at a breakneck pace, although the translation is somewhat slow to follow.

Edit:40k Years of Cultivation (hence 40k), written by Ascended Auroch (can't remember what the canon translation of his name is), is about a man who has a chance encounter in a XianXia world, and then bootstraps himself into greater power... and greater troubles.40k's best qualities, from my point of view, are the sympathetic, idiot-ball-immune villains, and the arguments that the protagonist has with said villains.

​

The villains are sympathetic because their goals make sense. By and large, many of the villains' goals are partially absorbed by the protagonist, or at least taken into considerations.

​

Protagonist: Hey, I found out that <evil race> isn't that bad! We can have treaties and intermixing!

​

Villain: but, <traditional enmity reasons>, <good anti-immigration reasons>. You can't just suddenly mix us together and expect that a few centuries down the line, our democratic system won't be overtaken! Death!

​

Protagonist(over the villain's body): We'll add some voting rights restrictions and such, and see how it turns out.
