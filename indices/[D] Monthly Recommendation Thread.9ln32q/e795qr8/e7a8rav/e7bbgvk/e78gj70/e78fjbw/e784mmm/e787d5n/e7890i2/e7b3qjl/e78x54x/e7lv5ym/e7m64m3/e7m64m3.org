Besides the other stuff in this reply thread

- Dungeon Born/Cradle: I'm bundling these together as non-web-novels by western authors. I haven't finished either, but I've seen enough recs on this sub to be optimistic about their overall quality
- Reverend Insanity: A surprisingly in-depth portrayal of a genuinely sociopathic 'protagonist' with an interesting magic system. Not my thing, but technically good.
- Soul Land(manhua): Thoroughly middle-of-the-road even by genre standards, but the good art and supporting cast make it very enjoyable.
- Zhu Xian: A hidden gem, if you can get past the awful translation. The conflict, both literal and ideological, between the factions generates some actual pathos, as does the MC's romance with a girl from the rival faction.
- Avalon of the Five Elements: What happens when a Jianghu runs out of qi? This is the sequel to world of cultivation where, untold eons later mankind? barely clings to survival in a world where a strange new cultivation system has arisen. Keeps things fresh by forcing the MC to deal with everything from politics to colonization to war to trade.
- Peerless Dad(manhua): Strictly comedic, a former mercenary wants to raise his kid, while unaware of how insanely strong he actually is.

I've also been meaning to check out Nightfall (by the author of ZTJ), Legend of the Great Saint, and Gate of God
