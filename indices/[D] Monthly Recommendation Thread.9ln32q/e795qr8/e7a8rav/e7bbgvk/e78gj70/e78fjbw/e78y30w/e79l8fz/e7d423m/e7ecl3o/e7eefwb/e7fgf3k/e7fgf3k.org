To say as much as I can, without leaving any serious spoilers unboxed:

F/GO is a mobile game in which you play as a "master" (a mage that provides mana for heroes summoned from the past) for Chaldea Security Organization. Chaldea is a United Nations project that's dedicated to protecting humanity; it's the first serious collaboration between the (becoming less and less) hidden magic world and mundane government. They utilize a pseudo-time traveling device known as rayshifting and said servants to deal with any issues that crop up.

Just after Chaldea begins its operations, Goetia launches his initial strike. He's an immensely powerful being with an extraordinarily strong clairvoyance to match, and Chaldea is one of his two actually three, but the third is also in Chaldea and is the reason Chaldea is able to form blindspots. For his opening move, he alpha strikes the only two things that can move against him, chaldea and atlas; the latter is summarily defeated. For the former, he suborns their second in command, kills 47/48 of their eligible masters, all but one of their senior staff, destroys all of their important equipment, and kills or otherwise incapacitates most of their ordinary personnel; the only reason he misses a spot is that the protagonist is talking to Dr. Romani aka solomon, the third blindspot, which puts Romani enough behind schedule that he's not at ground 0 of the explosion.

He immediately follows this up by incinerating human history via attacking 6 "singularities" (think fixed points from doctor who, if you've seen that) placed at important events in humanities history. You and chaldea have to clear 6 of these singularities, each filled with some of the strongest servants available, when:

They have to find and clear each and every singularity

Failing even once is a loss.

They're on a timer.

They can't afford to lose their sole surviving master.

They have to keep from seriously threatening his victory until they are absolutely ready, so he doesn't crush them like a bug.

They have to fight against some of the absolute strongest opponents Goetia can throw at them, including multiple infinitely regenerating demon gods, actual gods empowered by a holy grail, the beast Tiamat who, among many other extremely obscene abilities, categorically cannot die as long as any other being is alive and can kill some of the most dangerous threats in existence just by being near them

and all without losing Dr. Romani, since he's the only one with the knowledge to keep things running still alive, or letting goetia learn his true identity
