I mean, I think your example might be a bit big. The third, given your words and your example, would fit works as far out from this topic as Namek arc / BotG of Dragon ball in it. If this is intended, let me know and I can cast my search net wider, but as is:

Youjo Senki: [[https://www.crunchyroll.com/saga-of-tanya-the-evil]] (Vs a being who claims to be god; demonstrated powers of reincarnation, time stop, body puppets, matter creation, time travel, mind control). Category 2 or three probably.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death]] an actually good SAO fanfic; I would probably even call it rational. Against a sysadmin with a general Ai and a designed world. Little / no knowledge of the source required, no knowledge of source mechanics needed because they created a self consistent magic system (one of the outright best I've seen in fiction). Category 2 ish

[[https://www.crunchyroll.com/puella-magi-madoka-magica]] Probably my favorite anime of all time. If you haven't been spoiled, don't spoil yourself. The twists work even if you've been warned of their existence, but work better if you don't know the details. Givign the category would also be a spoiler.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo]] Post rebellion PMMM Fanfic; category is a spoiler unless you've seen the work above this. It doesn't look like it fits at first, and you could argue that it's honestly two books with that as the plot of the second one, but I think that that's worth reading anyway. Requires canon knowledge.

Worm arguably fits here, but it takes a long time to get there and I can't wholeheartedly shill it, since it does have quite a few issues. Category 3.

Fate Grand Order is a mobile game (I say, ignoring the fact that it has more story than many book series at this point) in the Fate/Nasuverse multiverse about this topic, although there are several writers of varying quality involved. Warning: some of the plots by the side authors can be, well, weak. Mix of 1, 2, and 3.

if you've already played the game, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/eye-of-the-gorgon-fate-grand-order-si.610048/]] is a fun fanfic of the above, although it does have some spoilers for NA on it.
