  This comic starts out well drawn and as the artist finds his style it becomes beautiful. The world is well developed and the lore seems to draw from Elder Scrolls , Hindu mythology, Lovecraft, and ancient Greek gnosticism. It is an ongoing comic updated frequently.

  The art may be a turn off at first as it is very simple however it gets better. This comic draws from the British Isles and Native American mythology.
