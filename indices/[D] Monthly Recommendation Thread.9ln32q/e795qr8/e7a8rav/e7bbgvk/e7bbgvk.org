Here's a weird request. I've been reading The Last Angel and, while it's... /okay/, I feel like it falls into the [[/r/HFY]] trap pretty hard. It's basically just Mass Effect with a coat of paint and kind of a fascist morality. I can only plod through so many chapters of "And then the stupid arrogant aliens were blindsided by the humans, again, as was foreshadowed sixty-five times at the start of this and every chapter" before it all starts to blur together.

So I'd like to cleanse my palette a bit. What's your favorite space adventure tale? Anything from the Vorkosigan novels to John Carter of Mars, I'm not picky. I just want to read about plucky humans battling aliens.
