I found it an interesting read, though they massively nerfed the culture in the default storyline for 'plot' purposes.

Then again, he did share an alt universe version where they let slip the dogs of auto-industrialism, and steam-rolled the whole galaxy in a week.

Anyway, anything crossed over with the culture automatically makes it worth reading for me!
