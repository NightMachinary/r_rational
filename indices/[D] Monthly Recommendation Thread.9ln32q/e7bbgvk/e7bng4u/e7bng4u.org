I started TLA after the thread from a day or so ago, and I'm not really liking it. I'm only like 8 chapters in but the characterization is bonkers. The Compact are so fucking cruel but our human protag is just like "lol i dunno what's wrong with them guys". I don't get it!

There are a lot of typos left in, too. I don't think I'm going to stick it out.
