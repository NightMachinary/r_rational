The Axiom series ("The Wrong Stars" and "The Dreaming Stars" by Tim Pratt) is solidly in the category of plucky humans battling aliens.

The Madness Season by C.S. Friedman is... well it's /sortof/ plucky humans battling aliens. The protagonist is not precisely human.

I found the "Stargate Atlantis: Legacy" books surprisingly good, and plucky humans battling aliens is basically Stargate's entire thing.
