Since this seems like it is becoming a Xianxia response thread, I have to say you need to read Way of Choices. It is the only multifaceted one with interesting characters, both protagonists and antagonists, good writing and plot setup, and actually has a very good translation available.

Takes a while of getting through initial chapters before you might get invested (as is usual in wuxia/xianxia) but I definitely recommend you do. The main character starts out as a nobody, as is usual, but really takes a long time to develop and give a sense of EARNING his eventual strength, which most webfictions fail to do.

It is also the first thing that I have read in a long time that properly set up a power scale and remained relatively consistent with it. It sets up these larger than life end game type characters who exist in the world. And they actually exist! They aren't just mentioned and then eventually faced once the main character and crew are strong enough to take them on. They are actually influencing the world and interacting with other people from the very beginning of the story.

Plus, the main character faces enemies from multiple factions, people who are stronger than him, and faces situations where the fight just isn't fair and it isn't right for people who are much stronger than him to fight him but, it only makes sense for them to do so since they are his enemies. You aren't left with the classic oh send henchmen of gradually increasing strength. On a related note, the reason why other strong characters don't interfere and why actions taken by the main cast are allowed make sense due to the political set up of the world (and can have political ramifications) and are not purely for the author's convenience.

The translation has also recently finished over at Gravity Tales so I would say now would be a great time to get into it.
