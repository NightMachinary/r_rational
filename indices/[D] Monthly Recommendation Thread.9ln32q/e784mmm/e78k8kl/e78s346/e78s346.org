  Darth Plagueis by James Luceno is surprisingly good. It's in depth exploration of prequel politics and how Sith exploited it.

Eh. I thought it was kind of monotone.

It didn't really sell me on the Sith's supposed genius at politics and manipulation. It just depict evil rich people being evil and rich; applying naked hypocrisy and nepotism and being systematically rewarded for it.

It makes the Sith ascension look easy, because nobody ever opposes them and everybody is evil. The Star Wars universe doesn't seem to have syndicates, NGOs, journalists, anti-trust laws, and whistle-blowers for Plagueis to navigate around. Rich people don't invest based on how much money they'll make, they invest based on how evil and dishonest the investment can be. Plagueis can slaughter a room full of assassins is a club he's the official head of, and nobody seems to think the guy miiiiiight be shifty.

(also the fact that Palpatine gives a vibrant speech for letting the Trade Federation acquire giant robot armies kind of undermine the whole plot of the Prequels; why was the guy who became famous by endorsing the Trade Federation put in charge of fighting them off?)
