A good and smart Star Wars fic with depth? I have just the thing! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm]]

This trilogy (rounding off at approx. 720,000 words altogether) is one of the best fan fiction ever written. I wouldn't call it rational, but the characters are smart and well written, and the author knows how to tell an intelligent story.

As a side note, The Good Place is one of my favorite shows. Glad to see it coming up here.
