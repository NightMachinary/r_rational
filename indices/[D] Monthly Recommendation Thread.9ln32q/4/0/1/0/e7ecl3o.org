By the new definition, I would say that FDoD doesn't fit; I would honestly offer it a general rec, but it's not what you're asking about.

F/GO does fit, though. I'm not sure how interested in spoilers you are (none? Ones that don't hurt he experience? Anything?) so I won't elaborate atm, but let me know if you do want more.
