Request (and kind of a recommendation): This is a strange request because it might already be in this thread and I'm just not seeing it. Very recently I read a story that I thought was linked from this thread, or maybe elsewhere in [[/r/rational]], but I can't find it again. It is about someone from our Earth who finds himself transported to a world where he is in what looks like a gladiator stadium filled with an audience of elves and the announcer announcing him as the next contestant. It is LitRPG; he sees stats and levels. He has little physical strength or combat ability, seems like a physics nerd, and his opponent for the match is a type of combat robot. I can't really say more about it without spoilers other than it is a short piece, complete though the author could choose to make it the start of something longer, I found it funny, with twists and munchkinry, and I really liked it.

Can anyone identify it from that? If anyone can then this is a recommendation as well as a request.

[Edit] Found it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13085708/1/Alien-Abduction-A-LitRPG][Alien Abduction: A LitRPG]] on fanfiction, three chapters, not tagged as complete but it stops at a logical ending point. And here is the thread about it, which is apparently where I saw it about a week ago: [[/r/rational/comments/9m0rnh/rtwipalien_abduction_a_litrpg_chapter_1_the/]]
