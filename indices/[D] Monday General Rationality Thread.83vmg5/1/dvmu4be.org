There's still time!

I've been thinking about how one might write a story driven by action, violence, physical conflict, etc between reasonably rational agents. People who should be smart enough to see that violence is not the way to resolve their conflict (except for this narrative circumstance, apparently).

Getting caught up in emotions, misunderstandings, self-defense... these seem like cop-outs because they're obvious narrative devices. Likewise for, say, rational agents fighting in a combat school to learn how to better fight external threats that aren't rational (or are too alien, or whatever). This lacks genuine threat. Stories that subvert and/or deconstruct violence don't count either. The lesson is very clearly 'violence isn't the answer!'. Let's assume the audience already knows this.

Video games, for example, have a hard time with the topic. Wanting you to believe your character is good despite monumental levels of violence because "the gameplay is fun" is enough to hand-waive the violence for most people. Or it's rationalized that the opponents are mindless or corrupted or some other lost cause.

So! How might one write a story driven by violence between reasonably rational parties, without cop-outs or excuses, but also doesn't glorify the violence? How might we construct an action-driven scenario (for e.g. video games that rely on the gameplay loop) where violence really does have intrinsic and instrumental value? Are there good examples?

(does this break the rules of the Monday General Rationality topic? it's about writing rational fiction, which is a real-world activity...)
