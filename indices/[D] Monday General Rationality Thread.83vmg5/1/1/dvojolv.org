  emotions, misunderstandings, self-defense... these seem like cop-outs because they're obvious narrative devices.

They're not cop-outs. They're basic realities of the human experience. That's why they crop up time and time again, throughout fiction. They reflect real life.

Now, I could start a big argument about how even "rational" people are driven by emotion, but I want to focus on misunderstanding instead. You call it a cop-out, because of course no truly rational person would ever misread or misunderstand a situation. They're too wise and enlightened for that.

But that's fucking nonsense. No-one has perfect judgement. Everyone makes mistakes. You are conflating "being rational" with "having perfect information", but they are not the same thing. Two characters might be perfectly rational, reasonable people, but if all they've ever heard about their counterparts is that they're greedy, selfish, sons of bitches, they're going to act on the basis that said information is true.

Now, you might argue that a rational person would take the time to verify that what they heard was true. But human beings do not have time to scrutinize every single shred of information they receive. If we did that, we would never get anything done. Sooner or later, we have to have faith that our sources are correct, and not mistaken or lying.

Even if the characters did take the time to meet, so they could judge each other for themselves, that still doesn't protect against mistakes. Human judgement is incredibly biased, in ways so subtle that they are almost impossible to notice from the driver's seat (as it were). For one thing, the human mind is biased towards maintaining existing beliefs. So even if the characters tried to analyze each other as fairly as possible, the fact that they've already been primed to see each other as assholes is going to colour their readings (and probably not for the better).

/And even if/ the characters took the time to verify what they'd heard, /and even if/ they were capable of judging each other as fairly as possible, any number of things could still get in the way. Their flight could be delayed. A family emergency could arise. Their horse could trip and break its leg. A malicious third character might sabotage the meeting. The best laid plans gang aft agley, after all.

Now take all these problems, and put them in a situation where time is of the essence, and the characters have to make a decision now, /now,/ *NOW.* That is where tragic mistakes occur - at the intersection of misinformation and pressure. Rationality will not save you there.
