Ok I want to rant about the movie Annihilation.

Just the whole process they take doesn't fit any remotely reasonable mission plan or scientific method.

There's this "shimmer", a barrier created by something that is expanding. "Every team or drone they ever sent inside has never come back".

Ok, well, that doesn't sound like the inside is very habitable. So the logical thing to do would be to create a huge variety of drones - clockwork drones, film cameras on a pole, hell just a really long stick - and try to get /something/ back from the "shimmer". (a clockwork drone is basically like a small 4 wheeled vehicle with a mechanical spring motor and some mechanical logic. It would basically be programmed to drive around a little, scrapping some sample scoop against the dirt on the other side, then come back)

Say you can't get any information back no matter what you try. Well then you don't send people in. Or if you /do/, their orders should be to try to leave the moment they find themselves inside. Not 'explore the place and then presumably die'.

Also if whatever is creating this barrier is so powerful it can stop you from getting any information from inside, and it's expanding, this is a serious existential risk to humanity. This is not something to keep secret for 3 years. This is "crash plan to abandon the planet" kind of scenario.

(presumably if the barrier is going to take decades to swallow the planet, you could build Orion drive colony ships and get millions of people and lots of infrastructure off-world to the Moon or Mars before the end.)
