Yeah, I don't disagree with anything you said. The things you're describing are definitely valid and very real sources of conflict, but not really what I was aiming for. I think the misunderstanding is my fault because I was too brief in my post - trying to get in before the thread post was over a day old - so sorry about that.

Good that you're fired up about this though! I think many novice writers overlook the conflict opportunities you're describing because they have the luxury to think about the narrative when their characters don't. They fail to get into the mind of their character in the moment.

What I failed to articulate is that I'm thinking about how to construct conflicts that would result in violence regardless if there is emotion or time pressures involved, and regardless of the actors' rationality (to the extent that rational agents with time to apply their cognitive abilities will still conclude that violence really is the answer in this context).

If you read through my post again you can see that I mentioned video games as an example, used because such campaigns of violence are prolonged and the characters often do have time to reflect and think about their circumstances. The other posters fortunately understood me and gave some good examples along the thread I'm trying to pull on. Hopefully that gives you better context.
