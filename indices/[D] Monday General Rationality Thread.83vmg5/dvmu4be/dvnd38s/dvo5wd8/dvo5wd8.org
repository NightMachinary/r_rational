This works, but I'm left feeling unsatisfied... I reckon because it still feels like an excuse, and I would feel bound to make the story about reforming the nature of the setting itself. I'm not familiar with A Practical Guide To Evil but based on the TVTropes description I would expect the story to go in that direction.

Perhaps I'm trying to make the conflict between people at its origin. I don't know yet.

Nevertheless, this /works./ So I must spend some time thinking past my first thoughts here. Thanks.
