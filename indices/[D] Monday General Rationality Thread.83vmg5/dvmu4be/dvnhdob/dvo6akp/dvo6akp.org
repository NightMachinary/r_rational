This seems to cut close to self-defense... unless the resource is generated by fighting, and is transient enough that it cannot be easily stored in any other way except within oneself?

Is the resource essential to life? Or it has undeniably high utility but the cost is violence/death? Death magic cult.

Hmm. This feels like a thread to keep tugging on.

Maybe we must bring these questions to worldbuilding/munchkinry threads.
