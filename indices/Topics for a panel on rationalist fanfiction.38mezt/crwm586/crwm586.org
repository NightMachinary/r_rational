I think you have to answer some much simpler questions for the average con-goer:

- What is this?

- Why is it fun/why do I care?

Otherwise, it's basically the funny custom of a tiny social clique on the internet, and at cons, you're /saturated/ in those.

Oh, and for examples, you forgot /Following the Phoenix/.
