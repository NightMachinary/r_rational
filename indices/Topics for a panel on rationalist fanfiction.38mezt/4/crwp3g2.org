Rationalist or rational?

Rationalist fiction as a genre dates back to the 50s and works like Van Voght's "Null A" series.

Rational fiction to me seems to involve applying the rules of "ultra hard" science fiction to fantastic premises. I'd include Randall Garret's "Lord Darcy" series in that realm.
