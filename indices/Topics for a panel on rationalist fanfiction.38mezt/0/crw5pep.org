For sure quote the sidebar to this subreddit, which I think informs a lot of how the genre is defined (for better or worse).

I'll give my own answers here, so that people can disagree with me.

  1. To what extent is rationalist fanfiction a product of Less Wrong style (aspiring) rationalists? Obviously Eliezer Yudkowsky is a major figure, but are there other rationalist communities represented?
#+end_quote

I actually think that "rational" fanfic taps into a larger idea that's been slowly building over the years, which probably got its start around the time that people could freely discuss fiction in a larger, more connected way via the internet, and the rise of postmodernism. If you look at comic book authors like Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, I think they're doing things that we might recognize as being adjacent to the rational genre (/Lost Girls/ and /League of Extraordinary Gentlemen/ are both fanfic in their own right). On the other side of it, I think the rise of authors like Brandon Sanderson ([[/u/mistborn]]) shows that there's some real interest in seeing fiction that clearly defines its rules and exploits them (which in turn is part of why places like forums.spacebattle.com, [[/r/DaystromInstitute]], [[/r/AskScienceFiction]] , etc. all find purchase). To that extent, it's a marriage of existing thoughts and ideas in a more formalized way.

  2. The best known works are HPMOR, Metropolitan Man, Friendship is Optimal and Luminosity. What have I missed?
#+end_quote

/The Last Ringbearer/ is notable as a forerunner, but there's some debate about that one. (It is listed on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic?from=Main.RationalFiction][the TV Tropes page]], for what that's worth.) Sorting [[/r/rational/top]], and limiting to fanfic, I don't think you're missing the "staples". There's some debate to be had about /why/ those are staples; part of it is because the stories you've listed were first, and by virtue of being first were able to set some of the tone.

  3. What are the must-read pieces about rationalist fiction/fanfiction?
#+end_quote

There's a relative lack of it. To my knowledge, much of that conversation has happened here, and it's spread out through dozens of discussion threads. There's a real need for someone to write up a handful of blog posts that make an effort to define the genre.

  4. What other question should I have asked here, and what is your answer to it?
#+end_quote

/What's the future of the genre?/ That depends mostly on what writers it can attract, and what those writers choose to do. There a definite sense of low-hanging fruit so far as rational fanfic goes; some IPs are easier to translate into the genre than others, by virtue of the hooks that they provide or the questions that they never answer. (The most interesting stuff to me, and what I feel like I don't see enough of, are rational takes on stuff that was never meant to survive cursory scrutiny in the first place; stuff like /Frozen/ or Santa Claus.)
