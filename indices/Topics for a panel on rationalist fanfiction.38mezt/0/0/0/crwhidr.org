Fanfic can be divided into two general categories; those that are trying to mimic a work, and those that are trying to enact a transformative process on the work.

In the first category, the fanfic writer is mostly adding onto what's already there. They're writing an eighth-year continuation of Harry Potter, or they're writing a story that's basically the events of canon from another perspective, or something like that. They're taking a world that already exists, and playing in it. This is all well and good, but the central ethos is, "I like this thing, and I want more of it". I think the majority of fanfic follows this to some extent.

In the second category, things are actually changing. The writer is trying to take canon and recontextualize it in order to make something new. This doesn't have to be as extreme as making a Disney movie into a singularity fiction; it can be as simple as a character study of Daphne from Scooby-Doo. The main point is that there's a lens being applied to the work that exposes new things about it, and displays previously unseen nooks and crannies (sometimes of the author's own invention, but when it's well done it seems like the things you're being shown were there all along).

*tl;dr:* So to finally answer your question, the reason that I prefer rational fanfic that has the greatest distance between the original canon and rationality is that I think the work gets more out of it. The illuminating effect is greater, and more previously-unseen surfaces are exposed. If you take a work that's already reasonably rational, you're lessening the impact of that transformation.
