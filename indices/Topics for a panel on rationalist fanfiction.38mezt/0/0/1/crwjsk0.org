I personally like fanfic that jumps genre boundaries more than fanfic that tries to keep the tone of the original work. Rational takes on Father Christmas, dark sci-fi takes on My Little Pony, comedic takes on Worm... you get the idea.

It makes smaller differences from the source material less noticeable, so I don't fixate on differences in writing style and inconsistent backstories. This in turn frees up the author to /use/ different writing styles and backstories, and to twist the established canon for the sake of a better story. (For example, the Avengers movies change the origin stories of several characters to involve the Tesseract and/or the Infinity Stones, to give those stones impact as more than just McGuffins and make the world more unified.)

It lets you shed light on oddities or inconsistencies of the source material, either by removing them and seeing the consequences, or by explaining and exploiting them. Recasting the hero as a villain to show the true impact of their actions, for example, or showing the impact a particular technology would have on society.

It creates new literary territory to explore, particularly the weird halfway-house of elements from the source's genre and the new genre which there would be little reason to think of outside fanfic. It can question conventions, not just of the original story, but of the entire genre it belongs to.
