UPDATE: The panel discussion was cancelled - was actually last night, and there was an audience of zero. (A mix-up meant that two of us on the panel weren't there either, but that doesn't explain the lack of an audience.)

I hope this topic gets discussed at a future event - and at a better time than 10:30 pm.

Thank you for all the comments - I found them really interesting, and hopefully they'll be of use to others.
