[[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]] isn't fanfiction, but it is probably the best example to add to the collection. [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] is another good example of rationalist fiction, probably the only story from the 'superpowers' genre I've read that could qualify.

edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][Signfiicant Digits]] is a HP:MoR continuation fic that has done a good job of retaining the rationality, but has significantly better /flow/ (hpmor's weak point is its pacing).
