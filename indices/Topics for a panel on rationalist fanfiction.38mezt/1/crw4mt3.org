Any reason not to broaden it from "fanfiction" to "fiction"? Other things fit under the umbrella that aren't fan work.

Aside from the ones you list, Waves Arisen is a good one, as are [[/u/alexanderwales]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/][other works]], touching on subjects such as AI invincibility/self-enhancement and implications of time travel.
