  I guess there are lots of rational fiction, but not rationalist, which is what this post is about.

Well /duh/, because "rationalist" is a social clique. It's "this set of people who hang out on loosely adjacent websites." It's, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/05/mapmaker-mapmaker-make-me-a-map/][anyone who shows up on this map]], and probably a few more places by now.

There's nothing /wrong/ with being a social clique, but treating ourselves like we have some genre of material defined by whatever the fuck we do among ourselves and con-goers ought to recognize it... is expecting con-goers to recognize our social clique, so it's unlikely to result in more than "What? Who?".

At least, IMHO.
