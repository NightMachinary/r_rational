OP's headline says "rationalist", and his examples are chiefly "LW-ian" [RST] rather than [RT], so I'm taking him at what he appears to be asking.

There are rules in the sidebar that specify the delta from [RT] to [RST], but it's more common for [RST] to mean "Written by an LWian or [[/r/rational]] user (not sure what the overlap is) to apply that particular group's way of thinking." In fact, the odd-numbered examples (HPMoR, MLP:FiO) are actually [RST] stories that /fail/ to be [RT], in that the villains are made to appear highly intelligent by pegging the protagonists with the Idiot Ball and the Villain Ball.
