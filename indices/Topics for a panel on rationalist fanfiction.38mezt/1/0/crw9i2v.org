I guess there are lots of rational fiction, but not rational/ist/, which is what this post is about. I agree with Waves Arisen being a great example, but I think it's a pretty awful fic for someone to read first considering it pretty much has an entire chapter talking about the numbers of its magic system in painstaking detail. That might turn some people off the genre.

Honestly EY really should start editing HPMOR, especially the first part. It'd be the perfect example if it wasn't for the obvious problems.
