It's not really that the events are rationalized after the fact as much as they're reinterpretations of the events that fits a more rational world. Back at Mt. Moon, it honestly took me a while to recognize the Team Rocket connection, even after the Witnessing. The whole series of events was so radically departed from how they were executed in canon that they might as well have not been the same event, even if the same sentence 'Team Rocket tries to steal fossils at Mt. Moon' describes them both.

The reason I'm not confident at all about Celadon and Saffron is that even though there's the sentence of 'Team Rocket base in Game Corner', that's about where the similarities will end, even if the conflict takes place there at all. Mt. Moon in canon and OoS aren't the same plan and plot, they're the same headline.
