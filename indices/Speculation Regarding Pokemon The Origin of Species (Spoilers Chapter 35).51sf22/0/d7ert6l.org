Looking broad-scale here, you can look at the major events of Origin of Species and, when you compare them to the Kanto games, there isn't much divergence if you reduce the events to a single sentence. Sure, we haven't had many so far, but 'Team Rocket tries to steal fossils at Mt. Moon' is what happened in the games and this story. The difference is that in the games the Rockets basically burst into the place and drove off everyone else (except for the protagonist, of course) while here they worked off of a legitimate operation in a much subtler and nuanced plot.

Given that it very much looks like this story was inspired by the idea of a rational Pokemon world, and not necessarily on a specific rational plot line like HPMOR was, it makes sense that DaystarEld would adapt the events into his setting, fitting them together into a coherent whole instead of establishing something entirely new.

So, I predict that Team Rocket will become focal points of the story again at Celadon, Lavender, and Saffron. Those are all locations where the protagonist of the games fought his way through grunts doing evil things, so if we accept the idea of 'adapting game events' then something will happen at or around Celadon Game Corner, Pokemon Tower, and Silph Co.

The easy one here is Pokemon Tower, oddly enough. Celadon and Saffron are both places where you find a base of theirs, barge in and beat up everyone, which is not something that would happen in Origin of Species. To figure out what might happen there, we would have to guess at what sort of events might provoke Red and co. into action against them, even if unknowingly at first like at Mt. Moon. With Pokemon Tower, though, we have a historical landmark with lots of cultural significance (and, given the way towns appear to be in Origin of Species, lots of religious significance). There are two things I could guess happens at Pokemon Tower. 1) Team Rocket wants to get at Mr. Fuji for some reason. Maybe the same sort of thing they did with Dr. Fuji and others, maybe the fan theory of the two being one and the same is truth in Origin of Species and that's the connection, or maybe simply getting his help for something about Ghost types. 2) They want to tear it down. Between the events of RBY and GS the Pokemon Tower is replaced with a Radio Tower for all of Kanto (don't ask me why they put it in a small town on the edge of the region). It's entirely possible that Team Rocket is behind an attempt of some sort to tear down the tower and even maybe put up a new Radio Tower. I rather like this second one, actually, since it gives a nice opportunity to delve more into the culture and religions of Kanto as Leaf weighs in on the topic.

With Celadon, all I really have is that the Game Corner is relevant. Maybe Team Rocket has been illegally biasing the machines to turn a greater profit? It's certainly possible, likely even, but I can't think of how that matters any for Red, Blue, and Leaf. None of them are the sort to go gambling in a shady place like that, especially with how the others would restrain any one person who for some reason is interested. I don't even know if it's legal for them to gamble in Kanto at their age. It's entirely up in the air, anything from kidnapped Pokemon to a kerfuffle about the biased machines to something about Erika herself, though I wouldn't have the slightest clue what.

Even more so with Silph, in the games you just walk in, see the red 'R', and bring out your Charizard. If Team Rocket really is in control of Silph, there's little to go off of to guess how that would come to light. My best idea is that the three go for a tour, and one of them notices something amiss. It sounds pretty cliche to me, but I don't even have any idea of what Team Rocket would do if they had control over Silph, let alone how much they'd fail to clean up their tracks.

And all of that stuff above is based on the premise that this is going to stay a rational retelling of the Pokemon world, and not transition into a rational original story in the Pokemon world. If this next chapter with Bill has him really mixed up with Clefairy then that's another point on the 'retelling' side, and if Bill's just playing a trick using Clefiary then that's a point on the 'original story' side.

Now, Mewtwo. From the interlude on him, I see some parallels to the AI in a box concept. Not that many, since communication is actively avoided and Mewtwo has influence beyond mere communication, but the idea holds true in the sense that Mewtwo is an entity head and shoulders above humanity which humanity created but is attempting to keep sequestered and harmless. Oh sure, they'll want to use him as a tool someday, and this wasting disease puts a different light on things, but I can't shake the idea of Mewtwo being the AI, ostensibly trapped by the humans but either on a path to getting them to free him (through mind control) or circumventing his shackles (through mind control). His Psychic powers are so much stronger than anything Team Rocket can hope to account for that, in effect, what Mewtwo wants, Mewtwo gets. Mewtwo as an 'end-boss' is all but a guarantee, unless DaystarEld really wants to throw a curve ball somewhere and have him fall under someone else's influence, but I even this early I put 85% probability to Mewtwo being a key figure in the climax of this story.

At the same time, though, the Legendary Birds are too interesting an innovation to really pass up. While their presence changes the tone of the world an amount, they could easily have been portrayed as reclusive beings, too strong by orders of magnitude to challenge but easily verified to exist, and the story would not have been /that/ much different for it. There are really only two ways this can play out. The first is that the activity of a Legendary Bird acts as a special event of the story in and of itself, much like how an Endbringer attacks every few months but Leviathan is a pivotal point of Worm's story, more than almost anything else. The other way this could go is to have a special event regarding a Legendary Bird. First thing that comes to mind is someone, somewhere, finally gets past the challenge of how to catch a Legendary Bird, and that sends Kanto into celebrations. Second thing that comes to mind is someone, somewhere, finds out a way to kill a Legendary Bird. More mixed reactions, serious questions exchanged, but hey, next best thing to catching one, right? Assuming they aren't keystones of the climate or anything like that, of course. The third and last thing that comes to mind is Mewtwo and the birds. Maybe he strikes them down, maybe he enslaves them, maybe he recruits them, maybe even /they/ strike /him/ down. The opportunity for interplay between the Legendaries is a tantalizing concept, and I hope we see it to at least some extent in Origin of Species.

One last thing: a thought on Blue, and other Champions. Blue once said that all of the great trainers he really looks up to won every Gym Battle on their first try, and so it was frustrating for him to lose his first, but when I hear that I get the mental image of Cynthia and the like breezing through their journey with deceptive ease, while Blue is faced with roadblock after roadblock. What's interesting about this mental image is it lends itself to Blue clawing his way past those obstacles and being sturdier for it, when others like Cynthia feel like they've never truly been tested before, giving an advantage to Blue by dint of the struggle he goes through to reach their level.

As for Red, well, I'm sort of waiting for when his intellect finally fails him in a big way. Stakes haven't been high that much, so we've seen the establishing of his intellect more than his failures, but a part of me is just waiting for when he outsmarts himself or isn't at the top of his game, and others suffer for it. A moment where his attempts to be intelligent and rational arguably make the situation worse, and he has to deal with that.

I'm looking forward to see what kernels of wisdom you have in response to this, DaystarEld. You did, after all, mention that you had popcorn.
