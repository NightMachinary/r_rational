Ha! That's pretty neat.

I would love it if the mainstream pokemon games treated the pokemon sizes and habitats a bit more relevantly. Summoning wailord in a building or cave is ridiculous, but non-amphibian water pokemon should only be able to be used in or near water.

I guess technically wailord is a mammal so it could survive out of water, but since it's basically a beached whale at that point, no moves should ever miss it. Hell, no moves should miss it in the water either, considering its size!
