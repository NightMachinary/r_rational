  Honestly, I'd rather hear something official about what we always see with fish Pokemon in land battles: spontaneous flight.

I always just figured that was laziness on their part: animate them as if they're swimming because they're aquatic, and then just use that animation even if they're not in water. There's no other indication that they're actually floating (with the possible exception of gyarados being Flying type, despite that he can't actually fly), since they're still susceptible to Ground attacks.

  I'd agree with you if I wouldn't have to memorize size-accuracy modifiers for every Pokemon.

Yeah that would be annoying, though this data could be easily displayed in battle. The new games are adding stat up/down modifications as a permanent visual, but they could do a lot more with the battle UI.

Mostly though I'm just spitballing ideas for a realistic pokemon tabletop RPG.
