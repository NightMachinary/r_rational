Right, right. In that case, it's more like the Pokemon Tower in that Team Rocket could be operating behind a more corporate facade in their ambitions, attempting to steal designs or other such secrets. It could also nicely segue into discussions of the Master Ball and Legendaries. After all, you've already established that Pokeballs don't care about Pokemon strength or vitality, so a type of Pokeball efficient enough to store a Legendary should be able to do the job.

And now I just realized no one has ever captured a Wailord. Not that it'd be useful outside of the water in tournaments, but like in the Ranger series capturing it would just be a flat 'no.'
