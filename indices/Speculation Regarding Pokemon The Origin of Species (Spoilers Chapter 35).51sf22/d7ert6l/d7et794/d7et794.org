Wow, awesome comment! I didn't realize how closely the story so far has stuck to that of the games. I'm hoping we'll see something "original," but given that I didn't notice the similarities up to this point, it's unlikely I'd mind them in the future. Still, it'll be pretty disappointing if the introduction of a bunch of smart players somehow manages /not/ to lead to some really interesting outcomes, and instead we see the same old plans and plots, only /rationalized/ (in the sense of having been justified "rationally" after the fact). I would expect the changes to magnify as we progress through the story, and the changes to the characters have time to compound.

I agree with everything you've written about Mewtwo and the Legendaries, but I maintain that the prospect of capturing them strikes me as more interesting. At the very least I'm expecting some investigation of how there can be species of pokemon that apparently have /only a single member/.
