Honestly, I'd rather hear something official about what we always see with fish Pokemon in land battles: spontaneous flight. Pokemon like Gyarados and Kingdra, it's more easily understood to be their typing or dragon-powers at work, but even Basculin can apparently produce quantities of water orders of magnitude larger than itself, so I really wouldn't mind if someone from Game Freak casually says that fish Pokemon have also developed the ability to swim through the air so that they can make friends with beach Pokemon or something.

The stuff about buildings and caves, as well as moves missing, can also be chalked up as abstraction and simplification. If there's a large cavern where a Wailord might be able to battle freely, maybe all cave fights take place in such a space, and if the building's too small for the fight (or, as BW showed us, the fight's too heavy on the collateral), then the two take the fight outside, where there's room. As for accuracy, well, I'd agree with you if I wouldn't have to memorize size-accuracy modifiers for every Pokemon.
