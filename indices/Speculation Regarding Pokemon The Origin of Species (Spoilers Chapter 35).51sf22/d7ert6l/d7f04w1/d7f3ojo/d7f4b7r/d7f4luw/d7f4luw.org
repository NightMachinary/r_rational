There's a small underwater segment in Shadows of Almia where you have to stop the evil team from trapping a Wailord. The Wailord is large enough to span multiple screens, to the point where its width is taller than the screen and one screen will only show its head and the other only shows its tail.

After the mission, once Wailord is rescued you interact with it and it automatically registers itself in your Browser, not even entertaining the idea that your styler could encircle the whole thing.
