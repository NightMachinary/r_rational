Just popping in for a quick clarification:

#+begin_quote
  And lastly, does anyone remember anything interesting about that chapter that took place in Unova or something?

I believe you mean the second interlude, [[http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-chapter-12/][Chapter 12, Shadows.]] It took place in Fuschia, which is a city in Kanto, not Unova.

  And [[/u/DaystarEld]] : willing to offer any public or private hints?
#+end_quote

Nope! /popcorn/
