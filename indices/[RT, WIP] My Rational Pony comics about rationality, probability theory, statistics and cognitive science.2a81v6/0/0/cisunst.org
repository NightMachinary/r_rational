Some of the examples are also a bit confusing. In 'generalizing from one example' it seems like the shop owner wants to target just that one pony, is the generalizing here that only pink ponies want to visit the shop? It's just a bit contrived, not something that a real person would think and doesn't illustrate that particular bias very well. If this was my first encounter with that bias I would just become more confused.

The same thing in 'Anchoring'. That instance seems more like halo effect or simply not knowing enough about the world. As far as I know, in real anchoring studies people still make judgments that are on some level right, or make decisions that seem reasonable if you don't know that any anchoring happened. Anchoring just pushes those decisions or judgments in a certain direction. So the fact that the pony's impression is simply incorrect is not very illustrative about that heuristic.

Otherwise the examples seem to be roughly on target, but it's hard to know how illustrative they would be to someone who's never heard about those bias.

But if I had to say something positive, this is a good list of some basic bias and heuristics and it mentions some really fine books and studies. Whoever made this had a good purpose and I applaud his effort, the execution just doesn't do justice to that purpose. So I have to agree with you, it doesn't belong into this sub.
