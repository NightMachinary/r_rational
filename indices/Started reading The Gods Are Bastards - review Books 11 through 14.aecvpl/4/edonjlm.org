I tend to think that the gods are as they say: they are aspects.

We don't know exactly what happened to give the original gods their powers. We know that they ran their world for tens of thousands of years according to their will.

I don't think that it's a simulation. That's easy. I do think they found a way to computationally affect physical probabilities, which amounts to the same thing. They can use computation to control reality. The power of the gods is directly plugging the human brain into the probability whatsis matrix gadget, so that the computation of the mind is what controls the probability. But this has an effect of locking the state of the mind in place. Since the brain is a network of physical connections, the gods can still think and be, but they can't really grow or learn, much. This leads them to be sort of fixed in their thinking and attitudes. If Vesk was feeling frisky on the day when he was plugged in, then he will be feeling frisky forever.

The upside is that you get phenomenal cosmic power. The downside is the itty-bitty thinking space. The elder gods messed up and got lost in the system, becoming their aspects and really messing it all up. I think the new gods are the support staff who rebelled and tried to fix it all. They made adjustments such that they are less fixed, but also have less power. Naiya is nature herself, but Avei is 'justice'?

The more I read of this story, and its side quests and 'NPC' interludes, the more I love it.

It's deep, consistent, and entertaining every time. This is why I love these kinds of serial or 'amateur' works, because it's craft and art and love and it shows. Maybe an editor could fit it into books, but I think it would suffer for the effort.
