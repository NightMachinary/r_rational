  She had more of an excuse to reach for violence in the first instance, perhaps, but committed a much less violent act in the second.

Both are still violent acts, and in a series where the demonstrable lesson till now is that "violence doesn't solve everything", this one violent act seems remarkably free of consequence, hence the bad vibes. Remember that after attacking Gabriel, Trissiny's reputation was in tatters and she got into a lot of trouble from Tellwyrn, but not so here.

Also, any violence in recent books will have the weight of 14 books worth of character development behind it, so from that perspective, this act is very, very odd.

  Sure, officially, but I meant that she was drawing on her Guild training and their influence.

You do realize what "acting as Hand of Avei" means right? It means that the Avei herself has her eyes on this little theatre. In the name of Justice, without giving her a Trial, not informing her that a trial was actually taking place, or giving her a chance to defend herself, Trissiny proceeds to beat the living shit out a middle aged lady with her patron goddess watching.

Avei is supposed to be the goddess of Justice, yet "Justice" doesn't seem to have been served, simply a one sided beatdown.

Then that means Quentin Vex and/or the silver throne as a whole seems to be acting very much out of character, without sufficient justification.

  , but Vesk certainly manipulates people and events. He explicitly says so and gives several examples, later on in the book.
#+end_quote

If Quentin and the emperor are being manipulated by Vesk, can I assume it's not actually revealed later in the book? Because there wasn't a scene with them immediately discussing the violent outburst of a Paladin toward a ruler figure that derives authority from the silver throne.

  It's ok to say "A god did it" when the gods are actively involved in the story. It's like saying "A Sith did it" about the events of Star Wars. A Sith did in fact do it.

It's true that the powers of the gods, as long as they are unexplained, are pretty much "whatever they want" in this universe (see: Scion). I don't necessarily like the ease at which it gives the author a free pass on things, but ok, fine. As long as things are consistent.

But in-story, the Gods seem to be involved only through their Hands, at least /so far/. You don't see Avei smiting random thiefs and rapists from heaven. You might see Trissiny doing it on her behalf. Vesk breaks this precedent just a bit, but even he only nudges things this way or that. I haven't seen him exercise his power to shape the minds of mortals to better his story. If he did that, it would certainly be a huge event, and many powerful people like Tellwyrn, Mary the Crow, Justinian etc. would be able to feel it.

The equivalent in the star wars universe would be, the sith spontaneously creating a death star out of nothing, and then saying it's one of their "dark side powers".

Rules are established in every story, and when the story itself breaks them, readers will call the author out on it.
