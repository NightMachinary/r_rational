I agree with you that the violence was weird and out of character and story-wise, deserves some consequences. I haven't read far enough to know if they happen. It does go against the established themes tho, as you pointed out.

Regarding your point about the reactions of Vex and Justinian, just because they weren't described in an interlude doesn't mean they didn't take notice. Presumably they continue to do their thing whether or not we see it.

I get that Trissiny was acting in her capacity as Hand, but I think her Eserite training and attitude was showing through. Justice doesn't specify the precise method by which it's administered.

And Vesk explains that he manipulated Trissiny into taking a certain course of action at the end of the book and making her think it was her own idea, in addition to ensuring that a handful of important people were all in a certain place at a certain time. So maybe the beatdown was another instance of Vesk manipulating Trissiny. I don't think an act like that would have the kind of magical ripples you suggest.
