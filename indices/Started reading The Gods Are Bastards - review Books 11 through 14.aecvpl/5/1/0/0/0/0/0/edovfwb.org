  just because they weren't described in an interlude doesn't mean they didn't take notice. Presumably they continue to do their thing whether or not we see it.

Once again, I'm working based off precedence here. Whenever anything world shaking happens in a Book, the reactions of those in power to such events (mostly the silver throne and imperial intelligence) will always be shown in the text on that book itself. For example, the hellgate incident, sleeper incident, Lor'naris... wait, pretty much every single significant event I can think of follows this pattern! Quentin Vex was even keeping track of the things going on in Sarasio, which was a pretty remote part of the empire.

So from your text I'm inferring that no such interlude was shown in this book, which breaks the pattern, or that this is considered by the author to be an insignificant event (even though based on the worldbuilding, it's pretty significant).

  Vesk explains that he manipulated Trissiny into taking a certain course of action at the end of the book...

  ...maybe the beatdown was another instance of Vesk manipulating Trissiny.

Your first point is based in text, the second is not. Because the event was public, had quite a shocking reaction, and everyone who was supposed to be concerned about it didn't get a PoV paragraph.

Till now, the theme was that everything is interconnected, one twist or nudge in the web without thinking things through can affect something else connected to it. But here, Trissiny has taken a node in the web and publically humiliated her, with her goddess' consent, and there wasn't any ripple effect whatsoever.

If you're following the series, I assume you've read Book 5 as well, and can check whether this incident is even mentioned in passing again.
