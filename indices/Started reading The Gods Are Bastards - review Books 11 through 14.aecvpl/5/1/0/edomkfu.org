- You can't equate the sudden emotional reaction to her own arch enemy species (to her, at the time) /taunting/ her and the planned, coldly executed beatdown of someone who can't fight back. Also you're referencing how she was in Book 1 and equating it to her behavior in Book 14, are you implying that she didn't get any character growth this entire time?

  Unlike the last time she had crashed a high society party, she was just in her silver armor.

- So, she was acting as the Hand of Avei, not guild.

- The quests bend reality to fit around them? That was never really implied from the text. Till that point, the "narrative" if it even existed, was a subtle force of influence and not a world shaping superpower. Is it capable of mind control now? Does Quentin Vex just shake his head at all of Trissiny's actions, say "I hate it when she does that." and just move on with his business?

- If so, that again just seems like handwaving stuff that's inconvenient to think about. "A God did it" instead of "A wizard did it".
