Just a few points,

  There's walker who is admittedly insane and has an urge to kill everything
#+end_quote

It's been a while but I'm almost certain that this is false. Her "craziness" is mostly from isolation and she doesn't have an urge to kill everything, she just kills everything around her in an aura because she's a death-being ripped into the universe.

  So if Naphthene smites anyone worshiping her by sending an angry storm their way
#+end_quote

99% sure this is already said in book 14, but just in case it was specifically because Naphtene didn't dare to smite Vadrieny directly as it would antagonise Elilial. Ruda's entire bloodline was cursed because one of them pissed on a shrine, if a normal person did what Vadrieny did they'd probably just turn into a sea urchin or something.

  Why were the sophomores so pissed that the Avatar killed the nanite swarm immediately without their permission? They were going to order him to do that anyway
#+end_quote

As far as they were concerned, time was of the essence and everyone above was in danger, then they find out that they've been manipulated into spending a bunch of time helping the Avatar that was completely unnecessary in the current crisis. Even if every second didn't count and Ruda's family wasn't in direct danger, I can certainly understand being angry about people lying to you to manipulate you into doing things for them.

  It's almost as if she put it aside for the sake of propelling the story forward.
#+end_quote

They've gone over this multiple times, but she feels genuinely terrible about how she treated Gabriel and even during her first trip to Tiraas she was questioning her fellow cult members about why they didn't have unsanctified grounds to allow demonbloods to get assistance and even started setting up a system like that.
