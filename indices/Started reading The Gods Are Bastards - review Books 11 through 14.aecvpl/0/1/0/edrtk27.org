Apologies my computer just locked up 45 minutes into a long post, replying on phone while patches happen,ugh.

The last one is the dad scene it starts in book IV Ch 27 and ends in Ch 30 witness. There's an Orrorary and someone comes to ask "Neshama" about thier plans I think you'd be good starting at CH 28 as the dad is the closing line of 27.
