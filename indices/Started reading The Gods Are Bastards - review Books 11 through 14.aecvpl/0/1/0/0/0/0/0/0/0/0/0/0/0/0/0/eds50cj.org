Do. I was about to double post but I forgot to say there's compelling character growth along the way, because our experience tying things together is or lags a bit behind the viewpoint character(s).

I'd say the values of the world, the characters values have a real development arc in them.

Please ping me when you read I'd be interested in your thoughts, and your concerns are validated by the fact that there is too little Twig discussion when/because it's (scarily)the most real world applicable story.
