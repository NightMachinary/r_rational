I think you're drawing a distinction between human judicial systems and Avei that shouldn't be drawn.

It's entirely possible to have a judicial system that says something along the lines of: "Everyone has a right to be judged by a jury of their peers, or by Avei, or her Hand". (Actually I'm not sure if the empire uses juries or magistrates... I guess it's not relevant).

The important things that make judicial punishment separate from vigilantism are consistency: People know the laws and how to avoid breaking them. And a right to a fair trial where you can see the evidence against you and defend yourself. Both of these can be made compatible with a goddess of justice. Avei, or Trissany, could personally preside over a fair trial. We've seen Avei do just that. So I don't think she makes an exception for herself or her hands. A goddess or a paladin shouldn't need to make exceptions.
