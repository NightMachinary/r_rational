  Do you have a source for this in the the text?

Actually yes. There's this quote from Trissiny: "...no, Shaeine is completely right. Without law, justice is impotent" from chapter 5-24.

There's this quote from Rouvad to Darling in 3-9: "I'm also aware of what you do to rapists caught in your ranks. I'm not impressed and don't care to hear about it. Summary execution is not justice."

That's both Aevi's paladin and the head of her religion expressing support for laws and due process. I think between them they can be considered an authority on what Aevi wants.

  Avei doesn't care about the right to a fair trial when she's considering a case before her; that's only the foundation of justice when the divine avatar of the concept of justice isn't directly involved in the matter. Trials do not trump Avei's divine judgment.

That would be relevant if Avei was intervening personally. In this case she is not. When Trissany decided to Burn down Syrinx's house, she was acting on her own initiative rather than Avei's. In fact immediately prior Rouvad points out that Avei /hadn't/ stepped in to discipline her own bishop and that's why Rouvad is putting faith in her.

We do see an example of when Avei does intervene personally, when she judges Juniper. In that Avei manifests personally, she gives the defendant a chance to speak in their defence. In short Avei presides over a fair trial.

Avei's divine judgement might trump mortal judgement; but Avei still thinks institutions like fair trials are vital to justice. Both because she can't judge everyone personally and relies on humans to act in her name; fallible humans who need checks and balances. And as a tool for laying down her own divine judgement.
