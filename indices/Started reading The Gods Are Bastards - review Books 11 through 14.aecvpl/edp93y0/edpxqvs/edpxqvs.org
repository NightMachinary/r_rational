Yes, I think so. Or close enough. It's a reconstruction of the fantasy genre that is careful to include sensible, Watsonian explanations for why the tropes exist, it features smart antagonists who act to further their own interests rather than just the plot, and they do so off-camera, and there is an emphasis on intelligent solutions to problems. The world is internally consistent and follows its own rules, and characters behave as rationally as real people would in those circumstances.
