Can't say I agree with your points.

On the alt-character not being a good fit: in the vision quest in the grove she explicitly states that the mindset/attitude of the alt is exactly what she is looking for. After Avei's intervention in the quest the significant information she gains are 1) thoughts on reconciling her poor opinions of Eserites with the reality of Eserite teachings and 2) that the job she has been given isn't to be cunning; she is an enforcer. Her prior mindset may have led her in a different direction, she is offered additional information and makes a different decision.

I also disagree with the idea that justice must be lawful. Justice is a concept that predates anything we'd recognize as a judicial system. Hands of Avei are more likely to break someone's fingers than bring them to trial, they are provided with divine power and able to command all of the cult of Avei to mete out whatever punishment they personally consider appropriate. The Hands do not work for the legal system, they work for Avei.
