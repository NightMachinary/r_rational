I'd say it's not a rational fic. It has characters making decisions that don't match their established persoanlity or even common sense. To give an example

Trissany decides she needs to learn how to be more subtle and diplomatic. She is then given a list of potential highly qualified teachers; but decides instead of any of them she'd go to the thieves guild.

This is despite the fact that she is chosen by the goddess of Justice and the thieves guild have already been established to be antithetical to justice - as they endorse unaccountable vigilante justice against whomever they take a dislike to. Rather than fair trials.

The reason given for this decision is that Trissany a short period of time when she was magically induced into thinking like an alternative version of herself who grew up in the thieves guild. Except that alt-Trissany was very explicit that she wasn't cut out to following her mother (a con-artist, the role Trissany says she wants to learn) in favour of purely physical skills like pickpocketing.

Later on in that book we see Trissany, with the endorsement of the high priest of her church, illegally burning down a bishops house as a punishment because they couldn't get the bishop in a fair trial. So you get two characters going against established characterisation and motivation in order to forward the plot. That's the sort of thing a rational fic wouldn't do.
