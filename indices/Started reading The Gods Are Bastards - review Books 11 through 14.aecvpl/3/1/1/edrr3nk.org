Regarding the 1. AU influence choice and [2.] the extra-judicial punishment. I think you are assuming: 1. something that has been explicitly called out as a false axiom: the antithetical nature of two complimentary cults, when a growing strategist see's a toolkit that has bested her; 2. you are assuming too much of the lawful good/stupid by a young woman just given a second strict code of ethics for punishing abuses of power, and one that she mis applied in this case, subsequently has it rubbed in her face, and in a chapter this week or last week teaches someone else about the lesson she learned.

​

All that said I'd steelman your argument by saying the most lacking part of the writing style is all of Trissany's best rational thinking happens off screen and the reasonable/clever/laudable actions that come out of are jarring against what we see of her internal narrative.
