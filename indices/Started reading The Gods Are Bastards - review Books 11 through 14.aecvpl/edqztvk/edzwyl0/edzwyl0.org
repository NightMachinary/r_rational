I'll never understand this tendency to judge a story you haven't even finished. After a dozen books you'd think there could be some kind of level of trust that it's intentional on the author's part and not just assume they're regressing to their first time writing in elementary school. This kind of deconstruction of ideas has been around since the first chapter, it's just a different topic now and boo is that horrible.
