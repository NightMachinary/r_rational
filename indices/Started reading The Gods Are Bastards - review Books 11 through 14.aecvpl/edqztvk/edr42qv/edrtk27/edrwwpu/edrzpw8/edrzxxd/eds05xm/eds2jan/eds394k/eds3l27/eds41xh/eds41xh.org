Its a logical conclusion that ties together a lot of evidence: it's a lot like the Flower prince trilogy (starting with the quantum thief) in that way.

The crown colonies world is confusing and wrong, Twig gives you a jigsaw puzzle without the box and puts it together step by frustrating step with no idea where the growing nexi of datums fit, until they start to clump. The picture on the cover will resonate with [[/r/rationals][r/rationals]] desires, though imho it sickens our communal ethics. I think the general deal is we know liberatedham can build a Sandersonisk hard rules world; and this one is wrong in many many ways, so we want to know why.
