Don't click the spoiler one name in context on one character will explain 60% of the story, it's really that tight.

The lacking piece is something that is not uncommon knowledge in the setting but is also a closely guarded secret: it is explicitly revealed in the last chapter, because the reasonable extrapolations from one person's name spoil many plot points: (Epiloge reveal and 60% of story spoiler)Adam, as in Frankenstein's monster, is king of England and the crown colonies extrapolate from this and you will spoil many things.
