Yep, I agree with everything you've said. If your characters point out at every opportunity how stupid and pointless your story is, they might just convince your readers that your story is stupid and pointless. Not a winning move.

That being said, it gets much better in the last few chapters, and the first interlude after Book 14 is outstanding. I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to tell you that it's an interlude from Butler Price's perspective, from the time before she served Darling, so keep at it.

Maybe you can help me find my place in PGTE. I recall Catherine coming back after dropping a lake on her enemies, her encounter while disguised with a major Hero (I forget his name- old guy, mentors young heroes, has massive narrative cach√©) by the fireside during a parley between muggle representatives, a giant path built through the mountains that Black went to deal with, Catherine stabbing Black, and Heirophant being obsessed with the past visions in the Fey Wilds where he saw his dad. I don't remember the order all that stuff happened in exactly, so whichever is the latest of those is around where I am. Any idea what chapter that would be?
