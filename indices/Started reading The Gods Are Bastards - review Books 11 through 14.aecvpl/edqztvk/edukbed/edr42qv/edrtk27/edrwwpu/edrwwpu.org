Thank you! And the chapter you're looking for is 9.2. So regarding Ward, I found Arc 8 to be very boring and mostly pointless. The TV appearance was notable, but aside from that, the team mostly just hung out in the clubhouse and made plans. Once Arc 9 starts, the story is riveting again. I expect that you probably let it fall by the wayside due to how much of a slog Arc 8 was. It's now at 11.6, and it's been excellent since the start of Arc 9, so I encourage you to start reading again. You're also lucky in a way, since you won't have to wait between chapters.
