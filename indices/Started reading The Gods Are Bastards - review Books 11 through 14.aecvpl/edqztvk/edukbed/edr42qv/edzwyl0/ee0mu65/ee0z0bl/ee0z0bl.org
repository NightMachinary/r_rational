Okay you're missing a bit of context and I should have provided that, so here it is: Your complaints are about foreshadowing for the setup to a reveal that's coming in another book or 2

You haven't taken the first bite of your sandwich, you read a tweet about the exciting new flavor that will be available in q3 of next year.

I'm not sure if you've reached the scene where Vesk and Eserion explicitly talk about metagaming the rules under which they are bound to operate, But the fetch quests and annoying references to narrative tropes are part of Vesk's way of >! gaining some level of control over his own actions in the grand scheme of things.!<

In any case complaints regarding narrative elements as basic as foreshadowing by someone who hasn't even read to the point being foreshadowed are unfair to the writer.
