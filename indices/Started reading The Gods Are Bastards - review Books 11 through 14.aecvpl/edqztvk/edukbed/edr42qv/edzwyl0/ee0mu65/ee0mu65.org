My statements were meant to reflect the experience I had up until that point. I suppose I can see where you'd make the mistake given some of my declarative statements so I apologize for that; I did not intend to judge the entire book with the experience I had in the first 18 chapters.

  I'll never understand this tendency to judge a story you haven't even finished

I'll have to disagree with this sentiment, though. You probably shouldn't make declarative statements about the a book as I did and instead make it clear you're discussing the parts you have consumed, but it seems perfectly valid to me to judge /any/ content you consume. To use a trite food analogy, it'd be like if you ordered a sandwich and took one bite in and found out you /hated/ it. Should you be required to finish the rest of the sandwich before forming an opinion on it? Perhaps you believe you must, but that's not my stance.

  After a dozen books you'd think there could be some kind of level of trust that it's intentional on the author's part and not just assume they're regressing to their first time writing in elementary school
#+end_quote

Hyperbole aside, this seems unnecessary. There are plenty of authors that I enjoy that have written numerous books while some of them you just don't enjoy as much. To use a personal example, I appreciate most of the Discworld series, but there's still a couple of them that I dislike. That doesn't mean that the author is "regressing to their first time writing in elementary school," just that they have written something that isn't to your tastes.

  This kind of deconstruction of ideas has been around since the first chapter, it's just a different topic now and boo is that horrible.
#+end_quote

That seems like an unfair characterization of what I was saying. I understand that I was somewhat rambling in the first paragraph, but I felt that I was fairly clear in the sentence on the next line; it's not that the metanarrative aspects of the story are inherently annoying to me, but rather that in this arc they felt /pointless/, which ruined my immersion.

Based on various comments, it appears as though it improves later in the book, which is great, but that doesn't change that my experience with the first half of the book was negative. I find it very unlikely that the ending would make me retroactively enjoy the first half, so in all likelihood when I have finished the book I will regard it much the same as TGAB as a whole: overall thoroughly enjoyable, but with a beginning that could use improvement.
