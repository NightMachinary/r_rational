I feel like this was all fine, except for the fact that it went on for a bit too long. I liked the idea that the paladins were actively warned against "traditional" hero quests by all their teaches and the idea that any rational person should just avoid them whenever possible and do more productive things, but by the time they did the Izara part it was getting a bit old. Luckily it doesn't long so I wasn't to bothered by it.
