I'm also currenly reading Book 14 of The Gods Are Bastards right now, currently on 14-18, and I definitely agree that it's not as captivating. For me it's mostly the repeated use of terms like "fetch quest" by the entire cast of characters; it feels as though the author is trying as hard as he possibly can to break immersion at every possible opportunity with this arc. Rational(ist? I always combine the two terms in my head) fiction often enjoys metanarrative, but in my opinion PGTE handles it much better, integrating metanarrative into the worldbuilding while still giving characters reasonable motivations for their actions. With Book 14 of TGAB, it feels like it's a sudden departure from the rest of the events going on so far with the only justification being "Wow, that god of bards sure is silly, isn't he?" This in itself is a bit contrived but otherwise wouldn't bother me too much, but when every character takes every opportunity to point out how dumb and contrived the entire situation is, it tends to cross that line. It would be as though in PGTE, every time that the Rule of Three was relevant a couple of characters pointed out that it is wildly impractical for a mechanic like that to exist in a world and that the events are therefore somewhat contrived; it wouldn't contribute to the story at all, and it would utterly destroy immersion.

In typing all that out, I've realized that I view it as a sort of Chekhov's metanarrative; if metanarrative if present, it must have a concrete purpose; including it without a very solid reason just breaks immersion and serves as a needless way of telling the audience that the author is aware of narrative tropes.

That's just my opinion though, obviously other people will have their own reactions to it.

Also in writing this I decided to check in on PGTE and realized that Book 4 is finished; I was waiting until it was complete to start reading it, and I probably would have went another six months forgetting to check on it. Thanks for the reminder, even if it was accidental.
