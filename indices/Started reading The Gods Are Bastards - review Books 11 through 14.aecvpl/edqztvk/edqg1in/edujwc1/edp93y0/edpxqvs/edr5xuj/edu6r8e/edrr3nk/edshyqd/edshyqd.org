I disagree.

On 1. While the two cults might not be inherently antithetical individual practices of one cult can easily be antithetical to the other: In this case extra-judicial punishments are antithetical to justice. You might make exceptions for special circumstances, but "not enough evidence to take her to court" is not one of those special circumstances.

If you want to argue that it's a false axiom that Aveism and Eserionites are not antithetical you have to explain how unaccountable violent retribution with no checks and balances, no trials, and no method of choosing appropriate targets beyond the personal whim of who a thief thinks has it coming is compatible with any reasonable definition of justice.

In addition, for Trissiny's decision to be rational it's not enough to demonstrate that Aveism and Eserionites are not antithetical. You have to demonstrate that Trissiny's reasoning is self consistent and makes sense given the information available to her; and the alternative options she didn't choose. The reason she chose the Thieves Guild is AU-Trissiny. But AU-Trissiny is explicitly lacking in the diplomacy/cunning Trissiny wants to learn. That's the kind of discrepancy that prevents TGaB from being rational.

On 2. This is not a random young woman. Trissiny has been raised in a monastery dedicated to the goddess of justice. She's had the best possible education her cult could provide, and impressed the goddess of justice enough to be appointed the one and only paladin. In addition to her training she has a direct hotline to the goddess of justice in her soul.

The right to a fair trial is not complicated and difficult legal theory. Given Trissiny's upbringing I'd expect her to know why it's the foundation of justice. For Trissiny's actions to make sense the entire cult of Avei would have had to have failed as an educator, for the cult of Avei to have failed as an educator, and it would have had to fail so fundamentally that it's the equivalent of graduating high school students who're functionally illiterate.

For The Gods are Bastards to be rational it would have to explain how the Cult of Avei could fail that badly. It would then have to portray the logical consequences of that explanation. What enormous flaws does the Cult have; and how does having one of the three largest religious groups, one with it's own army and enormous influence over the justice system, burdened with those flaws effect society.

We don't see that. The Cult of Avei isn't perfect but it's portrayed as a functional and well respected institution. The courts are functional enough to support a profession of lawyers.
