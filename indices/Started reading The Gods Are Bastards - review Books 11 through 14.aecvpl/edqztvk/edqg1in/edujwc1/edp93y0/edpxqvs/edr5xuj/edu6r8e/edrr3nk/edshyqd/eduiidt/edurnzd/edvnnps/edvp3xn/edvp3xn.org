Thank you for your effort and for finding that in the text. I said,

  I've seen no evidence thus far that Avei cares about human judicial systems at all.

The quotes you provided have convinced me I was wrong about that part, and Avei does in fact care about human judicial systems. Enjoy your delta: *Î”*

That being said, I still believe that Avei favors vigilante justice/extra-judicial punishment and problem solving, via her Hands, whose behavior as cop/judge/jury/executioner she endorses. I think that normally, she prefers that the system of laws be followed and upheld, but she makes an exception in matters handled by herself and her Hands. In your first quote, I think Trissiny was speaking generally, and in your second, Rouvad was criticizing the Eserites' style of vigilante justice, since it apparently involves very little fact finding or process. I don't think either statement applies to a Hand of Avei meting out justice as she sees fit in situations that warrant it. If Avei cared about that, why did she never tell her Hands to stop, aside from the one Hand who was abusing her power to torture someone? Justice can be harsh; Avei is not the goddess of mercy, after all.
