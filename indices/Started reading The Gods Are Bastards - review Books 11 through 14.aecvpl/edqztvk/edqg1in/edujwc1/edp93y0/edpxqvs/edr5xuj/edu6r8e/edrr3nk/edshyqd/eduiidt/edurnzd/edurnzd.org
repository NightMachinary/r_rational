  On 1. While the two cults might not be inherently antithetical individual practices of one cult can easily be antithetical to the other: In this case extra-judicial punishments are antithetical to justice. You might make exceptions for special circumstances, but "not enough evidence to take her to court" is not one of those special circumstances.

Do you have a source for this in the the text? Avei is about justice- not the trappings of justice. The whole point of the Hands is to go around dealing out justice personally, not to support human judicial systems. In Avenic justice, there is no 'getting off on a technicality to preserve the integrity of the system' because Avei is concerned with justice in individual cases, and has the benefit of divine knowledge. She wouldn't ignore evidence obtained by an illegal search and she wouldn't care if something was proven to a jury beyond reasonable doubt or not, because she has divine certainty in the cases she considers. Avei doesn't care about 'enough evidence to take them to court'; she just cares if they did it or not. I've seen no evidence thus far that Avei cares about human judicial systems at all. In fact, I bet that if a judge let a defendant off the hook because he was powerful, she would punish both, even though they were working within the rules of the system. All systems are corrupt. Avei doesn't care about the right to a fair trial when she's considering a case before her; that's only the foundation of justice when the divine avatar of the concept of justice isn't directly involved in the matter. Trials do not trump Avei's divine judgment.

Both Avei and Eserion are concerned with actual, real life justice, without regard for human social structures, and both advocate vigilante justice. IRL, the problem with vigilante justice is the possibility of getting the wrong guy and the undermining of the state's authority and monopoly on violence. In TGAB, the gods have better knowledge than jurors and the state's authority is subordinate to theirs; nor does the state hold a monopoly on violence, since the gods specifically grant that right to their Hands.
