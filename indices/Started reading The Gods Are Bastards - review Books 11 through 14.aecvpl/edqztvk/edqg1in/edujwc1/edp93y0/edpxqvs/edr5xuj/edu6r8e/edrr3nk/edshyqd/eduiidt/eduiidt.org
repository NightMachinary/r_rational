  In this case extra-judicial punishments are antithetical to justice.

What? The entire point of the hand of Avei is to carry out extra judicial justice. Trissiny even goes on this spirit walk where she sees this firsthand and we are told that the hands of Avei aren't admired as much as they are feared and the godess is the only one who decides whether or not what they are doing is justice or cruelty.

  unaccountable violent retribution with no checks and balances, no trials, and no method of choosing appropriate targets beyond the personal whim of who a thief thinks has it coming is compatible with any reasonable definition of justice.

Again, that's what a paladin is. The "checks and balances" here are the gods and while a paladin has more of their attention, serious actions by the thieves guild are reported to, or usually coordinated by, the leaders of the cult. You could argue that the thieves guild isn't that great for the justice system, but for a paladin their rules fit perfectly.

  The reason she chose the Thieves Guild is AU-Trissiny. But AU-Trissiny is explicitly lacking in the diplomacy/cunning Trissiny wants to learn.
#+end_quote

I didn't interpret that as her wanting to become like AU-Trissiny (in fact I recall Trissiny disliking her), just that she saw another version of herself and after learning a lot about the Thieves guild and her own cult she decided that the guild was what she needed.

#+begin_quote
  Given Trissiny's upbringing I'd expect her to know why it's the foundation of justice.
#+end_quote

You're still working on the logic of our world and our systems. The epitome of justice isn't a fair trial, it's divine judgment. For most people the world functions like you're saying, but for a paladin of justice it's about going up and bringing justice to people directly. The reason She goes to the Thieves Guild is because the old system was to ride up in silver armor and cut the heads off of people she deems worthy of death.
