  - You can't equate the sudden emotional reaction to her own arch enemy species (to her, at the time) /taunting/ her and the planned, coldly executed beatdown of someone who can't fight back.

True, but she tried to /murder/ him just for calling her a name, while she carefully planned and executed the much less harmful beatdown. She had more of an excuse to reach for violence in the first instance, perhaps, but committed a much less violent act in the second. You could just as easily say, "You can't compare attempting to murder someone for calling her a name she didn't like to a measured bit of violence that did no permanent damage and was meant to merely humiliate." Both were wrong in their own ways and I think they do compare.

  - So, she was acting as the Hand of Avei, not guild.
#+end_quote

Sure, officially, but I meant that she was drawing on her Guild training and their influence.

  - The quests bend reality to fit around them? That was never really implied from the text. Till that point, the "narrative" if it even existed, was a subtle force of influence and not a world shaping superpower. Is it capable of mind control now?

No, but Vesk certainly manipulates people and events. He explicitly says so and gives several examples, later on in the book.

It's ok to say "A god did it" when the gods are actively involved in the story. It's like saying "A Sith did it" about the events of Star Wars. A Sith did in fact do it.
