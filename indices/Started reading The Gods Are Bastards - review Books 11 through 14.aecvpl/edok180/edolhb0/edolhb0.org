I didn't mind the Scion stuff so much. I think it was explained as well as it could have been, thought you're right, things always get weird when time is involved. I think it being strictly limited to that one god's domain keeps it from breaking the story.

And I definitely agree, the violence against the noble seemed like a giant overreaction and the wrong choice. But 3 things: 1. Trissiny has struggled with this in the past- remember she tried to murder Gabe for calling her a bitch once, 2. She was acting as a Thieves' Guild enforcer, and not only is that basically their thing, they also have a casual blas√© attitude towards inflicting violence (they're not really good people, despite their noble rogue thing), and 3. It's a Vesk quest, which means overdramatic plots, big reversals of fortune, and quick, pithy resolutions.
