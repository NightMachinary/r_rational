I initially stopped following this during the Scion extra chapters. Anything related to manipulating time has to usually be carefully crafted to avoid inconsistencies, but here it was simply "A God did it", which is just handwaving. Even if they introduce proper mechanics for the power of the gods in the future, I would always have this entire timey wimey thing in the back of my head, and I don't think any pseudo science explanation would be enough to untangle that mess.

I recently tried to get back into it, started Book 14, and was just aghast at the sequence of events in chapter 14-5.

We have what is presumably a "lady of the noble house" who's in charge of the budget for "education" I guess, building a museum for showcasing the state of the art science that runs their industry. /Not bad, not bad/. Oh wait, she used the part of the budget which was earmarked for schools. /Big oof right there/. Ah, but okay, you're paladins, so you can use your soft power to remove the funding support from the Vidian cult... +wait that still means that the education budget was already spent for building this thing right? The Sultana wouldn't be happy about that.+ seems like it hasn't been spent yet, it's softly implied that it's a fundraiser for doing this. That's cool, that means their soft power saved the day, and the money can now be allocated towards building schools! Pretty nice resolu-

/Wait, what? Trissiny, why're you punching that middle aged lady?/

Trissiny just casually inflicts violence on someone who just made a sarcastic comment, being a bit emotional after one of her projects was just destroyed. I'm not sure if it was intended, but that whole scene seemed imply that Trissiny was somehow in the right for beating up this defenseless lady, making an example of her in front of her peers and humiliating her... for what, exactly? Budget allocation shenanigans? A bit of corruption? Like everyone else there?

It gave me extremely bad vibes, as the text and the characters were going about as if this was the right thing to do, humiliate and make an example of one person to "send a message" to the rest of the "group". As if the "nobility" as a whole were some sort of amorphous entity and not consisting of individuals with their own personalities, aspirations, dreams etc. That's the type of shit terrorists and dictators do, make an example of someone to try and intimidate the entire group.

The worst part was the aftermath, Trissiny pondering the implications of what she did, and +the author+ "Yasmeen" reassuring her that "s'all good, those noble rich fucks occasionally need to get kicked in the hide".

It was such a childish, simplistic explanation that I was tempted to go back and reread some sections, wondering whether it was always like this. Where did the whole "violence can't solve everything" lesson of so many books go? The Lor'naris arc in the initial books was a pretty well done arc where Trissiny doesn't realize the sort of authority she carries around and subsequently, makes a slightly bad situation much worse. And she didn't even use violence, just threatened to.

The author also seemed to think of this as just a minor step along the heroes' journey, as the scene quickly cuts to their next destination and the next conflict. No scene with imperial spies informing the emperor about this, no scene where Quentin Vex ponders on the problem of a paladin openly inflicting violence on someone whose authority derives from the silver throne. +No scene indicating whatsoever that the empire is watching this, despite this ostensibly being their /own fucking territory/.+ Vex was there! And since there wasn't a scene with him, the readers are left to assume that he's okay with this...? That's so out of character for a man for whom the authority of the empire is not a trifling thing.

Not to mention this is someone who's subordinate to the Sultana, but instead of the Sultana herself handing out the punishment, she happily allows Trissiny to take over part of her authority (bit irresponsible there). Doesn't that count as the Sultana using Trissiny as a tool for herself? Or at the very least, speaks poorly of the Sultana that she doesn't have control over her subordinates and has to use punishment by proxy.

That scene jarred me out of the story so much, I just gave up on reading the rest.
