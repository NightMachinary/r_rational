There's a pope hacking AI gods, & trying to bring on a communist divinity singularity (and maybe not enough god to go around), a rebel god disgusted at the current AI gods, and a window for more gods coming up, a elder god's avatar as headmistress of the main characters/pawns/next set of gods , other power players, other chekov's guns , and "a great doom coming" I'm for one am interested to see what the next nash equilibra will be aka how it all shakes out.
