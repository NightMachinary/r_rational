I don't know, ask a more unquestioning fan.

This may surprise you, but while I think /GEB/ is a remarkable book, and I'm interested in promoting discussion of it, I don't believe every word of it is true. Saying "wait, really?" is an important part of the discussion.

There's a great contrast you can set up by reading part 2 of /GEB/ alongside Marvin Minsky's /The Emotion Machine/. While written about similar topics in a similar style, they come to contrary conclusions. And I wouldn't wholeheartedly subscribe to either of them.

EDIT: I do find your question misplaced though. This is philosophy, not neuroscience. The "brain literature" would require claims that could be tested experimentally.
