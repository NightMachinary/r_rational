Tough going because it's difficult to understand, or because it's dull?

I haven't gotten a copy of /Surfaces and Essences/ yet, but I eventually put aside his previous book, /I Am A Strange Loop/, even though I've enjoyed several of Hofstadter's books. I felt that IAASL was too much like a rehash of parts of GEB without the wit.

I envision this conversation between Hofstadter and readers:

- Hofstadter, 1979: Hey, here are some really cool connections between math, music, AI, and stuff! Also there's a conclusion I've come to about consciousness.
- Readers: Wow! Those are some really cool connections!
- Hofstadter: Glad you like it! Have some more books about the amazing things that minds do! By the way, I think you're not paying enough attention to the part about consciousness.
- Readers: Isomorphisms are neat!
- Hofstadter, 2007: CONSCIOUSNESS. IT'S IMPORTANT. LET ME EXPLAIN IT AT LENGTH IN ANOTHER BOOK.
- Readers: ...okay.

So what's /Surfaces and Essences/ like?
