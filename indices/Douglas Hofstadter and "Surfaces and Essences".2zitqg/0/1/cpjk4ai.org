well, those sections where he plays with phrases, idioms or descriptions? They are here in great big massed pages full moving slowly from one idiom-concept / phrase to another. I am trying to figure out if it is clever and I am completely missing it-- i.e. if there is hidden plot or fun here, or if it is truly just examples of analogies/concepts and that's it.

I have not gotten particularly far into it, just about a hundred out of the 500 odd pages, but it's also a bit hard to tell at a glance what's going on in the future chapters, so I don't know if this is going to change or not.

I loved his earlier stuff, GEB, Metamagical Themas, and the Mind's I. Honestly, I even liked I Am A Strange Loop, though I felt it was less clever than the earlier ones.

Surfaces and Essences though is /giant/ and I don't exactly know what he's trying to do with it. Its either far too clever for me, or it's just rehashing the same material, with each page being somewhat clever word play / discussion but it not exactly seeming to build on itself or go anywhere in particular.
