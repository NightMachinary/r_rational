This is a basic plan for a story I'm starting.

In a society analogous to Renaissance Europe (probably on the older end of it, so think early 1400s), the world appears much the same as our own but for a few differences:

1. Blood doesn't spill. When exposed to the atmosphere for more than a few seconds, blood (apparently) evaporates. This doesn't interfere with coagulation.
2. A small percentage of people who have been in life or death situations (specifically those involving near death by exsanguination) are capable of performing magic. This magic is powered by blood.
3. A blood mage who is extremely low on blood (especially when first unlocking their potential) will experience an unstoppable desire to draw blood through the skin of a nearby human by magic. Some of this stolen blood is used to heal themselves, and some to restore their levels of blood to normal.

   1. If there are no humans around, they will usually just die (it would be possible to force the unlocking event artificially and still save the subject, but nobody wants to try this).
   2. If there are humans around, they will almost certainly attempt to drain the most accessible of their blood in order to prevent death. They won't be able to control the quantity taken, instead drawing it until they are either fully healed or their victim(s) have run dry.
   3. The magic to siphon blood works only on humans for reasons that are, in-universe, attributed to the evil and predatory nature of blood mages. If the only nearby candidates are animals, they will not instinctively attempt to drain them.
   4. Nobody in the setting has discovered blood types yet. This means that in many cases blood mages will end up killing themselves by absorbing incompatible blood. I haven't yet worked out the exact odds (it depends on the distribution of blood types, which can be tweaked a little since it varies by population), but it would be often enough that blood mages would develop a reputation for it (how much of a reputation depends also on how long it takes to die from this transfusion).
   5. Naturally, not much study has been done on blood mages. They are seen as vampire-analogues or possessing spirits. Those that survive their initial ordeal and don't kill themselves attempting magic and using up all their blood (either through ignorance or desperation) generally have no desire to use their abilities at all.

4. Blood mages can also voluntarily donate blood (to a person, container, or just the atmosphere) and can extract it from all of the above (though they'd have to be very quick for the latter, since it would be evaporating rapidly). In both cases it must pass through the caster's body.
5. Magic is potentially extremely powerful, but the fact that you have to use your own blood to perform it makes it much more limited. You can't perform magic on unassimilated blood, so you pretty much have to either know about blood types (not practical in the setting, at least before the events of the plot) or stick to extracting your own blood and waiting for it to refill.
6. I haven't yet decided on the exact powers, but they'd be able to heal and harm at close range.

So, given all the potential negative associations with blood magic and the comparative rarity of its practitioners (fewer than 5% have the potential, let alone develop it), is it reasonable for society to still be close to 1400s Europe?

The bigger divergence might be the fact that blood does not spill, which changes the infectivity of bloodborne diseases (still transmissible by sex, not so much from fighting or bleeding) and changes how women are affected by menstruation.

I can elaborate on what drives the above setting differences (which is almost certainly a much bigger change to the world from our own), but it'll have to wait for me to get some sleep.
