Some points:

- Blood type incompatibility could possibly lead to a split classification of the mages, between "dark" ones (AB+, can receive transfusions from anyone, and giving transfusions to almost anyone else harms them) and "light" ones (O-, can't receive transfusions from most people, but can heal anyone), with all of the other blood types being a mix.

- Transfusing the wrong blood type results in a "sense of impending doom", even at concentrations that make you sick instead of killing you. This has interesting implications for the mythology of your world, as well as possibly acting as very expensive and difficult form of blood typing.

- When blood evaporates, does it leave its pathogens behind? If so, blood borne diseases would still happen some, just not as often.
