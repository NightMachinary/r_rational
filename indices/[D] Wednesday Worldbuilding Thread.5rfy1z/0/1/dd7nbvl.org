Menstruation isn't blood as such. It's very blood-like, but it's different - it's the broken down uterine lining and stuff too. Thicker and more coagulated. So I'm not sure how much that would be affected by something that affects blood coming from veins.

  Menstrual fluid contains some blood, as well as cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood. ... About half of menstrual fluid is blood. (wikipedia)

I guess along with this you gotta think about what happens if someone has internal bleeding and coughs / vomits / poops blood, because "blood mixed with other fluids in contact with air" may not have the same magic as "pure blood in contact with air"
