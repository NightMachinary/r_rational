The way I'm currently modelling it, a solution of blood will evaporate along with the solute, while a mixture of blood will evaporate separately (possibly slower, since less surface area will be exposed).

As far as I can tell, menstrual fluid is a mixture, so it would only be the blood that evaporates. That would probably make it less red in colour and more viscous. It may be enough to change the associations with menstruation (e.g. currently people talk about women bleeding, but they might not realise blood was ever a component of this fluid), but it probably wouldn't affect the realities of dealing with it in a pre-feminine-hygiene-product society.
