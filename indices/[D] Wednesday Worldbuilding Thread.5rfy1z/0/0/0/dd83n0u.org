I really like that light/dark split idea. Once blood mages form a fledgling community (i.e. after they discover blood types several hundred years early) it will probably split partially along those lines.

For reference, the protagonist is going to be AB+ (between 2% and 10% of the population in the real world, depending on the country), with his father being A+ and his mother B+.

O- has a similar distribution, except some Asian countries (China, Japan, India, Korea, the Philippines, probably others that just haven't measured it) have a very low rate of all Rh- blood types.

Assuming an incidence of about 5% for each, we'd expect to see far more dark mages initially, since all the O- mages will generally die after they unlock their potential (only surviving if the person they drain is O-, which is a 5% chance unless they're a close relative).

Later, once they come up with a system to trigger the event without needing to drain another person (probably just transfusing their blood out and straight back in), this skewed ratio would be corrected. By then the dark mages would have probably set the agenda for the community, so there would be some consequences to changing the balance.

The sense of impending doom is very interesting, along with some of the other symptoms I just looked up. It would appear a lot like being smited for an evil act, with purpura (rash of purple spots on the skin), jaundice (yellowed skin), and dark brown urine.

I'm not sure how long it would take for a near-total blood transfusion to be fatal, which is a pretty key detail. Any ideas where I could find that information?

When blood evaporates, anything in solution with it will vanish too. It's not truly evaporation, it's more like the blood is being taken. The people of the setting draw the connection to evaporation from the way it appears to turn into a mist and quickly dissipate, but strictly speaking there's no way to stop it (i.e. neither higher pressure nor lower temperature would keep it a liquid; even solid blood would "evaporate", though they haven't reached the level of scientific knowledge required to know that makes little sense).
