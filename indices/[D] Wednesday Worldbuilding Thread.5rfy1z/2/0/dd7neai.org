I studied an introductory unit into epidemiology and one of the lectures was on outbreak investigation - how health professionals respond to and identify the cause of an outbreak. I suspect that's too early in the story though (before they identify it's an unknown disease). You may want to look into how they researched legionnaire's and HIV for inspiration.
