Does anyone here know any immunologists/pathologists or is aware of someone who would be willing to help me craft a believable character working for the CDC or similar health organization which is studying diseases?

I have crafted a magical disease, and would like to go through some of the process a medical professional would use in categorizing and describing a new, virulent bacterium, and some of the methods they would use to study it.
