Finally making consistent, daily progress on my book. That does however mean that I've had to tackle an aspect of my worldbuilding I'm not very confident in.

When the main characters, who are mostly used to 17th century tech, explore the creepy old Hogwarts/Moria ruins of doom they run into a very simple computer. With the power of magic the computer can store holograms and voice recordings of the people who made it, but it's still basically just a Flow chart of Yes/No questions and a media archive less sophisticated than an mp3-player. I've tried to make their reactions to the thing realistic, and will continue to do so as they explore the +1940s science+ Ancient Lost Knowledge contained within it, but I'm definitely going to have to listen to the opinions of anyone I can get to read the first draft when it's done. Having your characters faced with something they have no reference points for is hard.
