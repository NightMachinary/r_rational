  Also, I am told that the magic system I am using is not original enough and too close to Naruto's magic system.

I thought that you were specifically riffing off of Naruto, so consider me another data point on that.

  Let me know how I can make the magic system more distinct.
#+end_quote

First off, drop the term "chakra." Between that and "chakra beasts," the comparisons to Naruto will be many.

You specify "kung fu," though, so let's see what we can do by focusing on Chinese mythology.

Interestingly, the term /Wulin/ means "Warrior's Forests," which brings to mind previously-discussed images of your three-dimensional world.

Reading up on the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (or "Boxers" as they are more commonly known), a recent but defunct Chinese sect whose beliefs may fit what you're going for, we find them practicing "martial arts and calisthenics" and seeking "a type of spiritual possession which involved the whirling of swords, violent prostrations, and chanting incantations to deities."

Furthermore, they "believed that through training, diet, martial arts and prayer they could perform extraordinary feats."

Let's take the possession and set the exact nature of it aside. Whether it's spirits with personality, amnesiac ghosts who really do nothing at all but fuel your powers, or random magical energy, it needs to be invited into the body and channeled through movement: if you stop moving, then whatever effect you're aiming for will dissipate. This means that the best way to counter chakra users is to trap them suddenly. This is probably how large chakra beasts are dealt with. Also (especially if chakra users can heal themselves on the go) fights between chakra users will probably focus on immobilization techniques.

If incantations are required for a particular spell, then the incantation must be continuous.

Interestingly, Qi/Chi/Khi/Gi/Ki can be translated as "breath" and "energy /flow/", both terms that fit into this idea that magic users have to be moving in order to use their powers.

By the way, the Boxers had female counterparts, whose members were referred to as Red Lanterns, Blue Lanterns, and Black Lanterns depending on their age. "[Something] Lanterns" might be a good replacement term for "ninja."

Looking at other traditions:

- Feng Shui is about the placement and arrangement of things so as to balance qi. Maybe the placement and arrangement (and even color) of objects can direct the flow of qi, creating both low- and even zero-qi zones where qi use is impaired (another useful tactic against giant qi beasts, but primarily limited, I imagine, to when they invade cities or other places that you've had time to fortify) and high-qi zones where you can perform techniques that are otherwise impossible. In Feng Shui there is something called a /luopan/ or "compass, which detects the level and direction of qi flow.
- Qigong is the practice of "coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness [...] to cultivate and balance qi." It is also a form of medicine: Can qi become "corrupted"? If so, then even if qi can't heal people you might still need qi-medics who can keep people from being impaired or sickened by bad qi. Acupuncture might be part of this, with needles used to redirect the flow of qi. If so, then metal, wood, clay, or whatever the needles are made of might react to qi in other ways as well.
