Congrats on making consistent progress! It's hard and you should be proud of yourself!

Are there any specific questions you'd like to ask? Your post and concept is interesting but it doesn't look like you have a specific question.

The thing I'm working on has a character meeting a vampire and he comes up with a bunch of theories - some quite implausible - for what the reason for his odd behaviour could be, because no matter how implausible the theory is, it's still more likely than "this guy is a vampire". I think that's what you'd need to do, get the people to use the stuff that's in their reference pane to justify the actions of the computer.

I think of Jumanji for this: when the pieces clip onto the board seemingly on their own, the characters in the '70s say "must be magnets"; the characters in the '90s say "must be microchips". If they live in a world where they see magic all the time, they're probably just going to assume it's enchanted in some way. If they live in our normal 17th century tech, they're probably going to relate it to mirrors/telescopes(?? I don't know exactly what tech level was at 17th century but for the purposes of my example let's go with that), or if they're in a theocracy, god/spirits/etc, lost magic artefact, etc. But probably they'd assume that it's a wizard of oz type contraption, with the hologram people in hearing range of them to answer questions, and appearing due to an "ingenious system of lenses and mirrors".
