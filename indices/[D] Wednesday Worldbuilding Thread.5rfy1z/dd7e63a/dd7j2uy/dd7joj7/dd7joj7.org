Someone who got just the right powers due to another event in the setting might be able to dilate time by a factor of 2.5 and never need to sleep. These powers would tie up a portion of their magical capacity permanently however.

Otherwise... time dilation is one of those really high end things that would take thousands of hours to figure out. Being in a time dilated zone would mess with the connection with the astral plane in a way that would make many types of spells and make exploring the astral plane more dangerous.

So in terms of magical FOOM/singularity... maybe someone could try, but only after investing a huge amount of time into magic first.
