Working on a Choose Your Own Adventure series over on [[/r/makeyourchoice]] and I have a few things I am seeking advice with. As a general note, at the level of detail I am working at, it is almost like a really open ended single player pen and paper RPG, although the general format of CYOAs on [[/r/makeyourchoice]] encourages less text than RPG sourcebooks typically have, and the single player nature means you don't have to worry as much about mechanical balance, if someone wants to take over the world, let them, although, in the style of [[/r/rational]] I am sure trying to think in terms of other (NPC) people around the world also trying to leverage things.

So my main questions:

How do you strike a good balance between "flavor text"/"fluff" with mechanical descriptions of things "crunch"?

How do you communicate info about the setting, balancing between players that are trying to get every little advantage out of the choices, vs. players looking for a detailed and imaginative setting vs. players that are just casually playing through and don't want to deal with too many choices.

I am trying to work info about the setting into the choices and events and not just tell the players outright. For example, I have a pretty detailed magic system in mind, and I want to figure out how to give just enough detail that the players can work out/ imagine most of the results and implications of the magic system. Preferably enough so that most of the events in future episodes/missions will make sense. At minimum, enough do that the player's character and allies are neither underpowered or overpowered.

World building question: Recently in the modern world, magic egad come to exist. Magic use can be learned, although it is very difficult to teach anything beyond the basics, as it must be worked out and practiced/experimented with individually for each person. It takes a large time investment (several hours a day for several weeks or months ) just to get really minor results (limited astral projection, conjuring enough fire to light a candle, boosting intuition or charisma, creating a jinx to trip someone, etc.). At the high end, it might allow stuff like indefinite life extension for the magic user, personal pocket dimensions, conjuring matter from nothing, although each of these type of things would take, let's say, around ten thousand hours of practice, research, and the experimentation. Magic also has some risks associated with the high end stuff: getting lost in the astral plane and never returning to your body, damaging your nervous system or blood vessels from the inside out, etc. Also, for various metaphysical reasons, it is really hard to use magic to permanently effect things on a large scale in the real world (for example, an extremely well practiced, high-end magic user can carve out their own pocket dimension and micromanage the weather in it, but they can't fix global warming in the "real" world.) So, if magic like this appeared in the modern world, how many people would invest time into learning magic? (Before you say everyone, think of all the people that don't exercise properly, or have poor diets, or don't educate themselves, or are religious fundamentalists). What kinds of laws would emerge in the first several years of magic like this becoming possible? How would various governments react? Etc... For reasons specific to this CYOA series, I don't need brainstorming past the first 4-5 years after the emergence of magic(partly for spoiler reasons and mostly because I can leave it up to the players imagination)
