If you haven't yet, immediately read Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy. The aging problems start in /Red Mars/ and only get worse in /Green Mars/ and /Blue Mars/. This is a world where people there's an effective anti-aging treatment, but it's not perfect, and can't solve all problems.

Some issues addressed in the book:

- Mourning people who die young, though accidents or disease
- Children who watch adults die 'early', when they had been told that people could live forever.
- People whose bodies longer than their brains can continue functioning, and people who are living through this process, realizing that it is happening to them.
- People who refuse to get the anti-aging treatment.
- Socioeconomic and political effects of having an ever-increasing population, many of whom might not be able to find jobs because the experienced workers aren't retiring.
- People coming out of retirement to work.
- People deciding not to have kids.
- Resource production and distribution, especially as regards food and shelter.
- Class warfare, if the thing that defeats aging is not widely available.
