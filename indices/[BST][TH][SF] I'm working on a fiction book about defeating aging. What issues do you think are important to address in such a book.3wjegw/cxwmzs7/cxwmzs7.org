It's good to see it confront some of the big problems people cite- older individuals taking positions of power in the economy, lack of innovation, people who are too old for easy treatment with anti aging serums, and seeing those challenges being overcome.

It'll be good to see the before and after. People mourning after losing parents to degenerative diseases and aging related sicknesses, and how they feel after it's ended.

Deal with how people handle those who died of aging before the treatments.

It'll be good to see some of the hypocrisy of people- the super rich who are morally against it seeking secret anti aging treatments.

It'll be good to see the old be restored to good health, enjoying physically and mentally intense adventures again.
