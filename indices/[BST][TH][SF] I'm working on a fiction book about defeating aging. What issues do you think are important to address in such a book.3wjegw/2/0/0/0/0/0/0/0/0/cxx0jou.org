I think your suggestions here are way too naive. When i said "solve overpopulation" I meant devise solutions for the imminent problem of overpopulation you will most assuredly have once you have a cure for aging (assuming you distribute it en masse) My apologies for not making that clear.

Next. Sterilization? No sane human society is going to agree to any form of forced sterilization, barring some hard, factual reasoning. You COULD try telling people "Hey, you can be immortal, but you need to sterilize yourself." But then they just have a few kids and sterilize themselves afterwards. That's definitely preferable to those people who will keep popping out babies as long as their immortal genitalia are functioning, but it's still not a solution.

Next. It's bad logic to presume that immortality would spark a technological revolution. What does immortality change in the world of science as it is today? You CAN posit that, with immortal scientists, the odds of sparking a revolution go up (since none of our scientists are dying off) but the odds don't go up nearly enough for you to say immortality will cause a revolution in and of itself.

  We can create inefficient sustainable habitats, enough solar panels can fuel anything

This made me laugh a bit. It's simply incorrect. We have more to consider than just fueling issues.

- The components of our space station/ship/mars city aren't going to last forever. We need access to the materials that we use to build these things, for when things inevitably start to wear away and break down.

- We need a way to create water, air and food while floating through space.

- We need to ensure that our space settlement is positioned such we're getting enough sunlight to facilitate our needs

EDIT: We still haven't developed a way to escape Earth's orbit that doesn't require a massive dump of fossil fuels

And those are just what I thought of in maybe 5 minutes of typing. Look at how much constant upkeep goes into the cities we live in now. Settling elsewhere would mean we'd need to "science the shit" out of a few particular aspects of how we live, else our stations won't last very long. And before you say "Oh, we can get what we need from Earth", keep in mind the whole point of this resettling is leaving because the Earth's resources are becoming insufficient.

Anyway, finally: You stated that over population solves itself. I remain unconvinced. Just because people won't starve to death (and that's a leap in and of itself, as OP simply talked about curing aging, which in NO way implies we won't continue to need food and water) doesn't mean overpopulation won't have consequences.
