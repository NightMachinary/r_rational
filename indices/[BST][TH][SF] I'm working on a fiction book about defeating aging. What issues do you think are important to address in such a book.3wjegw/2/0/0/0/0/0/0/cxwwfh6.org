No, okay. Let me try. The point of curing aging is stopping people from dying. The long-term goal is for no one to die anymore, because death is bad. Ergo, any 'solution' to overpopulation that involves people dying, while technically valid, is still counterproductive and not the kind of solution we want to settle with or work towards.

Again, the real, long-term goal is total immortality for everyone who wants it. Not just young people who still die.
