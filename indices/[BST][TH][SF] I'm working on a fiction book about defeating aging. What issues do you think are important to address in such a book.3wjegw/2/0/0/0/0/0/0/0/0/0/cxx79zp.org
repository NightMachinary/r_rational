  I think your suggestions here are way too naive. When i said "solve overpopulation" I meant devise solutions for the imminent problem of overpopulation you will most assuredly have once you have a cure for aging (assuming you distribute it en masse) My apologies for not making that clear.
#+end_quote

The important thing is that you said solve it first.

  Next. Sterilization? No sane human society is going to agree to any form of forced sterilization, barring some hard, factual reasoning. You COULD try telling people "Hey, you can be immortal, but you need to sterilize yourself." But then they just have a few kids and sterilize themselves afterwards.
#+end_quote

"Be immortal and sterlized if you have fewer than one kid since a year after the announcement of this medicine"

Not really hard is it... at the end of the day you're the one suggesting that such an enormous number of deaths from overpopulation would demand that the inventor not release the immortality solution and so left billions die or be injured while he waits...

Never mind the fact that we can easily store genetic material or in the future recreate fertile material from someone's DNA. Sperm and egg banks?

  Next. It's bad logic to presume that immortality would spark a technological revolution. What does immortality change in the world of science as it is today?
#+end_quote

I already told you. It has nothing to do with people "surviving", it's entirely to do with people's utility function now predicting a near infinite time horizon. It completely changes how people optimize behaviour. People might care about their kids to act well, but they certainly don't act in the interests of great great great great children. But if you're alive, and you predict you'll be alive in 100 years your incentive model is completely changed.

  The components of our space station/ship/mars city aren't going to last forever. We need access to the materials that we use to build these things, for when things inevitably start to wear away and break down.
#+end_quote

Nothing will last forever. If you take sustainable to mean that then I admit that you are right and nothing in the universe is sustainable. The goal I intended is to last until new technology is invented.

You said that we couldn't do it, that it's literally impossible (which obviously is true if you're using last indefinitely but I'll ignore that and assume you mean like 100 years). That if in 5 years time the Earth would explode there (and everyone knew this and there were no more tech developments) there would be no life long space container with humans inside. Well you weren't so precise since you said cannot really I can do any scenario without tech development.

  We need a way to create water, air and food while floating through space.
#+end_quote

NASA already electrolyse their oxygen. As space stations are almost entirely self contained (no mass loss), with constant energy from the sun you can break and form bonds as much as you want.

We know how to do all those things, as I said it's just greatly inefficient. It's just turning waste back into usable products.

#+begin_quote
  We need to ensure that our space settlement is positioned such we're getting enough sunlight to facilitate our needs
#+end_quote

That's not hard when you're not locked to an planetary orbit lol. Just orbit the sun, or not, anywhere in space you're statistically likely not to be in shadow.

You confused me by saying "in space" when we were talking about on a body too. Where it's even easier to do all the above since you can just mine from the moon or Mars more resources. Though as I said we can do it mass neutrally anyway.

#+begin_quote
  We still haven't developed a way to escape Earth's orbit that doesn't require a massive dump of fossil fuels
#+end_quote

So what? That's not what you said. You just said we can't do that. I just said it was wrong, we could do it.

#+begin_quote
  And before you say "Oh, we can get what we need from Earth", keep in mind the whole point of this resettling is leaving because the Earth's resources are becoming insufficient.
#+end_quote

If we need to leave Earth because the resources are dwindling, then there will be motivations to make it more efficient. A space elevator is almost technically possible, if not already so (not kept up with carbon nanotubes of late) and that has the barest of funds.

#+begin_quote
  Just because people won't starve to death (and that's a leap in and of itself, as OP simply talked about curing aging, which in NO way implies we won't continue to need food and water) doesn't mean overpopulation won't have consequences.
#+end_quote

Yes, I sure said that overpopulation won't have consequences. I said people would starve to death, not wouldn't. If you breed so much you can't feed yourself you die.

You said let people die until you figure out how to solve a problem that you believe has no solution for, so that's an indefinite problem. I don't want to die because someone listened to your advice and is sitting on immortality for the next three hundred years.
