Please explain to me how overpopulation solves itself. I heavily disagree, but am capable of being convinced if your argument is valid.

The earth is finite. We're heavily reliant on fossil fuels, despite all of the research that proves this may not be the best idea. We don't currently have the technology to create sustainable habitats for humans on other astrological bodies, and we're decades away from such technology (unless something sparks a technological revolution of some sort)
