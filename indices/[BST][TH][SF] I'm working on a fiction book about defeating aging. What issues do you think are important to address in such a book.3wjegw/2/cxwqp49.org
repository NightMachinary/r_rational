1. You would need to address overpopulation immediately. I'd almost say you should address it before you release such a cure. I think somewhere around 15-ish people die every 10 seconds, and like 20 are born (super rough numbers, obviously) Not all of that is due to aging, but I'm sure a good portion of it is due to aging and diseases that would be cured by an aging cure. We'd run into scarcity problems after a few decades. Addressing it, in and of itself though, is tricky, as having babies is one of those things that people feel they should be in total control of, so any obvious attempts to curb that will be protested heavily.

2. How easy is this to produce? How expensive is it? Who's controlling such a cure? Something like this in the hands of someone who isn't very altruistic could have terrible consequences. I'm vaguely reminded of the rich people in /In Time/, that Justin Timberlake movie where time is currency, and everyone just stops physically aging at 25. They just live for centuries and keep a forced monopoly on stored time, enforcing the aristocracy.
