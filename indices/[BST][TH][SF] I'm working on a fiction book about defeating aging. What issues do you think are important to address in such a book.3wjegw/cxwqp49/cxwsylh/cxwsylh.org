Overpopulation solves itself.

Plus as long as human output over a lifetime is more than their input then overpopulation is a non-existence problem at large enough scale, until you reach the energy cap of the universe being consumed obviously.

If you do have a cure for aging, do not wait to "solve" overpopulation so millions and billions can die while you wait for a solution.
