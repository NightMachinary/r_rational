  Be immortal and sterlized if you have fewer than one kid since a year after the announcement of this medicine
#+end_quote

You're creating a division in the world's people. On one side, you have the sterilized immortals. On the other, the fertile mortals. Entire swaths of the planet will resist this sort of thing. Having kids is a fundamental aspect of human society. And offering it to only people who are willing to give up that chance for the rest of their immortal lives won't sit well with people. Although if it's reversible sterilization, (not even sure how that would work, but hey, we cured aging) it may be ok.

  with constant energy from the sun you can break and form bonds as much as you want.

For some things, sure, but not most. We can electrolyse water and such, but we can't spontaneously create whatever matter we need. We can't just pick and choose our bond formation.

  You said let people die until you figure out how to solve a problem that you believe has no solution for, so that's an indefinite problem. I don't want to die because someone listened to your advice and is sitting on immortality for the next three hundred years.

I didn't say it had no solution. I said you need to find one. And, if some immortality cure is found before we have certain things in place, I believe it will ultimately be worse for humanity on the whole. It'll probably be great in the short term, but the long term will need to be accounted for. And I'm not really a fan of just hoping for the best and figuring it out later. By that logic, I suppose I'm sentencing myself to death as well. Oh well.
