  You're creating a division in the world's people. On one side, you have the sterilized immortals. On the other, the fertile mortals. Entire swaths of the planet will resist this sort of thing. Having kids is a fundamental aspect of human society. And offering it to only people who are willing to give up that chance for the rest of their immortal lives won't sit well with people. Although if it's reversible sterilization, (not even sure how that would work, but hey, we cured aging) it may be ok.

Ok, again I genuinely don't see what the issue is here. If people would prefer kids over immortality that's their choice. The only reason I'm suggesting a limit is because of you. As far as I'm concerned immortality should be available for everyone.

Eggs + sperm is equivalent to reversible sterlization.

  For some things, sure, but not most. We can electrolyse water and such, but we can't spontaneously create whatever matter we need. We can't just pick and choose our bond formation.
#+end_quote

For everything important we know how to. Big ones are carbon dioxide to oxygen, water, and recycling human waste into plant digestible (which we can do). Once you've got those down everything else you can do old fashionedly.

#+begin_quote
  I said you need to find one.
#+end_quote

The bane of you as an indefinite pronoun. You said the creator must find a solution to overpopulation prior to releasing immortality.

Needing to find one means that immortality could, under your logic, never be found, out of the fear that the population cannot contain itself and some other nebulous bad thing will happen involving overpopulation. You could never be certain of a "solution" working without releasing the immortality so that basically means it'll never be released, alternatively the "solution" takes millennia to discover and the counterfactual was say 90% of the current population die if immortality was released. Congratulations you've traded 30000 billion human lives for 6.3 billion.

  I believe it will ultimately be worse for humanity on the whole.
#+end_quote

I have no idea on what basis you're making this value judgement so I cannot comment on it.

#+begin_quote
  And I'm not really a fan of just hoping for the best and figuring it out later. By that logic, I suppose I'm sentencing myself to death as well. Oh well.
#+end_quote

This is a very unexpected view from [[/r/rationality]] home of death defeatists.

Any logic which values an indeterminate amount of potential possible deaths over billions of guaranteed is not something that seems reasonable to me.
