  Big ones are carbon dioxide to oxygen, water, and recycling human waste into plant digestible (which we can do)

In regards to recyling human waste, that's simply incorrect. We can't do this in anything even remotely resembling a sufficient manner. You use most of the parts of your food that you can process once you eat it.

  Eggs + sperm is equivalent to reversible sterilization.

It isn't. It really isn't. Your body (barring some disease or trauma) will continue to produce gametes for however long you're young enough to do so. Especially in males. By saving your sperm/eggs and being sterilized, you're putting your future progeny's existence in a cooler. You're trusting that, for your immortal future, the company handling your frozen gametes will never fuck up. As opposed to relying on your body, which is much more reliable. Especially if you don't age.

  You could never be certain of a "solution" working without releasing the immortality so that basically means it'll never be released

Better to have SOME idea of what you're doing than to rush ahead with no plan. Of course you'll never be 100% certain. Doesn't mean you don't try and plan. That's the whole point of being rational.
