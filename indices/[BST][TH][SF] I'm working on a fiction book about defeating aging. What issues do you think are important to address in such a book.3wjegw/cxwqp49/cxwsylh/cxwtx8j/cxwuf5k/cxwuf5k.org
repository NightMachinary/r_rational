  Please explain to me how overpopulation solves itself
#+end_quote

If the population is unsustainable people die until it is sustainable.

  The earth is finite.

We're not locked on the Earth, none the less we are not a Type I civilization, plus even if we stay on Earth you've got that classic quote that the sun delivers more energy to Earth in an hour than we use in a year.

#+begin_quote
  We're heavily reliant on fossil fuels, despite all of the research that proves this may not be the best idea. We don't currently have the technology to create sustainable habitats for humans on other astrological bodies, and we're decades away from such technology (unless something sparks a technological revolution of some sort)

1) There is almost zero economical or personal incentive to do those things. The immediate immortality of all people changes that.

2) We can create inefficient sustainable habitats, enough solar panels can fuel anything. We already know all the theory behind mining such that there's even a few companies already out there. Just because we haven't built such a thing yet doesn't mean we couldn't.

3) Immortality would spark a technological revolution, there's not a larger incentive to develop sustainability or a quicker method of leaving than the surety that you have to suffer the downsides (rather than great great grandchildren). Plus however much output is invested in afterlife based religions which would I presume fall apart in immortality (people are unwilling to kill/delibrately endanger themselves with lifespan to get into afterlife) and other things like the death and health industry which are fueled by aging and aging related problems.
