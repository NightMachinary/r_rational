My initial reaction was a smirk and a shake of the head. "We'lol never get there!"

Next, I realized that THIS REACTION could easily be said about a number of things we now take for granted.

We send invisible messages to each other through the air.

We fly in airplanes around the world.

We sent a man to the moon. It was in the context of a Cold War space race to demonstrate technological superiority.

These feats required an immense infrastructure, the right combination of economic and cultural values and I'm sure there are other common themes.

Pick a historical context for disease and death and research the reactions of the conservatives and progressives of the time to see what issues came up. (A big task -- one that I'm working on for my own Rational story on "Medics and Magics")
