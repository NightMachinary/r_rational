Social -political implications, in particular inequality and social stasis - if the result is that the rich get richer forever, and that the relatively young form a permanent underclass, that would, to put it mildly, be socially destabilizing.

There have been various more- or-less hilarious proposed solutions to this. Periodic jubilees where all debt and all wealth are reset to zero. Every 50th birthday is an individual version of the same thing.

Less drastically, there are ideas like just having asset taxes that on the margin work out to absolute wealth caps - a world with multi-millionaires, but no billionaires, in effect. Â¨

Forcible career changes on a 40 year rota - This might actually turn out to be pretty important just to keep people from ossifying.

overpopulation is actually a mild problem compared to this, because, well frankly, we are pretty good at building food production capacity. But if you get into a situation where most of the population thinks they're going to be servants to the plutocracy for all eternity, the world is going to burn.
