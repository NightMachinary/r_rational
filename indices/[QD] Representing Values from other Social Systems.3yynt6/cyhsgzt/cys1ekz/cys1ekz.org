Seconding Ursula Le Guin, her works are a great read in general but for cultural distinctions I'd really recommend Left Hand of Darkness which manages to include clear distinctions of class, race and gender. If you're up for an example from fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]] by Vathara does a good job of handling the difficulties 4 values distinct cultures face when attempting to interact diplomatically, it also comes with some pretty useful discussion of the real world influences used as author's notes.
