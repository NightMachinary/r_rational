I'm going to have to mull this over, but that's a very interesting point.

You might look for works that don't make these mistakes to "prime the pump".

In the /1632/ universe we get to see 20th century attitudes like these running into 17th century ones, and some of the authors produce scenes like these, and others seem to have thought through what you're talking about and you get entertaining misunderstandings... from both sides.

Glen Cook's "Wiz Biz" series has Wiz Zumwalt slapped down over and over again in the first book where he's expecting people to treat him like a peer and they... well... don't.
