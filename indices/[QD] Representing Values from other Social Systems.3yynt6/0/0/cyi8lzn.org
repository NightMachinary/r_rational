I second this advice. The best way to get a feel of foreign cultures I know of is watching/reading things from foreign cultures.

Anime is often really good for this purpose if you wish to look for more hierarchical society. The whole "Japanese have word for younger/older sibling, but not for sibling in general" thing blowed my mind when I encountered it first. See also: senpai/kouhai. Often when characters in anime behave strangely, it is because we, western watchers, lack the cultural context to understand what happens and why, but it makes perfect sense within the culture of characters.

I also want to complain about US authors. Many, many US authors just don't care about cultural context. I have lost count how many times I encountered fantasy characters horrified by violations of laws and morals of California. Things like legal drinking age being 21, etc. In most fantasy settings legal drinking age doesn't make sense as a concept, for Cthulhu's sake.

The other way to pay more attention to cultural context is learning to notice your own cultural context. Paul Graham wrote an [[http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html][absolutely fantastic essay]] on doing this. I really recommend you to read it.
