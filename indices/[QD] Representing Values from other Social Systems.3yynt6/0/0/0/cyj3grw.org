  I second this advice. The best way to get a feel of foreign cultures I know of is watching/reading things from foreign cultures.

Perhaps something from our past as well?

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2aiobi/i_want_to_write_a_novel_in_medieval_austria_can/civjgv4][This]] great post tries to argue that, even in relatively recent times, the mores were /very/ different and that writing fantasy is superior to historical fiction since, unless you're truly immersed, you'll never really get the culture of even a recent civilization "right". I think the bit about "taking credit for things he didn't actually do but made decisions about" would fit with the above snips the OP posted.

The benefit with going with something older is that it's probably going to be in English. Depending on how popular the work is all of the secondary material and discussions will be in English too. Of course, this is probably true of something like..Greek works.

  In most fantasy settings legal drinking age doesn't make sense as a concept, for Cthulhu's sake.

Partly the audience is to blame I imagine. The audience can tolerate the idea that all sorts of violence and butchery was acceptable, but certain things (rightly or wrongly) tweak their moral noses.
