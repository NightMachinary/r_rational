Go watch some foreign-language television. Watch the stuff that's been subtitled really well and that hasn't made the translation from their culture to our own. There's loads of it on Netflix. Try to find romance, drama, or workplace stuff; I think generally speaking, those will highlight the differences much more.

I just got done watching two shows that I thought really illustrated cultural differences well. "Coffee Prince" is a sort of silly Korean drama about a girl pretending to be a guy at a coffee shop. The Netflix translation is terrible, but in this case that's sort of good because it includes a lot of the concepts that don't translate cleanly. "Atelier" is a Japanese show about a lingerie shop, notable because pretty much all of the relationships in the show are /work/ relationships. Most American workplace comedies are about things other than work, but Atelier seems notable in that it's /driven/ by the workplace and professional/vocational issues, rather than using the workplace as a setting for interpersonal drama.

The easiest way to see cultural assumptions is to go grab some stuff from another culture and see how it compares.
