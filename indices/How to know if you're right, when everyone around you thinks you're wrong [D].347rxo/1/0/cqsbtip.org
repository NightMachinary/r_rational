Very well put. Other than the nebulous "how smart/rational is person X," the two most important factors in determining how seriously I take their views is their expertise on the topic and their motives.

Sometimes it comes off to others as an ad hominem to dismiss arguments for these reasons. While most reasonably intelligent people accept that if they have not studied biology or computers their beliefs on the topics are ill informed, when it comes to political or social or economic issues, everyone has an opinion and few appreciate having their lack of credibility pointed out.

In the ideal world, arguments are judged on their own merits, and who says them is completely immaterial. But when an argument literally /can't/ be judged on its own merits, because we don't possess the necessary, hard to acquire information related to it, or if the ultimate truth of the statement is impossible to verify, or if the justification for the argument relies on a difference of values, then focusing on the person is a useful shortcut for determining how much stock to put in what they say.

  If I'm hanging out with my dad's Persian friends and try to talk about Iran, things get even worse... their subsequent attack won't be an expression of their thoughts on the price controls placed on staple goods, but rather a way of defying the theocracy that plagues the Iranian government.
