In addition, you should avoid having strong beliefs about very complicated systems: social systems, real economies, individual human minds, 'the future of AI', and political policy are all excellent examples.

No matter how much of an expert you are on any of those topics, you do not /grok/ them, and you cannot make dependably accurate predictions about them. If someone else seems to be offering a high degree of confidence about anything like that, they are exaggerating - look for a motive (conscious or unconscious).
