No. If everyone in the room is telling you that you're wrong, you can occasionally be /fairly confident/ that you're right, but you certainly shouldn't be 'assured'.

Maintain the belief that you /could be wrong/. More importantly, learn to hold beliefs with varying levels of confidence - if everyone in the room thinks you're wrong, and you logically 'proven' to yourself that you are not.. you should have some significant doubt, especially if you can't point out a clear reason /why/ everyone would believe that untruth.

Now, to address what I think you're really after.. if you for some reason need to determine your correctness /suddenly/ - immediate consequences, basis for a time-limited decision, etc - then you should find someone willing and able to have a rational discussion about /why/ they hold the opinion they do, and /truly attempt to understand/. This is not an exercise in figuring out 'how they were wrong', you need to be able to imagine circumstances in which you would also believe that thing. If you can't easily/safely discuss the topic.. you're stuck. Treat your belief as non-confident to some degree.

In reality, that doesn't come up much. More often, you are asked to commit socially to an opinion, but there is no real fallout from /not committing/, or from expressing a lack of certainty. Express and maintain that lack of certainty, until you can consult someone who /ought to know better than you/ on the topic (not somebody from your community, or someone who will just agree with you, someone who has specific experience or expertise in the topic in question).

Edit: above all, be aware that humans (even ones who really should know better) are /terrible/ about updating their beliefs. Do /not/ commit to one and pretend you're going to come back and reassess later.

Edit: clarified leading sentence slightly.
