I'd say that you have to understand the arguments of others before you can judge the relative strength of your own position. I have a personal example.

I was a jury boss at one point, for a court case where there were about twenty charges. I (and everyone else on the jury) were convinced that the defendant, who had not even shown up to court, was guilty of all charges, except one.

I was the only jury member who was unconvinced of the most serious charge, the one which had the potential for significant jail time.

There was a bit of irritation towards me, but I short-circuited it by simply asking everyone else to explain to me why they thought like they did. Most of them couldn't articulate reasons. Two could. Between the two of them, they helped me bridge some things together and see things from a perspective that I hadn't considered.

The rest of the group had been right. I had missed a couple critical connections, but only two of the others were able to actually explain their position.
