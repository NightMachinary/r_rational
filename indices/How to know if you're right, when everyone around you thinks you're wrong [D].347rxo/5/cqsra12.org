I think "How to know /whether/ you are right, without resorting to popular consensus" is a better way to put this. (Because we want to actually /be/ right, not prove that our opinion /was/ right)

Not really. If you're thinking in a philosophical sense, you can't ever know. Your methods of calculating truth are just a result of your brain's hardware, and at bottom there's no final justification for any of it other than that's what /you think/. It is analogous to morality in that way.

Practically speaking, it depends. If the question is not philosophical but a complex empirical issue, you go to places like this [[http://scholar.google.com/]] and this [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed]] and so on and take stock of the evidence.
