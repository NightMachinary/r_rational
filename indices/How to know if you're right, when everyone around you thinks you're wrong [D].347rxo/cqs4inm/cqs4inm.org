This sounds worthy and thoughtful, and I wish you the best of luck. There are many places to turn to learn and to find resources about how to disagree and what it means to know you're right when others thing you're wrong. It might be worth checking out [[/r/lesswrong]] (or [[/r/lesswronglounge]] ?), which is a subreddit related to the Less Wrong rationalist community. Other places to check out include the comments section of the blog [[http://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]] which is full of people who are trying to become well-versed in all manner of things.

What you're describing is interesting, and I guess the underlying question here is how much other people's opinions should matter. The problem isn't people disagreeing with you, the problem is being wrong, and there are many correct facts that people agree on. It's also annoying and difficult to have an opinion many people disagree with. Having an unpopular opinion has negative consequences that I'll address later. For now let's focus on being right when people are wrong without losing your ability to adopt people's correct opinions.

*** Being right when people are wrong

So, my usual strategy is to only trust people to be right about certain things. There's a large class of subjects that I expect almost everyone in my life to agree on and be mostly correct about. Examples include basic arithmetic, common-use definitions of American English words, and everyday skill knowledge like cooking, operating consumer electronics and machines at a basic level, writing, reading, and so on. On these things, if I have confusion, I usually bring it up but don't cling to it if most people disagree with me.

In domains where knowledge is specialised or difficult to acquire in an unbiased fashion (politics, automobile repair, organic chemistry, religion, laws of a specific country or city, microelectronics, local geography of suburban town, martial arts or combat training, etc), I do not automatically defer to those around me. Instead, I defer to them on subjects that I judge them to be likely to know about. If I'm in a room full of lawyers from India, and there's a lively discussion happening about the best way to travel between two cities in India, and I have an opinion they disagree with, I'll generally assume I'm wrong and they're right. On the other hand, if we get into a discussion of microelectronics and I have an opinion and they all disagree with it, I see no reason to thing they are right while I am wrong.

My father is a domain expert in real estate, european literature, German, Farsi, and French. If I'm hanging out with him and his real estate agent friends and I have a certain opinion about whether or not it's possible to legally sell a home in a certain way, and they all disagree, I'm almost certainly wrong. We run into an interesting case though if I express an opinion about real estate politics ("we should have more high density housing in SF!") and they disagree. When we run into issues where people have a motivation to have a certain belief, we have to counterbalance expertise with motive. If I'm hanging out with my dad's Persian friends and try to talk about Iran, things get even worse. They may not have motivation about a particular answer, but there will be all kinds of identity politics gumming up the works of discussion. If they all think Rouhani is a swell dude and the clerics need to butt out, and that would help Iran's economy, that's fine. Still, I have to think about the fact that that might be an expression of their distaste for Islamism and not an expression of their thoughts on the best policies for the management of the Iranian state. If I express some disbelief in Rouhani's economic policies, their subsequent attack won't be an expression of their thoughts on the price controls placed on staple goods, but rather a way of defying the theocracy that plagues the Iranian government.

So, if people are disagreeing with you, and you want to factor this into your decision about whether or not to change your opinion, you need to think about why they're disagreeing with you, and how much they know about a subject matter, and whether they have other thoughts on their mind. My roommate hates techy culture, despite being a techy person, because of past experiences with the dark side of Silicon Valley tech norms. An expression of distaste for a hackathon isn't necessarily a swipe against pizza, beer, and crappy code, but could be a swipe against negative past experiences. When the rightist branch of my family expresses distaste for my leftism, that doesn't tell me anything about the truth. My family would be annoyed by leftist thoughts whether or not these thoughts are correct.

Choose which groups you discuss things with carefully. The opposite problem is actually much more common. It's really really easy to notice when you disagree with most people. They'll let you know. If you're wrong, and you disagree with everyone, I am absolutely certain that people will let you know you're wrong. The much more dangerous scenario is being wrong when everyone else is wrong. This isn't something that is easily noticed.

Being right when everyone else (in the room with you) is wrong is unsettling. I don't really know that I've been in a situation where I've felt seriously threatened by disagreeing with people, though. This is probably the largest amount of thought I've put down about what it's like to disagree with people, because for me it's fairly natural. I'm extraordinarily stubborn (and nobody will tell me otherwise! hueheuhue) when it comes to people, but not when it comes to facts. Take your time and learn what you want to learn

So, I've been rambling a lot and probably have gotten off message here. My usual strat is to not tell people I disagree with them! :D
