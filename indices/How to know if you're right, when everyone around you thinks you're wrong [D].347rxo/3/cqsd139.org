Reality can't be bought, it cant be bullied, it cant be reasoned with and it cant be negotiated with. Reality just wants the world to turn.

So find a way for reality to point out the right of way. A test to see if proposition X, yields result Y.

Also get some sort of area of effect weapons like a flame thrower, to keep away mobs of people who want to ignore your arguments and argue pointlessly.
