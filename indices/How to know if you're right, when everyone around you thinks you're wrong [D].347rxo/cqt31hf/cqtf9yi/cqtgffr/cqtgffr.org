Oh, I never said it was simple. Here's some of the problems:

- Police forces are being militarized. They are given weapons and taught to defend themselves with lethal force in a reactionary fashion to perceived threats, rather than trying to de-escalate. Some lady is disagreeing with them in public loudly but non-violently? Pepper spray. Someone walking down the street asserting their right to leave if not being detained? Tasered. Someone checks their cell phone? Shot. Somewhere along the way the police started being taught their lives were more important than ours, rather than they were the few noble volunteers who took the risks the public shouldn't have to. Now instead it's the public on the chopping block of a police force that protects and serves itself.
- Police forces are being immunized. They are exempt from most on-duty crimes and the consequences of their actions, and a large portion of their off-duty crimes too. This is done in the name of team unity, since police have to work together, but it's being done too strongly and there is no longer an adversarial incentive to stay straight and honest and clean. The blue shield insulates everyone on its side of the line.
- Police forces are being privatized. The mayor gets campaign donations from corporations telling him how they would like laws enforced. The mayor passes this down to the police chief, who is has power over because he assigns him. The chief makes this a quota, or a priority, because it's an election season and it looks good for the mayor if they can cut a particular kind of crime. Regardless of if that coincides with the will of the people.
- Police forces are being vilified. There's a deliberate effort to make police forces seem more racist than they are. If 70% of violent crime is committed by blacks (Warning: Hypothetical Premise!) then it is not racist that when cops investigate crimes, they find a 7:3 ratio of black to non-black and end up arresting more blacks than other races.

Combining ALL of these factors makes for one hell of a mess, one that feeds back into itself as police get more accused, more scared, more vilified, more reactionary, stick together tighter, care less about their actual duty, as the "race problem" appears to grow worse, as the top men decide something must be done... and so on around the multidimensional vortex of failure.

We need to hold cops to higher standards than citizens. If a cop can shoot someone they think was reaching for a gun, kill them, be wrong, and not even lose their job, much less go to jail, then a civilian should have more right than that to perform self defense, without facing charges. Now it seems clear that this level of permissiveness in self-defense killings among civilians is unjustified and absurd. So it should be doubly absurd for police, who in addition to being held to higher standards and charged with protecting the lives of even criminals with their own lives, also wear body armor and have advanced training! Cops need to be held accountable, and taught to de-escalate rather than shoot first and get a pat on the back for offing another black guy probably up to no good.

Similarly certain demographics who have issues and attitudes with the police need to understand that those very attitudes, deserved or not, are part of the problem. I understand their concern. If you literally can't trust the police to not shoot you while you walk down your block at night, then you really should be shooting cops to kill or disable. Going to jail is a fair measure better than being killed outright. But that action would require you to actually believe and be justified in believing that the cops are out to kill you. And in some places, they might be able to make that case, but I won't deign to judge what places that might be.

Money has to be kicked out of politics. Corporations have to stop being treated like people. Stockholders should be liable for the actions of companies they own stock in, and when a corporation is found guilty of something, they should feel the sting. Owning stock in a corporation is just like having a share ownership of a poorly socialized pit bull. You're responsible for the people it bites. Bribes to government officials under the guise of campaign donations need to be penalized and prosecuted.

So yes, the issue is complicated, and there's plenty of blame to go around in many directions. Cops want to not die on the job nor be prosecuted for their mistakes in the same way a civilian would be. People in high-crime demographic profiles want to believe they're more than safe from, but protected by the police, innocent until proven guilty, and not guilty until shot dead. Corporations want the high-crime demographic eliminated and legal authority in their hands. And the general public wants accountability and transparency.
