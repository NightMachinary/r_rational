I get that, but when the issue gets complex, it's hard to say. It's not always that simple, especially when there's a lot of data involved.

For example, the riots in Baltimore. I got into a charged argument with my three friends (for reference sake, we're all black people) about it, and its effectiveness. My argument is that I feel this sort of violent outburst only makes those responsible for the injustice (be they the justice system, the police, the government itself) feel justified if there is a racist element to this sort of thing. In addition, I think the number of unarmed black male shootings that have become sensationalized recently are just that; sensational. I'm not saying that it's right, or just, or anything like that. I'm saying when you have a country with over half a million cops, and 300 million people, screw ups are BOUND to occur. And we shouldn't use that as an excuse to go "Fuck the system!!". Does the American justice system have flaws? Hell yes. But I feel like these shootings aren't as systemic as these incidents would have you believe. I think it's an error in judging scope. We know humans have trouble with scale once we surpass a certain number.

In this case, my three friends feel that the shootings are a tragedy, a result of a system steeped in racism. While I'm not arguing to the system being racist/non-racist, I'm arguing to the fact that 5-6 (?) unarmed black male shootings out of the 650 odd people killed in police altercations in 2014, seems to be an acceptable number when you note that there are over ten million arrests made by police every year.

I know that sounds callous, but that's my viewpoint. Needless to say , my friends disagree. And while I feel I have a rational view, I also feel my friends are fairly intelligent (easily on my level, although they don't partake in rationalism) so the 3 on 1 odds made me wonder.

TL;DR: Complex topics make it hard to rationally decipher facts. I feel the Baltimore riots are a result of the recent over-sensationalization of unarmed black male shootings. Said sensationalization occurs due to the anecdotal logical fallacy, in my opinion, vs. there being a real issue. Opinions?
