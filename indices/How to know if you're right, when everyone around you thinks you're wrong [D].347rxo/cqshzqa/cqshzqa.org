You know whether you're right or wrong by the evidence.

So, if someone advances an opinion or several people advance an opinion it doesn't mean much. Whenever you hold a piece of knowledge you should ask yourself "How do I know what I know" (i.e. what evidence is there for it) and "What is the majority consenus of actual experts who have studied the matter?"

The two questions normally go together because experts tend to know things based on evidence.

You don't have to agree with the experts, but you have to agree with the evidence. What studies do they have to support their view, what analysis, what experiences? You should know these about whatever issue so you know how strong the evidence is in favor of whatever view.

A lot of popular culture views aren't amendable to evidence. We should ban gay/ interracial marriage because it will destroy traditional marriage? How do we know it will destroy traditional marriage? How quickly will it destroy traditional marriage? What countries has it successfully destroyed gay marriage in, how unhappy are relationships in that country? Those who advance views like the above don't tend to have a good answer to such questions and so it being a popular view doesn't mean much.

Or for a previous question you asked, how successful is x diet plan. How large was the study used to test its success? How much weight was lost on average? How well did people adhere to the diet? Did they prove their point metabolically?

Stuff like that. If you want to know you're right you have to have numerical answers to questions like that which can reliably predict the future.
