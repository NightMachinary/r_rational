You know you're right if your method works. You know you're wrong if your method doesn't work. If I predict an eclipse tomorrow based on my knowledge, and that eclipse doesn't happen, I'm wrong. If I predict no eclipse tomorrow, and there is one, I'm wrong. If everyone everywhere predicts and eclipse tomorrow and there isn't one, everyone everywhere is wrong.
