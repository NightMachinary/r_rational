  No, you can be fairly (60+%) confident that you are wrong, not right assuming a reasonably homogenous group. Scrutinize and question your beliefs very carefully.

No, because you are assuming a reasonable level of rational introspection and extrospection on the part of the group.

For example, there is no logical proof of the modernly popular abrahamic deity, but if I walk into a church and say "There is no god", the churchgoers will tell me I am wrong and that there is a god, despite an overwhelming lack of evidence to base their opinion about.

A more correct response would be "No, you can be >50% confident that you yourself are wrong, assuming a reasonable homogenous group".
