Sorry, my wording was ambiguous. I meant that you /can occasionally/ be fairly confident under certain circumstances, not that you generally should be confident.

If you can find a clear profit-motive or a social-motive for /asserting/ the believe you are encountering, then it should barely affect your confidence. Standing in a church with an opinion about the presence of a deity would be an obvious example. The polarization of politics in the US makes it actually /hard/ to find a sizable homogenous group without strong social motives for having a huge variety of specific beliefs about social structure and economics.
