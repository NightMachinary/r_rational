  Maintain the belief that you could be wrong. More importantly, learn to hold beliefs with varying levels of confidence - if everyone in the room thinks you're wrong, and you logically 'proven' to yourself that you are not.. you should have some significant doubt, especially if you can't point out a clear reason why everyone would believe that untruth.

Also, formal logic is a very leaky abstraction for dealing with things that aren't ontologically basic (ie: most things), so you should trust apparent empirical evidence over "logical" argumentation. Look at the way the world seems to be, rather than what it sounds like in your head.
