A quote from the light novel:

#+begin_quote
  In all of the light novels out there about reincarnation, the vast majority of them dropped the protagonist amongst the rich and noble, and very few of the remainder place her in abject poverty.

This LN is about the life of the poor. This isn't about Ma√Øne attempting to perform uplift; it's about a precocious five year old living in poverty in a previous (and often romanticized) era, and trying to make the best of her situation.
