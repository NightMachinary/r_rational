I enjoyed the manga; haven't tried the LN yet. But the main character annoys me to some extent.

- As other comments mentioned, she's supposedly a graduate student in a 5-year old's body. She's incredibly immature and short-sighted.

- A bunch of things that are immediately curious to me don't interest her in the slightest. What is this "baptism?" What is religion like here? What is the /world/ like? It's pretty clearly not Earth because of all the weird green and blue hair colors. Isn't she interested at all in how or why she was reincarnated? I realize none of those are her priority, but... it's like Middle Ages time and she's young and sick. It's not like she's kept busy and can't ask questions. I would think boredom, if nothing else, would eventually cause her to seek out answers.

- Her dad is a soldier (and seemingly a guard leader of some sort). What is war like in this world? Besides unsavory looking people and nobles, who do they guard the gate against?

- I think the depictions of how her family is basically working poor in a Middle Ages setting is probably the strongest feature of this work. It's a neat look into how tough life could be. But it still feels romanticized to an extent, mostly because the other characters feel so one-dimensional. Overprotective but kind-hearted dad, patient and caring mom, big sister... all tropes. I imagine their development is second to "look how neat this process of doing something we take for granted is!"

Anyway, thank you for the recommendation. I liked it, and it was a quick read. Any idea how often the manga gets updated?
