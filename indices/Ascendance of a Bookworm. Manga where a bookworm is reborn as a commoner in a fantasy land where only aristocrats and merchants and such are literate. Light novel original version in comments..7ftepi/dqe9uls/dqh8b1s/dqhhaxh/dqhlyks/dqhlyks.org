I did enjoy the Bookworm manga (or at least what's been released so far) a lot more, especially in terms of pacing, dialogue, and characterization. It's just a much more polished experience overall.

But unfortunately, it's the same story and protagonist, which are not particular rational or impressive (as it sounds like you agree).

Still, thanks for posting! If nothing else, was a decently entertaining way to spend an evening :)
