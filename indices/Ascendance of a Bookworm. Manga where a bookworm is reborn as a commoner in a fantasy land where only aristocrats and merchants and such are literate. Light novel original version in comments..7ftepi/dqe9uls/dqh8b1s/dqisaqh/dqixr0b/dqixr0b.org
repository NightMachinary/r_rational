She's not a scientist, but she is a university librarian, who apparently loved reading encyclopedias (as well as other books on psychology, religion, history, geography, education, folklore, mathematics, physics, geology, chemistry, biology, art, fitness, and language), per the prologue. She should certainly be making more technological leaps than introducing paper and shampoo, and she should be showing WAY more initiative with learning about her world. In the LN she's been there for almost two years, and still knows almost NOTHING about the world (she /just/ learned the days of the week!).

She breaks into tears at slight provocations. Small children cause her mild inconveniences, and she starts planning elaborate revenges on them. She has awkward crushes on and gets embarrassed around other small children. Obviously it's a fantasy situation, but I can only think that if I were reincarnated as a kid while keeping my adult mind, I certainly wouldn't think of other /5-year-old children/ as equals, or naturally act even less mature than they do.

We can theorize that the transition to a child's body affected her psychologically, but there's nothing to actually suggest that in the text (it's not like we get to see her acting non-childish in her adult life prior to her reincarnation).

I do agree that Dr Stone goes far into the other direction, but I think it embraces how over the top it is - it isn't shooting for gritty realism. Bookworm /does/ seem to shoot for "realism", which I think makes its flaws all the more jarring, and the dullness of the protagonist that much less impressive.
