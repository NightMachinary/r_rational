  Bookworm does seem to shoot for "realism"

It's a fantasy world with magic.

  She should certainly be making more technological leaps than introducing paper and shampoo, and she should be showing WAY more initiative with learning about her world.

The thing is going slowly enough even as it is. If she would ask around finding all that info she would never grow up to actually get anything done.

She literally can't get anything done herself. How is a 6 year old with almost dead body going to be uplifting anything? :S

I think it's pretty amazing what she has done already. I don't think I could recreate shampoo, for example.

Even if it's not the transition that messes her up, it's probably the frustration with the sickness and the uselessness she feels.

But hey, it's certainly not perfect, but it's way better than the gamer and I'm a bit ashamed to say I'm devouring that. :S
