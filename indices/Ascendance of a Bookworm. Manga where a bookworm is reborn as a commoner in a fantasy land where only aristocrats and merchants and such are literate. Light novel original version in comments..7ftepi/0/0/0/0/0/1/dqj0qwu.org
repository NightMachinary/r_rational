    Bookworm does seem to shoot for "realism"

  It's a fantasy world with magic.

Sure, but fantasy worlds with magic can still shoot for realism. In this case, she's a poor sick girl whose family is focused on keeping food on the table, and fully expected their sick child to die (as was common in the actual historical period the story's loosely based on). I mean, that's a key part of rational/rationalist stories, to create "realistic" fantastical/sci-fi worlds - not in a sense of "this actually exists!", but rather in a sense of "given the premise of XYZ, how would an actual world unfold, and how would a real, intelligent protagonist act/react?"

  The thing is going slowly enough even as it is. If she would ask around finding all that info she would never grow up to actually get anything done.
#+end_quote

The author could easily weave questions about the world into sections where she's just hanging around the house with her sister, cooking/weaving baskets/etc. "The author is bad at story pacing" does not really excuse the protagonist being oblivious and singleminded (in her pursuit of books) to an unbelievable degree.

  But hey, it's certainly not perfect, but it's way better than the gamer and I'm a bit ashamed to say I'm devouring that. :S

Well, I /definitely/ agree with your assessment of The Gamer (had to stop reading that a while back). And I don't think there's anything wrong or shameful about reading and enjoying it (I mean, I did). But for me at least, I can enjoy something and still recognize that it has major flaws.
