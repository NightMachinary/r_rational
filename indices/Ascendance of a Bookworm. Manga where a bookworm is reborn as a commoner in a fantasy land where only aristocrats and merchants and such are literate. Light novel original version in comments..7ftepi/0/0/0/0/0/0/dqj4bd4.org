    Bookworm does seem to shoot for "realism"

Using the word "realism" as in "exactly like the real world" when describing a fantasy world, which by definition has elements that are not present in the real world, would be unlikely.

I think its safe to assume that when talking about "realism" in fantasy works what people really mean is "internally consistent and plausible given how the fictional world works".
