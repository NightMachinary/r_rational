Just finished the LN (at least, what's been translated so far).

*(possible very minor spoilers for both Bookworm and Dr. Stone below)*

--------------

Conceptually it's similar to Dr. Stone (modern day protagonist attempting to recreate technology in a relatively primitive world), but as a story, I like Dr. Stone /way/ more.

The protagonist of Bookworm only cares about technology as a way of acquiring books (and keeping herself alive until then), which is pretty simple-minded and one-dimensional. She's /extremely/ childish and emotional, to the point where I can't actually believe that she's suppose to be a woman in her mid-20s (albeit in a child's body). And her "rational" intelligent application of knowledge/resources isn't actually that impressive - she has problems thinking of modern technologies to attempt to recreate, outside of a few cosmetic/food items, and most of her ideas come to her on a whim instead of through actual planning.

It's a fairly enjoyable read, but IMO not nearly on the same level as Dr. Stone (or other "modern day protagonist in primitive fantasy world" LNs/mangas). It's just OK fiction, and not particularly impressive rational fiction.
