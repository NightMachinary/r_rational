But see, that's just baseless conjecture, there's nothing actually suggesting that in the books.

On the other hand, we /do/ know that Urano still kept her same desires (e.g. obsession with books), her same tastes in food, her same cultural preferences (e.g. using chopsticks), and her same lifestyle preferences (e.g. staying clean), even though they were completely alien to the original Maine and her family. Why would she just get a few selective emotions (like crushing on 5-year-old kids), and nothing else?

Maybe if Urano/Maine started thinking "wow I've been more emotional lately than I was in my past life...am I being influenced by the original Maine? Oh god, how much of me is still me??", or something like that, it would actually explain her immaturity.

Also, her brain biologically (or rather, magically in this case) seems to be her adult brain, not a child brain. As one example, [[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-g-goldberg-phd/memory-test-_b_801102.html][the "digital span" (number of digits one can retain in their short-term memory) of 5-year-olds is ~5]], but Urano/Maine's has been shown to be way more than that. I don't think normal 5-year-old biology can be assumed in a magical scenario like this.
