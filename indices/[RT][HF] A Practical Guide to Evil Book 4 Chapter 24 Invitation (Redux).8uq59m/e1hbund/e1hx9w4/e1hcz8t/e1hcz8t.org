Any sort of agreement with the Dead King would close off a /lot/ of cat's planning, but they seem to be in too dire of straights to not consider the benefits of such an agreement...

I'm curious as to what the Dead king wants. We only know of second hand stories saying he's against /all life/ and such, but what exactly is his life's goal? What has he been doing for the past half millennium that helps with that goal? Was he the Gods Belows' response to the Wandering Bard's meddling?

Exciting times ahead!
