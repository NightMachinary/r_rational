Probably Malicia, since the Tower has a way to contact the Dead King, and the stone was hinted to be a gift from Triumphant.

Also, it may have been the means of /summoning/ him. Remember how, in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/regard/][Regard]], he was waiting for Ranger on the /other/ side of the portal, and she remarked that he could change the place it led to because he owned the entire hell? Ever since one of Akua's interludes mentioned that she had to circumvent the issue of Keter's Due to stay human, I've been thinking that this was the reason Trismegistus transitioned into the Name of the Dead King - to reflect the fundamental change in his nature. Now I think that wasn't the only consequence.

For a villain, undeath is a net loss. Sure, you can make phylacteries and other stuff incompatible with life, but the core purpose of it, escaping the inevitable death by old age, is already achieved by being a villain. As Warlock remarked, undeath makes one less able to change, which is damning in the long run, which makes me wonder: if subjugating a hell had him becoming nonhuman enough to suffer fae-like setbacks in his capacity to learn, just how close is he bound to it?

See, the little detail that made me remind you all that was this little passage from the end of the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/03/07/epilogue-3/][epilogue]]:

  In the depths of a Hell that had long lost its name and number, a monster opened his eyes. In Keter, a stone that was an old and treasured gift shone red. It had not done this since the days of Dread Empress Triumphant.

Now, if Akua's dimension-scrying artifact and Hierarch's Receive are any indication, there's nothing fundamentally impossible for magic and Names in connecting directly to the other dimensions. But why would the lich and the stone be separated if it were a simple communication device? Surely someone as acquainted with the Hells as Triumphant could make a device that could allow direct calls? More importantly, is there any significance in the fact that both times we've seen the Dead King he was in his hell? He's undead, it's not like the poisoned air and the undead armies in Keter would hinder him.

My theory is that claiming a hell and making it lose its name and number bound Trismegistus to it. It's why he needs all those intermediaries in the varying states of decay and sentience: he can't set the foot in the Creation himself. Triumphant, on the other hand, had made her armies out of denizens of Hells; she also probably made some deal with the lich, given how fond he is of her and how nobody mentioned conquering the Kingdom of the Dead as her greatest achievement.

Perhaps they can use the Diabolist as a last-ditch way to keep him in check, or at least to inform them about him: she was planning to rule all of Calernia, after all, she must have had /some/ plan to deal with him. Besides, he's famous for fielding devils and demons too.
