I think the Dead King is also semi-fond of Ranger. I mean, sure she's strong as hell, but it's telling when it seems like he leaves holes in his defenses for her to get through. Maybe since she's a fellow immortal, he enjoys the company.

Also, considering Saint is concentrated desire to kill, and Ranger has made a name for herself murdering powerful beings, this heavily implies that Saint is beneath her notice as she would have made repeated attempts to kill her by this point. I mean, she's done it once or twice, but if the Dead King, Drow and Larat are examples, Ranger would keep trying until they eventually found a way to keep her out for good (Drow) or gave up fighting her off (Larat).
