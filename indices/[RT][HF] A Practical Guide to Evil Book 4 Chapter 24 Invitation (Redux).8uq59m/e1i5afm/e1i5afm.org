I had a strange idea, based on the description of the Princes' Graveyard:

#+begin_quote
  “When historians try to pin down Foundling's methods they point to the Battle of the Camps or the Princes' Graveyard, but those came later. After she'd learned her trade. If you want to understand how she operated, look to the Battle of Four Armies and One -- from the beginning to the end, she was playing an entirely different game from every other commander on the field.”

A graveyard is often metaphorically used to refer to a place where a lot of people have died, but /literally/, it's a place where the dead are /laid to rest/.

An alliance with the Dead King would be playing right into Procer's "Crusade" game, which, as noted in that chapter quote, is not how Cat plays.

But... if it were called the "Black Queen's Graveyard," we'd assume that she was the victor, not the vanquished, so...

What if the Princes are not being killed in their Graveyard, but are the ones performing the "laying to rest?" Right now, the Dead King and his forces are safe in his hell, accessible only through the heart of Procer.

What if Cat is setting it up so that she joins the forces of Good against the Dead King, petitioning to join the Alliance after drawing the King's forces into a vulnerable position?

It seems like much more in line with "playing an entirely different game" than any narrative where she ends up actually /fighting/ the First Prince's Army.
