Well, Black isn't picking up the phone right now, and Cat won't go in blindly a second time. Not when there's even more at stake than in Diabolist's lair.

I do hope they'll at least try to track Warlock down, maybe give him an item to Imbricate/Reflect Catherine's domain, like they did with Hasenbach. They have to know he's still at the pass, waiting for the Witch to blink first.
