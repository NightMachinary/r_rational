There's zero chance she's just gonna make a straight up alliance here without extracting some major leverage. From the very beginning, from that first fight with the Lone Swordsman, to her experience in Winter, her MO has been to use the strength of Named more powerful than her against them. She uses their narrative weight to gain earthly advantage.

The first thing she did after fully taking the mantle of Squire was to let William survive. Knowing that the forces of narrative would ensure a war and deciding it was worth it to get more earthly authority over the Legions. This was how she was able to survive Winter and become the Duchess of Moonless Nights. It is worth noting that being part fae gives Cat more power in narrative; in that breaking an oath will have severe narrative concequences for the offending party.

The Dead King has a LOT of narrative weight for Cat to use to her advantage. If he's calcified in his thinking or bound to the narrative, then Cat is gonna do wonderfully. If he's even nearly as canny as Black or the Pilgrim then Cat might be in big trouble.
