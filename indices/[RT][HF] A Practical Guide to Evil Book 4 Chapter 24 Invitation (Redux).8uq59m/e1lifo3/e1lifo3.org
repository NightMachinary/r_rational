I just ripped through this novel in 4 days with a Text to speech app on my phone, and I honestly have to say it was quite delightful, as always I now sit in the slump of the series know there is no more done but more to come, though honestly it will be difficult to go back to reading about the good guys after this.

This chapter was an interesting place to catch up, my opinion is that the Dead king isn't going to be an enemy, he strikes me as someone more like black than triumphant, except it has taken him eons of loneliness and crusaders to reach the same conclusion, that the heroes always win, and even if he lives as he does now it is no real life.

I feel like he is the only person currently alive that can understand the situation that Cat is now in, an immortal evil and /other/ that doesn't fit into the ranks that the world made for her anymore, her name was basically stripped away by winter and Black's betrayal, it is distinctly likely that the Dead king could engineer a situation in which she receives a new name.

Though my unfounded hope for her rise as a white knight, a knight white with the ice of winter, on the side of evil is also still burning quietly.
