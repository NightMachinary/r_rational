I'll copy what I said on the SB thread.

If you think you might have been affected by this exploit, *go to your account settings immediately* and look at your backup email addresses. If there's anything there you don't recognize, get rid of it right now, and you should be fine. If your own email address is missing, re-add it. It might also be a good idea to change your password, just to be safe.
