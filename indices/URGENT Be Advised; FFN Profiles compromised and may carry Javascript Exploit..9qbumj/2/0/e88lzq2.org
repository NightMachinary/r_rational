Basically, someone found a way to inject a virus of sorts in the profile bios. The virus is JavaScript, aka it runs in your browser when you open the page, and it instantly adds itself to /your/ bio (plus does a few other things). Now the problem is, there's a message inside the virus that suggests it's just someone trying to show off this exploit as a way to tell the admins to fix it. Which if true is the best scenario, but it STILL means that they need to fix it, and apparently FictionPress admins are just sleeping on this. I can confirm their Twitter has said nothing yet.
