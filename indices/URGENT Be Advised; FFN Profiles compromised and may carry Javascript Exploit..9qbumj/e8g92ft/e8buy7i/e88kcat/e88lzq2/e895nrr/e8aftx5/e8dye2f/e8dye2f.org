Just to clarify - access to javascript and the ability to perform actions on your behalf on FFN indicate that it's highly unlikely that the attacker would be able to gain access to your password, since that isn't actually used/accessed by JS during non-authentication tasks.

Worst-case scenario (in terms of potential damage) would involve the attacker sending a copy of your session cookie to a remote drop, in order to imitate anyone they want. However, to foil this, even if you've been affected, all you would need to do is... log out, and log back in again, without viewing the virus a second time.

For authors, there's a higher risk of malicious code automagically deleting all of your stories or something similar, but otherwise, it's best not to overstate the possible risks without cause, so that when larger incidents do happen, people don't underreact to them.
