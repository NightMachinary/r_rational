For some time now I've been recommending using any site other than FFN for publishing. My personal recommendation is [[https://SufficientVelocity.com][SufficientVelocity.com]], although check the TOS if you're going to be posting mature content.

IMO, FFN has the following pros:

- Large readership
- Really detailed and interesting stats about your readership

It has the following cons:

- Non-responsive admins
- It will mangle your text, including:

  - No links allowed.\\
  - No use of the word 'Patreon' allowed
  - No use of the word 'Kickstarter' allowed (I might be wrong about this one)

- You cannot copy/paste from the page, because they have javascript that disables that
- If you disable javascript so that you can copy/paste, you will find that everything is centered
- It is not possible to reply to a review inline, only via PM. This means that:

  - You cannot develop a mutually-interacting community among your readership[1]
  - Future readers cannot see your response to reviews
  - You cannot reply to guest reviews

- Screenplay format is a violation of TOS, which is annoying because screeplay is an excellent format for parody
- You cannot edit reviews that you leave
- You cannot review a given chapter more than once, so if you submit a review and then want to add something, or if you re-read something a year later...too bad!
- The interface for uploading/updating chapters is absolute shite.
- When you update a chapter it does not actually show the changes for an indeterminate period of time.

[1] FFN actually does have a 'community' feature, but it requires taking a positive action to create, then readers have to actively join it, and there's no direct access from the story to the community.
