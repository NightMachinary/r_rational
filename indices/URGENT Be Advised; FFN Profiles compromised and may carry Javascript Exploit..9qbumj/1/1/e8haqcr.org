#+begin_quote
  You cannot copy/paste from the page, because they have javascript that disables that
#+end_quote

It's CSS, not Javascript. You can easily override it by adding =div.nocopy{user-select:text!important;}= to your custom CSS in [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne][Stylus]]. Even without custom CSS, there's nothing stopping you from simply copying text directly from the code of the page (in Chrome, press Ctrl-U).
