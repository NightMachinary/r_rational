AO3 is a great site, and I recommend it. It's a fine publishing platform, probably my #2 choice behind SV.

Actually, now that I think about it, I should look into Royal Road. They have one killer feature for an author, which is that they make it easy to monetize by including Patreon links directly into the chapters for you. I'm not sure about the rest of their functionality, though.
