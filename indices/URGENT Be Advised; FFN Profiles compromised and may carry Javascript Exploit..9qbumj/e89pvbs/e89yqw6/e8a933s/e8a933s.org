Duuude, I love cybersecurity and pentesting stuff (but I've never hacked on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] because they don't do bounties :P)! Thanks for the heads-up. This was a really interesting vulnerability to read about.

Also, apparently the site miiight have a few more errors when it comes to URL parsing. If you do [[https://www.fanfiction.net/?foobar][www.fanfiction.net/?anythinghere]] you get an error, rather than a redirect or 404. Might be them just being lazy; might be something exploitable. Found it by accident; too lazy to check any further, and nothing important (financial or identity-related) on there anyway.
