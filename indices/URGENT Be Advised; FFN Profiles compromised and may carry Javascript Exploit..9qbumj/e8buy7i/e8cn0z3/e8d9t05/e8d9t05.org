Press the "Reader mode" button on SV and it will show you only the story posts without the discussion.

Reading SV in your phone browser works fine -- it's quite mobile friendly. I see zero value add from a specialized app and noticeable downside.

Parsing SV is pretty trivial; I've done it.

If you want offline-readable versions, your browser comes with a "download" button, so the fact that it's not epub or mobi carries no water with me.

Maybe you have some specialized workflow that isn't met, but I stand by my statement: aside from the question of stats, SV is strictly superior to FFN.
