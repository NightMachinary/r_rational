While FFN has limitations and this exploit is bad news, I really don't think a forum like Sufficient Velocity can come close to even approximating the same functionality. The forum format is horrible for writing and reading fanfiction, it comes with a lot of distractions, fragments the content interspersing it with the comments/answers and is hard to parse out. FFN has a smartphone app and there's a complimentary site that compiles EPUB and MOBI files out of a given fanfiction, that's a lot of convenience right there. Archive Of Our Own if anything would be the only alternative that's really even in the same ballpark.
