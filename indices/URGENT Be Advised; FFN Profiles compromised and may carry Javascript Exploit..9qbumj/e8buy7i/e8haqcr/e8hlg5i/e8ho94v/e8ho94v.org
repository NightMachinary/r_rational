  when I turned off JavaScript I was able to copy from the page. I hadn't realized that doing so changed anything about the CSS.

Presumably, the page's CSS is the default "copying allowed", but the site's Javascript changes the CSS to "no copying allowed" when you load the page. However, your browser's custom CSS can change it back to "copying allowed".
