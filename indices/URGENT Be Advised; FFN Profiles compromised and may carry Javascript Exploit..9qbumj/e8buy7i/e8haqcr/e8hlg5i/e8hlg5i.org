Ah, the people of assumption! Thanks for letting me know.

I note that I'm confused, though -- when I turned off JavaScript I was able to copy from the page. I hadn't realized that doing so changed anything about the CSS. Weird.

And yes, I'm aware that I can copy from the source. That's not the point; I shouldn't needed to apply workarounds for such basic functionality, and they shouldn't disable such unless they can do so effectively.
