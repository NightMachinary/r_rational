How much control does rational man with a shotgun have? If you're just sticking him in a match with everyone else, rationality doesn't have much benefit. And shotguns aren't great against enemies that can only be killed by throwing them off of the stage. If he builds the stage beforehand, he can just build it to have a place for him and not his opponent, and his opponent will immediately fall to his doom.
