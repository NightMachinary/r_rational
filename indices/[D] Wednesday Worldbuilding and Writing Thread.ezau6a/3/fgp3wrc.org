I've got a story idea I'm working on a bit at the moment. The general setting is as follows (subject to revision):

- Five different fantasy races, each of which is associated with an element.
- Elves = air, humans = water, orcs = earth, dwarves = metal, goblins = fire
- Each race follows a different god
- Most races stay in the lands their god gave them (elves are mostly gone, humans are traders/fishermen/pirates, dwarves live underground, orcs are farmers & herders on grasslands, goblins live in mountains and forests)
- The dwarves are zealots and expansionist (similar to the way the US military behaves nowadays, especially in the Middle East)
- The gods used to talk to their chosen race, but don't any more, ever since the goblins killed their god and stole the secret of gunpowder from his remains (this is the most original part of the setting, I think?)
- Every race has 'raw' magic based on their element, and there's also magic rituals

The story would follow a goblin as he tries to free his people, but not focus on military matters so much as magic, espionage and diplomacy.

It's inspired by a mixture of Practical Guide to Evil, Codex Alera and the Inheritance cycle. I'm hoping it will turn out more rational than not.

Questions: - Does the setting seem interesting, immediately off-putting, or somewhere in between? - Can someone recommend any good resources on Nato bases in Iraq/Afghanistan, especially from the perspective of the locals? It seems like a good place to start researching. - Can someone recommend good resources on conflicts where one side has primitive gunpowder weapons and the other doesn't? Either land- or sea-based would be useful. - (More for the future) where's a good place to post original webfiction if this ever gets that far? I know fictionpress.net and AO3 are potential options, but a lot of webfiction ends up on wordpress sites and that seems like a bit more hassle than I'd want.
