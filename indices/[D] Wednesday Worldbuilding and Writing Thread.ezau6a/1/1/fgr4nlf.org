Having both skipping and retelling sounds like an unnecessary headache. Could you do it with just skipping? Skipping over a scene because the players have no memory of it is structurally similar to any other roleplaying prompt based on the players having imperfect information. It breaks a rule that's very important in other games (the GM does not ever control the player characters) but that's just explicitly not part of this game's social contract. Force the GM to open with a memory wiped scene, if you really want to hammer it home.

It might be helpful to experiment with the concept in a less serious manner and see what works well and what doesn't work, before building the serious version around that. For example, play some one-off roleplays where you hand the players pre-made cliche fantasy characters, inform them they all got black out drunk last night, and have to piece together what happened. One character soon learns they were challenged the town champion to a duel at noon and (we know everything, but what about the consequences?), one woke up with a glowing crystal skull in their bag (what is this, why do I have it?), one woke up in bed with an ent (it's obvious what happened, but how did we get here?). Which structures are fun to play, which are not?
