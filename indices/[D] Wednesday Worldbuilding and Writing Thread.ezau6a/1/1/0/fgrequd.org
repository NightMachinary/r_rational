Dropping the ability to recover lost memories is a viable option. Thank you for suggesting that.

I just realized a way to solve most of the problems in one swift stroke - Memories can only be erased backwards from the time of erasure (and a little bit forwards from there as well). You cannot selectively remove memories from the past without removing all the memories from then until now.
