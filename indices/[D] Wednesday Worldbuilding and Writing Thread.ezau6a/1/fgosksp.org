I want to make an RPG that includes mechanics for memory erasure (sci fi), but it's really awkward coming up with design pillars.

One big part of the game is asymmetrical knowledge of rules between players and GM, so I can keep a lot of the rules mysterious so as not to allow players to gather undue hints from the rules the GM has to follow. That problem is summarily dealt with.

The most important rule: If the players have experienced it, then their characters remember it. It can't be erased unless the GM has a plan for them to regain that memory soon. However, you can skip over scenes or tell them in a 'retelling' frame. This means that the characters are talking about that scene after it happened, but the players are experiencing that scene for the first time. This also gives the GM freedom to say that they don't recall certain things, or they remembered it wrong.

I have some big problems with this setup though, if you have ideas to solve them, please help.

1. Stories in RPGs can be really hard to write if you're bouncing forward and backward on the timeline. I can somewhat solve this by having a designated set of rules for the 'retelling' frame so that it doesn't bleed into parts of story writing that would be difficult.
2. When the GM skips over something because 'your memory was erased of the event.' The GM has to decide how the players acted during that time. And though that version of themselves was killed and replaced with a rollback, the player might still feel betrayed.
3. In the retelling frame, the scene still has to end the way it actually ended in the past, but the players still have freedom to choose how they acted during that scene. This is a clear incongruity, and I don't think players would like RPing when they know the ending result of the scene.
