If you want a close-to-present tech level, multiple sapient races, magic as a source of power, and the conventions of superheroism all to be present and playing nicely with each other, it's worth spending some time/energy/thought on what purpose each of these serves in your story, and how the interactions among these things will or won't shape the story you want to tell.

Sorry for the vague response, but I don't see how I could say anything more specific than that without a better sense of what your goals are.
