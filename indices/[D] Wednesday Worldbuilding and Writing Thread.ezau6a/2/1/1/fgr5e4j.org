My favorite way to handle racism in a fantasy-modern setting is to follow real world racial lines as close as possible. Racism in the US still targets African Americans, and also the Duergar and Drow. Because races are arbitrary boundaries drawn around groups of ethnicities based on what's convenient for the power structures of the day, and we can underline that by grouping people who aren't even the same species by their skin color.
