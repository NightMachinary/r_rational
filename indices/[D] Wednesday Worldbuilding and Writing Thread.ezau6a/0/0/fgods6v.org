If you consume any fantasy geared towards kids between 10-13 (so, not YA, but not quite kiddie books either), you'll notice something very particular. The protagonists, despite their age and lack of planning, have significant independence and control over their own life. Take ash ketchum as the prototypical example-- he's out, gallivanting across the entire world. But that's not to say the protagonists never deal with adults or other authority figures. But instead of controlling the main character's journey, these characters are invariably less "mom and dad" and more "aunts and uncles." The protagonist always finds a kindly family willing to let them sleep in their barn, or a wise mentor to teach them tips and tricks for the road. Ash ketchum finds brock and misty, and receives guidance from other adults he encounters across his travels.

It's not simply that people are friendly, but that everyone seems to be willing to go a little out of their way to help each other. It's never awkward to talk to strangers because, even if you don't have anything in common, they always seem to think of you like a little cousin or nephew. You don't miss them overmuch when they're gone, since they're not nuclear family, but it's always nice to see them again when you stumble across them a few months later.

That, I think, is the core of what makes Ghibli films ghibli films. Not every character may /like/ the main character, but, potentially excluding major villains, even dislike tends to be of the sort a grumpy old aunt or rivalrous cousin has for you. See /Spirited Away's/ Zeniba, or even sort of the relationship Nausica√§ has with the female antagonist. Everything feels familial, and even life-threatening conflicts can feel cozy and personal.
