What's the key to a cozy, pastoral, slice-of-life setting? My own personal list is a lack of crime, lack of coordination problems, general friendliness of inhabitants, disconnection from the wider world, lots of personalities, traditions, customs, and hyperlocal cultures ... but I'm wondering if I'm missing something.

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions/feedback, it's helped me firm up the genre in my mind.
