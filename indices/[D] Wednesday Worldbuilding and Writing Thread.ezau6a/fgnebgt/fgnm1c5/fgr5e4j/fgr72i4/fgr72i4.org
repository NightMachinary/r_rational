When I first introduced the incredible amount of racism, and blurry moral boundaries to my DND party, they freaked out. There was an evil dictator called "Cantor" who was feared across the land. When confronted by a Tiefling on whether or not they supported him, they said yes. This got them a confused stair, and a lecture on how not all Tieflings are evil.

I built up a few goblins enough to get the group on their side (mostly through the entertainment topic "Goblinball"), and am slowly building up the number of cultural, and thought pattern differences between them and the party. I'm planning on getting them to eventually torture a man to death (with a good enough rationalization that they won't feel bad about it), and side with the goblins when it comes to the dominion of Cantor over the land. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll ever get to this point, as most of the party has lost interest.
