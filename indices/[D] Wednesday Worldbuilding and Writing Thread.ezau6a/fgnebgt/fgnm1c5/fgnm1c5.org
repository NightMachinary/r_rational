I say write down everything you'd expect to see in something like this, then do the opposite:

For instance:

- Follow the +good+ bad guy

- Each country is made up of +a separate race+ many colonies and nations that function as certain racial hot spots, kind of like the Ottoman empire, and most newer countries today. Different countries would clearly have different ratios of races, and different races would have different socioeconomic statuses depending on the country/region they're in.

- There is severe racism against orcs/goblins in humans/elf/dwarf populated areas. This would be false, and in fact although this was the case only a few decades ago, the world has generally been getting better about racial acceptance.

etc.
