I wouldn't say that it's off-putting, but it /does/ seem a little bit ... paint-by-numbers? The first thing to actually get an eyebrow raise from me was goblins killing their god to steal the secrets of gunpowder, in part because it raises some potentially interesting questions, tensions, and conflicts. Of course, a lot of this is just a matter of execution, and I've long been of the opinion that the world doesn't matter that much unless that's going to be the primary showcase: plot, characterization, and prose are going to be the primary drivers of most stories.
