I have this idea for a superhero setting, playing with the idea of the magical superhero (i.e. Doctor Strange). The inhabitants of the world being not just humans, but orcs and elves and goblins, etc. Technology level roughly the same as the modern day.

Only issue is that I don't really have an idea for a proper story. Any ideas or thoughts, story or otherwise?
