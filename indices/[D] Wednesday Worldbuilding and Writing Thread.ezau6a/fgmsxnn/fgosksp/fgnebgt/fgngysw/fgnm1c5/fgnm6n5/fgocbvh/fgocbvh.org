Also, when writing inhuman characters, you should make them actually /not/ human. A common fantasy trope is to make Orcs and Goblins evil/greedy without much thought into their thought processes. And to make elves and dwarfs different enough from each other, and humans, but not so different that differences can't be explained by cultural differences, and bodily makeup.

*EPISTEMIC STATUS: You would do well to ignore all of the below, as it comes primarily from naval-gazing. I have never actually written an inhuman character.*

I'd recommend focusing on the generalized thought processes of each of the species, and get down a list of general guidelines for you to follow when constructing characters. It may be helpful to learn a bit about human phycology, but not necessary.

A sort of cheat could be to imagine each species as a kind of animal given conciousness. For instance, maybe Orcs would think in the same terms as rams. Constantly identifying threats, showing that they are not to be messed with, etc.
