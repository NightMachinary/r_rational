Superhero stories are often (not always) about conflict with supervillains. Where would the Batman be without the Joker? Superman without Lex Luthor? Spiderman without the Green Goblin? (And yes, all of these have other villains they can swap out with - the important point is the conflict, not the specific villain).

A good villain needs to challenge the hero - and /not/ just physically (in fact, often not physically at all. Luthor is never a /physical/ challenge to Superman). He needs to put the hero in a situation where the hero is at the brink - trapped by the limits of his own (powers/moral code/endurance) - and where there is no obvious solution.

Perhaps he has similar powers to the Hero but different ideas on how to use them (Superman vs. General Zod). Perhaps he merely has a different philosophy to the hero - perhaps even a philosophy the hero /agrees/ with (but then pursues some very questionable means to do it - killing the unhappiest people is a /terrible/ way to make people happier).
