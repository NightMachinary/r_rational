Can I ask what you're hoping to accomplish by handling the memory erasure this way? Like, what kinds of scenes are the memory wipes going to happen in/after and how would skipping the scene and coming back later be more enjoyable than playing it the normal way?

Because points #2 and #3 are...pretty much unsolvable, assuming that your players enjoy having control of their characters and their effect on the world. They can be minimized by making any skipped scene as short/inconsequential as possible and/or by limiting how much of the "new" world the players see in between regaining control and the "retelling" of the lost time, so that anything outside of what they see can still be changed by their actions during the "retelling." But no matter what, every time you do a memory wipe, you're violating your players' agency, the only difference is how much you violate it.

Another problem I see is that the way you've laid it out make the memory wipes either inconsequential (because the players experience the scene, so there has to be a plan to regain the memory soon), or inevitable (you can't skip a scene that ends with memory erasure if the players might be able to avoid the memory erasure by their actions in said scene). The inconsequential memory wipes seems like a total waste of time (why bother if it changes nothing?), and the inevitable memory wipes seem like they would take a lot of fun out of the game for your players, because control of their characters and their effect on the world could be taken out of their hands at any moment without anything they can do about it. Neither wastes of time nor inevitably getting screwed are very fun mechanics.

This is not to say that I don't think you can have mechanics involving memory wipes. I think your problems all come back to "The most important rule: If the players have experienced it, then their characters remember it." Trusting that your players can and will keep player knowledge and character knowledge separate is, in my eyes, going to be a much simpler and more fun approach to this mechanic.
