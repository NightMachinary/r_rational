Thank you for clarifying my ideas. Inconsequential or inevitable is going to happen, I guess, but the players don't necessarily know these rules so it's probably fine.

I believe it is okay to have memory wipes that are inevitable in the storytelling, but were a chancy thing from the characters' perspective. They just got unlucky. Although that does require more trust between players and GM.

This isn't a 'D&D combat adventure' RPG. I have mechanics for emotional impact as well, though there isn't magic that messes with emotions directly.

As for reasons why to wipe memory, Rich and powerful people could do memory wipes for completely mundane reasons, like embarrassment or looking bad in front of their crush. Or someone might have 'memory wipe after' written into a contract. Memory sometimes even disappears when you get hit hard, though that's rare (the people in this RPG aren't human.. anymore).
