Judging by [[/r/CozyPlaces]], where it seems the one element of coziness that's more important than soft things, earth tones, and yellow-tinted lights is a window showing either snow or a downpour, it seems like coziness is partly defined by being protected from unpleasant things, distinct from the absence of those things.

I don't think that you need to hole your cozy place up in a bubble in a dystopia, but you need some sort of unpleasantness that you can take a break from. If it's supposed to be an idyllic world, then that has to be something situationally unpleasant, like a loud party that you need a break from. Like you go out of your way to design an overly boisterous parade just so people have an excuse to hide in coffee bars when they're partied out.
