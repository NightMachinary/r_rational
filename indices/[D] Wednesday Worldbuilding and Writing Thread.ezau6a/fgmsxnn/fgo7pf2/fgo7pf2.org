A lot of this comes down to simply having a small population in a remote and geographically-isolated region. Ideally, you'd be looking at a population equal to or less than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number][Dunbar's number]].

Imagine a small town of about 150 people on the Alaskan coastline, or a fishing village on a tiny Hawaiian island. Having a small, isolated community like this means that relationships with one another are very important, and anything that would harm those relationships is not likely to be done, if it's even feasible. For example, theft of most types of property tends to be pointless. If you steal anything, everyone in town is going to hear about it and no one would buy it from you. Food and other consumables might be another matter, but everyone would suspect you if you don't have a job so you can make money legitimately. Your relationships matter, but property, not so much.

To stretch this concept though, you might be able to achieve the same sort of feeling even in an extreme urban context if you had mostly self-sustained and semi-isolated arcologies. Imagine Earth in the year 14,500 A.D. With a global population now measured at about two trillion (assuming 1% population growth per 25 years), power is provided through immense nuclear fusion power plants, and we're using a /ton/ of power for cooling (average air temperature is a scorching 80Â°C), cleaning CO2 scrubbers (since the outside air would be fatal with its 10% CO2 content), and providing power for grow lamps to produce food (since there's no unoccupied land to grow on anymore, even if the temperature would permit it). Everyone has to remain inside largely self-sufficient temperature- and atmosphere-controlled buildings; arcologies.

One of the major challenges with such a large population is that infectious diseases can be absurdly difficult to manage. Viruses occasionally mutate as they spread, but with a population of two trillion, a virus that spreads widely will mutate at an absurdly fast rate and become almost impossible to stop. As a result, many of the UN semi-autonomous administrative zones are under near-permanent quarantine. Every 40 days, arcologies that have gone disease-free for the full duration may allow members in and out as they please. Of course, during these prolonged quarantine periods, people often build good relationships with their fellow arcology members and end up choosing to stay long-term, and many arcologies choose to voluntarily extend their quarantine period if they remain concerned about diseases. Once again, you have a close-knit community in a cozy (albeit cramped) environment where property doesn't matter much, the outside world is blocked off, and relationships are everything.
