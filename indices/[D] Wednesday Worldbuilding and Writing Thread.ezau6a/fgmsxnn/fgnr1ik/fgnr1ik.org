Lack of economic pressure/hardship. Low-work hours required to get by comfortably. For anyone living modestly, part-time jobs are enough and anyone with bigger ambitions is able to make their passion into a viable job.

I'm thinking of My Little Pony as the ideal example of this. In MLP the main characters all get by mostly just doing what they like. They either make their passions into jobs or work part time at other jobs and still have plenty of time leftover. In the early seasons their lives are relatively unhurried and relaxed. In later seasons helping Twilight with various official jobs takes up more of their time, but even then they make time for their other hobbies and interests. In Equestrian overall, various magics make life easier and it seems like ponies are able to achieve self actualization in making their special talents useful.
