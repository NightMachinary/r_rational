Books, people playing games*, helping neighbors out, possibly less atomic socially (or atomism used to create the perfect less atomic situations), nice weather, maybe both things to do at times, and times when there's nothing pressing to do. Perhaps some positive connection to the wider world (like regular trade with a sister city), etc.

*Perhaps ritual conflict, but injuries aren't too serious, and no (really) hard feelings. ("This year our team is finally going to beat their team!" "And if they don't?" "Then we'll congratulate them/all get drunk together afterwards/complain together about the refs and the calls in the game all night long.")
