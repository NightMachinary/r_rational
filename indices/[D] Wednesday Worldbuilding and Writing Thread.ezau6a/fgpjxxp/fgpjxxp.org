After reading Mother Of learning I am playing with the idea of making a game version of a time loop RPG. One thing I want to see better in games like skyrim is the world should change on your actions( not just guard barks) the downside of this is basically requires you lock off content to players based on their choices which is generally a nono effort/money wise. So to make replaying it part of the game would be a good idea.

I am thinking of a world familiar so similar to skyrim or the witcher. Where you can kill monsters, rob people get gear etc. and advance in your player "skills"

So there will be two ways you can bring info into repeats. One, in game spells or skills learned which will give you more options say like teleport.

The second is info the user brings back in their own head. This is where I am asking for help, I have a bunch of ideas but I want to see what world changes in a game world that you expected to see based on your actions.

Eamples: Say you sell a bunch of high quality weapons to a bandit camp this should make the bandits attack people they would not normally not go for. If you kill a Monster the is attacking anyone a road this show allow trade through affecting prices etc.
