Ultimately, Bayes' Theorem is one of many tools or concepts within statistics. It is important, but there isn't anything really that special about it in terms of writing fictional characters. I would suggest figuring out whether you are interested in it because you want to read a story about statistics, or logic, or quantifiable settings, capable characters, realistic cost benefit analyses, etc.

Asking how to write someone that uses Bayes' Theorem is like asking how to write someone that uses the Pythagorean Theorem. I guess I could say that most would do it intuitively, without explicitly naming it or considering it worth mention. If mentioned more explicitly, they might use a notebook and calculator, or a phone.

Also, if someone is going into it without clean numbers, there is a whole lot that has to be done with managing error in approximations. And if you're using crude approximations without managing error then what you're doing is at most a ballpark and at worst a debate technique.
