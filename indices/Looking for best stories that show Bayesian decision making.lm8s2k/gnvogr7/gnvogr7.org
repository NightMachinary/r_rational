I think an important point is that Bayes' Theorem /cannot be used to make a decision/: it describes how to update a probability estimate (from "prior" to "posterior" estimate) based on a new observation, and the probability you estimated of making that observation.

So any use /specifically of Bayes' Theorem/ would basically have to be in a story about scientists doing actual science, which tend to be disappointingly rare - not many readers really enjoy statistics or probability theory in their fiction! So on the assumption that you're after "rationalist characters who [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bkSkRwo9SRYxJMiSY/beautiful-probability][appreciates]] Bayes' Theorem displaying the subjective experience of good decision-making/decision theory"...

That said, it's not hopeless:

- [[https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/beisutsukai]]
- [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/starwink.shtml]]

are all good, and at least reasonably closely related to Bayes' Theorem and practical decision theory.
