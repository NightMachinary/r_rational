Maybe they were more engaged with the story-telling aspect and less with the gaming or role-playing aspect? Stories with vampires have vampire hunters do suboptimal stuff all the time in order to heighten the stakes of make things more even. A story where a team commits arson in daylight and watches as all the vampires die helplessly is a lot less interesting than a pointlessly dangerous nighttime fight.
