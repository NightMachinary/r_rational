I'm so happy that Worth the Candle fanfiction exists now! The writing is spot-on too; it feels like a real chapter of WtC, tabletop misadventures and all. Some of my favorite parts:

#+begin_quote
  “Before this goes any further, I need to tell you something. The Fel Seed incident---”

  “Do you think I'm pretty?” Fenn interrupted.
#+end_quote

No, Fenn, don't interrupt him! The readers are dying to know!

#+begin_quote
  Fenn looked like she had opened her birthday present, and it was bees.
#+end_quote

This is a hilarious turn of phrase.

#+begin_quote
  You deserve to be real, and not just like me because I'm the main character. I want you to be Fenn Greenglass, a thinking person who kind of likes me as much as I kind of like her, not a character in this world I made.”
#+end_quote

D'awww.

#+begin_quote
  I silently vowed to remove this event from any eventual memoirs.
#+end_quote

Well, now we know why this isn't in canon! Besides the fact that Juniper didn't remember any of it, of course.

#+begin_quote
  "... and if this is /at all/ based on Dungeons & Dragons, a candle of invocation will show up at some point. It makes sense narratively, I even said something candle-related once, dramatically too!"

  ...

  "Grak! He won't shut up!"
#+end_quote

The entire candle of invocation rant is excellent. It's everything I hoped it would be and more.
