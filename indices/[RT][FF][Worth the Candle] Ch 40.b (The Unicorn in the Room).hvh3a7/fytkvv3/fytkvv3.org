  “I'll make sure to let you fuck up next time, Reimer. Felicia, technically it was an asteroid, and it happened because the party ignored five prophecies, eight NPCs and about four hundred hints,” I said. “It was supposed to be a cautionary tale about avoiding the main quest for too long, not a sign to start rushing every event without preparation.”

God, I still remember when I ran my first World of Darkness campaign... I tried to ease everyone into it, very simple story about vampire arriving at a small town and slowly taking over. When the party finally wised up and went to prepare to fight vampires, someone rolled a dramatic success when talking to a local gun dealer and got access to a backroom full of high powered weaponry.

Very useful against the human servants, not so much against the vampires, who not a single person decided to use wooden stakes or crossbows against despite me making them clearly available and present.

Cue everyone complaining about how hard the combat was. After storming the head vampire's manor. During the second session.

At night.
