Ok the way the relationship is treated... kinda SoD breaking at this point. Polyamory is messy and difficult, with trust issues and insecurities all over everything, all the time, especially at the beginning of the relationship. Just kinda skipping it with not even a concern of cheating (which that's what that was a few chapters ago) and no discussing anything? and everyone's just ok with the new status quo. Did someone eat a few rotten blues and the author just forgot to include that detail?
