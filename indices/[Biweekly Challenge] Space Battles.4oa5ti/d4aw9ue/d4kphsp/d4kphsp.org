Hopefully constructive criticism:

I found the voice of the character jarring. He at times spoke like an old, ignorant Philly guy, but then in the same sentence he'd sound like a boy in his late teens or very early twenties who spends most of his time on the internet or speaks internet jargon in-person. For example: sentence fragments beginning with "so," use of "I guess" when not actually guessing, other filler words like "like" and "kinda," overuse of "oh" and "[yeah]," the phrase "here's the thing," etc.

To fix it, watch a video of a person from your character's target demographic and mimic their voice verbally. Then talk aloud as you're writing.
