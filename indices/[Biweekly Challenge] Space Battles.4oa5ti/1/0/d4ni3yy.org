I understood this was a sort of e-sport, but played with a trident in an arena. I wasn't able to imagine how the hologram looked though, or what a "unit" really is. A spaceship?

Furthermore, the discussion in the end about things that are dangerous, magnetic tethers and magnets in the gloves makes no sense. I have no idea what any of these might be used for. It seems to set up mechanisms that will be explained in the future, but the story then ends.

Don't take this badly, I write this because I'm hoping for clarifications. You have a nice writing style :)
