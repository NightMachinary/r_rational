The vagueness was intentional, but perhaps ill-considered if it hindered your imagination. I imagined somewhat triangle-shaped three dimensional motes of blue. Could spaceships, but didn't want to restrict more fanciful imaginings. The augmented reality could display any number of scenes and still represent the movements of blue blobs. The hologram I imagined as a blue sphere, somewhere between a meter and two meters in diameter. I didn't realize this when writing it, but I think I drew subconscious inspiration from blitzball's sphere and minimap when visualizing the hologram and the units, respectively.

The end banter is just work-place banter. They're both professionals who make their living at a sport that should have no danger, but does in order to make the stakes higher. The neophyte recommends a magnetic tether gun, as it would be exciting to see someone who falls off the platform shoot it in order to save their lives. The veteran already solved the problem to her own satisfaction by emplacing magnets in the backs of her suit's gloves in order to stabilize herself should she misstep, as she does in the end.

I appreciate the feedback! Thank you.

I think I could fix all the things you mention with just a few added lines. I'm not sure if that's against the rules, though. I'll just update the master copy, unless I receive word it's okay to edit - which I just got. Thanks again!
