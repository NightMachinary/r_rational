Tbh, I just sort of picked Philadelphia as a home city. I've never even been there, lol. The most I know about Philly is what the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air has taught me.

I just kind of needed him to have a home city. I wasn't really intending for him to sound like an old Philly guy. Which makes me curious, what sentences sounded like "an old Philly guy"?
