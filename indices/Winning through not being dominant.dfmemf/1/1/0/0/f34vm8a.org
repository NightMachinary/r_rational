Eleanor was already well aware that Nick would resent her when she rejected Rachel from the family the first time; that much has already been priced in. Rachel's persuasive method is more carrot and less stick.

If the "stick" side of the equation has changed at all, it would mostly be based on changing Eleanor's belief from "I'm doing this for Nick's own good, Rachel is a bad woman and one day he'll see that, meet someone who's better for him, and forgive me for rejecting Rachel" to realizing, "Rachel is the real deal; she's willing to place Nick's honor and family above her own interests and she's got the wit and gumption to back it up, Nick is actually unlikely to find another woman like her."
