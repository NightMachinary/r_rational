This example is complex...but there are simpler ones.

The simpler version is to just appear polite and pleasant when others in authority are around while maneuvering your opponent into over-the-top bullying (in front of an audience). Arrange to be the "good guy" and make it look like your opponent is kicking a puppy.

And I know some people IRL who's passive aggressiveness had those around them living in fear.
