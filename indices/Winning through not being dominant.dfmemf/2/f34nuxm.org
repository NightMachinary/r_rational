I'm attempting to write a ratfic around Miraculous Ladybug right now, and it starts with a victory through surrender:

Hawkmoth, canonically the villain, has been trying to steal the mcguffins of the teenage heroes Ladybug and Chat Noir for years. Unbeknownst to everyone, he needs them to save his wife, who is comatose and dying. He has had a growing suspicion that his son is Chat Noir. He surrenders in chapter one. No powers any more, no minions (???), and a serious offer to go to jail for his crimes.

He does, however, paint a heart wrenching picture of how he would do anything for his tragically dying wife, and begs the heroes to spare his son.

There is no way Chat Noir would ever betray Ladybug and ally himself with Hawkmoth, and Hawkmoth has repeatedly failed to take the McGuffins by force. So Hawkmoth doesn't ask for an alliance, or the McGuffins. But to save his dying mom, and if he thinks it's his own idea and he has Ladybug's approval....
