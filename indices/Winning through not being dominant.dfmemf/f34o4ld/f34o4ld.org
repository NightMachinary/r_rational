It's important to note that while Crazy Rich Asians is set in Singapore, the culture (and people) it depicts are Chinese. (The protagonist is a first-generation Chinese-American immigrant, and her boyfriend's family moved from Beijing to Singapore one generation ago.)

As a story about Chinese people, Crazy Rich Asians is deeply concerned with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(sociological_concept)#Chinese_%E8%87%89%E9%9D%A2_and_%E9%9D%A2%E5%AD%90][the sociological concept of "face"]] (as in, "saving face"), which is something that is omnipresent in social interaction in China (and many other eastern cultures). Of course, it's something that comes up in western culture as well, an example being the idea of giving someone "an out," and why certain people are often "asked to resign" rather than being fired: it gives the illusion that they were a voluntary participant in the process (and thus had some agency in the process), rather than being kicked out against their will.

As an example of "face" and "offering an out" from western media, this famous scene from Game of Thrones:

*Tywin*: The king is tired. See him to his chambers.

*Joffrey*: I'm not tired.

*Cersei*: We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.

*Tywin*: Grandmaester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.

*Joffrey*: I'm NOT TIRED!

When Tywin says, "the king is tired, see him to his chambers," the subtext is, "Although Joffrey is king, I am the one who is truly in control of this situation. I could demand that he be removed from this chamber, but that would ruin the illusion of power we've created for Joffrey. Let us weave a fake story about why Joffrey is being removed from this room so that we may continue to pretend that Joffrey is the one in power, even though I am the one in control."

It would be humiliating for Joffrey to be escorted out forcefully, so saying "the king is tired" is a way for Joffrey to "save face." When Joffrey says, "I'm not tired," he's mistaking his figurehead status for real power. And, in attempting to seize on to real power, Joffrey loses what little dignity he had remaining.

But that's a little bit different from what you are asking for, because here, Tywin is only giving up the /appearance/ of power (an offer which Joffrey refuses); he's not actually prostrating himself before the child king.

The Ender's Shadow series is full of lovely little stories about power dynamics, and much of the story is set in various locales throughout Asia (including China, India, and Thailand). In the second book in the series (Shadow of the Hegemon), our protagonist Bean and his former (and now present) colleague Suriyawong are tasked with training an elite group of soldiers. Certain figures begin conspiring against Bean, and after Bean survives an attempt on his life, the following scene happens:

Bean strode forward and spoke in his not-bad Thai. “Sir,” he said, “I believe Suriyawong and I are safer here with these loyal troops than we would be anywhere else in Bangkok.”

The Prime Minister looked at the soldiers standing, fully armed, at attention. “So someone has a private army right in the middle of this base,” he said.

“I did not make my meaning clear,” said Bean. “These soldiers are absolutely loyal to you. They are yours to command, because you are Thailand at this moment, sir.”

The Prime Minister bowed, very slightly, and turned to the soldiers. “Then I order you to arrest this foreigner.”

Immediately Bean's arms were gripped by the soldiers nearest to him, as another soldier patted him down for weapons.

Suriyawong's eyes widened, but he gave no other sign of surprise.

The Prime Minister smiled. “You may release him now,” he said. “The Chakri warned me, before he took his voluntary leave of absence, that these soldiers had been corrupted and were no longer loyal to Thailand. I see now that he was misinformed.

In this case, Bean "wins" the moment that his soldiers demonstrate their loyalty to the PM, to the point that they're willing to arrest Bean: it proves to the PM that Bean (and his soldiers) are loyal to Thailand, and that Bean's political rival was spreading lies about Bean's divided loyalties. Also, in another round of "saving face," the PM refers to the Chakri taking a "voluntary leave of absence." As you might surmise, this leave of absence was not exactly "voluntary."
