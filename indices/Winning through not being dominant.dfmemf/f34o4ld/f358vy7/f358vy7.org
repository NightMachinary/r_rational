The broader point notwithstanding, I recently learned that nightshade is the basis of the anticholinergic drug atropine, and would most certainly not make Joffrey sleepy or sedate. In fact, it'd make him anxious and irritable. Along with a whole host of other mostly unpleasant effects. Happily for Sansa, it might also make it difficult to get an erection.

Other than that, the drug would basically make him an even bigger asshole than he already is, doubly so because he'd feel terrible. I think that's kinda funny.
