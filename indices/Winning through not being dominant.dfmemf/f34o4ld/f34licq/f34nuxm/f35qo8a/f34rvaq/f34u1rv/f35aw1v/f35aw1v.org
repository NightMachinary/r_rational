A very interesting new story you might like is on RoyalRoad called He Who Fights with Monsters. I don't think I'd quite describe it as super rational, but it is more so than most stories and the dialogue is very witty and the MC is smart and socially savvy (or at least aware). He can certainly be very strategic and polite to enemies as you mentioned.
