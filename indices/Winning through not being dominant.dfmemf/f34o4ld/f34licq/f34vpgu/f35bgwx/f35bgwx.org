There was a Spider-man comic, iirc, where the Green Goblin provoked Peter into following him to his office and beating him up there - surrounded by security cameras. Similar idea.

It's more of manipulating everyone else, though, rather than the more complex form of actually manipulating the person you're submitting to.

I suppose gaslighting can be a dark form of it, depending on how subtle vs aggressive the perpetrator is.
