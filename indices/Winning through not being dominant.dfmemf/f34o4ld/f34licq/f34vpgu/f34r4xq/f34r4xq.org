It makes more sense given the full context of the story. (Spoilers, basically explaining the entire social dynamic that drives the plot of Crazy Rich Asians):

For one thing, if the mother (Eleanor) decided to get rid of the protagonist (Rachel) as you describe, it would not be a "win" for her: she and the entire family would have egg on their face for even /allowing/ Rachel to get close to the family. More importantly, Eleanor's son (Nick) would likely resent her for the rest of his life: Nick already made it clear that he was willing to leave the family dynasty behind to be with Rachel in America, and if Rachel breaks up with Nick and leaves the country, there's a good chance that he will conclude, "Oh, my mother forced the love of my life to leave me." (Even though this conclusion would be wrong, it would be the most likely conclusion for him to draw.)

So, there are significant downsides to getting rid of Rachel: Eleanor's entire motivation is to keep the family together and respectable, and she wants her golden boy Nick back in the fold: a lifetime of stewing resentment from Nick would be a deep and heavy cost to pay in order to preserve the family honor.

Now, consider the value proposition that Rachel lays out: by voluntarily leaving the country, Rachel allows the family to keep their honor. She says, in effect, "I'm willing to allow the love of my life to marry another woman so that he (and his family) can keep their honor." This is a critical piece of the puzzle, because throughout the entire film, Eleanor's main concern is that Rachel is a social climber or a gold digger who is trying to connive her way into the family's riches (or, equally bad, a naive girl who would value Nick's love over the Young family's honor). When Rachel says, "I value the honor of your family above the life that I could have together with Nick," she demonstrates that /she has the exact same value system as Eleanor/: Rachel is willing to make personal sacrifices to preserve the honor of the Young family. (And on top of all that, not only does she value preserving the honor of the Young family, she's demonstrating that she's savvy enough to know how to do it, as she has many times throughout the film.) That is exactly what Eleanor would want from a daughter-in-law!

Also, there is also the fact that it's been made clear many times throughout the movie that if Rachel wanted to, she could say, "I'll disappear if you write me a big check." The fact that she's not asking for money here should assuage any fears Eleanor might have had that Rachel is looking for a payday.

Now, Rachel's position is still fraught: she is from a "lesser" family, and her legacy is not one that will improve the lot of the Young family. All that Rachel has demonstrated is that she has the values (and is willing to make the sacrifices) that are demanded of the Young family. However, all of this is also largely true of Eleanor: Eleanor herself married into the Young family, and throughout the film we see scenes of Eleanor judging and appraising Rachel, perhaps seeing a younger version of herself, and hoping that Rachel is not as naive as she appears to be.

So, when Rachel says to Eleanor, "fine, I'll go back to American and never bother your family ever again," she's really giving Eleanor two options: you can either let me leave and spend the rest of your life with a son who resents you, or you can let me into the family and I'll be the daughter-in-law of your dreams: someone who values upholding the family honor above all else, someone who's willing to do whatever it takes to uphold that honor, and someone who has the guile to do it.
