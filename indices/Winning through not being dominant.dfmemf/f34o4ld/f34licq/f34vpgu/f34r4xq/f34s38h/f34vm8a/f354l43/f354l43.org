Nice comment, but don't forget an additional factor: Nick proposed /after/ the initial rejection, and with the offer of simply walking away from his family, and Rachel turned him down. Rachel had thus unequivocally held the power; she could have said yes and wrecked all his mother's hopes right there. By not doing so, she placed his mother much more firmly in her debt.
