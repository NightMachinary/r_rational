  as Bashir really didn't care how the story ended as long as everyone lived long enough to sort out the holosuite malfunction.

That's not really winning through not being dominant, that's winning through letting the clock run down. All Bashir had to do was keep all the relevant characters alive until the rest of the crew of DS9 could interface the station's computer with the /Defiant/'s transporters. He never submitted to the Sisko villain, but rather pretended to have been swayed to the villain's side.
