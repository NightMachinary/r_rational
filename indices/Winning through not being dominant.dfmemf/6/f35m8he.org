The best IRL example I can think of of this is the Enigma cypher, where the Allies let certain Axis attacks (that they knew about and could have avoided) happen to keep the Axis believing that Enigma was secure.

The best fictional example would be the ST:DS9 episode "Our Man Bashir" which ends with Bashir letting the supervillain enact his plan to destroy the world, as Bashir really didn't care how the story ended as long as everyone lived long enough to sort out the holosuite malfunction.

All in all, though, this seems to fall into the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin][I Let You Win]] / [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureGambit][Failure Gambit]] tropes (and the Crazy Rich Asians example is even mentioned in the former).
