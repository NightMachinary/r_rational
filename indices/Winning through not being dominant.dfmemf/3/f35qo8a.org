A not-so-serious example in the sitcom Brooklyn 99. In season 3, episode 19, Charles Boyle (who avoids confrontations and lacks self confidence) offers to host a colleague, Pimento, at his home after said colleague have been thrown out of his apartment. Pimento is a horrible house guest and shows no signs of planning to leave soon, and Boyle is too meek to confront him about it.

His (extremely assertive) colleague Gina tries to push him to be more dominant, "alpha", and confront Pimento, while Boyle insist he is a "beta", and that "alpha" Pimento will take mercy on him if he's subservient enough. Boyle tries to confront Pimento and fails several times, until his failures spur Gina to confront Pimento on his behalf. She is successful, and gloats about solving problems by being an alpha. Boyle in return asks whether he didn't win by being a beta, acting so weak that Gina as an alpha took mercy on him and intervened.
