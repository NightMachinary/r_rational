I'd love to encounter more of these. Much of Urban Fantasy and Progression Fantasy features weird epic dominance contests where the main character and an antagonist posture at each other. At this point I'd love to see more stories where the hero is strategic and polite.

There might be a scene sort of like that in Daughter of the Empire by Feist and Wurtz? I read it a long time ago.
