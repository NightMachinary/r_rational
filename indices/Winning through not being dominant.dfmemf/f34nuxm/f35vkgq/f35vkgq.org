That seems like it's less victory through surrender and more like victory through allying with people who have common goals. Obviously the heroes would want to save his tragically dying wife, and he was an idiot for not thinking of asking them for help in canon. Though I suppose that's risky, since it's difficult to ask for help without revealing who he is.
