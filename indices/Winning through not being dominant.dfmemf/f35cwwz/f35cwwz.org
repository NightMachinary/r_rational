From the top of my head, when people say some offhand comment about you that sounds bad, if you try to fight it or prove them wrong you'll look bad and the comment will appear to others as true. If you pretend you didn't hear it and ask them to repeat it, they'll sound like an asshole instead.. So they'll generally just let it go.

It's a good way of handling assholes, either they make themselves look bad or they take away their offensive comment, either way you win.
