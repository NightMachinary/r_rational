Well, the point of this kind of manipulation is still to ultimately win, in the sense that you achieve your goals, isn't it?

However, your paraphrase has altered an important point. You phrased it as "give me...or else," a demand for dominance. Rachel, on the other hand, was /already choosing/ the "or else". She just turned up to announce that she was leaving - "You win, because I let you" - and the ball was in the other court. Thus her ultimate victory is the more compelling, because her future mother-in-law had to actively intervene to reverse her decision.
