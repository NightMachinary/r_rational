So far it's not very rational, what with the whole laid back attitude of the people who have things happen to them, I think it's not a good idea to change character perspectives often and to have minimum insight in each character's thoughts.

Also if I am reading this right [[#s][Spoilers]] that whole situations feels off somehow.

Some of the chapters don't have next chapter links.
