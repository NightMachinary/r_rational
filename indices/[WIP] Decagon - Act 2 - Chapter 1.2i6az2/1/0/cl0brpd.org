A character is killed off in a particularly gruesome manner and left to be found just to offend or insult someone, or to cause someone serious anguish. The usual victims are those [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget][who matter to the hero]] , specifically [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners][best buddies]] , love interests, and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick][sidekicks]] . In some cases, the doomed character may be killed by natural forces or by a character who doesn't have the intent to cause someone else angst -- in this case, the intent comes from the writer, who wants to rouse strong emotions in another character.
