That's certainly a lot of critique, and I thank you for putting the time into saying this. I'm not sure how much of that to take with a grain of salt, because you haven't read the other eight chapters, but I'm definitely seeing your point about maybe re-writing it. Truthfully, I was beginning to feel like I wasn't doing this properly. I will very probably end up re-writing what I have so far.

Also, I love that you like Carl so much.

As far as her being nine inside goes: I was trying to get at her being kind of playful, and always being in a kind of "play-time" mindset. I think it would have worked, but I have her stuck in the "acting like a queen" mode more than any other mode, so it makes her seem less playful.

Finally: Shit, you're right, I can't believe I told so much. Again, probably going to re-write this, maybe with different characters. I'm too stuck in the wrong mind-set right now.

Edit: This is my first attempt at rational fiction, and I think my main issue is that I'm doing this the same way I normally write non-rational fiction. I just jumped straight into it without planning too much. When I re-write this, I'm definitely going to put in a lot of time planning before I ever set fingers to keyboard.
