Plan your situation, your world, and your characters - but /not/ their actions. Then role play!

Near as I can tell, fantasy is about the narrative: causality, consistency, and common sense are sacrificed on that alter. Science fiction is about /consequences/, so the only way to tell a particular story is to set up a particular world so that the exploration of it's consequences tell that story.

As far as nine-inside goes... keep it, but keep it to yourself. It seems like it really helps you write the character, but until you find a say to /show/ it, there's no need to say anything. That terrible movie I Am Number 9 illustrates this really well: How much better of a movie is it if you completely strip out that exposition chunk with the cheesy names? Or the first of the latest Transformer movies: How /awesome/ were they - up until Optimis Prime started talking?
