Ok, the /other/ chapters...

- There's mystery and the viewpoint character recognizes this and /actively dismisses it/.

- She says she hates the headphones, and then she's putting on her headphones? You implied they were going to her locker to get something to alleviate the need of or hatred for her headphones.

- /Programming does not work that way/. The difficultly of your problem does not go down, what, three orders of magnitude? In one sitting? And he doesn't even test it! And what did he do in class if he /didn't/ implement it? Implementation is the hard part! And he's, what, flummoxed? by his own sudden genius? Where's the joy, the eureka, the elation? I'd expect a mix of emotions - happy ones at the surprising success, worried ones at first his locker mate and now his genius...

- Read about this trope: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge][Stuffed Into The Fridge]]... and stop doing it. You have characters that exist merely as targets for the characterization of the main characters. Charity graduates from this, but not in a way that makes sense. Everybody should be able to exist out side of the situation you needed them for.

I'm actually going to stop here. I think I'm picking up on the common aspect of the things I'm critiquing, and I think I can name the causal root - In most chapters, you've already decided what you want to happen, how you want the characters to respond, and what you want to have changed in the world when you're done. You're not always letting what happens arise organically out of the situation and characters you've created; you're forcing it. And thus, characters do things that don't make sense - like sticking around your rapist.

That all said, I do want to a) congratulate you on writing stuff and putting it out there! Holy shit! And then b) compel you to remember that /you are actually writing stuff and putting it out there/. I'm just the jackass with opinions on the internet - you're the /writer/. Seriously, that's awesome.

So finally, my amateur recommendation is to do.... nothing different. Seriously! Keep going and only look back a little bit. Explore what happens when you try this or that, and it doesn't matter if something's bad or doesn't work as long as you're paying attention and noticing what happens as you play around.

I spin fire (as in Burning Man) and I sometimes teach people how to do it. There are two things you always "teach" early on: Hitting yourself and the "ground stall" (aka, dropping it). You do this so they directly experience what happens when you make a mistake and realize... it's not bad at all.

So, keep going! Make mistakes. Make successes. Then, in a couple months, come back, re-read it, and you'll /really/ be able to learn from /both/.
