1. I can't necessarily stop changing character perspectives now, unless I begin holding to one character's perspective for a longer period of time, which is a possibility. Edit: Also, I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at. The fact that these powers exist was revealed two days after people first began to develop them. The most noticeable events people went through happened the night before it was revealed.
