You're unlikely to find a "pure" rational manga, but you can find several manga that have characters and societies that act mostly rational in response to a situation, while still having common genre tropes like a hotheaded protagonist or emotionally-driven powers.

/Attack on Titan/ could be considered one example of this. The characters are more driven than would be rational (especially Eren, the main protagonist), but the setting is pretty consistent, and the military chain of command of the scouts is pretty ruthlessly rational in tackling challenges rational and not as is most of the supporting cast within that group.

However, it is a "soft" SF (pseudo-magical) setting, not a "hard" one where the physics all work exactly the same as our world, if that's one of your requirements for being "rational." The 3D mobility gear is pretty physics defying, and titan abilities (/existences) are semi-handwaved / semi-justified.
