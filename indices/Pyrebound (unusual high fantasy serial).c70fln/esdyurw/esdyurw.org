My, my. Technically well written, no glaring grammar mistakes, good world building, and understandable characters!

Plus the characters act reasonably with realistic motivations. They're not wish fulfillingly clever nor are they dumb bricks for plot convenience.

That's really all that I can ask for in a rational fiction so thanks for this post! I'm on 3.2 right now and I have enjoyed the story so far. I'll be following it now.

I love the setting with the Mesopotamian influence and naming. I really appreciate when authors decide to use naming that goes beyond boring, overdone English names in Western Fantasy and actually dip into to countless other cultures that exist.
