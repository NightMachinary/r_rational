I start by looking at the list of available phonemes in the language of the real-world culture I'm trying to root the society in, and go from there. Some of my names are weird inside jokes to myself (all four non-human races' names in PB are derived somehow from relevant Sumerian or Babylonian mythological figures), but for the most part I slap together legal sounds until I get something I like.
