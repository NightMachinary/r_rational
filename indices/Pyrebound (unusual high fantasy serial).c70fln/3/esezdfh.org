Spoilers ahead, I can't seem to get the tags working on mobile.

It seems fairly clear to me that Ram himself was chosen by a spirit, rather than his sword.

I wonder if he's the first of his kind.

Also, I really want to see his "girlfriend" find out about the rumors he's spreading. My bet is she'd show him off as her boy toy to get back at him.

So far it's excellently well written, and would absolutely be welcomed here if you posted whenever you dropped a new chapter.
