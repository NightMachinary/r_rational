I know i'm super late to the game, but be aware of the difference between rational fiction and rationlist fiction.

The first is about consistency, characters (good and bad) not acting as morons just to forward the plot (if they aren't generally morons), worlds that take actions and give realistic consequences...etc. Which sounds be what you are talking about above.

Rationalist is more focused towards talking about modes of thinking, techniques for applying rationality...etc in addition to the rules listed above. Which seems to be what you are worried about in this comment.

So it sounds like a good fit to me.
