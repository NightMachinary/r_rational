If the world is not familiar to us, exposition (underlying exploration) is mandatory. Knowing how the world works make readers understand whether the characters make correct decisions, or ultimately, go the right way to solve problem. I'd love to quote Sanderson about magic & problem solving, but change magic to world, world & problem solving.
