I guess it would have been sensible to specify how/to what extent it could be considered ratfic, huh? The whole human civilization in this story is organized around the use of magic to survive a catastrophic event that recurs every four days; all the society's institutions and culture are rooted in the ways they've had to adapt to this central problem. I have tried to work through the implications pretty exhaustively; however, they do not take center stage in the novel because it would feel mildly ridiculous to have Ram stop and think at length about aspects of life that are as basic to him as democracy or corporations are to us. Ram's problems are ultimately rooted in the deficiencies of a society shaped by brutal necessity, and I try to explore that, along with the many different ways you can acquire power in such a society, and what it does to you.
