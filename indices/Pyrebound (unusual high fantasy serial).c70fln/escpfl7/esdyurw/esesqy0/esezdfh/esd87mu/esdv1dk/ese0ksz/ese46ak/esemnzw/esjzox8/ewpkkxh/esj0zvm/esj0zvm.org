Pretty exciting so far, looking forward to the next update. One thing I'm still kinda confused on and not sure whether it'll be clarified later or I just missed a detail:

You have tetrants as 4-day weeks, blooms as years, and kindlings as decades, but there's also a mention of "months" which doesn't have a name or conversion ratio. So should we know yet how many days or tetrants there are in a bloom?
