I write fantasy as a hobby, and names are one of the hardest things for me to come up with. I want names my readers can pronounce, and sometimes I want a particular sound or feeling from the name, but the problem of naming a character still feels open-ended enough that I have no idea where to start. Now that I think about it, I'll probably make a post on a writing subreddit to ask this question, but I'd like your input as well since you seem to have strong feelings about names.
