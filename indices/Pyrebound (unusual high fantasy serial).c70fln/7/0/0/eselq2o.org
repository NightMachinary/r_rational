I recommend that you get a ko-fi or list a paypal or something so that people who want to donate to you in the meantime can do so. If you're against that for whatever reason, perhaps consider listing an effective charity such as those listed by [[https://www.givewell.org][GiveWell]] to donate to, since people seem to like making donations after reading well written fiction.
