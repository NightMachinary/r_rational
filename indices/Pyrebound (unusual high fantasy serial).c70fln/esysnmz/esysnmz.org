I enjoyed it, and the only criticisms I have is that I found the intersection of your show don't tell approach and call a rabbit a smeep with regards to time periods needlessly distracting. It would have been nice to have the duration of a bloom and a kindling spelled out a bit more clearly early on.

As to whether it's rat-fic. Honestly my vote would be "no". The wold-building appears to be there, but the main character has so far taken a "head down, don't make eye contact" approach to any opportunity to engage with the mysteries he's encountered and appears to operate more on common sense than rational methods.
