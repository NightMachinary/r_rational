No keeping your head down is a good idea. Not all good ideas are arrived at rationally. Ram has shown a distinct lack of curiosity, or willingness to change opinion in light of new information.

The difference between a rational protagonist and a successful protagonist is whether they succeed because of rational thinking, and so far Ram doesn't.

Now don't get me wrong. I think Ram is well written, his motivations make sense, his lack of rationality makes sense in light of his position in society, and his reliance on common sense makes sense as it's until very recently worked well for him. Additionally given where the story is right now it's entirely possible that he's about to change, and post character development Ram might be more rational. But, there's noting in his past actions or thoughts to suggest he will become rational (he might just trade "what would father think" for some form of black band club rules).

But based on his actions and what we've seen of his thinking so far, he's not currently a rational protagonist, and the story is centered on him to a degree that I'd argue that makes it not rational fiction.
