Was planning on posting 6-3 when you update, I'll probably continue to do so until either the upvote ratio drops off, the story stops updating, or someone starts beating me to it.

So you can rest easy on that front ^^

Really enjoying it so far, speculation: biggest question I have so far is what drew the Ensi (and through him the Damadzus) to Ram in the first place. Current guess is indwelt prophecy of some description.

Looking forward to finding out!
