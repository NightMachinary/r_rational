Hey you. Yes you. Cynic. I can hear you sneering.

"The Erogamer? Oh no. Not more anime highschool romance dating bullshit. I get enough of that cancer just by proxy of being someone interested in web fiction, thank you very much."

Well, no need to worry, this isn't it. A while ago someone tagged this as a "Lovecraftian sex comedy". And man, does this go weird places - story wise and LitRPG wise.

Look. Grit your teeth, figure out how to work a registration form, and read the first two arcs. Personally, that second arc (Charles) is the most entertaining thing I have /ever/ read. If you're not sold by then, you can have your money back.
