  Hey you. Yes you. Cynic. I can hear you sneering.

  "The Erogamer? Oh no. Not more anime highschool romance dating bullshit. I get enough of that cancer just by proxy of being someone interested in web fiction, thank you very much."

  Well, no need to worry, this isn't it. A while ago someone tagged this as a "Lovecraftian sex comedy". And man, does this go weird places - story wise and LitRPG wise.

  Look. Grit your teeth, figure out how to work a registration form, and read the first two arcs. Personally, that second arc (Charles) is the most entertaining thing I have /ever/ read. If you're not sold by then, you can have your money back.

Money? Why this fantastic story is completely free! And I have to completely agree with you, anyone who gives this story flac for being erotic fiction or an anime style ecchi Knockof is insane, it is likely the funniest thing I have ever read, and it's references to other Rational fiction are just as hilarious The first time I read the line "BREEDING? AGREEMENT." Had me in stitches for minutes. The fact that a story this well written, well thought out and well executed, about a girl who's life is slowly becoming an erotic visual novel, and the existential horror that such a thing provokes baffles and delights me on a daily basis.
