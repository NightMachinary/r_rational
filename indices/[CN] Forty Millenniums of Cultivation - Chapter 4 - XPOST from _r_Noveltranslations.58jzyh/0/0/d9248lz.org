Chinese Novel. It's a tag from [[/r/noveltranslations]] where I believe [[/u/Cakefleet]] is used to posting translation updates to and probably put the tag in by reflex. The purpose is to say what language the novel was translated from, because for a fair number of commentators on that subreddit, they have strong preferences for some languages over others.

One might think this isn't important since they're all being translated into English anyway, but the original language has a significant impact on how the novel will sound due to cultural idioms and sentence structure. For example, some translators will often write Chinese sentences with a semi-direct translation into English sentences with a passive voice instead of the active voice many of us are used to in everyday writing. Hence languages can have a big impact on translations with characteristic quirks in grammar and phrasing. Good translators can correct for this, but some languages are simply easier to do so than others.

There might be other reasons for the tags, but this is the only I'm aware of.
