I forced myself to read Lewis' novel a while ago when it was posted somewhere in the rational sphere because he's held up as a good writer and a powerful christian apologist and I wanted to give him and his ilk a fair shake after my childhood self hastily abandoned /Narnia/ due to having interesting literature also available. I gained little from that endeavor.
