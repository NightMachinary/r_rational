When /The Great Divorce/ was recommended in another comment as a more realistic version, I was confused. As you said, /HitAG/ contorted its setting to explore certain implications of Christian theology. To me, this was the realistic, non-supernatural counterpart. The setting was explicitly our own, with the only fantastic element being extrapolation of single-bit errors to our fleshy substrate.

Actually, what this really reminds me of is a more satisfying take on Greg Egan's [[https://www.gregegan.net/OCEANIC/Complete/Oceanic.html][Oceanic]]. Both have the tension between a transcendental experience and the base, materialist process that is or could have caused it.
