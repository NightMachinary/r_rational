Thanks for sharing. Starts off feeling similar to Ted Chiang's story, but eventually diverges onto its own path. Whereas in /Hell is the Absence of God/, Angels and miracles are shown to be irrefutably true, forcing all kinds of strange thinking and logic upon the characters, this story turns out to be a more grounded search for faith, with a weird science-astrology twist.
