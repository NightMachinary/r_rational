I was wondering from where I recognized the author's name--he translated the excellent Three-Body Problem.

The whole time I was reading this was as unsettling and ominous as when I read Hell is the Absence of God. I'm not sure if it's the subject matter or the tone of the writing, but it speaks to the author's skill when awful events in the plot don't relieve the sensation of waiting for the other shoe to drop.
