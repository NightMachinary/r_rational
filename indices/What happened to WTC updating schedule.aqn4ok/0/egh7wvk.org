There's a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit#gid=0][spreadsheet]] with current progress. The current release schedule seems to be bulk chapter releases whenever they're ready. The writing rate has been extremely fast overall, but there's often 30,000 words released at a time or something, so the length between updates is longer than one might expect.

(Also, the author has been sick recently, but that only affects the most recent stuff.)
