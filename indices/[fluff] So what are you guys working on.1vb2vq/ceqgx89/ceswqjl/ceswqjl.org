  I'm trying to do something[1] in the style of the lesswrong sequences demystifying economics. What economics is and why it exists. How to tell whether it's beneficial or not. It doesn't seem to be going too well. I probably need to rethink the concept a bit.
#+end_quote

Which perspectives/schools of thought within economics do you cover?
