Software engineer here.

I just got out of three years running a startup in the valley. Now I'm paddling my feet in the corporate world for a while, letting someone else do all the hard parts while I just cut code. I'll start something else eventually, but right now this is relaxing.

I'm learning to play the lever harp. It's amazing. (Although I'm not that great at it yet.)

I'm writing a rationalist fantasy story, [[http://tinyurl.com/two-year-emperor][The Two Year Emperor]]. It was posted here last week by one of the readers (thanks, man!) which is how I found this subreddit.

I'm evaluating an idea for my next startup, and would appreciate input. Elevator Pitch: List your rental properties with us. We advertise them, take bookings, take payment, and we do it under your domain name so that (unlike with AirBnB) potential customers don't come to your listing and then get sucked off to someone else's.

I'm trying to decide: is it worth marketing at all? If so, hosted or installed? What would the right fee structure be?
