Wow, it sounds like you are a really hard worker, probably with lots of interests that take your time. Congratulations; that's a fantastic life skill.

That said, "More free time" doesn't mean "lots of free time". No matter how hard you work or don't work, once you are out in the world with a job and (eventually, probably) a house, spouse, and kids...your free time will drop to basically zero. So, yes, college is when you have the most...let's call it "self-determined" time, instead of "free" time. That work better?
