I've got a pretty good volunteer group working on large scale 3D printing. The intent is to sell it to the automotive industry, although I'm not really working on that angle.

I have most of a very scalable 3D object repository. I'm hoping that the community will adopt it, in part because it's open source and therefore a common ground all the small indie 3D printer companies can contribute to. You have to direct your users somewhere, but directing them towards something private is a good way to get your userbase bought out from under you.

Of course there are all kinds of network affects that will make that very difficult. Still, it should be cheap to run and I can fork it off into more specialized services. Maybe something subscription based for the automotive industry, depending on if that team can successfully monetize it.

I've got the system architecture more or less worked out that I suspect would be very good for distributed computing/virtual reality/collaborative design. Maybe some robotics stuff eventually, aggregating sensor data into a sort of short term memory. Almost entirely uses off the shelf pieces with a bit of python glue code. But that's hard to monetize and not really a high priority. Plus, it's a lot harder to tell if you're doing it right.

Somewhere theres a group working on getting funding for 3D printed veterinary prosthetics. Presuming they do I'll be involved with that.

I'm trying to do [[http://traverseda.wordpress.com/category/economics/][something]] in the style of the lesswrong sequences demystifying economics. What economics is and why it exists. How to tell whether it's beneficial or not. It doesn't seem to be going too well. I probably need to rethink the concept a bit.
