Aside from my undergraduate degree, I am focusing on a fantasy world that is based off of Napoleon dying from a new Black Plague, so the Council of Vienna is still led by Metternich but is focused on defence from outside threats (Russia, an Africa unified by the communication possibilities of scrying, the Chinese Empire that covers a fair fraction of South America and is fighting with a more unified Native American empire in North America).

It is going to be the setting for an RPG I am designing about students in an army-run magic spy school, to oversimplify. I have an inventive combat system that has been simple and fun in playtesting, but still have to get the magic properly statted out. The magic system includes force mages(heat, electricity and kinetics), fundament mages(space and time warping), nature mages(super-breeding), knowledge mages(sensory enhancement, mental enhancement, scrying), and four other kinds of magic.
