Actually, college / university is your best chance to do cool things. You have more free time now than you'll have until you retire. You have lots of inanimate resources (computers, books, etc) and enormous amounts of human resources (professors to act as consultants, other students to be co-founders / collaborators / guinea pigs / etc), and your need for money is as low or lower than it will be for decades.

Carle Diem!
