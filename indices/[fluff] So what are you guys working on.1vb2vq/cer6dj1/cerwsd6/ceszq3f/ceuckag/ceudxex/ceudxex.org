  Wow, it sounds like you are a really hard worker, probably with lots of interests that take your time. Congratulations; that's a fantastic life skill.

No, I'm only taking 2 courses and a seminar this semester, TA'ing, and doing collaborative research on two topics much too slowlyl (like I said, grad student), while occasionally seeing friends, putting scant hours into my moonshot hobby research, and getting so far behind on my other hobby that my "January buffer" for having done an extra release in December is basically consumed.

Basically, I'm a lazy son of a bitch. No, that is not a humblebrag: that combination of "achievements" really only sounds impressive when written down, and when considered in terms of total hours of actual, disciplined work rather than redditing or other distractions, it's much too little.

I'm halfway through my second year of grad school, I'm panicked and stressed about courses I feel I haven't comprehended thoroughly enough, and I don't have even one publication (despite one paper submitted last year and one over the summer). The world is going to shit around me and I'm nowhere near doing anything about it. Fuck. My. Life.

Sorry for venting. Grad-student stress plus hold-self-to-shounen-hero-standards stress.

  No matter how hard you work or don't work, once you are out in the world with a job and (eventually, probably) a house, spouse, and kids...your free time will drop to basically zero.

I definitely had more free time than my current level when I was at my internship last summer. Ah, 40-hour workweeks that you actually finish in 40 hours rather than being so undisciplined that your 50-hour workweek drags out into 60 hours of wasted life.
