I'm a computer science grad-student doing empirical metrics over software-engineering corpuses. And an improved Hadoop on the side, designed as a test-bed for a design for redundant storage hardware (wow, that actually sounds cool to say!).

My original hobbies were programming-language design, and what I once dreamed of doing, that I can admit in the dark of night, was formally verified operating systems. I still have a programming-language design and its compiler to hack away it Real Soon Now, but I have to get around to sitting and learning enough Coq to prove the type system and its inference algorithm sound, complete, and correct. I'm hoping to take an independent study course to learn the Coq next semester.

Right now, my grad-school's workload is kinda burning me out, and I'm gonna need to take a break of at least a year after my MSc anyway, to cohabit with my fiancee again and get married. Gibs job pls?

As to my less code-oriented research hobby, well, I'll bring no report to brighten the good dark of night or warm the good winter's cold. Suffice to say I really need to do a bunch of background reading in neuropsychology and probably write some stuff up into LessWrong posts -- for which purpose I did make a LessWrong account.

As to my other hobby, I have a /long/ writing queue: current thing, next thing that will be a bit more fun and have a broader audience, the thing where Mitt Romney on spice melange gets into a reality-bending fight with futuristic spiral-powered communists as the economy collapses because Spiral Power became a thing....

And then of course there's my political rantings everywhere, which have actually toned down somewhat: I'm occasionally not sure anymore if [[/r/politics]] is just behind me by a few years or if I actually seeded a few of the memes on there now.
