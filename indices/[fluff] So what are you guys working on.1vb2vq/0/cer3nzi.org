I'm a software engineer, doing incredibly boring shit with simulating large scale phone systems. People ask me what I do for a living, and my eyes start to glaze over. I otherwise work on writing fiction, mostly science fiction or fantasy. Projects include;

*Timewise Tales*: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Self-consistent time travel]] novel in a fantasy setting. There are time storms that come down with increasing frequency through history which blow apart cities and scatter their component parts out through the span of history. The novel is about fate, destiny, and how people deal with natural disasters. This one is more or less done, and in the editing process.

*The Wayward Souls*: Detective Jan-Fong dies in a back alley and has his soul put into a new body two hundred years later using blasphemous (but apparently now common) magics. He's widely regarded as the best detective to have ever lived, in part because a cadet wrote a long series of novels about his that embellished a lot. It's a fish out of water story in a sort of dystopian fantasy Chinese industrial revolution. This one is 2/3rds done at 50K words.

*Pax Arcana*: Wizards rule the world, and have for a few centuries. Magic works like an API (and shares lots of the same terminology), with feedback effects depending on what kind of magic is used. The story is about a rogue wizard and the man who's hunting him down, at least to start. Lots of broken, damaged people. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/186l1y/a_crud_magic_system_v2/][Summary of the magic system here.]] Might end up as a novella instead of a propel novel.

*Detective Jones and the Murder That Wasn't*: Terminator-style branching timelines story. Time travel was "invented" in 2007, and it's now 2012 - the police of Chicago use time travel in order to stop crimes before they happen. If you've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]] (my Terminator fanfic that I posted here awhile ago), it uses a lot of the same ideas, but in a setting that's more or less peaceful. I completed this for National Novel Writing Month a few years ago, but it's in the process of being rewritten from scratch to actually have a coherent plot and better character building.

*[[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/railboy/frontiers-explore-discover-survive][Frontiers]]*: An indie videogame in the style of Morrowind. I'm one of the lead lore guys, and laid down much of the foundations of the world's religions, regions, and so on. Currently working on a bunch of the books that you find scattered about the world. This is my first experience actually getting paid to write, which is cool.

There are some others, but that's everything that I have in "active development" right now.
