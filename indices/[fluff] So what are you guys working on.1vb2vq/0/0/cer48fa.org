Interesting. I'm a big fan of computable magic systems, which yours isn't. But it probably could be.

Somewhere in my reddit history is post talking about a low-level magic system using cellular automata. The goal was to make something sort of particle physics-ey. Basically a combination of [[http://youtu.be/KJe9H6qS82I][smoothlife]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld][wireworld]], in 3D. Never got to the point where I wrote any code.

Is any of that online?
