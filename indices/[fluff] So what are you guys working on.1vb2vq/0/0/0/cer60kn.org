No, none of it is online at the moment. Here's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/alexanderwales][my fanfiction.net page]], but that's about it. I would put some of this up online, but then I'd be pressured into finishing things, and in my experience I write best when it's not an obligation (I spread out over a couple projects trying to avoid burnout). When I finish any of these and edit them to a shine, I'll definitely post links to this sub.
