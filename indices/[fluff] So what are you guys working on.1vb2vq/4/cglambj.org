Undergraduate in cognitive science, for one. In terms of writing... well a whole lot, but in terms of specifically rational writing I've got my "Avatar: the Last Rationalist" in the works. I'm a about halfway through the first chapter but the chapters are going to be a bit longer than chapters in a book, since they each take after one episode of the television series on which this is based. Once I finish this one and the next one as a proof of concept, I'll start on the next six simultaneously. When I've got those more or less done, or at least I have the first few well enough done to release I'll start putting them up.

Another writing project I have that might be interesting to y'all is a futuristic dystopian original work about superheroes. It's a deconstruction of the superhero genre that takes it in a different direction from the typical "what if superheroes were just regular assholes like us?" deconstruction.

There's also two YA things I have in the works. One is something I just thought of today that is a bit difficult to describe. Essentially, it's an over-the-top story about a high school where inter-student power struggles dominate. There's intrigue and espionage and betrayal and it's all comically framed as being between the Culture Alliance which is the old guard of the school's politics (consisting of a supremely uneasy alliance between the French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and Arabic culture clubs, the school's marching band, jazz band, chamber choir, glee club, four a cappella groups, the fine arts club, the drama club, and several of the school's athletic clubs), and the emerging power that is the Gaming Federation, which has been steadily on the rise since two years ago when the Video Game Club acquired the power of several tabletop gaming clubs, including the Dungeons and Dragons club and the chess club, and several athletic clubs, and used them to take control of several important sports teams, most notably the cheerleading team, which was once firmly a territory of the Culture Alliance.

The other YA thing is a combination coming of age story/deconstruction of the high fantasy genre. It's a compelling high fantasy story, but it alternates chapters with the story of several high school kids who are playing said high fantasy story in D&D. The high fantasy story follows close to the arc of the kids' story, which is about the rise and fall of their D&D club.

Finally I have some hard-ish science fiction that's just a good old space adventure. First and foremost I'm trying to have it be about how a human society would exist in the future with a galaxy full of small colonies.
