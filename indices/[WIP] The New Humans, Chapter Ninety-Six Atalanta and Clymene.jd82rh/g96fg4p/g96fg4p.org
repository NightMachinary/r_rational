Not related to this chapter in particular, but I just read up through chapter 2 and the detailed and systematic isolation/dehumanisation/abuse of children seems a bit too grim for me. For the sake of my emotions, does their situation improve significantly? And does Allison ever reunite with her parents? Well written though.
