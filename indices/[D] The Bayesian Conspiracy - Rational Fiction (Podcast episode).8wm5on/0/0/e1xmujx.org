I often wish that I could duplicate myself, since that's the only way that I'll ever get to do all the things that I want to do. Following that conversation I actually tried to make a budget proposal for the project, in terms of time and effort, and though it's something that I would like to do, it's just too many hours/spoons to get it done, especially since I get a bit of social anxiety, and dealing with all the people I would need to deal with sounds like a people-stamina sapping nightmare.

If someone /else/ wanted to do it, all you'd need to do is contact authors through reddit, and so long as you're known to me, I'd be willing to lend /some/ effort and knowledge to the project (as well as some prose, given I have a fair amount of short fiction and a few wins). But one of the reasons that I'm running the weekly challenge is that I thought if I didn't do it, no one else would have, and I expect a compilation or anthology would be the same.
