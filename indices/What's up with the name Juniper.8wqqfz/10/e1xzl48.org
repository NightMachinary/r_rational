I am just glad that its not a really generic Caucasian name like bobby. Joe, Mitch, john. If your MC's name is generic I subconscious ly think your story is generic. Compare a name like Gary to a name like Randidly Ghosthound. Which story will you get invested in more? (Too bad randidly ghosthound is still a terrible webnovel but the name got my foot in the door)
