Not only where you live, but when you were born. For the same reason you wind up with multiple kids with the same name who wind up in the same class as school, authors of the same generation will be fond of the same name. It's some form of cultural osmosis.

When an individual is seeking a certain name to associate with a particular sort of person, they reach into a basket they share in common with a lot of people.
