I'd say so. If a bunch of stories from the same author use a name a lot it doesn't show that the name is weirdly popular in a certain kind of fiction, it shows that a single person has a (conscious or unconscious) fixation on it. In that case the only person who can be asked for the source of the trend is the author.

Of course there are only two stories sharing an author, making that not the case. On the other hand there seem to be only four stories showing the Juniper trend, so there's not much of a trend in the first place.
