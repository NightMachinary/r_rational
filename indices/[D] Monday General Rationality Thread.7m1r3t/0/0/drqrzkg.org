I recommend you make this a post rather than a comment, because the Monday Thread is for discussion but you are trying to get a mini-group together for mutual support rather than asking for advice on how to keep up with New Year's Resolutions.

Not to say that you shouldn't have posted here (it's fine!), but it likely work better as a post over as a comment.
