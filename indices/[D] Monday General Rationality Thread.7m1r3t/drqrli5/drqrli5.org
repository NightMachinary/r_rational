1. What are your New Year's Resolutions? Mine are, basically, exercising more, reading more, and writing more, though all of those things are broken up into sub-resolutions (e.g. I decided my word count goal by looking at the projects that I need/want to accomplish this year, estimated the word count per project based on past projects, and then broke that into monthly/weekly/daily counts + some buffer/failure days to make sure that the goal was reasonable). I'm also moving residences, in part so that I live closer to a gym.

2. Anyone want to form an [[/r/rational]] group to support each other in keeping our resolutions, to the extent that online acquaintances can do so? I have some ideas, but I'm less set on the “how” and am open to ditching or adding to them. Register interest /first/, and then we can figure out what would work for the people who are interested. This might not be very effective, but I'm all about trying new things (especially low-cost things) and I'm willing to give it the old college try if anyone else is.
