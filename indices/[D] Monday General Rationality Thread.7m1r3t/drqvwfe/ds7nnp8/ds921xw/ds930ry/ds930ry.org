Potassium Chloride is sold as '[[https://www.amazon.com/Morton-Salt-Substitute-3-12/dp/B00KPX1W4U][Salt Substitute]]'. You cook with it just like you'd use table salt.

I find that it [[http://www.bloodpressureuk.org/microsites/salt/Home/Howtoeatlesssalt/Alternatives][tastes pretty similar]] to normal salt. But some people use a [[https://www.amazon.com/GoodSalt-Substitute-Iodized-Mineral-Alternative/dp/B00UKSA5D4][low-sodium salt]] that has a mix of KCl and NaCl.

You should be able to get either version at a typical grocery store.

Some research shows that [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1627756][potassium lowers blood pressure]] directly. But, even if that doesn't kick in, it's a substitute that can let you cut sodium.
