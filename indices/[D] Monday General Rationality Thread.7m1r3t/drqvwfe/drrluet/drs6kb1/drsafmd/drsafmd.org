He said he was having problems with doing this, because salt clumps together and essentially forces you to add them in large randomly-sized discrete chunks. So if he wants exactly X amounts of salt on something, he can't do it with his salt shaker. In contrast, if you dissolve salt in water, now you can easily measure out precise amounts of salt to add to stuff, with the only problem being that your food would be covered in water.
