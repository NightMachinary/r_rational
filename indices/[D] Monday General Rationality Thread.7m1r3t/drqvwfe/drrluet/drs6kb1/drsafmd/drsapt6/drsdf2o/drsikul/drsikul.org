The obvious simpler solution rather than

#+begin_quote
  Step 1) Weigh salt shaker.\\
  Step 2) Dump large amounts of salt from shaker into an empty container.\\
  Step 3) Weigh salt shaker again to know the amount of salt you put in the container.\\
  Step 4) If the amount is wrong, pour the salt back into the salt shaker, repeat from step 1 until you get the amount right.
#+end_quote

is to just use whatever precision scale you're using for the salt shaker and just measure out salt onto that (rather than doing math for how much you removed from the shaker which would take a while). With that approach I can say from having done chemistry labs that you can get a specified amount in a few seconds, adjusting the amount on the scale is really quite quick, and given the wider tolerances allowed for food it would probably be faster than that.

  Step 5) Pour exactly that amount of salt water onto your food.

It also strikes me that the water isn't massively necessary here either, since you could just use a smaller measured container to dispense salt (or more like a teaspoon marked with a given size circle) in an analogous fashion. It's not clear that you would be better protected from applying too much salt by pouring in saltwater. You could probably guarantee a great deal of precision if you diluted the saltwater enough, but that has to be weighed against the cost of adding more water to your food (yes you could make the food with less water in the first place to counteract that, but at that point you're not saving any effort).
