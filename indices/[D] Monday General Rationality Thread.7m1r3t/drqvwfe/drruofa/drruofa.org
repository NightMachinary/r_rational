Salt shakers tend to acquire a salt crust that eventually makes the holes smaller. You could try to accelerate that - dipping the shaker in water and then in salt, or if you want to go fancy, putting the shaker headfirst into a supersaturated salt solution and then slowly evaporte it over a heater.

Also buy all the shakers online, test them to your satisfaction and return the ones you dont like.
