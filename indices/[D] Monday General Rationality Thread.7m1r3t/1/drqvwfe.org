For blood pressure reasons I'm looking for a precise saltshaker or other way of applying salt to food. Most saltshakers either flow too fast and are hard to control or flow too slowly and clog easily. It seems the only way to find out which is the case is to try it yourself which isn't an option at any store I know of.

Any recs?
