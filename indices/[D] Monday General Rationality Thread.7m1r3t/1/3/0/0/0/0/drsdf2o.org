The way to get a precise amount of salt into water is to dump the whole thing in. As in, here's the procedure:

Step 1) Weigh salt shaker.

Step 2) Dump large amounts of salt from shaker into water.

Step 3) Weigh salt shaker again to know the amount of salt you put in the water.

Step 4) Do math, calculate the amount of salt water to use to get the amount of salt you want.

Step 5) Pour exactly that amount of salt water onto your food.

If you do step 2 directly onto the food, you can indeed tell how much salt you added, but that's unlikely to be the amount you wanted to add. The water is needed for fine precision.

I mean, without the water, you would have to do something like this:

Step 1) Weigh salt shaker.

Step 2) Dump large amounts of salt from shaker into an empty container.

Step 3) Weigh salt shaker again to know the amount of salt you put in the container.

Step 4) If the amount is wrong, pour the salt back into the salt shaker, repeat from step 1 until you get the amount right.

Which will take forever if you want a very precise amount.
