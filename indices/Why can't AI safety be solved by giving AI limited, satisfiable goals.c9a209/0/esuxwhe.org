Specifying a limited, satisfiable goal about something in the real world is in fact an extremely difficult problem. Figuring it out would take us a large fraction of the way towards creating an AGI that's safe even with goals that aren't limited, but we aren't close to figuring it out.

How would you go about specifying (in mathematically precise language) what a paperclip is? What "making something" is? Or even what "stopping" is?
