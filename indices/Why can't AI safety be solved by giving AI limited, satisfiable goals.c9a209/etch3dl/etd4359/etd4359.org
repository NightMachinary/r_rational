Where are you getting the step 3 from?

If I have a while loop with i>10 as the exit condition, it runs until it reaches 10 and then stops. It doen't keep running to make sure i will be equal 10 forever and ever.

When a human being wants to eat 10 nachos, he eats them and feels satisfied, he doesn't keep pushing nachos into his mouth to make sure there's never less than 10.

It seems like step 3 is based on the idea that AI would want to twist anything you tell it into the world destruction, and from there you figured out how it would do that.

But AI isn't an evil genie.

Executing step 3 requires more complexity than not executing it.

Your "additional step" would have huge negative value because it results in more resources being used than I specified. I didn't say "use at most this many resources on making sure there's 10 paperclips", I said "use at most this many resources".
