I get your point, but if the AGI has such an alien understanding of human language and intent at all, what good is it? It's not just 'stopping' it won't be able to understand, it's literally everything else too. If we had such a poor understanding of its way of interpreting the goals we encode in it we couldn't give it any goals to begin with.
