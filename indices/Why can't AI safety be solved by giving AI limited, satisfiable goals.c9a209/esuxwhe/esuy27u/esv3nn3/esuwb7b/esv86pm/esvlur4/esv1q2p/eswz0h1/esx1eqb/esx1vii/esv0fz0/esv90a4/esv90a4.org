If you want an AI that is capable of complex thought in order to be able to solve non-trivial problems that a simple computer cannot, you are truly in the bailiwick of 'true' AI.

True AI are more than smart systems. They can change their assumptions. They can change their approaches. They can learn from experience and change their behavior based on what they have learned.

This means that they will likely be capable of changing their values and goals to match their perceived needs and desires.

In short, I do not believe it is possible to create a true intelligence which will be a creative, capable thinker, while also being unable to modify itself, because creativity and intelligent problem solving are very much attached to being able to change.
