I guess that depends on your definition of intelligence.

Chess programs are intelligent at chess, starcraft programs are intelligent at starcraft.

If we have a program that cures cancer, designs spaceships, and figures out the laws of physics for us - who cares if it has metacognition or self awareness.

Besides, I thought the whole problem was designing utility function. I think it should be perfectly possible to have self awareness, abstract problem solving, self improvement, while at the same time having only one desire in life - making 10 paperclips and not any more.
