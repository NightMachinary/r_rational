Working in machine learning, I can assure you that your plan is perfect except for the part where you have to implement "limited", "satisfiable", and "goals".

High level concepts don't exist in the world, we can't use them to control the behavior of AI. You have to build sufficiently precise correlates to the concepts from scratch, and this turns out to be much, much, much harder than it sounds.

Leaving aside the overall utility function, let's talk paperclips. You'll need to build a representation of "paperclip" that approximates the concept well enough for manufacturing purposes. And that's assuming you actually understand what a paperclip is well enough - do you? (how thick is the wire? which alloy is it made of and why? how is the metal treated? what are the manufacturing tolerances?). If you feel that the AI should figure all this out by itself so that a few words or a picture of a paperclip is an adequate specification, then we're back to loosely constrained AGI.

And if that's the situation for "paperclip", good luck with getting the AI to do what you mean by "make 10 and then stop".
