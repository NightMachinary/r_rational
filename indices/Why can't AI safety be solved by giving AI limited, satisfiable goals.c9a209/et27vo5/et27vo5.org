It's a trope/aesop about trying to "control the monster". A bunch of monkeys trying to trap a human often ends badly for the monkeys due to differences in capabilities.

An AI is advertised to be much better than humans at everything. We are now training AIs using machine learning, so even we don't know how things really work.
