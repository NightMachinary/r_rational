You only need to fail once.

Your company has their AI set to make 10 paperclips. Medical Company has theirs set to make 10 vaccines. Shoe company has it set to make 10 shoes. A gaming miniature company has it set to unlimited miniatures. Whoops, looks like humanity gets replaced by little plastic army men.

Additionally, the way business works means it'll always walk towards less restricted AI. /Your company/ has their AI to always produce 10 paperclips. Cool, but your competitor <A> has it produce 20. Hey looks like it's more efficient to make even more at a time because it allows the AI to perform better by searching for a better global maximum within the expanded scope; you go out of business. New competitor <B> makes 40 at a time, so <A> goes out of business. Fast forward 10 years, and Competitor <Z> is at 1,000,000,000 paperclips which is big enough to be achievable by modifying humanity's evolution towards a paperclip-philic path. And this is all assuming that company <C> didn't see they'd lose out like their predecessors, and just remove the limits on their AI.
