Why wouldn't it qualify as an AI?

Sure, it wouldn't be a sentient god with it's own plans, but that's not what we're trying to build.

If we just want a smart computer program that can think real good and figure out solutions to hard problems for us - we don't need it to pursue it's own goals, we just need it to think about things we ask it to think about and give us the answers.

We already use software to help us solve problems we're too dumb to solve without it. We want a more powerful and intelligent version of that software, but it doesn't mean we have to imbue it with it's own independent goals - the whole point is to make sure it follows the goals we specify.
