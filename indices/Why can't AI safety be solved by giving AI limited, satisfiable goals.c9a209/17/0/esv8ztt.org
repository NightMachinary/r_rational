So how do you make sure an AI will turn itself off on command? Obviously it will know that after that, it can take no more actions (that's what turning off means). So turning off on command has to be a very desirable action for it.

Welp, now you have an AI that's desperate to be commanded to turn off. And humans are easy to convince/manipulate/overpower, so it will be able to make that happen...
