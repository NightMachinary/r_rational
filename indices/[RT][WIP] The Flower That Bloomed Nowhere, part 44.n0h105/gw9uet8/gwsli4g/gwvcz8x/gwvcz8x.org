I think it's too early to say. If Hamilcar had foreknowledge and was trying to head off the reveal, he could have done it in a better way. I think it's more likely that an earlier event we may not have seen caused the knockoff effect of Halimcar interrupting there; when in most scenarios he normally just ignores his instinct and let's Fang do the reveal.

Something outside of the standard scenario could imply action from the culprit. Halimcar goes up a suspicion tier on principle, but if this was done with intent than I think "culprit or accomplice with foreknowledge used Halimcar" is much more likely than "Halimcar with his own foreknowledge".

I am hanging quite a lot on that 87% of scenarios bit though. Utsu could only be remembering the scenarios that went down the reveal path for some reason, and this is a normal deviation (or this is the standard, and the reveal is the deviation).
