  I'm pretty sure this is the first direct indication that we're off of the normal version of events

What's got me scratching my head here is that the chapter 1 opens with "SCENARIO CONCEIT: Control. No variations." Makes it sounds like this /is/ the "normal version of events" or at least, that it's meant to be. I wonder if deities (or whatever they are) running the scenario screwed up or something? Or... maybe 'control' just means that the initial conditions are normal, and ghost-Su (or something else) is allowed to make additional changes?
