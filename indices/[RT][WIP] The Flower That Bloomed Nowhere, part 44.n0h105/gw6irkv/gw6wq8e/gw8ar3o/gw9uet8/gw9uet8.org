Delivering that warning is probably what Kam was desperate to do here, but is she being forced into it or is she a true believer? She's had several lines that seem anthetical to being a willing supporter of a death cult, but she also seems capable of keeping up that appearence for the years she's been in the class. I believe Utsu has clocked a few things she's said along those lines as coming off as rehearsed, like her professed reason for getting into healing. Maybe there's more to it?

Or, this is completely unrelated to why Kam is desperate and she's just having an /incredibly/ bad start to her weekend.

Anyway, the message. Yeah, I'm with Utsu on this one, the flippancy of that message makes the death threats more chilling and not less. Why were those bits at the beginning and end even left in? Was it even intentional? The speaker is almost coming across like an actress, does she even know that this message was going to be delivered?

And the last thing... Utsu has been having those deja-vu moments that are probably memories from previous loops. I'm pretty sure this is the first direct indication that we're off of the normal version of events, but I'm not sure what could have happened to make this loop so dramatically different. The only thing that comes to mind is whatever Utsu's request might have been back in the initial chapter.
