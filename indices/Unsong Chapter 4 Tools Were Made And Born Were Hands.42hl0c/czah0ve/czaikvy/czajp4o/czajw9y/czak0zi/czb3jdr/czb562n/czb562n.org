The problem is that the Vital Name may flip the switch that tells the universe to turn whatever comes out of the computer's speaker into a magic effect, but it presumably won't change the computer program's flow. If up until now it always outputs that the name didn't work, then there's no reason for that to change now, unless the computer program observes its surroundings for the effects of magic.
