Chapter 5 is out. Let's see what numerical references we can glean from it, shall we?

#+begin_quote
  two big yellow letters [...] two big yellow letters\\
  5'4, maybe 5'5\\
  Matthew 5:18\\
  not a single letter\\
  Matthew 16:4\\
  Exodus 20:23\\
  Exodus 25\\
  L and F sum to twenty-six [...] gematria value of twenty six\\
  the Third Commandment\\
  aleph is silent and represents nothingness. So I have taken nothing.\\
  eleven PM\\
  next six months

Okay, I think I've proven my point. There are plenty of numerical references scattered throughout chapter 5, but none of them are overwhelmingly more prominent than any other.

Remember [[http://hpmor.com/chapter/8][the number game Harry Potter played on the train in HPMOR.]] It's not enough to find evidence that supports your theory. You also have to look for evidence that /disproves/ it.
