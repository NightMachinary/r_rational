Prediction: The number four will be prominent in this chapter. Chapter 3 had many threes, including being set 40 * 3^{5} days before the discovery of the Vital Name in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 had many twos, including references to duality. Chapter 1 had many ones, though that's hard to separate out from the high base rate that I would expect (but that isn't a coincidence!)

Off to read the chapter...

EDIT:

"...he were to buy a second computer? What about a third computer? What about +a giant Cray supercomputer...+ *A fourth computer*"

"Knowledge brings discord (1), knowledge ripens (2), knowledge is poisoned (3). Men greedily devour the exterior of knowledge, but the core they do not reach (*4*). "

"Knowledge was first domesticated in southern Turkey (1) or northern Mesopotamia (2), from which it spread to the rest of the world, although some scholars claim its modern genome owes more to various European ancestors (3). Most historians believe it was first brought to the New World by colonists, but this ignores the existence of native American varieties (*4*)..."

"I stood up...I placed my hand above it...I started...and I ended"

This is four sets of four, but that is /probably/ a coincidence, as I think I missed at least one thing.

EDIT2:

Llull ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull][Wikipedia]]) has four "l"s
