I agree with you for real life, but I think that applying "there are no coincidences" to a web novel /specifically about/ there being no coincidences, with an author that I believe could pull off meta-level references of this scale is a much better idea.

I suppose we'll see if chapter number = significsnt number /in/ the chapter within the next few weeks.
