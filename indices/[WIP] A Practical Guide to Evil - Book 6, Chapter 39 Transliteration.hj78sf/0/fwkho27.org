So the solution to this whole conundrum is the fantasy version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_Synod][the Cadaver Synod,]] now with 100% additional necromancy. Gotta be honest though, I still feel like something will go wrong. It's too easy for this plan to fall apart, be it people disproving of the necromancy or the existence of the T&T trial leaking to the Grand Assembly.

Returning to the chapter as a whole though, I have to say that the trial was written quite well. It didn't drag on, yet all story points were addressed well and it still managed to be impactful.
