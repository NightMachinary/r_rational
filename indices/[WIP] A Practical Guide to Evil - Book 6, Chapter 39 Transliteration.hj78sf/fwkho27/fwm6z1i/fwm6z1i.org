It's a vile act on one of Above's deceased. Hanno's punishment was done, and the thing Cat creates won't have a Name, so it's not a technical violation of the Terms. Still, the Heroes will all be revolted by it, and many may jump ship if they'll find out. Given that they're Heroes, and the Wandering Bard is about, you can bank on them finding out - when it's least convenient for Cat.
