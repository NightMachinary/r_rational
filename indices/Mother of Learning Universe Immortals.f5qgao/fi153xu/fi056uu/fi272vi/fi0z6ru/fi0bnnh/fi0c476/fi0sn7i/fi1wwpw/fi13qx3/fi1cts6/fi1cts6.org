The author responded to the comment at [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2018/03/24/magic-users-of-pre-ikosian-altazia/comment-page-2/#comment-15889]] without disputing the line:

  Since going Lich would involve losing taste and the other physical sensations...

which is a weak implicit confirmation that going lich does have some pretty steep drawbacks.

But WoG at [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comment-48]] does provide a pretty hearty endorsement of the lich path:

#+begin_quote
  There are no magical/power drawbacks to being a lich no. And yes, most necromancers wish they could become one eventually. It's just very hard.
#+end_quote

I found some more discussion of the pros and cons of lich-hood at [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/#comment-223]].
