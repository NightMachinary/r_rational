When a lich is discorporeated its soul returns to the phylactery, which implies they need some kind of preparation at that location to be able to return from there. Zorian spent a brief period as a discorporeated soul and the process nearly killed him outright, so unless being a lich also shores up the weaknesses of the soul we can assume they can't just wander around until they find something to posess.
