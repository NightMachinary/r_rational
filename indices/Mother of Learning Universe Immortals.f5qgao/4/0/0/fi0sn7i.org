There are so few we might as well quote them:

#+begin_quote
  Although undead can also potentially continue existing in perpetuity, they are not considered real immortals. The same goes for spirits and other creatures that naturally don't age.
#+end_quote

That seems like mortal bias. It also means that all the 'immortals' are victim to the weakness from the second paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  No method allows one to be completely invulnerable or be free of weaknesses, so getting killed is always a danger.
#+end_quote

Four of the immortal 11 are either deceased or likely deceased. Had they chosen a path to immortality that made them undead liches, at least 3 of the 4 would likely sill be 'alive'. In particular, #10, Sakelus, died to a gunshot. Any form of immortality that leaves you vulnerable to gunshots sounds pretty weak. #11 was assasinated, so maybe they would have destroyed his phylactery, though we don't know the details of phylacterys or why a lich wouldn't drop the phylactery in some unmappable section of deep ocean where it couldn't be destroyed.

If I was able to become immortal, being a lich doesn't sound all bad.
