The halo effect of celebrities and leaders has always existed, although live streaming may be making it more intense and widespread. People developing cult followings certainly isn't new, and I'm not even sure the number of "cult followers" has actually increased, they could just be louder now due to the internet. The #1 thing we need to do is take steps to reduce social isolation, issues with parasocial relationships are a symptom of this larger problem.

Changes in technology and culture have led to people becoming more and more isolated. Every study I've seen has shown that decreasing time around others decreases well being, even for introverts. We are all trending in that direction. Working on reducing physical isolation is the clearest answer: we can take concrete steps to improve it with low risk.

A messier problem is cultural isolation: locally we are more fragmented than ever. People don't share the same world views and interests as much any more. Social media bubbles are part of this but in general we have more and more niche hobbies and communities. The most harmful example is politics: people have wildly different foundations for their politics now more than ever. On the less extreme end this generally reduces the quality of time spent with others and the drive to do so, we just don't have as much in common to talk about compared to the past. Trying to fix this would be a nightmare.

Japan is a painful example: there's a culture of isolation, anti-social cultural trends (no judgement, but treating the opposite sex extremely differently halves your social opportunities), and the largest social force remaining is the workplace, which benefits from the culture. I also don't think blaming the J-idols and telling them to make sacrifices by being more real is the best way. You should blame the industry for building them up like this and not protecting them. The industry should work to reduce the harm they get when they are more real, and you should try to change the fan culture.

My priorities of interventions:

1. Education: it's cheap, effective, and low risk. Post Maslow's hierarchy pyramids everywhere with socialization emphasized, social health experts etc. Teach people that they should schedule X social time a week just like exercise, and hope for better success.
2. Increase availability: Do interventions to increase the availability/acceptability of social events. Right now these would have to be online, but later the options are endless. There's tons of room for easy improvements.
3. Reduce isolation incentives: trickier, hard to balance, and unlikely to happen. I would target specific industries and work to remove the incentives for them to increase the isolation of people. Forcing more transparency is "easy" and good for citizens.

Thanks for reading my rant! I've thought a lot about social isolation issues, after I realized I myself am having problems with it and that they don't improve over time by default. Water is wet, if you do nothing nothing changes. If anyone wants to talk personal plans I'd be happy to share as a young avoidant person.
