I've thought a lot about VR.

When I was like 2 and 3 years old, I had a "plan" to "invent" a door in the side of the TV cabinet that would let me get into the world of the movies I saw on the TV. I understood none of it was real - I'd had some nightmares about Cookie Monster chasing me down my house's hallway so my parents bought a Cookie Monster hand puppet and showed me how it worked, even hooked up our video camera to the TV and showed me the puppet on my dad's hand and on the TV at the same time, and I had been shown a flip book as an explanation for how cartoons work, like, I /knew/ the stuff on the TV wasn't real, but I still thought it might be real. I also /knew/ that my toys weren't alive from the ages of 5 to 10, but I still thought my toys might be alive from the ages of 5 to 10.

VR is going to be ubiquitous in just a decade or two, and AR might be even more ubiquitouser even sooner. Some parents let literal babies - like, literal 1-year-olds - use smartphones and tablets. There's no way too-young kids aren't going to be using VR/AR, and there's no way it's not going to confuse the everloving hell out of them. If I'd had access to the type of AR we're going to have in 2027 when I was 3... who knows. The '30s are gonna be interesting.
