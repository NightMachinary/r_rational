I can't remember where I read this because it was definitely over five years ago, and I can't find any sources, so take this with a grain of salt. It might be 100% false. It's probably not, but I'm going by memory here.

So, some researchers were trying to pinpoint the area of the brain that recognizes human faces. I guess that would be difficult in something more accurate like an MRI, so they just used an EEG to read spikes in electrical activity and had subjects sit in a neutral room and have other people enter the room. I don't remember how they controlled for whatever. Maybe they just showed the subjects pictures of faces. They also exposed subjects to the faces of loved ones / friends / family / acquaintances, whether that was in person or just pictures.

They found that an area of the brain recognizes "HEY THAT'S A HUMAN FACE" and a smaller subsection of that area recognizes "HOLY SHIT THAT HUMAN FACE BELONGS TO A MEMBER OF MY SOCIAL CIRCLE."

Somebody had the bright idea to do the experiment again, but with a television. Random television programs that subjects never watched with unfamiliar actors triggered the general "HEY THAT'S A HUMAN FACE" area, and subjects' favorite shows (or popular shows they were familiar with starring well known actors) triggered the more specific "HOLY SHIT THAT HUMAN FACE BELONGS TO A MEMBER OF MY SOCIAL CIRCLE" subset.

It's like the savanna principle. Ancient brains interpreting modern stimuli, and all that jazz. It doesn't matter how rational you are or how high your IQ is, your brain is dumb and easy to trick.

You see Robert Downey Jr. on your screen and you consciously think, "hey, it's RDJ, he seems like a pretty cool guy and I like his movies," but your brain reacts the same way as it reacts when you run into a friend at the grocery store, something like "hey, it's my friend Tony Stark, I've known him for years, he's definitely part of my social circle." People who fanboy/fangirl over musicians in particular are (I'm guessing, but I feel like it's a reasonable guess) generally on the younger side. Lots of self-insert One Direction fanfic on Wattpad. So maybe younger people don't yet have the life experience necessary to separate fantasy from reality and they're just experiencing the feeling of "I know this person" without being able to consciously override that with the rational thought of "I've never met this singer/actor in my life and they have no idea I even exist." Maybe adults with that problem are just lonely. I remember reading an article on Cracked dot com like 7 years ago (yeah yeah I know, /real accurate source you're citing there, buddy, Cracked is definitely peer-reviewed, and you definitely remember the details 7 years later/) about something like a "naked picture test," like, in the '70s they asked people if they had somebody in their life they trusted enough to guard a naked picture of them and they asked the same thing in the '10s, and in the '70s only like 1 in 10 people said they had zero people in their life they trusted that much and in the '10s a full 1 in 2 people said they had zero people they'd trust... There were other statistics, the "naked picture test" was just the most memorable, because it's funny. Anyways...

TL;DR: Brains are stupid. Even your own brain thinks you're personally acquainted with the stars of your favorite movies/shows, and maybe people who get obsessive about it are just lonely or young or whatever.
