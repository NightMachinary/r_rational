I've always liked phrasing praise of artists as "I like your work." Doesn't link it to the art-liker's self-identity the way "I'm a fan" does, or focus on generic praise like a "You're amazing." Probably helps to whatever small degree phrasings shape perceptions. And people tend to use phrasings they've heard, so using it yourself lets it spread a little. That's a tiny tiny lever for social change, but it's the best one I have handy.
