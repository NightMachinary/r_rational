The human brain is a neural network. Neural networks work on the basis of pattern recognition.

...it's amazing how much of human thought that explains. Take this example, for instance.

When you meet a good person, who you /know/ is a good person, then you feel betterl there is a good person in the area, who does good thing, therefore the odds are that /good things are going to happen/ and you feel (at least a little) good in anticipation already.

But this is a pattern. You meet a good person, you feel good. Therefore, if someone does something that makes you feel good, they are a good person. (Yes, I know the logic here is flawed. But it's a /pattern/.) Now, here's this guy who makes content that you enjoy. That is to say, he makes you feel good. Therefore, says the pattern-recognising human brain, he /must/ be a good person!

...which is why it's a shock when he turns out to be a rampant bigot (because the human brain does not like to be /wrong/). Suddenly, all that content that you enjoyed is tainted by association (because it made you /wrong/) and you feel personally attacked and betrayed (because he did something that made you /wrong!/ It must have been deliberate!) and you can no longer enjoy that content - or even things that remind you of that content (because it reminds you of a time when you were /wrong/).
