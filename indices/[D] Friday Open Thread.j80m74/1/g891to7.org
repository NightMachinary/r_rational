What can/is there any point in even trying about the development of parasocial relationships?

It seems that going by comments that people seem incapable of thinking of people who make content they enjoy as anything other than some perfect superhumans who should be worshipped.

You regularly see comments on youtube especially on music videos ranting about the artist (not the song, nor even their other songs, about the artist personally - not I love their music, not I love this song, I /love/ THEM, the person) when content producers are just like everyone else, they could be Jesus or they could be Hitler the ability to make enjoyable content doesn't make them any less of a person.

There is a strong incentive for all parties to cultivate this persona further as it makes them more money but is it good for the mental health of anyone involved? You can see it most starkly in Japan but it's pretty universal.

This was prompted when I was reading some comments on a discord about a guy who wants J-idols to be both honest (don't lie about not having a boyfriend) and pure (don't have a boyfriend and don't ever have one) and others were trying to explain that they lie because it makes them more money and their pureness is irrelevant and not something you should ever demand of someone anyway.

Thoughts?

It's a very privileged problem but I'm not sure how it'll get better. How many celebrities need to turn out to be "evil" for people to stop worshipping them?
