Couldn't wait for the next Monday thread, so posting it now, but what does everyone think of the newest volume in Cradle, Wintersteel?

I thought it was the best novel so far, expanding on everything that's happened so far and revealing crucial information regarding several loose ends and advancement into the highest levels. Will has truly outdone himself, the character writing, insights, and action are all fantastic. Some of these moments have been building up from the previous volume or even since the first volume, and it is glorious.

I think Cradle truly is one of the peaks of xianxia, and Wintersteel has been one of the most cathartic reads all year. The sequence of fights near the end are just so satisfying. Man, I still can't get over the Yerin and Lindon stomps. Especially with said Lindon stomp proving himself over his inner conflicts and showing that he still has it, especially after what happened in Uncrowned. I had high expectations for Wintersteel, but the actual volume far surpassed them.
