I thought it tied everything up very nicely.

A critique points that I would have though is that I would have liked to seen more dialogue between Lindon and Yerin to develop the romance even more. Like in the restaurant scene, it literally ended with a single sentence along the lines of “Yerin told Lindon about her doing something with a sword.” It felt, idk, abrupt.

Otherwise, it was a very solid entry in a multi-book series, a type of writing that often sees quality dropping significantly as more books are written.

My thoughts.
