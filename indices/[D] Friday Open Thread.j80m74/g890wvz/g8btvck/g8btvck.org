*Spoilers through Witnersteel, obviously.*

Wintersteel was one of the more enjoyable books I've read this year, and it did a good job picking up where the cliffhanger of Uncrowned left off. It also developed the world and characters a lot; prior to this book, the fandom consistently brought up how Yerin wasn't very developed, but this book finally fleshed her out for me.

And we finally get insight into Cradle's global powers (Monarchs, factions, etc.)! All in all Wintersteel really finished sketching out the world for me; before this I felt as though Lindon/Yerin were being led blind through the world. I'm hopeful they'll have real agency in the next book.

I also really appreciated how most of the enemy competitors and "villains" weren't 2D "evil," and instead were shown to be normal people dealing with the horribly competitive system that is Cradle's world order. I'm hopeful that the report on the Remnant Monarch and her "cooperative" system is foreshadowing this issue being addressed. For example, the scene where the Dreadgod cult members meet with Yerin felt forced, but I appreciated what the scene did to justify the Dreadgod cults.

Not really criticism but I did have a quibble- the Ruby issue was handled very oddly in my opinion. I felt like there was a disconnect between the reader and the characters because from the observer's perspective Ruby is no longer a menacing blood shadow but a new-born sentient being created by infusing Yerin's being into her (exactly what we've been told would happen by following the Blood Sage's technique).

In this book there are countless examples of her in this role- The scene with her petting the rabbit, her free-spirited pursuit of Lindon, etc. And yet Lindon/Yerin and the others don't seem to update to this view and Ruby's treated with horror/suspicion the whole time despite intellectually being aware that she is likely a ~clone of Yerin now.

And then she's quickly gone without ever really exploring her?! It just felt like the topic wasn't given the time it needed to develop the issue and make the scene of her merging with Yerin into the meaningful moment it deserved to be.

Overall it was a solid book, well worth the wait.
