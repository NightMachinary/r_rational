A bit of a more accurate name for the sub, I suppose, given that 'well written fiction with depth' is far more than just rational works. While a sidebar update might be beneficial, I think we're cutting out a portion of potential audience already by having such a specific sub name. I, anecdotally, basically never read sidebars unless I'm going to make an actual post. I wouldn't have stayed on this sub for more than a few minutes (especially not long enough to see that it's far more than just 'rational fiction') if not for my general interest in such works. I think the only reason I found this sub was from WorthTheCandle getting posted elsewhere?
