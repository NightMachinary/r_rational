So I posted last week about making a new subreddit, and I got a lot of discussion on it, and it made me realize that my idea of what I wanted for it is somewhat nebulous. Suggestions ranged from "Don't, we don't need to split the sub" to making the new sub '[[/r/ratadj][r/ratadj]]', but I don't think I had a good enough idea of what I wanted at the time.

The reason I spend a lot of time on this sub isn't because I try to read rational works, it's because this is one of the few subs that doesn't care about medium or genre, and the weekly recommendation threads always have excellent content at high volume. I'd say I have a rational slant, but it certainly isn't everything I read, or want to.

I don't want a sub that contains a subset of this subreddit, as this sub is inactive enough already. I think I want a sub that's everything on this sub and more: Less targeted towards 'rational' works entirely, to form a new community that includes all sorts of well-written fiction, from entirely rational webserials, to mainstream published novels, to webcomics that hardly make any logical sense at all. I just want well-written fiction with depth, in whatever form they may take.

So with that, what does everyone think about [[/r/DeepFiction]]? I've gone ahead and created the sub, but I don't want to try and split the sub if we're worried about that (I think most initial posts are going to be crossposts or links, to not steal discussion) and have set it to restricted while I try and build it out correctly with community input.
