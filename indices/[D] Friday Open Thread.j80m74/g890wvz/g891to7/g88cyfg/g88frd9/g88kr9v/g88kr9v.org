I've been playing it, but I might be taking a break until the next update.

Hit AR30 last night and the amount of grind it's asking for combined with everything being gated behind resin isn't very appealing.

The multiplayer being so limited is a bummer also. I have a few friends also playing, and I'd love to be able to hit Spiral Abyss with them.
