It would be interesting to see the differences in responses to different technology levels such as: writing, radio, tv, and a livestream. I would guess that more live coverage is making these issues worse, "RDJ the person going through the motions on screen" is probably less pleasing to our monkey brains than "RDJ responding in real time, or even better to ME!(the chat/donations)". Celebrities intensified with TV I wonder how intense they will get now, let alone as things progress. "Standing right next to my hero" in VR probably lights up a hell of a lot of brain regions.
