I prefer to maintain an idealized version of an author/content creator in my mind. Doing so enables me to get immersed in enjoying their creation without intrusive negative thoughts spoiling the moment.

That said, I fully understand that human beings are not perfect, and very, very few live up to the ideal. Therefore, 90% of the time I strive to keep my interaction with the artist, and knowledge of their personal views, to a minimum.

The other 10% of the time, I follow the artist's social media presence because of all of the following: a) they are unfailingly honest, down to earth, and courteous in all online interaction, b) they avoid sharing any details of their personal life, and c) they avoid expressing religious or political views.

That's all a content creator needs to do to maintain my distant admiration.
