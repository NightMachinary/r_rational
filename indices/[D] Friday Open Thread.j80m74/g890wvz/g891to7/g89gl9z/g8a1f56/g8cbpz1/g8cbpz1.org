I agree.

I do think that language can influence your brain and your choice of language can be a vessel to make even greater change on yourself than just using the different word at first does but I do wonder how much of an impact it really has at the end of the day. It's not just a reflection but how much more than a reflection is it?

If we tore out pronouns from the English language for example, what would that mean for gender in ten years time that would have been different from how it was before?
