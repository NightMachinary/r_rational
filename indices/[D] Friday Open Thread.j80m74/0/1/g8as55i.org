Agreed it's incredible though I will say it felt like it was missing one thing. The ending felt abrupt like all this stuff just went down, a bunch of threads were tied, a bunch of people died and they basically don't talk about it or reflect on it or anything despite it seeming like the perfect time to do so.

Overall I still rate it 9.9/10 but it felt like it was only a single scene away from a perfect book
