Tbh, it might be easier trying to rope the mods into something. Like if they had automod comment "non/less rational work goes here" in the monday rec thread as a comment to the main post, that'd be a balance between finding new works without having to build up a new subreddit for it all. If that works out well, then you've got a base community to open the new subreddit with.
