  Where does the biomass come from? Most Earth plants get their mass by breathing (CO2 -> O2 leaves you with an extra C), so are these plants just breathing a lot faster and more efficiently to justify that growth?

If magic exists, it provides enough energy for plants to grow even when they'd otherwise be covered.

In any case, you could have this planet be significantly wetter, so that plants have a lot more water to absorb.

  How fast should growth be in order for it to be a continuous threat that any city has to constantly deal with on a daily basis?
#+end_quote

At least as fast as kudzu. Though the growth itself doesn't actually have to be that fast, if there are other aspects to the plants that make them inimical to structures. (i.e., these plants are evolutionarily adapted to tear apart stone, cement, or just about anything except pure metal.)

  Given that growth, what do the places that are totally unchecked look like? What should they look like if I'm trying to make the most compelling setting? Trees that just keep growing, a foot every week, until they're so tall they fall over?
#+end_quote

The tree cover of a tropical rainforest, but with a ground level as densely packed with plants as a mangrove maybe.
