  Where does the biomass come from? Most Earth plants get their mass by breathing (CO2 -> O2 leaves you with an extra C), so are these plants just breathing a lot faster and more efficiently to justify that growth?

Could come from CO2. Could come from some special mineral in the ground that the plants could mix with something else(O2?) to expand it. It could also come from a symbiotic relationship with some underground creatures who then feasted on the roots. I only know a little biology but I imagine that a lot of biomass is still water so you'd have to take into account where the water comes from. Does the earth itself naturally soak water from the sea/underground rivers and transport it up? Does it rain a lot? Does the plants such water out of the atmosphere(In which case you'd expect heavy tree places to be somewhat dry)

  How fast should growth be in order for it to be a continuous threat that any city has to constantly deal with on a daily basis?

Grass grows with about 4 inches a month. A 10 year old kid is about 50 inches. If grass grew at x200 speed it would be taller than said kid in two days and you would have to cut it down every day or your kid would wander the streets blind. If it grew at x50(6.7 inches/day) you'd have to cut it down at least once a week to keep it below 50 inches which still is really labour intensive. It'll depend on where you are seeing the threats coming from(i.e. if poisonous plants grow at 6 inches a day you'd be really screwed) and how intensive we are talking.

  Given that growth, what do the places that are totally unchecked look like? What /should/ they look like if I'm trying to make the most compelling setting? Trees that just keep growing, a foot every week, until they're so tall they fall over?

Assuming water wasn't a concern the primarily initial limiter would be sunlight. As such I would predict that plants would take one of two strategies. Strategy A includes aggressively pursuing sunlight and we would see plants either growing really tall or to somehow piggyback on the tall plants to get sunlight, such as growing on tall trees. The majority of strat A users would be the tall ones as they would have evolved first and we would expect them to have really thicc roots and have massive trunks to support the weight and to sustain through wind and weather. Seedling of tall trees would need to have a lot of energy stored for their initial growth until they can get to sunlight. The tallest plants wouldn't have to optimize for sunlight effenciency so would let a bunch of sunlight through but the medium height plants would have to use the residual sunlight well which would leave the bottom with little natural sunlight.

Strategy B involves accepting losing the sunlight race and get energy from other places. Some plants would be parasite plants that stole energy from the other plants. Some might eat insects or small animals. Lastly, and honestly most interestingly, some plants might learn to survive on unnatural light. In our world there is something like 80 bioluminescent fungus and while we don't why these plants waste energy like that, it's plausible that it's a byproduct of producing energy through non-sunlight processes. I think it could be cool to explore this idea, if other plants evolved to accept this as their light source you could end up with a really appealing undergrowth, including symbiotic relationships with plants that would somehow protect said fungus in exchange for light.

For wildlife I would expect a lot of diversity. With a lot of biomass I would expect some animals to be rather big though the thick roots would require a certain agility to jump around, over and such. I can imagine animals that lives best at certain altitudes and that jumped between different trees without ever touching ground.
