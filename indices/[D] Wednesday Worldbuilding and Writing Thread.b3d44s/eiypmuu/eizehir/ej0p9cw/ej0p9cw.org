Gundam's rationale for large robots was many-fold:

- because of Active Mass Balance And Control tech --- basically, having limbs --- the mechs were more maneuverable than similarly sized spacecraft with fixed configurations of mass, and could adjust position without spending propellant
- humanoid body plans provide more intuitive control for pilots than fins or thrusters
- humanoid body plans already have a number of established weapon design schemes, which only need to be scaled to fit the mech.

In the main timeline of the Universal Century, the state of the art design did tend back towards expendable munitions under psychic control, called "bits"
