Maybe they're powered by an evil magic force, which has enough intelligence to withdraw its animating power if a given zombie is not useful to it anymore?

Also, with the standard medieval fantasy tech base, I don't think zombie treadmills are really going to compete with your standard water wheel or wind mill for power generation. Sure you don't have to feed the zombie, but you do have to feed the full time guards and handlers that are necessary to keep such an operation running.
