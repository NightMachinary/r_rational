*Are slow!Zombies actually really fast?*

So I've been thinking about zombie hoards recently. They turn up in fantasy quite a lot - shambling armies of uncountable corpses that kill not through skill or even often strength, but shear weight of numbers. One of the defining traits of these types of zombies is that they are slow - often moving at little more than a walk (as opposed to the fast, animalistic zombies often seen in some modern zombie films).

Let's say a zombie can move at 3mph, about human walking speed. On that battlefield that means skirmishers and well drilled regular infantry should be able to keep well ahead of them. A light jog would be enough.

But the tactical map isn't the only thing we need to consider. The strategic is also vital and it is here that I think slow!zombies become fast.

Why? Your typical fantasy zombie doesn't tire. It doesn't need a supply train. It can march through storm, hail, sleet and good weather without stopping. It can march day and night. It can ford some rivers and maybe even march under water.

3mph for 24 hours is over 70 miles a day. That's insane for non-mechanised infantry. Even if terrain means that can't be in a straight line, they are going to be out marching any mundane force a fantasy kingdom can field.

Do the zombies break through your lines to ravage your inner kingdom? Better catch them within a day otherwise you aren't catching them. They're going to out-march anything you send to catch then.

Zombies and your re-enforcements heading to the same place? Better hope its very close or they are beating you there. And worse, you're forces are going to be dead on their feet after such a forced march, while the zombies will be as fresh as ever (:>).
