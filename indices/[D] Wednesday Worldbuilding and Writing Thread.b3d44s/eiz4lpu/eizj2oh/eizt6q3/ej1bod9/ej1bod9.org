1. You will need increased CO2, but that won't be enough by itself to turn plant growth into a continuous threat. You'd also need increased rainfall, increased sunshine, a longer growing season, improved soil nutrients, and probably some degree of genetic engineering to make the plants grow at an alarming rate. You might also consider some kind of air-deposited biomass, perhaps an abundance of pollen, which would have a tendency to clump up, decay, and form soil on top of buildings which then supports the growth of plants that sink their roots into the structures.

2. Roughly 50x growth rates would be about the minimum to create a real problem. A tiny bamboo sapling would grow 1.5 to 5 meters over the course of a day, potentially making open fields inaccessible within 24 hours. Kudzu could spread 50 meters across the surface and have its roots go down 1.5 meters in a day, and it would probably cost the US about $50 billion per year to control its growth. Most trees would grow 50-100 feet per year.

3. Unchecked areas are basically going to look like old-growth rainforests, except that it'll happen very quickly.
