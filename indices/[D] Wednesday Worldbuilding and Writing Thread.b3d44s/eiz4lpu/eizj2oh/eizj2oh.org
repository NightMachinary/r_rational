I'm sketching out the details for a new worldbuilding project that will never be used for anything serious, and would like some feedback/thoughts/help with it.

--------------

As a result of incredibly fast plant growth, the world has a stark contrast between the wilderness and the places where people live. Typically speaking, cities are built where soil has been permanently made so poor (via salting or otherwise) that plants can't grow, and even then, it's a constant struggle against the plantlife, which is always threatening to swallow up houses and cities by creeping in.

The thing that I like about this kind of threat is that it's both gentle and ever-present, in a claustrophobic, suffocating way. You can go between cities or towns fairly easily, even if it takes a bit longer because there are fewer roads (with roads being difficult to maintain). And there should be lots of lost ruins that have been swallowed up.

I have a few questions that need to be answered before I can do more work though:

1. Where does the biomass come from? Most Earth plants get their mass by breathing (CO2 -> O2 leaves you with an extra C), so are these plants just breathing a lot faster and more efficiently to justify that growth?
2. How fast should growth be in order for it to be a continuous threat that any city has to constantly deal with on a daily basis?
3. Given that growth, what do the places that are totally unchecked look like? What /should/ they look like if I'm trying to make the most compelling setting? Trees that just keep growing, a foot every week, until they're so tall they fall over?

I'm mostly looking for some help making the foundation of the setting solid enough that I can do some of the more fun extrapolations on it, including the big set pieces. There will probably be some magic systems related to the growth in one way or another, but they're on hold until next week.
