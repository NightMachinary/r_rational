Mechs are basically super-infantry.

If your goal is to destroy some fixed target, you'd use artillery or airstrikes. Infantry becomes necessary when you want to occupy a city.

So, I'd I wanted to do future mechs, I'd write a story where they occupy an especially hard-to-hold city. Then the questions are: Why not non-mech soldiers? And why not mechanized cavalry?

One sci-fi option would be to put the setting in some shallow water. Projectiles become less effective, and mech suits with swords before slightly plausible.

A less sci-fi option would be focusing on the human aspect. Human scale mechs looks more human than tanks. So maybe they're less offensive to the locals. From there, I'd write a premise where there's an especially brutal insurgency and a civilian population who's right on the brink of revolt/collapse. Main characters need to be able to rapidly respond to attacks on infrastructure, without creating a bunch of collateral damage.

If I wanted to go full (slightly fucked-up) anime, give the mechs some bulletproof glass face-masks and have the pilots be smallish women.
