lets start with real things in science today, shall we?

now, lets consider those technologies maturing a bit. to me, that looks like actuators and myomer for a battlemech. but it also has an impact on computing, being able to make very small parts in circuits. add a VR helmet and a fusion power supply... and we can start looking at a new type of machines.

a lot of people complain about the PSI of a mechs feet, so how many legs does our new machine need? or could we expect to be able to use flexible tentacles instead? the main downside of tentacles would probably be the complexity of the controlls, followed by the inherent problems with complex mechanical design.

then we get to the point where people have large robot vehicles... and then stick guns and armor on them. the question is not if its practical, it will be for some jobs. instead, we should ask what would it be best at? what niche would this sort of tech actually fill? a self-propelled fusion reactor with multiple appendages.

battletech was the 1980's view of the future with robots. what should the 2020 view of the future look like?
