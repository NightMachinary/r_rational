if England is anything like Australia, you might find that there's a "low supply" of orphans, so they're either adopted immediately into their permanent families, or in foster families. Doubly so if they are white children orphaned in infancy. The image of "orphanages" like in Oliver Twist is very outdated.

For a more accurate response, I'd go to an England subreddit, or if there's an AskEngland subreddit (I know there's AskAnAustralian so there's got to be an English equivalent).
