I don't think that there's a proper thesis for it, but the premise is essentially that the Capitol will have better internal cohesion if they have a hated enemy, and given their utter dominance, they need to create their own enemy. The Hunger Games then aren't /really/ about suppressing revolt within the Districts or punishing them, they're the Capitol's yearly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate][Two Minutes Hate]]. Of course, the people in the Capitol don't really seem to "hate" the people from the Districts, instead seeing them more as caste inferiors or something, but the Hunger Games could still be a deliberate way of reinforcing the ingroup/outgroup pressures that would already be in place in order to ensure homogeneity.

(Whether this would actually /work/ is beside the point, so long as someone in power thinks that it does, or possibly just through inertia from the original creator(s) of the games.)
