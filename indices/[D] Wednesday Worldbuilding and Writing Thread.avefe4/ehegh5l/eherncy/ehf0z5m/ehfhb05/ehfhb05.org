Haveing the players be aware of VR and questioning if what they are seeing is real would problely make for a more interesting story. I was imagining that the Cabal would have a huge amount of resorses so could kidnap people who were unfamiler with VR from less developed countries but If they are on a budget or have a tight deadline then it would explain why they had to chose people who were familer with the tech.

I was thinking that a lack of education would lead to people to not question their perception of the world. If you have never heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave][Platos Cave]] or anything that explorses similar themes then you would have to come up with that idea on your own. Now I think about it [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)][The Matrix]] explorse those theams and is quite wide spread in pop culture so idk.

For the simple game world I was thinking makeing world less like skyrim and more like [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/461560/MANDAGON/][MANDAGON]]. I don't know how much game design has improved along side the VR tech, but asumeing it is still slightly comparble to today, makeing a truely believable gameworld with lots of NPC's and complex moveing parts would be almost imposible. So remove the NPC's and the complex moveing parts. Make it so the players spend their most of their time in a very simple eviroment that can be made as realistice as posible. Like the [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/0/0c/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber_DBS_Ep_32_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20171106012206][Hyperbolic Time Chamber]] or [[https://previews.123rf.com/images/mikekiev/mikekiev1204/mikekiev120400014/13293901-private-house-on-green-planet.jpg][house on a tiny planet]]. If they can simulate a perfectly realistic world then this would proberbly not be needed.
