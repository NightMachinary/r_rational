Glad that you like it. If I have the time I'll try a stab at making a story for it. It was something I used for rpg's two times but they never lasted long.

The limiters are live invisible non-material magical constructs that sustain themselves on the psychic energy of their host. A player learning how to see invisible creatures will be able to see them once they return to the real world. They can be destroyed and the cabal have limited ability to manipulate them but not a good way of doing it largescale.

I agree that making people unaware that they entered a VR would make it more real and perhaps removing the memory of entering a VR would be a good idea. I dislike that from a narrative perspective though and I wonder if we could make a tweak to the world that would change that?

I actually disagree on your point about people who have lower levels of educations. Higher levels of education allows people to perform more abstract thinking and to accept weirder premises.

I'm not sure that I am following the point about a simple in game world. Would you be interested in elaborating on that?
