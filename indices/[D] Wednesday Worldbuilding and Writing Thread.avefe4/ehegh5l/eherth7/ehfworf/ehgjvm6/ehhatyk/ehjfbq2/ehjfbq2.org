Yeah, I assumed you were tongue-in-cheek calling out the official treaties; that reference passed my substrate-hogging head like a manta ray.

I haven't read Lovecraft /nor/ Laundry Files, but for the former popcultural osmosis has provided me with basic understanding. Incidentally, if the deep, deep sea is something that gives you the good willies, you might enjoy Nate Crowley's /Death and Life of Schneider Wrack/. Met him once, he's a swell dude.

Anyway, thank you for clarifying =)
