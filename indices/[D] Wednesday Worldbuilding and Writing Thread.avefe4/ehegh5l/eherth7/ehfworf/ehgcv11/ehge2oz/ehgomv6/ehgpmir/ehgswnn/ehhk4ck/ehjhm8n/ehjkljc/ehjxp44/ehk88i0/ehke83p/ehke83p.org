Sea trading being possible doesn't mean it's economic. You'd have to have the lifting body aspect of your ship 100+ meters below all the crew accommodations and workplaces.

...now I'm imagining an unmanned submarine with a tower on top from where the submarine is being piloted. It is a supremely weird image.

Though, thinking on it, if floatation aspect + cargo is on the ocean surface and the crew is suspended 150m below on a gondola, this might be doable. All manned shipping would come to a halt when they get too close to classical harbours; there would be really weird wharves built. Countries with naturally deep harbours (fjords come to mind) have an advantage in shipping.

These kinds of oceangoing vessels would also look like the weirdest Zeppelins I've ever heard off.

While inside your intangibility bubble, yes. You could use a pistol to hunt critters that swim too close. (I feel like contradicting myself with something I already said elsewhere...)
