Case 1: Keep flying. As you and John are ~200m apart, your overlapping bubbles of intangibility ...uncouple(?) and the paper place keeps flying in John's bubble.

Case 2: It turns to mush as it has fully left your intangibility bubble.

Illustrative case 3: You throw a spear at John, who's 300 meters distant. As the spear's trailing end has passed the 'intangibility border' of you it slows and stops in 'midair' just as if you had thrown it into sea water and slowly sinks to the bottom of the sea situated between you and John.

Illustrative case 3.1: Suppose ri is the intangibility radius, and d is the length of the spear, and you throw in perfectly straight line. For s(You, John) > 2 * ri + d there's a time when the spear interacts with sea water, however briefly, and it will behave as if the rest of its travel is through sea water. A target near John's intangibility border may be hit with the remaining speed the spear travel at through sea water, but John will very likely not be.
