[[/twilistread][]] Hmmmm. A few thought experiments, then.

[[/sp][]] My friend, John, touches a piece of paper and then walks 50m away from me. I fold the paper into a paper plane and throw it at John. Since I am an expert paper-plane-folder and -thrower, the plane travels in a perfectly straight line exactly where I aim. As it approaches John, he backs away rapidly, such that the paper is never more than 50m away from him. When it gets 100m away from me, does it turn into mush or keep flying?

- The second one is similar, but with a difference - before I throw the plane, I tell John to "go long", so he backs off to 150m away from me before I throw the plane. Does the plane turn to mush at any point in this case?
