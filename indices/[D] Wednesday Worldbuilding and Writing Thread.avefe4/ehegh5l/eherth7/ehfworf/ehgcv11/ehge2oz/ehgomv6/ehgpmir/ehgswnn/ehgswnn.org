Yep, it's tied into the unmentioned background, and it's not exactly 100 meters but in that range. It's very much tied to distance, not time, though I might rework that.

You would turn the shark via the stick; the stick doesn't transmit the intangibility property.

Underwater warehouses are... difficult.)
