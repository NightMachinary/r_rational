  Actually, in this setting the distance is much higher (around 100 meters), but beyond that the bullet would suddenly start to interact with seawater instead of air, so long-range guns are done for, in this scenario.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. So, if you /stop/ touching something, it remains unaffected by seawater? Is this based on time since touching it, or distance? (What happens if I throw a paper plane?)

If I touch a think with another thing (e.g. I'm holding a stick, and I use that stick to poke a shark) then what happens? (If it's a /long/ stick, this might help prevent me from being splattered with exploding shark).
