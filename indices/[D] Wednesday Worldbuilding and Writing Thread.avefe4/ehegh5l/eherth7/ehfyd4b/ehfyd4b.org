I'm thinking about The Hunger Games after mentioning a (non-rational) fanfic of it in the Monday thread.

So, the hunger games: discuss?

The premise, for those that don't know, is that we're in a dystopian future where every year 24 children (1 boy and 1 girl from ages 12 to 18 chosen via lottery from the 12 districts) compete in a fight to the death, only one survives. There's 12 districts who live in relative poverty (the main character comes from a district where people regularly starve to death) and a Capitol full of people living their best post-scarcity utopia life (including things like surgically transforming themselves into cat people) - it's these people that watch the Games each year like their favourite reality show.

The Games happen as "penance" for the districts previously rising up against the Capitol, it's apparently used to "keep them down" and to make them mad at each other instead of at the Capitol which gives them all the problems. (Because if the little girl that used to sell lemonade in District 5 is killed by a teenage girl from District 8, this wouldn't make District 8 popular for District 5. Multiply that by two children every year for 75 years...).

I've glossed over a BUNCH, it's obviously a very detailed world. One other thing I should mention is that in exchange for more entries in the lottery, a child can get a supply of bread and oil (about one year supply for one person per entry). As well as that, some districts "train" most of their children for the Games, and then those Careers will actually compete for the "honour" of competing - which means that everyone can get the extra bread and oil with impunity.

Anyway, I guess my thoughts are:

- How rational is this system? It is pretty well thought out as dystopian futures go, and the events of the books cause the dystopia to fail after 75 years, which seems like a bit too long to me?

- Presumably in this dystopian future there are unwanted pregnancies. Why not raise these children in dorms, brainwash them as best you can to think dying in the Games are an honour, and then everyone can get the bread and oil and not starve? Basically a more extreme version of the Careers. I mean, yeah, it's unconscionable, but so is everything about the system. (Actually that would be an interesting fanfic, to write about the point of view of one of the Careers, but the situation is more like this than the outward perception of what a Career district is...)
