Why does the Capitol need cohesion? I suppose they're united under President Snow who for all intents and purposes is an evil dictator, right? That'd do it...

It'd be interesting to see what other stuff happens in the Capitol to help keep the class divide: they obviously have fashion norms (green skin is in, for example...), so there's probably at least quarterly fashion shows so that way people have to spend a lot of time and energy changing their appearance / wardrobes to keep up.
