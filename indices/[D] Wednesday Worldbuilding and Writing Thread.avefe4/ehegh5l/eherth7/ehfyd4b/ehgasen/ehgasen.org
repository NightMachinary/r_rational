To start with, you need more diversity to the districts, which is pretty easily done by saying "no, districts aren't entirely themed along a single career/resource, but that /is/ a method of culturally segregating them, in the way that people from Wisconsin take pride in their cheese, and Appalachia takes pride in their coal miners, despite the number of jobs that are actually in those industries being not actually that high". Simple enough.

The real question is how this all works (or fails to work) on a sociological level, which is probably a question of 1) demographics and 2) technology. The hunger games are put on because the Capitol are exercising control over the less technologically sophisticated districts, and whether this works or not doesn't actually matter, so long as people have cause to /think/ that it does.

(There's actually an interesting theory/headcanon that the hunger games are more about keeping the Capitol in line than the districts themselves, which I think is a better explanation, given that routinely killing children in a highly publicized way is /probably/ only going to inspire immediate and violent revolt, especially when those children are picked/groomed to be exemplars of that culture.)
