In Harry Potter canon, Harry was born on 31 July 1980 and Hermione was born on 19 September 1979: Hermione is 10 months, 12 days older than Harry. What are the effects of reversing their relative ages, so that Harry is older than Hermione?

I'm wondering about Watsonian and Doylist effects. For example:

- As a Watsonian effect, Hermione might look at Harry as an older brother rather than as a younger brother.
- As a Doylist effect, someone might accuse the author of perpetuating a sexist standard of men only pursuing younger women.
