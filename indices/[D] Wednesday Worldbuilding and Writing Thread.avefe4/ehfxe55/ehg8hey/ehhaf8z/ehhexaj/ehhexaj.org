Yeah, but Harry never pursues Hermonine.

If you're talking about a fanfic, I doubt there would be any complaints because a >1 year difference is negligible. And I mean, there's a surprisingly large subsection of the HP fandom that produces and consumes Snape/Hermione fanfics, so I doubt this specific scenario would even raise an eyebrow.
