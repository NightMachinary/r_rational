This is a brilliant justifcation for a lit RPG.

How are the limiters put in place? Dose our cabal train people to believe that the limit exist, is there a magic switch that we flip or something else?

I think kidnaping people who have never even heard of VR and have lower levels of educaion would be the best bet, as it reduses the risk it might occure to them the things they see aren't real.

Create a very simple game world to reduse the worldbuilding mistakes that can be noticed. Or at the very least make it so the players don't interact will anything two complex for long. I would do this by haveing them teliported to locations with a quest to do and then warping back to a hub world the moment they are done.

Spread clues in quest locations, that tell a narative about why they are there, so the curious will accept the fake story as real and be more firm about believing it thanks to the effore they put in to uncover it.
