  The biggest challenge is to make people strongly believe subconsciously that the VR world is real and make the abilities from their class levels second nature.

In the VR world, every menu from your character options to your level-up bonuses to your quests are accessed through a cellphone app, which then has VR-world implications.

While your victims are in VR, you sneakily install the real version of the same app on their phones. Instead of letting them think the VR world is real, you're letting them think that their VR-world powers somehow escaped to the real world with them. (Also, you can manipulate the app to give them quests).
