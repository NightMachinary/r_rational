Humans all have a subsconcious psychic power that allows them to manipulate reality in a way that corresponds to the memetic strength of an belief. Any single human only have so much power but power can be consolidated by multiple people believing in similar ideas. As you can imagine that led to all sorts of chaos so you and a few other brave souls took up the mantle and formed a hidden conspiracy, largely successfully. You have put limiters on people's power, leaving them with only a small part of their usual power. Not enough that any individual could pose a threat but enough that you can harvest that power through memetic engineering.

Now a new wave of big baddies are threatening Earth and you can't handle it without removing many of the limiters put in place. History shows that it's a very bad idea just to remove the limiters without shaping the beliefs about what the unlimited can do with their power. All sorts of nasty surprises unfold - just have a look at ‘mythology'. So your merry cabal comes up with the brilliant idea to put people into superadvanced VR simulations(TM), with the goal of eventually removing the limiters and allow your subjects to use their class levels from the game in the real world.

The biggest challenge is to make people strongly believe subconsciously that the VR world is real and make the abilities from their class levels second nature. You also want to train them to complete the ‘quests' that you give them to in a roundabout way make them subservient to you. What systems would you implement to reach those goals? How would you shape the VR world to make it easier to accept it as real?
