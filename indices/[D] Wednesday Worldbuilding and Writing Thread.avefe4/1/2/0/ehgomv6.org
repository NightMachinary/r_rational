  Guns don't work.

  Sure, the bullet leaves the barrel fine, but a half a metre or so away from the person firing the bullet it just slows down and stops. Same for just about any ranged weapon, really. Anything that fires a physical missile, anyway.

Actually, in this setting the distance is much higher (around 100 meters), but beyond that the bullet would suddenly start to interact with seawater instead of air, so long-range guns are done for, in this scenario.

  Sonic weapons, on the other hand, will be... interesting. They'll work extra-well against sharks and fish and so on, but presumably not against humans.

Yes. Though you could also just touch a shark and let decompression do the rest. Though you might want to avoid having the shark touch you, and this doesn't cancel momentum, so you might be hit by a couple hundred pounds of meat at appreciable speed regardless of who does the touching.
