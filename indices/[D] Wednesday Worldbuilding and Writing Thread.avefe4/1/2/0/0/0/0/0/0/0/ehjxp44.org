Interesting! Tentatively I'd say that thing gets pulled along as the bathysphere rises..

That is a +kinky+ out of the box scenario... but yes, it would remain afloat.

No. It's all still submerged until you bodily interact with it. As you walk the ground, I imagine you would rather sink than the sand and rock bursting, but I honestly don't know how rocks behave when they're suddenly released from dozens to hundreds of atmospheres of pressure differential. They'd crack, I suspect? More compressible things, like fish's air bladder, would burst/explode though.
