Hmmm.

I have a bathysphere; a strong metal sphere, filled with air. (There are no passengers inside it). It can survive in the ocean's depths, but is lighter than water and floats. It has a cable attached.

I roll it, all the way from outside the ocean, to the ocean's floor. I loop the cable around something I want to get rid of (a building, perhaps, or an enemy who's in no condition to fight back - in the second case, the cable should be at least 150m long). I stroll away. I imagine the bathysphere shoots out out of sight, dragging whatever's attached roughly away with it?

If I have a boat designed such that it can be piloted from the crow's nest and needs no crew other than the pilot (and the mast is 200m long), then surely this ship can sail the seas as ships once did? (Though the pilot will need a parachute instead of a lifeboat).

As I walk along barefoot, I touch the ground. 100m ahead of me, does the rock and sand burst into the air at the sudden lack of pressure?
