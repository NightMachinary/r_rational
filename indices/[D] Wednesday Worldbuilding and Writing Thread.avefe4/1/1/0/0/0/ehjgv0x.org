  What do you breathe out? Is it instantly transformed into iwater, whatever it would be normally?

You breathe out air; if a fish happens to swim by your mouth as you breathe out, it would be functionally unaffected.

  If it isn't transformed, gas pockets seem likely. If it is, human beings slowly start transforming all the carbon on Earth to iwater (unless they agree to systematically breath in underwater, leave, and carry out the presumable reverse transformation that occurs above sea level). No easy gas pocket formation: If you walk through a structure you don't leave gas pockets of your air behind, used or not. However, if you carry a burning torch as you walk the depth, the fumes of the torch will remain in the 'reconstituted' water.

  How about: a tank full of N2 at 'ambient' (from the human perspective) pressure. When a human leaves, the gas in the tank is compressed by the change to deep-ocean pressure. If you put a membrane over the opening of the tank, the volume that used to be filled with gas will be filled with freshwater.

Good thinking! I want to say that the N2 would turn into sea water as the human leaves, but considering the torch trails fumes first through 'air', then water... I'll have to think on this.

  This implies humans see with something other than light... or that the iwater permits the passage of electromagnetic radiation, and all the animals are affected by increased light levels. Humans seeing with something else makes more sense to me, given the circumstances.

Without going into too much detail, it's either a 'special sun' for humans below the sea (where the 'sunlight' behaves as if water didn't exist, without affecting any processes of things shone upon the 'sunlight'), which would be the convenient excuse why everyone can see as if through increasing layers of fog/ash. I prefer this, since it aligns with my initial ideas about the setting.

Alternatively there's no virtual sun and until sunlight hits the transition it will be attenuated by the regular sea before it suddenly starts to pass through 'air'. This has its own implications, like littoral and human-inhabited sea floors suddenly becoming much more light soaked, with the subsequent secondary effects like increased sea plant growth around humans, shifts in species distribution (algae specialised to metabolise long wavelength light will suffer from light stress, short wavelength users will migrate (very quickly) into the human habitation bubbles. Light-sensitive animal species will tend to avoid the (relatively) shining human settlements.

Regardless, deeper seasteads would try bring their own light sources, but these might attract their own share of deep sea flora and fauna, depending on setting (and on if I think it makes sense).
