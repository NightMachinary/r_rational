    You'd also be violating the Benthic Treaties.

  Yes, those would need to be renegotiated anyway, which is why I expect people to jump into start extracting resources, lay claim to area for exploitation beforehand, etc.

So, that was a reference to a set of treaties between Humans and the Lovecraftian [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_One][Deep Ones]] in Charles Stross' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laundry_Files][Laundry Files series]], building upon Lovecraft's stories about Innsmouth. "Benthic" derives from the term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthos][benthos]] for organisms living on, in, or near the seabed.

The real-life equivalent would be the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed_Arms_Control_Treaty][Seabed Arms Control Treaty]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea][UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]].
