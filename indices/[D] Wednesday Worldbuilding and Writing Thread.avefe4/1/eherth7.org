I've been woolgathering on a story where the oceans turned suddenly intangible /only to humans/ (which is, admittedly, almost verbatim from an entry over on [[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]]).

To paint a picture: You can see the oceans only by what is in them, not the water, so all the creatures of the sea are 'airborne' when you're 'under water'. Fishes swim past you and you only feel their movements as if they were 'swimming' through air. But grab one and suddenly its buoyancy in water is cancelled and it behaves as if it was in air at that atmospheric depth, which mostly translates to sudden cases asphyxiation and decompression injuries.

On the other side of the spectrum, swimming in the oceans is suddenly impossible, because they're intangible to you. Furthermore if you were at sea when the switch happened, the boat you might have been on also suddenly gained (temporary!) intangibility and the drop from sea surface to seabed injured or killed you. Everything else, like weather patterns, is unaffected by that intangibility, by the way, unless a result of human-ocean interaction impacted it (that means: the ships and stuff falling from the surface to the bottom would impact like they were falling through air until their human passengers were dead, then the water is suddenly tangible again to them; the effects of oil spill on wildlife would be there).

In the immediate aftermath of the switch there's wide scale destruction and upheaval on account of all manned swimming sea platforms (like oil rigs) dropping from great height to their destruction, with subsequent ongoing huge oil spills. All the oil tankers and cargo ships that were in any ocean at the time experience the same fate. About half of all sea men / women on ships died. So... yeah.

The why and how this happened are mostly fleshed out (but irrelevant for this story), the source of conflict is clear, the location is 'under the sea'.

The story takes place decades after that switch, I am still undecided on whether the main characters lived through it or had only heard stories, but disregarding that, *I fear I am missing some of the less obvious effects an intangible ocean would have on people living there.* I mean, I figured that undersea dwellers would wear breathing masks when venturing outside that filtered all the detritus, sand, microbes, etc in the 'air' that would otherwise clog up their lungs of might infect them, buildings would be constantly inhabited by someone all the time (sudden compression of your habitat just because no one's in the house would screw everyone over) or be built to withstand the pressures, vehicles would be bigger wheeled and all terrain, and some of the smarter shallow water predators (sharks?) might take bites out of people if they can survive the sudden decompression-recompression of a successful attack.
