Are humans breathing the intangible water? (I'm curious).

The rock and sand at the bottom of the ocean is under immense pressure. I imagine a human walking along is going to struggle with the ground beneath their feet exploding constantly... but I'm not confident that would be the result. My reasoning is that even though the rock won't deform a lot, a small deformation causes it to violently shatter. Also, any dissolved gasses that are escaping will definitely explode. Watch out for porous things.

You can generate power by filling a room with a compressible gas and leaving it. The gas is crushed into a tank at the top of the room after you leave. Close the tank remotely, return to the room: instant ultra-pressurized gas, which can be fed to generators.

Bonus: expect explosive surprises when you visit any structure that has been abandoned. Air pockets will abound.

What happens to water that humans take with them? Does it turn intangible immediately, or only when it leaves their presence? The ocean area is a giant desert that gets no rain, from the human perspective.

Imagine leaving a glass of water alone outside. It would start flowing up out of the cup (it's buoyant in sea water) and vanishing as it mixed into the ocean.

Maybe you can install a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane#Reverse_osmosis][semipermeable membrane]] in your power generation structure to have it double as a water generation structure. Free pressure is useful.

Human-made sounds don't travel very far. Radio also doesn't work. That might be a problem, considering the land area on earth just quadrupled and people are going to want to start claiming it. How do you send commands to your armies? Communication cables and sonar stations, perhaps? What's the bandwidth and range on sonar?

Nuclear bunkers at the sea bottom will be popular; only manned missiles can get to you, and if they miss by a few feet the immense ambient pressure will protect the bunker. Also, missiles will be hard to aim, because...

Planes will work in this place, but they'd be /terrifying/ to fly in. No light, no sound, no comms, no way of gauging distance to the 'ground'. Maybe sonar on a stick is an option, but good luck dragging it through the water while flying. Maybe you'd need single-use sonar bundles attached to wires.

The former ocean is going to be a dangerous place.
