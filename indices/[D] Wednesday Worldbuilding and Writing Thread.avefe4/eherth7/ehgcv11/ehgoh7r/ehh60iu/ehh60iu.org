  A post-switch abandoned structure wouldn't have air pockets, unless they were generated after abandonment.

What do you breathe out? Is it instantly transformed into iwater, whatever it would be normally?

If it isn't transformed, gas pockets seem likely. If it is, human beings slowly start transforming all the carbon on Earth to iwater (unless they agree to systematically breath in underwater, leave, and carry out the presumable reverse transformation that occurs above sea level).

  Wouldn't work with how I think of the underlying mechanism. I think.

How about: a tank full of N2 at 'ambient' (from the human perspective) pressure. When a human leaves, the gas in the tank is compressed by the change to deep-ocean pressure. If you put a membrane over the opening of the tank, the volume that used to be filled with gas will be filled with freshwater.

Of course, good luck making a membrane that can handle such a sudden change--but I suppose you could put a valve in the neck of the tank that controls how fast the membrane experiences it.

This implies humans see with something other than light... or that the iwater permits the passage of electromagnetic radiation, and all the animals are affected by increased light levels. Humans seeing with something else makes more sense to me, given the circumstances.
