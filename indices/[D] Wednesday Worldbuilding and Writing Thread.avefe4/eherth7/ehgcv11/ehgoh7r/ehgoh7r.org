  Are humans breathing the intangible water? (I'm curious).
#+end_quote

Yes. H2O, (and a set of therein dissolved minerals like Na, Cl, Au, ...) are replaced by an atmospheric mixture comparable to air. The hard delineation of replacement for breathing purposes is outside one's reach. The /other/ stuff floating in sea water, be that sand, microbes, fish, etc /aren't/ replaced, which is why the breathing masks would be necessary.

  The rock and sand at the bottom of the ocean is under immense pressure. I imagine a human walking along is going to struggle with the ground beneath their feet exploding constantly... but I'm not confident that would be the result. My reasoning is that even though the rock won't deform a lot, a small deformation causes it to violently shatter. Also, any dissolved gasses that are escaping will definitely explode. Watch out for porous things.

Hm... reminds me of the Walking on Pluto scenario. My initial idea was that you'd sink into 'mud' if you just walked on the sea floor, since the sand is mixed with sea water, but you interacting with it replaces the sea water with air, which makes it lose it's cohesion. Basically like these [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4RA5I0FKs][liquid sand / fluidised air things]]. I'll definitely have to think on that. Explosions under your feet would be fun, but might detract.

  You can generate power by filling a room with a compressible gas and leaving it. The gas is crushed into a tank at the top of the room after you leave. Close the tank remotely, return to the room: instant ultra-pressurized gas, which can be fed to generators.
#+end_quote

Hm... wouldn't work as simply as you describe here, but might be doable. One major drawback would be building everything so it could withstand the instantaneous pressure change as you leave the premises.

#+begin_quote
  Bonus: expect explosive surprises when you visit any structure that has been abandoned. Air pockets will abound.
#+end_quote

A post-switch abandoned structure wouldn't have air pockets, unless they were generated after abandonment.

  What happens to water that humans take with them? Does it turn intangible immediately, or only when it leaves their presence? The ocean area is a giant desert that gets no rain, from the human perspective.
#+end_quote

If you're talking fresh water, that turns intangible if you pour it out and leave the premises. You can have a (fresh) water tank in the inhabited facility w/o worrying about it turning suddenly intangible, at least until you leave the premises. If you replace the opening space of the emptying water tank in use with a distinctly not air gas mixture (pure N2 for instance) that would be able to withstand the sudden pressure change of abandoning the facilities, then you can leave your home and come back and still have fresh water.

Your carpets might be ruined though.

  Imagine leaving a glass of water alone outside. It would start flowing up out of the cup (it's buoyant in sea water) and vanishing as it mixed into the ocean.
#+end_quote

Fascinating scenario! Also: true.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe you can install a semipermeable membrane in your power generation structure to have it double as a water generation structure. Free pressure is useful.
#+end_quote

Wouldn't work with how I think of the underlying mechanism. I think.

  Human-made sounds don't travel very far. Radio also doesn't work. That might be a problem, considering the land area on earth just quadrupled and people are going to want to start claiming it. How do you send commands to your armies? Communication cables and sonar stations, perhaps? What's the bandwidth and range on sonar?
#+end_quote

Bandwidth and range on sonar depend on a lot of things (you can have layers in the oceans where sonar can reach thousands of kilometres, see how submarine sonar screw with whales at that distance), and near shoreline seasteads would probably have had cables laid to them, but deep ocean seasteads would use buoys, anchored to the seabed outside their premises, that would trail cables down. The 'last mile' (might be more like a couple dozen metres in practice) would be sonar or radio, I think.

  Nuclear bunkers at the sea bottom will be popular; only manned missiles can get to you, and if they miss by a few feet the immense ambient pressure will protect the bunker. Also, missiles will be hard to aim, because...
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say popular, but ICBMs lose a lot of viability as a means of attack for seasteads.

#+begin_quote
  Planes will work in this place, but they'd be terrifying to fly in. No light, no sound, no comms, no way of gauging distance to the 'ground'. Maybe sonar on a stick is an option, but good luck dragging it through the water while flying. Maybe you'd need single-use sonar bundles attached to wires.
#+end_quote

You're right. In particular the upper couple hundred meters will be terrifying to cross, since that's where the lion's share of bigger aquatic life takes place, and if you go deeper the sun will notable dim (not because of the water, but because of all the detritus in the 'air' above); you'll fly either in darkness or a very dimm place with no shadows. I suspect there will be planes flying sub-oceanic, but these will be limited to research (and military) applications, and they'll fly much slower to deal with the bad conditions. As a rough approximation it will be like flying through ash-laden air (I'll have to look up numbers how ash-laden).

  The former ocean is going to be a dangerous place.
#+end_quote

Indeed :)
