Guns don't work.

Sure, the bullet leaves the barrel fine, but a half a metre or so away from the person firing the bullet it just slows down and /stops/. Same for just about any ranged weapon, really. Anything that fires a physical missile, anyway.

Sonic weapons, on the other hand, will be... interesting. They'll work extra-well against sharks and fish and so on, but presumably not against humans.
