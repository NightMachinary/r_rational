  It becomes impossible to drown in the ocean.
#+end_quote

Yup.

#+begin_quote
  How does this idea handle brackish water? At what point does the Chesapeake Bay or Potomac River become tangible?
#+end_quote

I'm still thinking on that, leaning on a blurry delineation where sweet water turns into salt water. Unless it comes up in story I'll probably ignore this.

#+begin_quote
  Does the intangible water still block light in the same way as before? You may experience light-related illnesses on the sea bottom, which would lead to increased light usage on the sea bottom, which would lead to light pollution in the depths.
#+end_quote

Yes and no. Light emitted from your inhabited facility still travels like through air for a set distance, but a random light outside would behave as if it was at that depth and heavily attenuated the more distant it is.

Good point with the light-related illnesses (Vitamin D deficiency, depression, increased alcoholism, ...).

  It is now monstrously cheaper to lay transoceanic cables for power and data transmission.
#+end_quote

I forgot about that! My initial thoughts went to metal mining, first deep sea nodules of manganese, then actual mining of sub-sea mountain ridges.

  A perfectly spherical, highly buoyant vessel is docked at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. All humans within it exit the vehicle. The vehicle is now no longer occupied. How fast does it ascend to the surface, and how can that be used as a weapon?
#+end_quote

There's limits due to water resistance. Highest speed possible would be with density of 0 and negligible drag. I'd have to calculate that. Regardless, all the airpockets inside the vessel would suddenly be filled with sea water, so that would also put a limiter on its ascent speed.

#+begin_quote
  The counter-operation is obvious: Float a massive object over someone's seafloor military base, then drop a human onto it from a helicopter to cause the vessel to smash into the seafloor base. The person riding the impactor pops a parachute, flies away, lands on the seafloor, and walks away, but the post-human-departure impactor is still traveling very quickly, and will likely hit the base with some force. It'll also just settle onto the base, as an area denial weapon until someone can get it buoyant enough to be floated off its target.
#+end_quote

As above, I'd have to calculate the maximum descent speed such an object could have, and how much it would slow inbetween the operator's departure and the object's impact. But regardless, you're right. "Death from Above" is suddenly much more threatening and realistic scenario, especially as a suicide tactic.

#+begin_quote
  You'd also be violating the Benthic Treaties.
#+end_quote

Yes, those would need to be renegotiated anyway, which is why I expect people to jump into start extracting resources, lay claim to area for exploitation beforehand, etc.
