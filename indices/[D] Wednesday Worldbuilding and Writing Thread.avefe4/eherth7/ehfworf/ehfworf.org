It becomes impossible to drown in the ocean.

How does this idea handle brackish water? At what point does the Chesapeake Bay or Potomac River become tangible?

Does the intangible water still block light in the same way as before? You may experience light-related illnesses on the sea bottom, which would lead to increased light usage on the sea bottom, which would lead to light pollution in the depths.

It is now monstrously cheaper to lay transoceanic cables for power and data transmission.

Some specialized jobs such as underwater welding become less specialized.

A perfectly spherical, highly buoyant vessel is docked at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. All humans within it exit the vehicle. The vehicle is now no longer occupied. How fast does it ascend to the surface, and how can that be used as a weapon?

The counter-operation is obvious: Float a massive object over someone's seafloor military base, then drop a human onto it from a helicopter to cause the vessel to smash into the seafloor base. The person riding the impactor pops a parachute, flies away, lands on the seafloor, and walks away, but the post-human-departure impactor is still traveling very quickly, and will likely hit the base with some force. It'll also just settle onto the base, as an area denial weapon until someone can get it buoyant enough to be floated off its target.

You'd also be violating the Benthic Treaties.
