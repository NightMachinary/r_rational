Not a milestone, but a significant accomplishment/feat of human progress: building cities and infrastructure. I mean, when I consider the skyscrapers and cathedrals that surround me have all been build by fellow ape-like creatures, I feel that's quite impressive.

Developing empathy and human level intelligence perhaps could be considered crucial early feats if you're (particularly) interested in ethics. (But perhaps random chance played to large a role in their development to call them "accomplishments".) As a predecessor to written language, I'd say spoken language is pretty impressive too.
