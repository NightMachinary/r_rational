I'm thinking that the list should be things that radically change human society, as opposed to incremental improvements). Probably most things that can be described as "The end of the monopoly of x" qualify. Here are some ideas:

- Cooking, food preservation
- Agriculture
- Cooperation and trading (no longer need to make everything you need yourself)
- Writing (no longer need to depend on personal memory)
- Money (replacing barter)
- The printing press (wide dissemination of written material)
- Efficient information storage, searching, and retrieval (this seems very much like computers, but I think the library card catalog counts)
- Industry (replace muscle power with machine power)
- The scientific method
- Recursion, or iterative improvement
- Individuals having the right to their own life (constitutionally limited democracy)
- Blogs / Facebook / etc (the end of the monopoly of publishers and broadcasters)

Future:

- Practical near-immortality
- Virtually all needs/wants provided by automated production
- Self-optimizing AI that doesn't kill or enslave everyone
- A solution to the problem of "I need really high energy density to do useful stuff, but it's also useful for making bombs"
