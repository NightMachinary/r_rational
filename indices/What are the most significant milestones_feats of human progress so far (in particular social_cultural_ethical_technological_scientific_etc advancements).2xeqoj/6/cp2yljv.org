I can't help but notice that most of your past milestones are positive, and almost all of your future milestones are negative.

That's probably because before something is invented we often hadn't knew we lacked it. So I'd guess there's probably twice more future milestones that we can't imagine waiting in future, and they might solve some of the negative future milestones, but not nessesarily solve them 100% (like irrigation haven't solved starvation 100%).

Also if you put "abolition of religion" there, the invention of organized religion should be there as well. It influenced our history a lot more than most of the other past milestones..

Also mathemathics isn't done.
