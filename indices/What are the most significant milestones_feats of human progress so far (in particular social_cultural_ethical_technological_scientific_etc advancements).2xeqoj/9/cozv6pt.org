Oh, a very important one. A great deal more important than what many people might think at first glance.

Alcoholic beverages.

Yes, they cause a great deal of pain and misery in the world. That being said, after people started living in large groups, the water that was available became foul and dangerous to drink. Weak beer, watered wine, and other light alcoholic beverages were safer to drink than water. Early medicine used alcohol as a painkiller. Without alcohol, our world would be a hugely different place.
