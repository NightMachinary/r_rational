/Note in hindsight: I should've said "pretty mean case," since I suppose its goodness is entirely subjective./

I really really really don't want to turn this sub to politics (since, as its now-inactive founder, I kinda have a vision for it, and political debate doesn't quite fit), so in lieu of typing out the whole argument myself, I'll kindly direct you to the best summary of NRx beliefs I know of, which is [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/][this SlateStarCodex post]]. I believe with about 80% confidence that the section you're looking for is entitled *Plays Well In Groups*, but I'm not sure if it would make much sense without context. Although the article is very long, like most SSC articles, it's also very good (also like most SSC articles). I highly recommend you read the whole thing, if you can find the time.

I'd also point you towards the relevant section in SSC's NRx rebuttal, but honestly that thing is so long that I've only read it once, so my (already cursory) memory isn't half as good in regards to that one. Sorry :/

Best of luck!
