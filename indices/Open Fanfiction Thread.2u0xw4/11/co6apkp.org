[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple][Scorpion's Disciple]] is a Naruto fanfic in which Sasori goes to ground in Konoha after losing most of his collection (for minor spoilery reasons which make sense from the canon universe) and he runs into academy student Naruto. IMO it features excellent characterization, both of actual characters, and of techniques and training/fight scenes.

Was never officially finished, but there is an author's note detailing how the epic final climactic battle would have gone down. Follows the original storyline, with significant deviations, up until the time skip. (I suspect the author's first language is not English, as there are minor grammatical errors here and there.)
