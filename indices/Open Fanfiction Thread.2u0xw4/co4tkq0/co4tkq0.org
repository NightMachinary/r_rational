[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul][Pokemon: The Sun Soul]] is my all time favorite fanfic. It's ALMOST a rational fic, the world is realistic and brutal and the characters, while I wouldn't call them exactly rational, are often very smart. I cannot recommend this one enough. Also, it's finished, and it has an ongoing sequel in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10539516/3/Foundations-of-the-World][Foundations of the World]]
