I kind of thought that Harry Potter and the Natural 20 IS rational fiction. Milo's thinking is VERY rational for the WEIRD alien universe he comes from, and to the extent that they've been explained so far, the rules of both universes and their interactions are predictable and possibly self-consistent. Although I'm not sure how much the story is going to explore the rules of the non-DnD universe since it's from Milo's perspective and it's doubtful he'll ever comprehend that much of it because he would probably have to take feats in Knowledge (physics) or something which would probably require him to class in "scientist" or something, and that isn't a character class available to him.
