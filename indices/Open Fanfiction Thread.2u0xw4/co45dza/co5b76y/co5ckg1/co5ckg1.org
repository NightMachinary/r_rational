I've actually argued that it's rational fiction before too, but from the standpoint that it pays meticulous detail to reasoning and where it gets you, rather than from arguing that anyone is behaving rationally. The opposing (and winning) theory at the time was that rational fiction should be about very smart and actually rational people with transhumanist leanings.

Milo's approach to the world makes sense in the world he's from - and I can't fault his rationality for the first few chapters - but at some point if he was a proper rationalist he'd have had a hefty "notice that you're confused" moment and rethought his worldview.
