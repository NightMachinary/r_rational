It would help if you listed the fanfic genres with the lists, where they have well defined ones. I mean Peggy Sue fic, darkfic, crossover, crackfic (altpower in the case of Worm).

I have to add Harry Potter and the Natural 20 in addition to your list. It's a HP/D&D crossover fic and has lots of level 1 intelligent characters with visible thought processes, each of which is completely wrong in their own lovingly crafted way.
