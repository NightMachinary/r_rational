[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]] is an AtlA fanfic. It is ridiculously good. It expands on the spirituality of the series in a believable way. Starts slow, but rapidly picks up the pace.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4381366/1/A-Matter-of-Honor][A Matter of Honor]] is another good AtlA fanfic. Not very serious, light hearted and believable Taang and Zutara. Plays with the series' spirituality as well, in a unique way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4041754/1/Time-and-Again][Time and Again]] is a Naruto time-travel fic handled pretty well. It's fairly old, and the sequel was never finished, but it's worth a standalone read. The twist ending's also pretty amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7415078/1/Naruto-Ouroboros][Naruto: Ouroboros]] An AU where Orochimaru didn't leave the village, Naruto was born eight years before the Kyuubi's attack and becomes his apprentice and his little sister's the jinchuuriki. Very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2218705/Kenchi618][Kenchi]] is a prolific Naruto fanfiction writer. I would highly recommend all of his fics (although the older ones are not as good) He does Naruto crossover ridiculously well. He made NarutoxStreet Fighter WORK.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5002293/1/A-Protector-s-Pride][A Protector's Pride]] is a Bleach fanfic that's really good. It's a retelling of canon after a certain point. Nothing's drastically different, at first, it's just grittier and more well written. This butterflies into AU later. Wouldn't suggest going into it without prior Bleach knowledge, at least up to when Ichigo meets the Vizard.

General tip for the noobie fanfiction viewer as well: On fanfiction.net, I suggest sorting by reviews and going from the top down in whatever category you please. Obviously, not all top reviewed stories are AMAZING but you can usually find some of the best of the bunch in at least the top 30-40 in any fandom you can name.
