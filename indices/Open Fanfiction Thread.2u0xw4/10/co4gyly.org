[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][*"Prince of the Dark Kingdom"*]] is thus far the only non-rational Potter fanfic (out of the 4 other top recommended ones I've tried) that has successfully held my attention. I still didn't finish the whole thing because it's not /consistently/ awesome, but /certain parts/ of it are extremely awesome. (It's really good, it's just harder to hook me as I am getting older. I rarely finish giant stories these days unless they are uber level or meted out in short doses.)

*Summary* (no major spoilers): Due to small alterations in distant past events, Voldemort is no longer shortsighted and insane (but still sociopathic) and Harry's parents fled with him to Germany, but they still die for unrelated reasons. We start out with Harry in Pivot Drive and Voldemort as leader of Wizarding Britain and Headmaster of Hogwarts. Make no mistake, Riddle is evil and the world is much darker underneath his rule...but, business does continue as usual and at least some things are better, simply due to Riddle's rational self interest and the lack of constant warfare between the light and dark following his decisive victory.

*Why it's good*: It's not the plot, it's the world building. The book /really/ fleshes out the world. The mechanisms of magic are linked to a system based on fairly well researched pagan mythology. Also, we find out all about the other societies - international politics, werewolf clans, elves. You might randomly stop reading because the plot isn't addictive, but it is satisfying. I'm told it gets even better in the parts I haven't read yet.

(Admittedly, I started reading it in the first place because I decided to /check/ what people said the best fanfic was after reading hpmor, so this is not an independent observation of quality)
