Very late with this, but [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/][Barb]]

This guy re-wrote his own HP books 5-7. So everything up to the Goblet of Fire follows canon, but it diverges heavily. I've read both these and the original books 5-7. Barb's are better. Easily. Especially Book 7. A must read for any HP reader. Even one who isn't big into function.
