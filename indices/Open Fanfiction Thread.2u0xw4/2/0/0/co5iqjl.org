I also liked Galton's Children by the same author. All the other fics I listed here have good plots, but there aren't many stories I know of that have both good storytelling and prose, at least not catering to my tastes of preferring action stories over romance. Usually I prefer fics that have exciting, action-packed stories with decent prose over stories with good prose but stories that interest me a little less. But I have read quite a few romance fics that do both well. Here are some I've read:

Persona 4:

1. [[http://badx2bathhouse.livejournal.com/543.html?thread=136735#t136735][Predawn Girls]] is a Persona 4 AU in which all of the male characters from the game are girls and focuses mainly on a Souji/Yosuke romance, though there is a nonromantic plot too. Here's the summary: Yasogami High is now St. Yasogami's School for Girls, a small, well-known, all-girls boarding school with a reputation for taking in delinquents. Local families get a huge discount for sending their daughters there, as a "reward" for putting up with the place. Nearly all the girls are dangerous in some way. There's a more readable, edited version of it on AO3 [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/329124/chapters/531072][here]], but that version is incomplete. The prose was pretty good iirc, and the dialogue really stood out for how good it was. It felt similar in tone to Chanson de Geste, though I don't think the plot was as good.

The Legend of Korra:

1. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2808119/chapters/6302432][Icarus and the Sea]], though I have to warn you that I haven't finished reading it yet (around 20% through). Still, so far it does a really good job of portraying Varrick and Zhu Li's relationship which I think is pretty impressive since Varrick especially seems tricky to write well since he's funny but really weird and kind of a jerk. The prose is good, and the dialogue is well-written.

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8442158/1/dream-of-the-lotus-in-bloom][Dream of the Lotus in Bloom]] takes place in an AU where Amon kidnapped and raised her from childhood. It does a really nice job with Korra and Amon's unhealthy father/daughter relationship and the AU was explored well. The prose is pretty good too, but I felt a bit hesitant about recommending it earlier since it comes across as a little too melodramatic at times (though the conflict Korra goes through probably warrants it) and there's something about the prose that, while good, bothered me a little, though I couldn't put my finger on what it was. Definitely worth looking into, though. There's some Mako/Korra romance too, though it's not the main focus.

Also, if what you liked about Chanson de Geste was mainly the dialogue, then you might like A Day in the Life or Sacred Host, which I listed above.
