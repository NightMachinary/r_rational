Here are some fanfics I've enjoyed:

Narnia:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5615090/1/Chanson-de-Geste][Chanson de Geste]] by LVDB is my all-time favorite, a Narnia fanfic that presents a more realistic view of Narnia based on medieval history and politics and focuses on the ghost of the White Witch, Jadis, haunting Edmund. It even manages to make you like Jadis while not undermining her status as a genocidal villain.

Harry Potter:

1. The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AlexandraQuick][Alexandra Quick]] series takes place after the events of Harry Potter, but in Magical America. The cast is all OCs, but the story is great and makes good use of its setting with plenty of references to American history.

Zero no Tsukaima/Familiar of Zero:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7736264/1/Emperor-of-Zero][Emperor of Zero]] is a Zero no Tsukaima fic in which Louise summoned Napoleon Bonaparte instead of Saito, resulting in a story that focuses more on politics and military strategy. Yudkowsky has recommended it in one of the HPMOR author notes.

My Little Pony:

1. [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/5523/nights-favoured-child][Night's Favored Child]] is an MLP alternate universe fic in which Nightmare Moon won against Celestia long ago and rules Equestria, which hasn't seen the sun in thousands of years. Twilight becomes her student.

2. [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/55377/blueblood-hero-of-equestria][Blueblood: Hero of Equestria]] is an MLP fic where Prince Blueblood is forced into being an officer in a war with the Changelings. He's selfish and cowardly and doesn't really want to fight, but he ends up doing some pretty heroic things because he's not as stupid or stubborn as the military higher-ups. This fics has really engaging narration and does a good job of making Blueblood likeable.

Avatar: the Last Airbender:

1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108225/1/][Gilded Green]] is an Avatar: the Last Airbender fanfic about how the Dai Li capture and brainwash Lu Ten after the Battle of Ba Sing Se. The brainwashing is chilling and is balanced well by the portrayal of the Dai Li as humans with families and ambitions that they are willing to do horrible things for.

2. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3036180/1/][The Problem with Zuko]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6360866/1/][When All Your Dreams Come True]] are excellent, unrelated-but-similar oneshots about the Avatar from Avatar: The Last Airbender being captured by the Fire Nation/by Zuko and Zuko realizing that that is not a good thing.

3. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4845588/1/][His Father's Son]] is a oneshot about Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender learning to rule the Fire Nation. Some of the plotline might seem familiar, but it was actually written long before the comics were released.

Madoka Magica:

1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] is a Madoka Magica fanfic that takes place four hundred years in the future, where magical girls have come out of hiding to help fight an alien invasion of human worlds. This fic has a lot of excellent worldbuilding and an interesting story.

Code Geass/Elfen Lied:

1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5327665/1/][Galton's Children]] is a Code Geass/Elfen Lied crossover. It's also written by LVDB and has really good dialogue.

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia][Lelouch of Britannia]] is probably the most popular Code Geass fic, and for good reason. It's an AU where Lelouch wasn't exiled from Britannia and has some well-written battle scenes. Updates are very slow, though.

Bartimaeus:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3854897/1/A-Day-in-the-Life][A Day in the Life]] is a Bartimaeus Trilogy fic set in an AU without magic. Bartimaeus is a human bookstore owner and Nathaniel is his employee. Kitty is a waitress at the cafe across the street. Unlike some modern AU stories, it has an actual plot: Nathaniel overhears Simon Lovelace, a politican, doing something shady and is put in danger because of it. The dialogue and narration are great, which is essential for a Bartimaeus fic. It's slow-paced at first, but the humor and dialogue keep it entertaining even then.

Animorphs:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464631/1/Sacred-Host][Sacred Host]] is about a Yeerk who infests a religious young Christian girl and is influenced by her faith. I know a lot of people here aren't particularly fond of religion, but this story is well-written and quite funny.

2. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/93341/chapters/127330][Out of the Blue Box]] is a sort-of-munchkiny Animorphs fic about transgender people post-series who use or choose not to use the morphing technology to permanently morph into the opposite sex.
