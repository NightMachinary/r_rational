Thanks for the reminder of 'Here be Dragons' - I forgot to include that in my list, it was so good, especially [[/s][Spoiler]] - it was really only one of a few scenarios where it'd work well . Sadly I couldn't get into 'An Imago of Rust And Crimson' despite 3 separate attempts. Security and Zenith were kind of meh for me, but I'll definitely read 'When a Lioness fights' and I don't mind the Drarry slashfic - especially when it's well done, like it was in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]].

Sadly I couldn't get into any Naruto fanfiction I've found as well - and I've tried at least 5 separate stories.
