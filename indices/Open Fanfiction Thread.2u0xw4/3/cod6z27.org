He's ready to be kiled by his dragon, but then something magical happens. Elements of HP and DRoP, with many OC characters and a heavy helping of judiciously-applied justice. NSFW chapter disclaimers, but no smut, and all sex is off-screen.\\
  Warnings: depression, wounds, suicide, politics, death, OC, religion, threesomes. *SEQUELS*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186304/1/On-the-Wings-of-Dragons][On the Wings of Dragons]] and in-progress [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10301672/1/Beneath-Sovereign-Skies][Beneath Sovereign Skies]]

Not a pleasant fic, about 0.75 /Worm/ in terms of gruesome. Invents a lot of things.\\

At times dark and messed up, lots of body modification, some downright disturbing accidents, and any sort of canon plot progression just got thrown out the window. *Long and unfinished*.
