*Harry Potter:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills][Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills]] Really good alternate Book 6+7 (before the release of either), and a wonderful characterisation of Severus.

*Star Wars:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2897153/1/The-Shadow-of-Vader][The Shadow of Vader]] Don't let the fact it's not "Published" deceive you - it's just lacking a planned epilogue, so the story is completed and in a very satisfying way. Best SW fanfic I've read. It's an alternate universe diverging from ROTS where Obi-Wan becomes Darth Vader.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2945228/1/Fall-of-the-Sith][Fall of the Sith]] & [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2987152/1/Descent-Into-The-Dark][Descent into the Dark]] Absolutely brilliant AU diverging from ROTS where Mace Windu kills Palpatine. Has a prequel (which works with canon) set hundreds of years before that tells the story of Yoda's touch with the dark side (and explains how come Yoda knows so much about the Sith in Episode I).

*Star Wars EU:*

[[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gvdfqocb976an44/-W4fVfxqbf][Legacy of the Sith]] This is a series of eight books. Technically, Legacy of the Sith is books 5-8, with 1-3 being an AU of New Jedi Order. /However,/ it's not entirely necessary to read 1-3 (or the intervening short fic 4), nor to know much about the EU - I started reading book 5 (Age of Heroes) and understood everything in short order even without reading any of the post-movie EU (just relied on Wookieepedia to fill in gaps), and it was so brilliant it actually got me into reading the EU!
