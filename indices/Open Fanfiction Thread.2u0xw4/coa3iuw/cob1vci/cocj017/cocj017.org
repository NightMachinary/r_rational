For BoF2, you won't need canon knowledge. It has enough description and backstory for you to figure out everything on your own.

Queen of Sorrow is probably the one where canon knowledge is the most helpful. Almost all of the characters that are very accurately portrayed. As you say, you won't really appreciate it without having played the game (or possibly having read the game-script for [[http://serenesforest.net/path-of-radiance/scripts/game-script/][FE9]], [[http://serenesforest.net/radiant-dawn/scripts/game-script/][FE10]], and the [[http://serenesforest.net/path-of-radiance/scripts/supports/][support conversations]]). And just straight dialogue is a shoddy substitute when compared to having visuals and music and gameplay. As much as I liked it, you might want to pass on it if you aren't familiar with the series.

I read the Fifth Act only having watched the Advent Children movie, and not having played FF7. I found it enjoyable, but it's not especially different from any other Peggy Sue. I think it'd make a bigger impact on people who've played the game. A wiki-page would be sufficient if you wanted to read it.

I Just Want a Vacation requires almost no canon knowledge of Zelda to appreciate (it's semi-AU anyway). A few minutes glance at a wiki-page is enough for back-story. It's not deep or complex. I just liked it because it was amusing, and I liked some of the ideas that sprang up at the end of the story.
