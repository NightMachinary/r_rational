Some video game favourites of mine:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6615342/1/Breath-Of-Fire-II-War-Of-The-Demons][Breath of Fire 2: War of the Dragons]] - straight game novelization. It's also my favourite non-rational fic, because it really brings the game cast to life. I also love the developing theme of fighting "destiny bullshit."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5465572/1/Queen-of-Sorrow][Queen of Sorrow]] - Fire Emblem AU with an originally morally-pure character falling off a slippery slope to evil. A bit contrived at times. Great characterization of Ike (normally the protagonist of the series).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5951824/1/The-Fifth-Act][The Fifth Act]] - FF7 Peggy Sue. Cloud makes relatively poor choices to take advantage of time travel, but he seems pretty in-character (I haven't played FF7, though, so no guarantees).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5264810/1/I-Just-Want-a-Vacation][I Just Want a Vacation]] - Zelda, Post-MM. Features OP Link trying to stay under the radar. The grammar is a bit weaker at the start (the author isn't a native English speaker) but picks up in the middle. There's better Zelda fics out there, but I loved the theme that developed in this one about 3/4 through the story.
