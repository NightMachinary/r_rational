In the rational Narutoverse, ninja fight with surprise attacks and one hit kills waaay more than one piece. There's no need for stealth when the only battleground is ships on the ocean. Anything along these lines, Law would be subpar at. Infiltration, information gathering, sneak attacks, surprise attacks, and spy ousting would all have the potential to seriously harm or setback Law. In a fight, speed would be his downfall. Ninja are used to rapid teleporting and switching due to kawarimi. I'm not sure how jutsu would interact - can he cut fire or wind? He can teleport, but can he bring others with him? What if he needs to protect a friend? Could fuinjutsu cancel his powers? If he cut a shadow clone would it pop or the pieces suspended? If he scrambles someone to another's body and they henge into their original body, are they still at a disadvantage?
