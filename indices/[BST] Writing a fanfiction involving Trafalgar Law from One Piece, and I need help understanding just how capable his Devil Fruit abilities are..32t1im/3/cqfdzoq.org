  There appears to be no way to resist being cut if you are hit, although it is hinted that a sufficiently powerful user of armament haki could take the hit. This is subverted when the most proficient user of armament haki in the series so far is cut in half.

I think that this is because Law's haki was simply stronger than Virgo's and therefore he was able to cut him apart.

Law's major (and probably only) real weakness is that his powers drain his stamina or whatever quickly. He can't really use his powers for a very long time, although if one really applied his powers to the fullest there would never be a long enough fight for this to effect anything.

I'd recommend using his stamina as a limiter to begin with and then maybe Law can use rational reasoning to figure out how to overcome this problem.
