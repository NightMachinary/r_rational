Law can control pretty much everything in his 'room'. But to be safe if the opponent is someone obviously stronger like doffy or admiral spec then dont have him swapping their brain or getting their heart because i think something is stopping him from doing this to stronger opponents.

Also when your done submit your fanfiction to fiction pad there is a growing [[https://fictionpad.com/fandom/1003/One-Piece][One Piece fanfiction]] community there :)
