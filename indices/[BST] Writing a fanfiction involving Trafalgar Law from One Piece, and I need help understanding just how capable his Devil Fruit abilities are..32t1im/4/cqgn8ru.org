I think, rationally, once someone got into Law's room, he had won. So I think you would need to tweak it such that preparing the room is, usually, too time consuming to feasibly use. Kind of like how Kakashis Raikiri (at least when he used it against Zabusa) wouldn't be feasible in a battle unless the opponent was immobilized. And even then, if your opponent is bound long enough for you to stand still and charge for a monologue's worth of time, you could definitely find a less chakra intensive way to kill them. So with Law, I think you could tweak it such that he has a hierarchy of rooms he can set up. So his One Piece one could be the fully realized form of this blood line. But it takes long to set. So maybe he can use smaller, less effective rooms to start with. Maybe he can only cut someone with a little bit more force than an average sword swing in his first tier room. And perhaps he can only heal surface injuries with said first tier. If Law has his fully realized abilities from the get go, and isn't slow about it, the only tactic people can employ against him is "don't get caught in the room". Which means you'd be hard pressed to write good fight scenes, as it would involve Law either wrecking his opponent, or getting wrecked at high speeds (or maybe super long distances, I'm thinking Deidara would counter him handily)
