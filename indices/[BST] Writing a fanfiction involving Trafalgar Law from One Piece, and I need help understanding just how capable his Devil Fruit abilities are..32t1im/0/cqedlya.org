Frankly, Law's abilities are overpowered as hell, especially since unlike most of his other characters, Oda never really set up hard limits on what Law could do. Though if you're just gonna keep Law like his canon self and throw him in Naruto, that could work. Just...you're bringing this up to the "rational" reddit here, and powers like that seem really ripe for abuse.
