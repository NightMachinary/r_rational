Sorry I missed these notifications! The protagonist is battling PTSD in a manner that is realistic(ie not used solely for plot advancement or freak outs) and the antagonist necromancers are not only skilled:rational adversaries, but have their own sensible goals besides “we're evil neecromancers let's make a zombie horde”.

I would say PGTE tops it, but I would definitely recommend it, as the author has since properly edited the story from when it was just available on a PDF, and it's much improved from something that I thought was already quite good.

Also the supporting cast is quite good, with the cimmmon theme being every soldier sent to the camp they're in is recovering from a tragedy or some kind of job related screwup.
