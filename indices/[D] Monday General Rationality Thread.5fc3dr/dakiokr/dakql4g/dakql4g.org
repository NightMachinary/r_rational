(Caveat: As a student myself, I don't have the expertise to give strong career advice, so please only minorly update on this, even if it sounds like a good idea)

First off, [[https://80000hours.org/][80,000 Hours]] if you haven't seen it already, has some of the best EA-aligned career advice out there. I'd recommend reading up on their career profiles, especially for being a doctor and the stuff on the tech sector.

Their staff are also very responsive, and have been helpful (in my experience) when I've emailed them with queries. All around great people.

I think a lot of this has to do with comparative advantage. If you think that you're reasonably better than most other medical candidates, than that may actually be a better bet. A friend of mine, for example, switched from coding to working at an NGO because she felt that her work as a coder was only mediocre.

If you're just interested in some general information on App Academy and doctors, here are the relevant 80K links:

[[https://80000hours.org/2012/08/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save/][Doctor stuff]]

Emailing some App Academy grads (like Buck) could also be a good preliminary step to see about what sorts of reasoning they had for switching.

Overall, my advice is to get more information from people who know more about these things. A lot of EAs are happy to discuss their reasoning, as well as impact, and I hope this helps you out.
