I have a triage call tomorrow with my clinic about my anxiety. I know what drug to mention to them, since it's worked on me before, and frankly I'm going to be really glad to get back to proper neurochemical functioning. Spending most of my time with a continuous low-level panic attack just isn't useful, even when I rationally endorse the thought that danger is in fact ahead.
