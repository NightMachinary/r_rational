I haven't seen too many good intro-friendly posts on people interested in the rationality community. Linking people to LessWrong directly without a good guide doesn't seem great (I bumbled around a lot when I first stumbled upon it).

To that end, I'm working on a short essay that introduces cognitive psych, biases, and some quirks of the rationalist community in a general way. I could then link that to friends, instead of just sending them a glut of disorderly links.

Would anyone be interested in reviewing some draft versions of the essay to give some feedback?
