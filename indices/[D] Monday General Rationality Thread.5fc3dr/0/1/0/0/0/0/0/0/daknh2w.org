I think we agree and you just misread my initial statement - citizens argue all the time, but just because the Democrat and Republican parties /appear/ to have different values doesn't mean the representatives in Congress do. They might not agree on what the citizens argue about, but they do agree on basic things like: "I want to be reelected," and, "I want a higher salary." Laws /do/ get passed, and in my opinion, most of the time they inconvenience the citizens.
