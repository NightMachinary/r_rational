Citizens cant agree on anything â‰  Congressmen can't agree on anything

The gridlock would be good if the Congress was perfectly representative of the needs of the people, but that's not the case at all. I would supply evidence, but I think you already have /something/ in mind.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)][This amuses me greatly.]] You do understand that you're arguing for /your own/ disenfranchisement, right? A hilariously small percentage of people actually actively participate in political discussion the way the two of us are doing right now. You may not consider yourself an extremist, and it's true that you're probably not radical within your own social circle, but if you went up to a random person on the street and struck up a political conversation with them, chances are you would be doing most of the talking.

Just take a moment to bask in the specialness of not being a lurker for a minute. For the two of us, there are two hundred other people out there who never even post on reddit at all. There are probably people reading this now, who will look at this comment and move on, who have never participated in a single conversation over the internet. Do they feel more disenfranchised than us, not ever talking, not ever giving input? I wouldn't know, I'm not a lurker.
