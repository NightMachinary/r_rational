  Right-wing politics aren't anti-intellectual, although I can't speak for Trump supporters. They are strongly anti-establishment - this has intersections with anti-intellectualism, but it's important to understand that sometimes rationality and right-wing politics aren't mutually exclusive.

I don't think anti-establishment politics are confined to the Right at all these days. /Everyone/ hates the establishment right now.
