Right-wing politics aren't anti-intellectual, although I can't speak for Trump supporters. They are strongly /anti-establishment/ - this has intersections with anti-intellectualism, but it's important to understand that sometimes rationality and right-wing politics /aren't/ mutually exclusive.

It's understandable that they're paranoid about intellectualism when the academic establishment has such a history of being dubious, and they themselves are conservative socially. It's not as if they're against studies in general (in fact, studies help legitimize their claims) - they're against /your/ studies, or they think your studies don't paint the whole picture. There are plenty of intriguing studies for the other side on issues liberals don't even tend to consider, and those keep a lot of people on the right who would otherwise leave. I can't name anything off the top of my head, but if you ask somebody for sources, you'll find /something/.

[[/r/AskTrumpSupporters]] isn't a good place to reassure yourself that this presidency won't be a disaster, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][because they're not as representative of Trump as Trump himself is]] - remember that many people voted for Trump begrudgingly, just to keep Hillary out of office. It's like going to /pol/ expecting to find people mourning the death of Castro. Trump himself is probably more left than half the people on that sub.

Also, picture this: In the wake of that massive invalidation of psychology studies, and the near stagnation of the field of quantum study, the people arguing against the current academic environment may not be all wrong. In the same way that people advocate returning to the Enlightenment roots of the constitution, there may be people who reject the modern publishing industry and strive for the virtues first established in the Scientific Revolution. There are people who reject the academic establishment who are /not/ anti-intellectual, the same way the people who want to return to the roots of the constitution are not anti-government. It's possible to be an academic conservative, or even a conservative rationalist, because the fundamentals of the movement are embarrassingly broad (and encompass both people who would identify as politically conservative and those who identify as libertarian-left).

Granted, the people who use this as an excuse to not change their minds /ever/ are wrong, but that's not the fault of right-politics any more than Lenin is the fault of the left-ideology. Some people are beyond the reach of rationality, but that is no reason to discount an entire political hemisphere! The biggest problem here is that you poured buckets into the desert to try to raise the sanity waterline, when you should have been digging canals in the lush fields. It might not be remarkable to preach the virtues of rationality in [[/r/Libertarian]], but it's more liable to give you results.
