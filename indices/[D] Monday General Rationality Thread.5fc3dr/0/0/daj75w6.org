I spent a little bit of time on [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters]] but I came away with the feeling that what I felt [[/r/AskTrumpSuporters]] should be wasn't what it was. The modding explicitly disallows hardball questions and even so the Trump supporters on there always are complaining that they get attacked.

Anyway I wish you luck. I think it's fair to say based on polling that the [[/r/the_Donald]] style Trump supporters are in the minority both of the country and even of Trump voters. It is strange though and scary. I don't think it just comes from one side though. Politics sadly isn't an intellectual game and few people know how to even start engaging with it as if it was.
