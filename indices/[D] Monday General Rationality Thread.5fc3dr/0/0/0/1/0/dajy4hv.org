Well yes, being a college educated professional and being smart are not the same thing. However, if somebody spends most of their time on menial or physical labor they're not going to have as much time or energy to focus on intelectual things, are they? And even then, I wasn't just talking about people who aren't college aged professionals. Sometimes people get really really busy and they don't feel like they have time to really sit down and think about things much. And while I suppose they could just make time, if they don't really sit down and think about things more then they'll never realize how important it is to do that. A lot of people might be smarter than they realize but just don't apply their intelligence that much. Take this with a grain of salt though, since I haven't actually read any studies that suggest whether this is an actually significant factor in why most people aren't intellectuals.

Also, saying it sounds like something that someone in the philosophy subreddit would say doesn't actually tell me anything since I am not familiar with that subreddit. But keep in mind that I did say it was just speculation. I don't really know enough about social psychology to really say for sure whether any of my speculation is actually true, and I don't have any idea how to test it. I was merely raising a possibility.
