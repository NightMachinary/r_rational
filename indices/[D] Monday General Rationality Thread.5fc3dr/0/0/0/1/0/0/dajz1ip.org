  However, if somebody spends most of their time on menial or physical labor they're not going to have as much time or energy to focus on intelectual things, are they?

That's... /really/ not true. Sorry, it's just not. I mean, I could compare by saying, "If someone spends most of their time on skilled cognitive labor in front of a computer desk, they're not going to have as much time or energy to focus on intellectual things, are they?" The jobs we think of as "more intellectual" usually aren't Intellectual in the capital-I sense /anyway/.

  And even then, I wasn't just talking about people who aren't college aged professionals.

Ok. I was just trying to point out where some of the anti-intellectualism comes from: "intellectual" designation is perceived to track a class difference rather than a map-territory fit.

  A lot of people might be smarter than they realize but just don't apply their intelligence that much. Take this with a grain of salt though, since I haven't actually read any studies that suggest whether this is an actually significant factor in why most people aren't intellectuals.

Most people aren't intellectuals because we mostly don't educate them to be intellectuals. This includes most white-collar professionals. LW, [[/r/rational]] and the rest are /unusually/ focused on large-scale intellectualism, /among/ communities, even among the educated, who focus on anything.

Most people don't get philosophy (in the academic philosophy sense) or rationality (in the statistical sense) lessons, ever, in their lives, and in fact, many attempts to use Philosophy or Rationality (in the economic sense) in common conversation are blatant manipulation.

When we keep intellectualism a rare skill that is commonly used to manipulate people, people are, well, kinda rational to somewhat distrust it. But it's also very cultural: people in Israel are /impressed/ that I went to the Technion (their Institute of Technology), with zero total allegations of egg-headedness.

(Of course, the last known allegation of being an "egghead" AFAIK was from Rainbow Dash to Twilight Sparkle. Does anyone actually /say/ "egghead" anymore?)

  Also, saying it sounds like something that someone in the philosophy subreddit would say doesn't actually tell me anything since I am not familiar with that subreddit.

Sorry, I meant it sounded sophomoric: like someone who knows what big ideas are, but doesn't really know how to handle ideas in a subtle, fine-grained way yet.
