Definitely! The newest R! Animorphs chapter does a great job of illustrating how fun writing can lead to some great learning. The references in Marco's POV to Labyrinths of Reason, for example.

I was thinking of a quick 5 minute-ish read I could send to friends that sort-of lays out the landscape, so I don't think this competes too hard for some other niches?
