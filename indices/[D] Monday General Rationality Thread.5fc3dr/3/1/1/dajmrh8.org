I also agree that R:A-Z does a good job of leveling people up. The LW wiki is also very informative.

I'm looking for a quicker read I can send friends so that if they're interested, they get a sense for what the Sequences are like (e.g. letting them know it's often anecdote / technical in places).

For me, the Sequences were often pretty abstract, and knowing beforehand what the general gist of what they'd been trying to get across would have been helpful.
