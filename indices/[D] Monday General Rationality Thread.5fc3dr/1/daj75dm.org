I've been using the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en][StayFocusd extension]] for Chrome, which limits time on whatever websites you want it to, either to certain hours or for a certain amount of time (or both). For me, that's reddit, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon video, and then a whole bunch of other sites that I use less often. That leaves me to do productive things, like writing.

I've been fairly astounded by how effective it's been for me. You'd think that it would be simple to just say "okay, don't go on those sites if you want to do more productive things" but I've increasingly come to realize that good habits are a matter of conserving willpower and altering patterns more than simply doing or not doing things. I've seen lots of advice for dieting that says it's simple, just make sure that calories in are lower than calories out ... which seems to deny that the basic problem lies within the brain.

(None of this is particularly new, but I haven't really applied it to my life too much before.)
