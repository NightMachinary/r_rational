  just make sure that calories in are lower than calories out ... which seems to deny that the basic problem lies within the brain.

I've read:

1) Get into the habit of cooking your meals/only buying food that requires cooking

2) Don't eat outside of meals

3) Go grocery shopping when full.

4) Buy healthy foods.

5) Buy small plates and bowls.

Which sounds like a much more psychology based diet plan.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to test it because I don't do the shopping. And apparently everyone else in the house thinks ensuring that the fridge contains a constant stream of Egg Nog and Chocolate Milk is a good idea...
