Yeah, I've had good luck with it so far. Originally I was going to do a similar thing with our router, but the results were really inconsistent. I've never had it block things I didn't want blocked, and it's even surprised me with a few things I hadn't thought of (like the fact that pages that you got to from a blacklisted site count against your time the same as a blacklisted site does).
