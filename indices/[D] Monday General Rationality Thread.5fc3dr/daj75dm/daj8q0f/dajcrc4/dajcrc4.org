My biggest problem with leechblock is the lack of a "Fuck it, I'm taking a break" button. Which means if I really want to stop the blocking (which I will, at some point, no matter how many layers of pre-commitment I put myself through) my only choice is to disable the extension entirely, and then I never bother to turn it back on.
