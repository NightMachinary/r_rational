I've always thought that [[/r/FULLCOMMUNISM]] and [[/r/COMPLETEANARCHY]] are pretty dank. They just have the problem that, well, the Dems are so goddamned /milquetoast/. I mean, I literally voted for the anti-vaxxer over fucking Hillary. The fucking Green Party! I was having to tell my friends to write in Bernie Sanders, the "legitimate" candidates were so fucking awful.

Also I'm not drunk and high enough most of the time to really dank it up.
