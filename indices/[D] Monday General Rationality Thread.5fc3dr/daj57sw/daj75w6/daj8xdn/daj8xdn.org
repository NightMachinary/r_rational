what exactly are the causes of anti-intellectualism being so pervasive?

Now that I think about it, if you try to run a campaign against prejudice or discrimination against any other minority group, people might be more likely to change their minds. But if that minority group is just intellectuals--that is to say, smart people who actually use their smarts and enjoy doing so--then most people will probably just feel insulted, because the implication is that /they/ are not smart people who actually use their smarts. But the fact is, most people aren't and not due to any fault of their own. Most people probably don't have the time, energy or attention necessary to think deeply about things, or to learn to think deeply about things.

Also, this is just pure speculation, but I wonder if maybe a lot of intellectuals started out as just average intelligence people who've then had more practice thinking deeply and analytically--more chances to hone their intellects, and either got less negative reinforcement for expressing deep analytical thoughts or who were able to just ignore the negative reinforcement. Like, somebody who is new to thinking deeply and analytically would probably think, say and do a lot of very stupid things, so in order to avoid embarrassment from expressing stupid thoughts, they just avoid deep thinking?

After all, being willing to think deeply about things isn't the same thing as being more intelligent.
