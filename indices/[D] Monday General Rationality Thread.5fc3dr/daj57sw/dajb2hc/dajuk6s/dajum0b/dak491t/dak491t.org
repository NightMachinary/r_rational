  Yes, and that's why the two party system is a useless piece of trash.

I have mixed feeling about that.

One one hand, two parties invariably leads to centrist candidates, gridlock in congress, absolutely glacial change, and disenfranchisement amongst a lot of people.

On the other hand, that's exactly what the founders intended, and so far, it's worked.

"Real change," even for broken things, doesn't happen. But at the same time, neither party has the ability to really fuck things up while they're in office, combined with our other checks and balances. It's why I'm not particularly worried about trump-- given free reign, he'd do a lot of stupid shit, but that very partisanship everyone hates so much will be stalling him in the senate, unless he buckles down and actually compromises for once in his life.

Similarly, extremists from both parties kind of deserve to be disenfranchised. They get to have their say in the primaries, but they don't deserve to steer the national conversation.

So the result is that if you're not already fucked to the point where only government intervention will save you, the government is sort of a nonissue with regards to whether you're ultimately succesfull or not. And while I think the US could do with a better safety net, that's still superior to the government being directly impactful on every citizen's day to day life.
