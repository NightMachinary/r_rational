So, are you telling me that global or national concerns won't have an impact on my everyday life?

That's wrong. Global and /particularly/ national concerns /do/ have an effect on my everyday life.

Your systems and balances won't prevent that. It'll delay it, it'll make the effects hard to aim at any individual person, it might even soften the impact when it does hit and spread it out over more people...

...but if your president doesn't have an /eventual/ impact on your day-to-day life, then he's not the one holding the power.
