  Citizens cant agree on anything â‰  Congressmen can't agree on anything

Citizens /can't/ agree on anything. Even people who want to fix climate change will split strongly across pro/anti nuke lines. So it's good that congress effectivelly needs a supermajority before taking action

Well, yeah. But I'm not getting fully automated luxury gay space communism anytime soon anyways. The views that I hold which are extremist aren't catered to, and that's the system working as intended. If a group wants a change from the status quo, then it's their prerogative to convince /people/, not politicians, that they should be listened too. Anything else is just another form of oligarchy.

  A hilariously small percentage of people actually actively participate in political discussion the way the two of us are doing right now.

Exactly. Extremists make up only a small proportion of the population. Letting them (us) control political discource just because they're loud is a sure recipe for a schizoprenic government. And regardless of how good each specific change is, they make planning for the future difficult, even if they make life better in the aggregate. And that's assuming the changes are /good./

Fundamentally speaking, I'm ok with being ignored, so long as my opposite number is also ignored. Because I think I'm right, and therefore will be vindicated eventually, therefore convincing the majority to see things the way I do.

And when I'm wrong? Well, thank goodness I didn't have that input, then.
