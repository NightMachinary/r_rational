  "I want to be reelected," and, "I want a higher salary." Laws do get passed, and in my opinion, most of the time they inconvenience the citizens.

I... Agree with your /statement/ but not with your point. That is, I think what you say is true, but I don't think it's bad. Because what is a law, other than removing liberty in favour of security? Every law is an inconvenience to some extent. The innefective laws are bad, of course, but the very centrism in government I'm arguing for keep them from being /too/ bad for any specific group. And they eventually get repealed or amended, for some reason or another. And the actually /good/ laws stay.

That's not to say that the current system is perfect-- lobbying has congress listening to a group of extremists, except both sides eat out of their hands.

But the fix isn't to give special interest groups, regardless of whether they're called "companies" or "third parties" more power.
