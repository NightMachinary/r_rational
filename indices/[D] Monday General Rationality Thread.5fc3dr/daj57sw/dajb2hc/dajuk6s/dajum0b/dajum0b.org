Yes, and that's why the two party system is a useless piece of trash. It just depends on what part of the establishment you happen to pay attention to.

EDIT: Example of a typical moderate democrat-moderate republican exchange:

DEMOCRAT: "Restricting the power of the government regulations is well and good, but how will we deal with things like climate change and corporate negligence without a government to enforce the rights of the citizens?"

REPUBLICAN: "I am okay with climate change laws, so long as the rights of the citizens are not violated. However, I feel as if they are an opportunity to sneak in more government corruption and power, which makes any benefit gained from climate laws irrelevant."

If that seems unremarkable, then you're correct. We don't actually think all that dissimilarly - the problem usually ends up being different priorities. This is probably half of why political affiliation is so heritable - it means little which party you're actually in, you are equally paranoid either way.
