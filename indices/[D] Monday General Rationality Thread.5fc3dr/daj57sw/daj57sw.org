I've been spending an inordinate amount of time on [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters][r/AskTrumpSupporters]], and it has become apparent to me that the goal of raising the sanity waterline is going to be ever harder than we thought it would be. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-intellectualism][Anti-intellectualism]] has become a pervasive attitude throughout the western world, which has rendered traditional methods of rational debate useless at persuasion.

Last week I made a post about how hard I was trying to avoid dehumanizing people with different political opinions from me, but the more I speak to them the more I see my prejudices as rational. Every fact I cite is decried as biased in my favor, even when they admit they are biased against me. It's as if they see rationality itself as something to oppose. I don't know what to do.
