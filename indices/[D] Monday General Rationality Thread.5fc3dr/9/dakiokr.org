I am currently torn between continuing down the path of medical school, since I just graduated undergraduate and I'm applying to med right now, or trying something completely different: going to a reputable coding bootcamp like hack reactor or app academy and trying that out for a couple years.

In support of the former: I've accumulated enough med knowledge on my own such that when I shadow physicians they are generally impressed with me, and ask if I'm in med school already. Im also extroverted enough that dealing with patients and coworkers is reasonably fun. In support of the latter: I'm impatient to start real/adult life, I have a growing sense of anxiety/excitement that tech is where I should work given that its kind of eating many other fields, and I want to be independent of family and in a new place for a while.

Hard to know that instinct to go with. Anyone here have thoughts on breaking into the tech industry through coding bootcamp? How realistic is that?
