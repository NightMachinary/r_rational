Good luck to you! I completely agree that this book is hard to read. I started it, but couldn't finish.

Unfortunately, I cannot reassure you and say that On War is going to be good reading. It certainly had some interesting notes but a lot of chapters contained too specific or too general information for my tastes.

Some points I have carried out:

1. It is useful to know about Napoleonic Wars, Second Punic War and wars of Frederick the Great. Clausewitz provides great in-depth analysis of some battles in these wars.
2. According to Clausewitz, deception is not very effective in warfare. This is why On War can't be the only book to read about war, in my opinion. (This probably comes from his experience, where such methods repeatedly failed him)
3. Sometimes it is possible to glimpse the views of Clausewitz himself from the text. These are, mostly: 'every plan is going to fail somehow' and 'it is impossible to evade war'.

If you (or other subreddit visitors) would like to read something more lightweight on military strategy, please see [[http://l-clausewitz.livejournal.com/][this amazing blog]] for general notes and [[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/1*.html]["Stratagems" by Frontinus]] for the specific examples.
