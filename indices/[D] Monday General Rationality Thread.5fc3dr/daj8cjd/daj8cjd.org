I've been helping [[/u/ketura]] with his !Pokemon fan project, and to be honest, I'm way more excited about that project than I am about school. I guess I just get anxiety when it comes to school, so helping with that is a good anxiety release without the destruction of time that comes with video games, my standard anxiety distraction.

Anyway, after typing for extended periods of time on my keyboard was giving me cramps and finger pain whereas I never used to get any, a change was in order. The keyboard I had was smaller than standard and also with even smaller keys as well. I picked up the Corsair Slate on sale during Black Friday, and have yet to notice any hand cramping in all my typing yesterday and today. Here's hoping it stays that way.
