Problem is that "breathing", eg. "burning" of Carbon with oxygen gives energy. Just like current fungi and bacteria do it, kinda. And every non-photosyntesis based lifeform*. Hypothetical grey goo eats you, makes half your mass of new grey goo bots, and burns the other half to fuel the replication.

(* other exotic energy cycles also excluded, like sulfur/iron based volcanic extremophiles.)
