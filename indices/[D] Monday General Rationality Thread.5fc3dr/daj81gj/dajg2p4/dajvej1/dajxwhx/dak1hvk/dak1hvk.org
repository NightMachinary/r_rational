  Nod! To explain a little more, what's weighing me is mostly the thought that, so far as the destruction of our various ecosystems goes, the tightrope that we had to walk was already pretty thin and required that we not mess up.

  Except, now we have, and so it doesn't matter that we'll eventually get back on track. I'd feel more hopeful if it were just a matter of pushing through and fixing what broke, but we don't have the time for that, or so my (possibly addled) brain says.

So on the one hand, yes, we're in big trouble. On the other hand, we're in the same big trouble we've been in for /many/ years now. On the other other hand, there's a bright spot: much of the social elite /actually/ care about this issue. The Chinese are /angry/ at the prospect of the Paris Climate Agreement getting tossed out, and /they themselves/ are focusing on clean energy. And yeah, Trumpkin are godawful, but do we really think they can /beat down Elon Musk/?

But yes, it's extremely weird to be relying on the somewhat humanist segment of our corporate elite to pull us towards halfway sensible policies on this.

And yes, there's a very significant chance we've been fucked for years now, and are basically just doing damage control at this point.
