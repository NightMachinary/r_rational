Thank you. We haven't had many discussions, but I've built a lot of respect for your views and general sense of things, so the encouragement actually does help.

  If we're all making World War II comparisons these days, well, things were awful in 1933, but in a part of the world FDR was about to start the New Deal then. By 1943, everything was thoroughly fucked and humanity was in its very darkest moments. By 1953, the Postwar Consensus had been forged and people were rebuilding in a healthier new order. Trust me, I hate the fact that the long view here involved 20 years and millions of deaths.

Nod! To explain a little more, what's weighing me is mostly the thought that, so far as the destruction of our various ecosystems goes, the tightrope that we had to walk was already pretty thin and required that we not mess up.

Except, now we have, and so it doesn't matter that we'll eventually get back on track. I'd feel more hopeful if it were just a matter of pushing through and fixing what broke, but we don't have the time for that, or so my (possibly addled) brain says.

Or more succinctly, I don't disagree that we've faced similar circumstances before, politically, and I'm honestly very optimistic about our ability to repair the situation given the time, it's just that, in the context of climate change, I don't think we have that time, and at best we'll fix the political situation in time for everything else to fall apart on us.

So I'm kind of torn between "The moral thing to do, according to /any/ of the systems that are even a little bit attractive to me, is to keep on trucking and do whatever I can, even if it ultimately won't amount to anything," and "Fuck it, I'm out, I hope I get hit by a car tomorrow because at least then I won't have to see the world burn."
