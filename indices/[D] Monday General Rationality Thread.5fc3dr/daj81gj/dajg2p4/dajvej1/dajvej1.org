I'd like to say that's the bipolar, but I also have some bipolar and feel really similar right now.

The rational part of me points out that what's happening right now is /overdetermination/: the people in charge attempted to impose an irrational order too hard, so the system is breaking down quite openly and turning chaotic. If you always give people a false choice between a lesser evil and a greater evil, while the evils always make their lives worse, they will eventually choose the greater evil, the one you didn't want them to, /just to stop you doing that shit again/.

Our task here is to rebuild social consensus towards a new order that meets people's needs more effectively and reliably. That's the hard part: the actual material infrastructure for the new order is /already here/.

If we're all making World War II comparisons these days, well, things were awful in 1933, but in a part of the world FDR was about to start the New Deal then. By 1943, everything was thoroughly fucked and humanity was in its very darkest moments. By 1953, the Postwar Consensus had been forged and people were rebuilding in a healthier new order. Trust me, I /hate/ the fact that the long view here involved 20 years and millions of deaths.

Morally, our task is the same as ever: to act on empathy and kindness rather than selfishness, fear, and bias. I've known at least one person /from this subreddit/ whom current fads of speech would group as an unrepentant neo-Nazi. He's definitely a Manosphere person at least, and I'm not sure what other weird alt-right shit he eventually got into. I'm not sure he browses this sub anymore, though I do very rarely see him around here. Without revealing anything he said in private, the difference between him and someone I'd consider "more decent" is mostly just that he's /selfish/: he suffered a major hurt in life, and he wants to be part of something that explains /his/ suffering and offers an opportunity to do something about /his/ feelings of powerlessness, rather than about suffering and powerlessness /in general/.

In very short, he suffered a deep, painful loss, and he thinks the theories he's adopted can explain that loss partially away and block off further such losses in the future. I might think that every inference he has drawn from his experiences is wrong, but I can hardly fault him for feeling pain in the circumstances.

The difference of belief that makes me /not want/ to side with him, when he was trying genuinely to convince me of his views, was that I don't believe the Dragon Tyrant can be appeased, and I kinda think he does. Or at least, he thinks he can schedule his turn with death to be "later" in an organized way that benefits him alone, while he thinks that attempts to benefit people in general are naive and in fact counterproductive. I believe the opposite: that security for people in general is the surest way towards security for myself personally.
