...imagine that the universe splits into two at regular intervals. (Once a second, say - the length of the interval doesn't matter). So there are billions, trillions, zillions of alternate universes with a common history.

Imagine that, every year, there's only a one in a thousand chance of humanity surviving the year. (Our odds are a good deal better than that. But just imagine).

Now... imagine that someone looks back at his past. "We've managed to survive this long," he says, "against odds of nine-ninety-nine to a thousand. Surely nothing will change that trend in the future!"

He does not know that, of all the universes that split off from his a year before that time, in only one out of every thousand does humanity still live. Those dead universes are something he does not see, so he does not consider them.

"We are lucky," he says, "and I do not see why that luck should end."

But, from the moment when he says that, the universe continues to split into alternate futures... and in only one out of a thousand of them is humanity still there a year later.

I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong, mind you. I'm just presenting a possible universe (multiverse?) in which your particular argument is completely invalid.
