Fair enough. But if we consider ourselves living in a universe that only has a /single/ timeline, then that single timeline is equivalent to a /single/ path through the multi-timeline model described above. It leads to the same flaw in the anthropomorphic argument you present; any argument that conditions on the probability of a person existing to present the argument will fail to take into account the odds of the person not having existed to make the argument (usually, those odds are unknown and may be unknowable).
