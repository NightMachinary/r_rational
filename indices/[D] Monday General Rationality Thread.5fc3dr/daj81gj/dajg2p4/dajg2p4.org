Similarly, I'm finding it more and more difficult to think that we're going to pull off any kind of future worth having, because we don't seem capable of getting our act together. Some of this is certainly due to my bipolar biasing me in the pessimistic direction but I still can't shake the feeling that the right conclusion to draw, even after I account for my bias, is "we're screwed and things are going to get awful in the next couple of generations, and then get even worse," and that coming to any other conclusion is just overcompensating for my bipolar's bias.
