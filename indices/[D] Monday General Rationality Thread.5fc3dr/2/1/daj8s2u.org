  I think we assume that the power to prevent destruction will scale about evenly with ability to produce destruction

Has this ever been actually the case in history? To me it seems like destructive power always ran faster, even if for a long time in history the difference was smaller. But even now the only thing protecting us from nukes is that you can't defend against them even if you yourself use them first and thus people with the power to use it are afraid to do so.
