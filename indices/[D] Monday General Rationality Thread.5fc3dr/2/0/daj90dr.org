There are papers out there re:what it takes to not have grey goo eat the biosphere.

It comes to the conclusion that we need blue goo, eg. benefical immune system nanobots, checking every single molecule in the biosphere every minute or so.

Thats probably the most extreme example; bioengineered plagues are currently the most realistic problem we have, and much easier to defend against (though still with really badly catastrophic outcomes).

For a fictional account of how such a world with very disproportional aggression/defense technologies looks like, see [[http://www.genocideman.com][www.genocideman.com]], recently finished webcomic.
