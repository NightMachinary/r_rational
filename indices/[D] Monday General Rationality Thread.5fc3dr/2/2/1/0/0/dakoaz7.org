Possible, but unprovable. You can't construct an accurate model without sufficient data, and we have no data to go on except the events that have occurred in our timeline. Just because it's logically valid doesn't make it true or even useful for making predictions about reality.

While it is entirely possible that we live in a universe where the world will end, there is no way we can know with the information we have. The best we can do is make predictions based on trends we already have data on. Speculating about what data we don't have access to is unproductive.
