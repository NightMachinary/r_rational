I'm a bit worried about the future. Something I thought of after the Brexit vote and now after Trump is how hard it can be especially for someone young to think about radical change in the future. I was born just after the fall of the soviet union. Almost all of the change I think about directly experiencing has been slow, gradual, and really quite predictable.

On the other hand I didn't expect Brexit, even though the polling was tight, even though it was a hard thing to accurately poll on I had strong bias toward the status quo. Similar with Trump while I was more aware I again couldn't picture what I viewed as a radical departure from the status quo despite the fact the polls were close, despite the fact that respected experts were giving 30% odds of Trump winning.

What I'm getting at is that I worry we don't picture the level of radical change we may see in the future. It's not exactly a new worry but so much Sci-Fi deals with nation states or similar groups doing bad things with technology, but the more I think about it the less that's my worry. I'm more concerned with individuals. What happens when and if any human can fabricate a nuke? I think we assume that the power to prevent destruction will scale about evenly with ability to produce destruction, but I don't see any reason for that to be guaranteed.

I feel like we may come to a junction where the only way to enforce rational actions like preventing nuclear bombings of cities is a much more invasive government. As somebody who is sympathetic to the ideas of Libertarianism that's a pretty tough idea, but I don't see a way around it.
