The problem is that English contains grammatically correct sentences which when you attempt to use standard logic on will lead to contradiction.

The problem arises when you allow unconstrained referencing of other statements. One solution is to only allow a statement if it either does not reference any other statements, or only references other statements which have already been shown acceptable using one of these two rules.

The problem with Eliezers statement is that it uses the phrase "this question" which references it's self, so it can't be introduced via the first case, and can't be introduced via the second rule because to do so you must have already introduced the statement.
