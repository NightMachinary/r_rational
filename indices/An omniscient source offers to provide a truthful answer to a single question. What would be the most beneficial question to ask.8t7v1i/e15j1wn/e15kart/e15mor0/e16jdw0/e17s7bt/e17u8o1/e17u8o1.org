Right. So if you choose to ask an extremely narrow question, which could have been answered as part of a more complex, acceptable question, then you will have squandered your opportunity. On the other hand, if you construct a question that is basically a multi-part question, you won't get a multi-part answer. The entity will decide whether this is the case.

So for example, if you asked, how does photosynthesis work, the entity could tell you that process, even though it contains more than one piece of information. But if you ask, (a) how do leaves absorb sunlight energy, and (b) how do plants spend absorbed energy, then you will have phrased your question foolishly, because you'll only get an answer to either (a) or (b).

On the other hand, if you ask it to fully recount all information on plants, that will be judged too broad of a question, even though it only requested one "thing" semantically.
