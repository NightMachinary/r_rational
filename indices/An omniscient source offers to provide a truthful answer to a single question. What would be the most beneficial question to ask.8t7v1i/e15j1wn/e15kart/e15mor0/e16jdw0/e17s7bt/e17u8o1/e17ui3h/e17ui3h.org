  Right. So if you choose to ask an extremely narrow question, which could have been answered as part of a more complex, acceptable question, then you've squandered the opportunity. On the other hand, if you construct a question that is basically a multi-part question, you won't get a multi-part answer. The entity will decide whether this is the case.

I'm saying there's fundamentally no metric it could use to determine whether something seems like a multi-part question and the metric you seem to be using is just whether it sounds like a multi-part question to you. However that metric can be trivially subverted by just phrasing your questions better.
