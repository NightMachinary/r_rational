Hmm that gives me an idea.. I don't actually think you could do anything very useful with just a single yes-no question (at least if you had no way of proving to others this happened).

However I think you could probably make the oracle useful if you simply limited it to giving you some finite number (say 20) of yes no question. Yes it would sort of change the premise however it would also eliminate the problems that the limitation on multiple merged questions was designed to deal with in the first case.

Additional limits may include having to merge the X# questions into a single question, or forcing people to ask their questions all within some short timespan. This would allow people to take their time coming up with good questions but not let them employ many additional exploits available to them if they could space out their questions over any amount of time.

P.S. If you were going with this and you wanted to actually have it be on the same level of usefulness as you probably had in mind with regards to the original scenario you'd probably want to give people a fair deal more than twenty questions.
