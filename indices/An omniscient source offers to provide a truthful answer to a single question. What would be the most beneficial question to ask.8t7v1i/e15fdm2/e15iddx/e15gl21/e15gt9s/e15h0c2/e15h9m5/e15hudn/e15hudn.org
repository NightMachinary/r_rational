Ok, define something as beneficial in my clarification as something which increases utility.

(nitpick: I don't consider my definition to be recursive, since in the first one I used beneficial in a sense of 'degree to which it is good' and the second time in the sense 'whether it is good'. It just so happens by a quirk of English that these concepts have the same word. Though of course your machine wouldn't like either concept since they are both subjective)
