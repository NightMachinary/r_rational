I would say that with its omniscience it would be aware of everything ever said or written that defines "Friendly AI" and, combined with its knowledge of you, come up with a definition that fits your best understanding of what it means. And as I said in my response to [[/u/vakusdrake]]'s comment, there may be things that would never occur to any human to include in the definition of FAI, that would nevertheless have serious negative consequences (one of the examples I gave was of a FAI annihilating all alien life because one of its directives was to protect human life).
