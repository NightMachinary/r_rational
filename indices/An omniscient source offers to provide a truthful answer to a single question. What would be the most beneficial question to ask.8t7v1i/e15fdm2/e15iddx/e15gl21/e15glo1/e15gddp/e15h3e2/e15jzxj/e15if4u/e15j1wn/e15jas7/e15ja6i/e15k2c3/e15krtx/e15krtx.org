Congratulations, you've munchkined your way into unlimited knowledge. Here is your infinitely long code. It may take some time to enter into your computers and compile. But really, since it includes the answers to every possible question, I think this would just be interpreted as a multi-part question. In other words the restriction is less, "no multi-part questions" as it is, "no questions that require numerous answers."
