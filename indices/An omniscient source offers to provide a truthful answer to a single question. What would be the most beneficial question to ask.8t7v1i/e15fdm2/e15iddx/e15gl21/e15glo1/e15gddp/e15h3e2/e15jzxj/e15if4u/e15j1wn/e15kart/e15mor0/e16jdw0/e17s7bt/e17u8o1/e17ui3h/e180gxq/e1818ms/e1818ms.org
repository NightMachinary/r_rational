Right I'm just saying that you aren't using a consistent standard either so saying it uses the same standard as you (with your FAI analogy) doesn't fix anything.\\
Comparing "determining whether something is actually multiple questions" to friendliness doesn't really work, because it implies that there is actually some non-arbitrary metric (as in not just whatever is currently your whim) being used even if you can't articulate it/understand it without omniscience.
