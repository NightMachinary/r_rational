  "What series of actions can we reasonably perform that will maximize the long-term probability of humanity's satisfaction and survival?" If it is possible to survive in perpetuity (e.g. avoiding heat death) these answers will be preferentially selected. If our extinction is inevitable we don't waste an answer on a response like "you can't."

Suppose the omniscient being does give you a correct answer for this. How would you convince the rest of humanity to follow those actions though? You can't really prove that you got the answer from an omniscient being, since it disappeared after you asked it that one question.
