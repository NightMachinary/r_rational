I get that, and I'm saying it has enough omniscience to make a judgment call, just like you or I could. If you agree that it can interpret things like utility functions and whether an AI is friendly or beneficial, then you should also agree that it knows enough about multipart questions and semantics to make a judgment call on whether a question qualifies. At some point, such a judgment call is necessary, otherwise that defeats the entire limitation of the "single question". If multi part questions were allowed, then you could just ask it unlimited questions by using clever phrasing.
