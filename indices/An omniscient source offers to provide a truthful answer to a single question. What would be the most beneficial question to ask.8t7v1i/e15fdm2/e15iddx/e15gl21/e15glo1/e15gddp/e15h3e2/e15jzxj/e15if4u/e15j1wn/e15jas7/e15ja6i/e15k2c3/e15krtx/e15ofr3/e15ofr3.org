As others have mentioned, that is not a coherent restriction. Or at least making it coherent is non trivial, how do you distinguish a single answer? Many questions can be broken up into simpler ones, and a way to demarcate questions that would include giving the source code for a FAI, but exclude the other answers to me seems like it'll be highly contrived.
