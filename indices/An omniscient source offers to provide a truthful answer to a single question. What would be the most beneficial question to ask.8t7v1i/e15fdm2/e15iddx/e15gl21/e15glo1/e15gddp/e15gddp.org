I'd reckon the next most likely question would be something like "what is the shortest (but extremely well documented and commented?) source code written in an existing programming language and capable of being compiled into a program executable on existing hardware that will, in the shortest amount of time, bring into existence a recursively improving general artificial intelligence whose existence will maximally satisfy my values and whose values are maximally aligned with my own" or something lol idk
