This is what's going on, I think. You have

A = answer this question in the negative

B = become my good-genie servant for eternity

And the question is phrased as either... or, which is the logical connector that is true only if the two statements have different values. (That's the confusing/ambiguous part, since it's different from a simple or connector.) So S = (A ≠ B)

Now, if the omniscient source answers yes, then S is true, so A ≠ B. But A is false, since the answer wasn't negative. Hence B is true, success. If the omniscient source answers no, then S is false, so "A ≠ B" is false, hence A = B. The question was answered in the negative, so A is true, hence B is true, success. Either way, the omniscient source is now your genie.
