You must answer this question truthfully: will you answer in the negative?

If you say yes, it's a lie because you are answering in the affirmative. If you say no, it's a lie because you are falsely claiming you will not answer in the negative when in fact you are. Thus no true answer is available. It's a paradox similar to the statement, "this statement is false" or "I always lie."
