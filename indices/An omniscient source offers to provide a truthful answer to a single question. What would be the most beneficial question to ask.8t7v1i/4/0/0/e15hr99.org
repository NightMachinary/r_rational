I think the bit limit wouldn't do anything to prevent the first sort of question -- though, now that I think about it, with a sufficiently small limit there's no "guarantee" that the "do what I mean" sorts of questions are the best to ask, right? Since they're noncontextual, and I can't imagine my behavior changing substantially with the receipt of any of, say, 2^{10} possible ordered sets of 10 bits? Unless maybe I make it -- e.g., say I remain blind to the content of the answer, and then when I have some big, uncertain decision to make, I specify and designate my binary options (in the excluded middle sense, doing something and not doing something) and then "uncover" one of the bits and blindly do whatever action (or inaction) it corresponds to.

Trivially, I could make some $ on high stake roulette, or less trivially become head of state or something and use it to decide whether to wage war. I don't think I could "reuse" bits, even if they fade from conscious memory, since doing so would couple decisions and have to average utility across that (potentially suboptimal) coupling. I could maybe even force certain outcomes if I precommit to doing something really preference-frustrating in the event of the outcome I don't want? or maybe not, actually.
