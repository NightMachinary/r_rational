"What is the code for a program that will answer any question I ask of it correctly (if it complies with the above rules)?"

Such a program exists, because you can simply program a massive look-up table for every possible question with their answers as coded constants. It is not an AI, because it isn't smart, it's just looking up a table. It isn't a multi-part question. It is an extremely narrow question, because the code given either works or does not. So it should comply with all rules and thus result in getting all answers to all questions that comply with the rules.
