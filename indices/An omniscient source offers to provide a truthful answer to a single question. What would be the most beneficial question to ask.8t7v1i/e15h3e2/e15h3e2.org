Clarification request: Under what circumstances do I have this opportunity to question this omniscient oracle, and what form does the answer take?

If I have to ask the question on the spot without preparation, and the answer is an immediate verbal response, then that would have a major impact on the people asking the oracle to write software for them. I doubt any ordinary human can memorize the complete code for an artificial intelligence after hearing it read aloud once.
