I am assuming an anthropocentric metric of benefit for the sake of time, brevity, and to avoid obvious monkey's paws.

My top choices are:

1. "Provide a complete Standard Model such that it accounts for as many phenomena as possible with the highest possible degree of accuracy." In addition to gravity, dark matter, and energy this takes care of any unobservables that we would otherwise never be able to fully understand.
2. "What is the genetic code of an organism that would provide the greatest benefit to humanity?"
3. "What is a safe method to optimize human intelligence?"
4. "What series of actions can we reasonably perform that will maximize the long-term probability of humanity's satisfaction and survival?" If it is possible to survive in perpetuity (e.g. avoiding heat death) these answers will be preferentially selected. If our extinction is inevitable we don't waste an answer on a response like "you can't."

If necessary, we can avoid being given answers we could never use by adding to the quotes above: "...that humanity will have a 100% chance of utilizing to our greatest benefit before extinction, the end of the universe, or a maximum of [[http://googology.wikia.com/wiki/Graham%27s_number][Graham's number]] of years, whichever is soonest." Probability takes care of failure during construction from all sources, so finding the *most* beneficial option requires playing the long game, but not so long that the universe dies before we have a few billion years to benefit from the results. If heat death ends up not being the inevitable fate of everything, perhaps as a result of the answer we receive, setting an arbitrarily high duration eliminates responses that would have the highest theoretical benefit but could not be fully realized in a finite amount of time.

Edit: [[/u/erotica][u/erotica]]'s answer takes the prize in my opinion, but hopefully this will provide you with a few more specific examples to think about :).
