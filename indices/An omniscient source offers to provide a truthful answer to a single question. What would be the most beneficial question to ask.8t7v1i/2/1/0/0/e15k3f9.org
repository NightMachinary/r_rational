I'll concede the point that the AI would refrain from reproduction to avoid the possibility of its offspring harming humanity, but I think my other point is valid, even if the examples I cited were obvious. The examples are meant to illustrate that an AI would have very different thought processes than people do, and that no matter how careful we are, it's almost impossible to think of every single possible contingency. I mean, in all the discussions on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] about writing utility functions for AI, have you ever seen someone suggest that AI also protect alien life? I'm not saying that if people sat down and actually created one, they wouldn't think of it (after all, the author of the story thought of it), but it's just an example of a blind spot.

I'm suggesting that there are unknown unknowns that no human has ever or would ever conceive of, that could still have devastating consequences if not addressed.
