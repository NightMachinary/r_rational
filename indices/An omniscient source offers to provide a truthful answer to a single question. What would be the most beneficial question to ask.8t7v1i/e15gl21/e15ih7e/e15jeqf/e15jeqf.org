A friendly ai wouldn't do anything bad unless this was the least bad available option (modulo knowledge and computational constraints). If it did, it wouldn't be friendly (e.g. intellect prime is not friendly). Unfortunately we don't have any precise definitions of friendly, this is the reason why I thought you wouldn't allow my second question.
