Does it know that those alien species would have maximized everyone's utility functions? If so, it would have let them live, since that is the method of maximizing utility. If not, then there's no real evidence that those alien species would have evolved, so wiping them out is fair game.

After all, every single action could potentially give rise to or prevent some maximally happy outcome, thanks to the butterfly effect. So if you weren't allowed to take actions that could prevent happy outcomes even though you have no evidence to suggest that that is the case, you wouldn't be able to take any action at all.
