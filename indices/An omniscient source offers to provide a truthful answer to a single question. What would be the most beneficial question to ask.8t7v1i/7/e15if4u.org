"Give me the proof or refutation of P=NP."

I think this is at least a good answer to the question given your restraints, if not absolutely optimal. It has a concrete answer and isn't asking to solve all my problems for me, but can still in effect help do so through giving the algorithm for solving any mathematical proof and giving the avenue to make basically all programming (excluding the AI ethics bits) problems trivial.

Well, it would suck if P doesn't equal NP, or the general solution requires a googol operations, but the potential reward is so high that you can risk merely learning an interesting piece of mathematical knowledge and getting the million dollar Millennium Prize money.
