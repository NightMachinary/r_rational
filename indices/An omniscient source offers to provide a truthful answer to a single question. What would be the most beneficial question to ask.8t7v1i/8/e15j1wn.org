This doesn't really work as a limitation. Just specify a question whose answer must necessarily include the answers to any other questions you want answered, thus meaning your only real limit here is needing to generate all your questions up-front.

I'd also like to point out that the previously mentioned question "What are the words that I would benefit most from hearing you say?" would very nearly work. However you would need to add the caveat that "benefit" is defined based on your current utility function.\\
The question works because without a limit on answer length the best answer for it to give you would effectively function as Path to Victory, in fact since it's able to exploit the butterfly effect it would probably actually be vastly superior to PtV. So the most likely outcome could be it causing you to take a bunch of bizzare random seeming actions that lead to the development of a FAI with your utility function happening in a few years due to many different freak accidents.
