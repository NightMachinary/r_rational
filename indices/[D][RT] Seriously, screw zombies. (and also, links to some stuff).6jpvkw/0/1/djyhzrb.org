As a casual reader of "rational fic", who isn't bothered by irrationalities as some others, I agree. I like the "ratfic", but I, and many people I know, value character dynamics, emotional consistency and well-done drama over extremely rational characters. Not that rational fic can't have emotional impact--they certainly can--but for me, moderate irrationalities don't sink a story.

I don't necessarily see rational fiction as better. It often can be, and it definitely creates better world-building, but one can have a perfectly good story that has irrationalities. The author wasn't saying you couldn't...actually, what would be more interesting is what qualities make up a well-done irrational fic. I'm sure I'm not the first person to ask it, though.
