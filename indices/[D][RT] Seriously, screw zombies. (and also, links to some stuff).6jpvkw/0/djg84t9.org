While I agree with you in broad strokes, there's one part of the rant that I disagree with.

  If a work wants to be taken seriously the way gritty zombie movies want to be taken seriously, they need to elevate their game to the level of rational fiction.

The fact of the matter, and you said it yourself, these movies /are/ taken seriously. Train to Busan is considered top-tier zombie fiction, so it's clear that it and movies like it can appeal to a large amount of people without appealing to us.

Perhaps that's a bad thing, and the multitudes of people out there should put more thought into their viewing habits so they can appreciate internal consistency and the same things we enjoy, but even if so we aren't there yet. The plotholes, the irrational behaviour, the lack of proper scope, they're things that first and foremost bother /us/. That the characters behave in life-and-death situations the way we'd /imagine/ we'd behave in life-and-death situations instead of how we'd actually behave isn't a big problem for most people, and you set yourself up for disappointment if you make that mistake.

Certainly, they need to elevate their game in order to be taken seriously by /us/, but that doesn't mean they lose out significantly by not elevating their game. The cliche 'zombie apocalypse, emphasis on apocalypse' story is something that works (even if by our standards it doesn't) and I hold respect for the makers of successful zombie apocalypse movies for creating a story that so many people enjoy, even if I can't enjoy it along with them.
