Well, zombie movies do receive critical acclaim at times, but think that the difference between an unsuccessful zombie movie and a successful zombie movie is a fine line. Most of the best of the genre, critically acclaimed or no, break out of the confines of serious "zombie fiction" somewhat - The Walking Dead is popular but generally not well received by serious critics. (And even its popularity has died down in recent years) The only zombie content I've really think is memorable or will outlive the old zombie trend is stuff like Zombieland or Left 4 Dead, where the content is focused more on comedy or gameplay than serious drama. I don't think that "serious" zombie fiction like Train to Busan will be remembered in decade the way most classics are. This isn't to say that serious zombie fiction can't be memorable or enduring, just that the Darkness Induced Apathy requires a lot of goodwill to overturn. That's more what I mean by step up their game - they don't need to be rationalist level consistent, they just need to stop relying entirely on an inconsistent premise to create their conflict.

I mean, think of something like Star Wars. It might be riddled with plot holes, but because it had other merits, it succeeded and became a classic. The traditional zombie premise also has a lot of plot holes, and it also generally is depressing - in order to balance those flaws out, it needs to have some other merit to be memorable. One way to do this is to be consistent, another is to be hopeful, and another is to add enough variety to the apocalypse to maintain the audience's interest. Works like Attack on Titan or RWBY clearly feature a post-apocalypse in a monster saturared world that brings more mystery to the table without losing themselves in gritty survivalism.
