When you mentioned World War Z I hope you were talking about the book and not the movie. The movie is incredibly stupid and contrived whereas the book goes into great detail about how the zombie apocalypse started, progressed, how civilization started to grow back, and how it changed.

It's not completely realistic as the zombies are a bit physics defying (acknowledged in the book) but it is consistent.
