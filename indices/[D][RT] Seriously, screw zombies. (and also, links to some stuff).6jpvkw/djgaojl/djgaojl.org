I have seen zombies used in non-apocolypse ways. The first one that comes to minds is zombies as cheap labor, in the webcomic /Unsounded/. More often they're used as not particularly threatening mooks. But in all these cases the zombies are really more of an afterthought to the plot, not the main event. (Although I do believe unsounded had a half undead main character)
