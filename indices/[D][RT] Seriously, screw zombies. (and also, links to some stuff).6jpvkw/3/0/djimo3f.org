It's not exactly grim darkness that they want. The fantasy of a zombie apocalypse is that it erases all social institutions and obligations. I don't have to pay my mortgage anymore. Nobody will care that I don't have a college degree. I can loot the supermarket and not feel bad because it's abandoned. I can shoot people in the head and not feel bad because they are zombies.

If civilization is rebuilt, all those things that people like about a reset of the social order will come back. Rebuilding is /hard work/.
