  any time the characters are close to any modicum of success, the idiot ball comes rolling in, because anything else would mean the authors would have to write something unique.

I think you're almost right here, and it suffices to explain pretty much the whole problem you're talking about. It's not that they'd have to write something unique, though it would be, but that they'd have to write something not-apocalypse, and then it wouldn't be zombie apocalypse any more.

They want the grim darkness. Fixing the world and behaving like reasonable people would make it not grim and dark anymore, and apparently grim darkness is what fucking sells this decade.
