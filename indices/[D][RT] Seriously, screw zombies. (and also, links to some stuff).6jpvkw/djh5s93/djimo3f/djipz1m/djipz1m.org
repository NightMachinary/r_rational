That's an excellent point. But there's another subset of zombie/apocalyptic fic that's exactly about rebuilding, and it's always approached with a similar level of grim darkness to the solo survival fics. The rebuilt town is always an autocracy, and always has a Dark Secret.

What I'm wondering is why the zombie apocalypse never seems to spawn a revolutionary liberation army. You don't have to pay your mortgage and can loot the supermarket, not because of the zombies, but because all is for all.
