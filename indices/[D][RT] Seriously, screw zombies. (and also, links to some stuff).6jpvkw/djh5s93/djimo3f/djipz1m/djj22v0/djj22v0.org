In every zombie apocalypse there is already a massive revolutionary movement that wants to destroy every old economic and cultural institution and just take whatever they want. It's the zombies.

The zombie apocalypse is most often an individualist's fantasy. Of course every human organization in that type of fiction will be autocratic and dysfunctional. For the kind of person who likes zombie apocalypses, joining a rebuilding effort that is actually functional will subsume their self-image as a rugged individualist survivor. They might as well let themselves get eaten by zombies, because it's the same thing for them.
