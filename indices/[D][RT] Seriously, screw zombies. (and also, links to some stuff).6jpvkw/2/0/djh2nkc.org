Yes, the main character is indeed sort of a zombie--he has all of his cognitive faculties, but his body is decaying, and he has had to come up with various workarounds to keep himself functional. You should catch up on the story! Some more information has been revealed about what exactly he is and how his condition works. It seems to be pretty important to the plot.
