The pattern-match reading of this comic is anti-bayesian. The pattern-match reading of the XKCD bayesianism comic was pro-bayesian. I didn't particularly enjoy either because neither make sense as a commentary about statistics.

So, at least for me, I think the joke fails to land because it's not an intellectually rigorous poke at the nominal subject (which I was expecting and hoping to be far funnier), not mere partisanship. The equivalent joke about a Christian who thought God would protect him because he lives in the best of all possible worlds and his continued existence is obviously a part of that would also fail for me. (A quantum immortality version might have been more salvageable with a different punchline; I'd have to think of one though.)
