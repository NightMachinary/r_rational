Uncertainty about uncertainty, in Bayesian terms, resolves to plain old first-order uncertainty. If you want meta-uncertainty, you need [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster%E2%80%93Shafer_theory][DST]] or something like that.

Of course, unadorned Bayesian reasoning is only epistemic, it doesn't prescribe actions. Most flavors of Bayesian decision theory do have ways to deal with Pascal's Muggings.
