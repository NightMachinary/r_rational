The sum of all /possibilities/ multiplied by their probability should equal 1, but just because you can only come up with one theory doesn't mean that it's the only possibility. For that matter, just because you can only come up with thirty theories doesn't mean there are only thirty possibilities. Unknown unknowns are notoriously hard to correct for though.
