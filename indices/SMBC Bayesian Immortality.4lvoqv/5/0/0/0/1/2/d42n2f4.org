I'm super-late to the party here, but I had another thought on the matter...

#+begin_quote
  the part of the joke that doesn't make logical sense should be the punchline not the premise
#+end_quote

If I had to really break the joke down to its essentials I'd separate it out as:

Premise: the 'main' character has terribly misunderstood Bayesianism

Development: his misunderstanding leads him to commit an entirely stupid form of suicide

Punchline: instead of saying "What a terrible misunderstanding and misrepresentation of Bayesianism", the person in the audience says "That's why I'm a frequentist".

The implication being that Bayesianism really does predict immortality, and that the presenter's Bayesianism was therefore "the problem", rather than his fatal misunderstanding of it.

So it /is/ the punchline that makes no logical sense; the rest of the comic was "played straight" with exactly the normal logical conclusion of stabbing yourself in the gut.
