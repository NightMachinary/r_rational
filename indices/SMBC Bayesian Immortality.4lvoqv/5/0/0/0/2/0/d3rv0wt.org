Honestly it feels almost anti humor to me. It begins with him making a true statement. He extrapolates wrongly. He builds a machine based off of wrongful extrapolation. He states the outcome of the machine. now here is where I got tripped up mentally, THIS IS A COMIC. In one comic someone disproved math, lit themselves on fire and became more powerful. I honestly expected his machine to work within the comic. Then he died. Subverting expectations and entertaining me.
