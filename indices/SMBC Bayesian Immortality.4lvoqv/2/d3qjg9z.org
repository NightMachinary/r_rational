Hmm, you can still have both finite and infinite "theories" integrate to some trivial slice of probability (and indeed you always do with continuous parameters, since there are infinitely many values between two points).

It's also very common and helpful to assign probability = 0 to certain values (e.g., what's your prior that a standard deviation is negative?).
