In that case, how do you /know/ that 1+1=2? Is this hypothesis based on evidence, or is it something you just know somehow? I'm pretty sure my prior here is based on the evidence that whenever I have added one thing to another thing in the past I got two things, and whenever I typed 1+1= into a calculator it would always say 2. In order to convince me that 1+1 does not equal 2, I would at least need a fucking shitton of shittons of evidence. Like if you could demonstrate that I had hallucinated whenever I added 1 thing to another thing, and if every time I add one thing to another thing in the next few decades I don't get two things. But my prior probability is overwhelmingly in favor of the hypothesis that 1+1=2. Even if I did see the evidence mentioned above, it would be /extremely hard/ to distinguish between 1+1 not equaling 2 and plain old human error, and human error has a MUCH higher prior.

My prior that a standard deviation is negative? Well, if you can turn a data distribution inside-out, or loop it somehow, so that getting farther away from the mean actually brings you closer...but that would require that math is inconsistent. So really really really REALLY unimaginably low prior.
