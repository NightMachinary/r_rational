Things like this fall prey to a certain mistake. This is in the same category of those "mugging" thought experiments. In these experiments, there is someone saying "I'm actually simulating this universe, give me 5 dollars and you'll get 10^{10^{10^{10}}} happiness" or something. It is then said that even if it's super unlikely this is true, it's not zero, and the happiness value is really high, and asks us how we could logically turn it down.

The mistake made by the presenter in the comic, and also by people who think the thought experiments about mugging are interesting, is not having [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_bar][error bars]]. For most things that we evaluate, we need to have error bars. It is categorically imperative not to consider probabilities below a certain amount. It is literally self-defeating to evaluate a potential outcome and try to reason about it, if that potential outcome is sufficiently unlikely: spending time evaluating things that are smaller than your ability to measure accurately actually decreases your ability to make good choices.

If we say "I think the likelihood of this being true is 0.000004 Â± 0.000300" about a particular outcome, then we shouldn't evaluate anything based on that outcome at all: our measurement is not accurate enough to distinguish something this unlikely from something that has zero likelihood of truth.

So, it's not quite true that "all probabilities must add to 1 in total" when we're making these judgement calls. Instead, we should say that "all probabilities, accounting for error, must add to 1 in total"--and effectively ignore outcomes that are sufficiently unlikely that we can't distinguish them from impossible. In fact, this is what most people do.
