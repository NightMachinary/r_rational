I believe the point of the joke was someone following their highly flawed model to a logically absurd conclusion resulting in death, without stopping to consider that reality might be different than their model. That is, someone having a psychotic break. Or behaving like masses of humans have throughout history regarding religion and war. And that by using the buzzword "Bayesian" this nutjob got people to listen while he gave a lecture about it and then committed suicide on stage. And that afterwards instead of reacting to a death or life threatening injury, one of the "rational" audience spent time defending a competing buzzword.

Would there be less salt here if he had used the buzzword "Quantum" rather than "Bayesian"? Would you be able to notice the point if you weren't busy defending your favorite buzzword, rather like the audience member in the comic? If the guy had instead given a lecture about how he had figured out how to get into Muslim heaven and enjoy the virgins by stabbing himself with a special knife, and one of the audience had commented after the suicide, "That's why I'm a Christian," would the point of the comic been any different?
