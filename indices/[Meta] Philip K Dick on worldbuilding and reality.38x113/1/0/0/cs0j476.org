SA is Something Awful - in this case the Something Awful forums; these are the (nonfree/paid) forums of the internet's self-described 'goons', a set of loosely amalgamated groups of internet people. They tend to have a strong presence in much of online gaming and (eg the Goonswarm in massive multiplayer online game Eve Online). The forums have as a whole strong tendencies to strong language mixed with pretty mainstream liberal beliefs on average, but they are large enough there is a great deal of variation from the average.

The Something Awful forums both started and first popularized the Let's Play phenomenon, where people watch others play videogames through videos or screenshots. The Talos Principle Let's Play thread I referred to above is [[http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3696744&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=1][here]] but may be paywalled (they switch the paywall on and off sometimes) and the Talos Principle Let's Play videos themselves are hosted on Youtube [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9796Fr0Sd2onLOYqW7O7w][here]]. On Saturday there was some mention/discussion of PKD and this specific essay.
