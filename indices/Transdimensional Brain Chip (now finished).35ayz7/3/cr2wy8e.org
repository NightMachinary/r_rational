ugh. no. really generic dystopia ending that shouldn't be new for anyone here, stilted narration/speech, awful art. i feel like choosing to make fiction in comic format rather than plaintext ought to add something, rather than a default for when you can't be bothered to describe things. the art is garish and attention-grabbing enough that it makes everything else seem juvenile by association. so on and so on. i feel like there might be something worthwhile there, but i couldn't stomach any more than the beginning/ending (to see if the art had improved) (spoiler: literally no difference). can't see why anyone would enjoy this.
