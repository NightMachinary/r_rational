I've submitted this once before, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ouxcm/xrisktransdimensional_brain_chip/][here]]. People seemed divided about it - there's a lot of good ideas, but it's badly-drawn and written in the author's second language.

Well, it's finished, so you can read it at your leisure now.
