You could probably postulate some kind of 'life energy' or 'soul energy' which would make that logically viable. Perhaps it also requires 'will to live' or something similar, such that the Matrix is a necessity, as just keeping the bodies around and unconscious would not generate energy.

None of that is of course ever explained.
