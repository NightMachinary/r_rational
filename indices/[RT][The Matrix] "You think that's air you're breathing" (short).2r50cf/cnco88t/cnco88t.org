A small continuation of sorts, to make the end result still fit with canonical Matrix.

"It wouldn't matter Neo... if the Matrix simply directly implemented its rules as if they were laws of physics." Morpheus continued "For some reason, the Matrix is designed to conserves processing power by utilizing the expectations and mental processes of those connected to it. By training in our simulations, where we can make the rules more flexible, we adjust our subconscious expectations to the point where we can bend the rules within the Matrix."

Neo sat for a moment longer, as he realized he would have to relearn what he thought was a fundamental rule. The map is not the territory. Under his old assumptions the goal was to make the map accurate to the territory. Now he would have to figure out how act when the territory was copying sections of his map. Neo thought for a moment longer. One thing was certain, he wouldn't figure it out just sitting on the ground. He exhaled as he stood up. As he let the air from his lungs, he tried to let go of his knowledge and intuition about movement about gravity. He would have to worry latter about the tradeoff between epistemic and instrumental rationality, after he beat Morpheus.
