I'm confused.

  The virtual body breathes virtual air, and that virtual air must contain something like virtual oxygen, because people in the Matrix still die from suffocation and drowning.

Right. But...

  When you hold your breath in the Matrix, the hypercapnic reflex sets in, and you start to panic. But that doesn't happen because of any conscious or subconscious mental process. It happens because there's too much carbon dioxide. Which means that it must be happening in the real world in order to affect people in the Matrix.‚Äù

I don't follow this bit. Why shouldn't the Matrix simulate the excess of CO2 and send a signal to the brain that becomes the sensation of suffocation, just like every other sense you're being fed?
