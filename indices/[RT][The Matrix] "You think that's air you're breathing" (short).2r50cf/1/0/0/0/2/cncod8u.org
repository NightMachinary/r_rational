Knowing a skill isn't about memory, particularly a physical skill. You can lose the ability to make long-term declarative and episodic memories and still gain new skills, resulting in the famous case study of the guy who was taught to play Pong after brain surgery broke his memory, and any time he sat down at a machine had /no idea/ what it was or that he'd ever seen one before, but was still predictably about to school your ass at it.

Of course this implies their interface is capable of physically myelinating neural pathways while you're plugged in, because your peripheral nervous system isn't /capable/ of being good at kung fu without that process, which usually happens slowly through training. (It produces a lot of what we colloquially call "muscle memory.")
