No, I'm not confident at all - but I do think a chemical pump of some sort would be needed if you want to achieve a passable level of fidelity. And people in the Matrix /do/ get drunk, and takes drugs, and presumably those are causing some actual change in cognition instead of just sensory input.

Edit: As cool as a line like "I know kung fu" is, I have some really big questions about how something like that is possible. How is the interface set up that they can just edit in memories at will? What's happening in the brain to make that possible?
