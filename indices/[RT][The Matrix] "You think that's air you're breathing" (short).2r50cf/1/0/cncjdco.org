It's not necessarily how you'd control the mechanism. You have chemoreceptors that might be activated directly. But that raises questions of how the human-machine interface deals with all of the subconscious stuff - the humans have a tube down their throat, and are still breathing, so if you trigger the hypercapnic reflex they would start breathing harder, which gets them more oxygen, and which should be measurable from within the Matrix (through interaction with the virtual person, not through their virtual body, which presumably gives different readings).

But if you're just fudging with things in the brain, then you get weird questions like what alcohol does - in the real world, it crosses the blood-brain barrier, but there's no good way to fake a chemical reaction like that unless you're taking complete control of every aspect of consciousness.

It makes more sense to me that the pods would have to have some kind of chemical component anyway.
