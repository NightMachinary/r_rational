I've always prefered the "harvesting humans for their brainpower" angle, in part because it makes so much more sense than using people as batteries. It does raise a whole host of questions about the machines motivations, but I think that a lot of the time you can get away with having an AI's goals be a bit alien.

I was trying to solve the brain-computer interface problem for a story I was working on a long time back, but I just don't have enough of an education to come up with something that would plausibly work how I wanted it to.
