My headcanon for motivation was that the machines had some deeply-buried routines that rewarded service to humans. Keeping some of them around and "serving" them by keeping the pods running satisfies that urge - the fact that the humans are treated like cattle satisfies the need for revenge.

These routines were integral enough to the identity of various AI that reconfiguring their runstate to not include them might count as ending the run of one AI and replacing it with a different one, "killing" the original. If continuity of consciousness is as important to the machines as is implied by the Animatrix, then running the Matrix may be the best solution for this particular problem.
