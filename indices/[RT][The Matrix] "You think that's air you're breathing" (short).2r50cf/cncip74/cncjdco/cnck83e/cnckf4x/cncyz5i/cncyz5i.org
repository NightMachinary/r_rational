To shorten a long description to a spiffy bit of jargon, the skills are added in as exocortical grafts. Some aspects of human body simulationa are going to require simulated neurons. I'm guessing that the ship's matrix-processor is able to run some extra brain material that codifies both the intellectual and kinesthetic aspects of an uploaded skill. If I were making something up, the interface would present itself as sudden awareness in the sensorium and a bunch of reinforced cognition/short-term memories to push the interface schema into long-term memory. Beyond that, I'm guessing that such a system would outright cheat the simulation of your body.

Of course, that would mean that you would spectactularly NOT know Kung Fu in the real world. It would be uniquely disturbing because you would reach for your brand-new knowledge and it would just not be there.

This would actually make for a really awesome Rational!Matrix story - especially one that used the original plot where humanity was providing CPU-cycle analogues rather than electricity. The machines put part of their minds into human brains, expanding who they can be through addition of meat. The rebels of Zion extend themselves in the Matrix by adding on mind-parts in silicon. Additionally, you would have rebels who were becoming different people in the Matrix, with all the fun story that entails.
