What is relevant is because Neo is on the ship, lack of virtual oxygen/build up of virtual CO2 isn't going to actually cause him to faint from lack of actual oxygen. So he can push himself in ways he otherwise couldn't because at the very least, he's not going to actually pass out.

(Admittedly, if your alt version of the matrix still has "dying in the matrix = dying in the real world even when you're logged in via the ship rather than in the pod", then... that spike/interface has more going on there.)
