See my example for an example of laws of rationality not working (although mine refers to the rules within the matrix). "Rationality" in general may still work, but common heuristics used to try to be rational may not. If the real laws of physics allow stable time loops, then ordinary intuitions about causation may be wrong. If the real laws allow a form of magic that causes reality to bend and conform to sapient beings epistemic states, then "the map is not the territory" heuristic stops working (see Old World of Darkness for an extreme example of this). If the real laws of physics cause high level events to run in patterns, then probability does not work as expected.
