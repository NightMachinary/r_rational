My 'solution' when the original dilemma was posted was in the same direction. That is, the Unbreakable Vow fixes the trust problem, and should allow Harry's believable surrender to Voldemort.

I was less hopeful re: their cooperation, I tended to believe that this was a "maybe the horse will learn to sing", where Harry just set himself to service and hoped that Voldemort's reign wouldn't be so bad, or that someone else would do something.
