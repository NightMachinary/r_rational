Also, I think you should somehow work in the quote from taboo tradeoffs about how utilitarians were allowed to take common sense into account and how real life utilitarians dont actually rob banks to give to the poor. Then say something about how people aren't smarter than their ethics.

Situations where its best to violate your deontological ethical injunctions in order to accomplish greater good are rare, while also being easy to find and hard to check. The exact opposite of P=nP? problems.

One should be extremely skeptical and make absolutely sure that there is no other way before violating one's deontological ethical injunctions. And its almost always more likely that you've made a mistake then that it was really the optimal choice to break your ethics. It would have been a bit more believable if Harry hadn't been so easy to convince to do this.
