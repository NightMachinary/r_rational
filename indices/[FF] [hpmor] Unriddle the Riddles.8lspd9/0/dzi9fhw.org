Impressive story. I had thought the idea of cooperating with Voldemort and Voldemort agreeing to cooperate would stretch my suspension of disbelief too much, but you actually sold me on it perfectly, keeping both Tom Riddles in character and building up to their deal well with just minor shifts from the original story.
