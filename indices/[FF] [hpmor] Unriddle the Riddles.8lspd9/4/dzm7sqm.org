I liked it.

One point that I think should be expanded on is Voldemort accepting the premise that a prophecy has to be fulfilled. He's trying to kill people to stop the prophecy he heard, so at some level, he believes that prophecy can be averted (which is true, as Dumbledore mentions blocking other prophecies of destruction). So why does Voldemort so easily accept that this particular prophecy cannot be stopped? The answer 'it has already been partially fulfilled' seems a bit weak without any evidence that a prophecy has to be completely fulfilled or not at all.
