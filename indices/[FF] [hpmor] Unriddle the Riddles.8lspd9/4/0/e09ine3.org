Yeah, that came up when I was planning the story. Ultimately I decided that it would be best to leave that without justification, for two primary reasons.

- As far as I could find, there is no solid evidence for /or/ against that in the original, other than the way the ending turned out. This means that I'd have to come up with evidence on the spot, which is a pretty bad writing move, and I think would have felt forced. This interpretation wasn't contradicted by anything, so I decided to let it pass.

- Intuitively, that seems like a more likely consequence of a mechanism that might be behind the prophecy.

Like, say I told you "my world has prophecies" and asked you to come up with a set of models for this world, with their simplicity rated according to Solomonof Induction. The most probable model would probably be "prophecies can't be averted" - you receive a bit string from the future, and then no matter what you do (with the string or otherwise) laws of physics ensure it ends up in the same state as it started when I went back in time. And then whatever mechanism that sends information back in time just sends that string back. This model gets a Bayesian update to pretty much zero probability from Dumbledore saying he averted some prophecies, and from QQ thinking that it's possible to avert prophecies.

The /second/ most probable model, in my opinion, would be "Either the string gets sent back in time, or the negation of the string gets sent back in time" i.e. suppose that in the future the string would be 100110. Now either the past receives 011001(in which case prophecy was averted entirely in this timeline), or 100110 (in which case prophecy was fulfilled in this timeline). This is the second most simple algorithm for prophecies, and the one I went with. It also pretty much means that after you've observed and confirmed the first bit, you know how the other ones will end up.

Finally, you have even more complicated algorithms for prophecy information, such as "any part of the string can be fulfilled or averted, with some complicated relation between them that ensures prophecy still tells you /something/ instead of being effectively white noise". I don't think those are /so/ improbable as to not be worth considering, but they are still less probable on priors.

[Weaker arguments start here]

- Counterfactually, if it /was/ possible to fulfill a prophecy just in part, QQ would have known about it and said as much. Since he didn't say anything, it's clearly not possible.

- As I've pointed out above, justifications of this would have felt forced and would have simply drawn more attention to this weak point. Since most people didn't seem to notice it, I feel that my sight deception had been successful.

But yeah, this is probably one of the weakest points of the fic, in my own authorial opinion. Very good catch.
