[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18630.The_Player_of_Games][The Player of Games]] by Iain M. Banks (one my favourites) fits the bill. A master of games in a post-scarcity world is bored with success. He gets forcefully "persuaded" to travel to a distant planet and play a game so complex that the winner becomes the emperor. The Empire's whole social structure is built around the game and people practice since birth. As a foreigner with no experience, how will he overcome his disadvantages?
