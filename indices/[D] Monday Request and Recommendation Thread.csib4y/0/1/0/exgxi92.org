Yes, I had this exact same conversation with Delve being very interesting but also disappointing. It felt like I got baited with a non-power fantasy isekai litRPG only to realize that the power fantasy was just hidden under the surface.

Specifically, the experience system's incentives are completely at odds with what people think of it, which makes society hold a massive idiot ball for the MC to be clever. Spoilers to follow:

There are two broad ways to get XP: killing monsters, or using health/stamina/mana points, the latter of which is significantly easier and safer to do consistently. In addition, skills can only level up through their usage, which means point usage is twice as effective at levelling your character as a whole compared to monster XP.

From this, it should be common sense that regen-focused builds are extremely effective and should be the dominant "meta" for the world, since that is the stat that directly correlates with how often you can spend points. Instead, people look at him like he's insane for dumping points in regen despite being able to level skills more than an order of magnitude faster than a "typical" build. There is no current way to excuse this complete lapse in realism beyond the author wanting to make a thinly-veiled power fantasy.

I have a bit of hope that the author will reveal things in a way to explain things in a way that makes sense, but who knows if that'll happen.
