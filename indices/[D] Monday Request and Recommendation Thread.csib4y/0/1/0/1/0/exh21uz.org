The thing is, it's only insane if you're trying to be an aura mage while being a solo /adventurer/. What should make an aura/Mregen build so popular is that there's barely a difference in level speed if you just spend all day in your bedroom, aside from the offensive auras that need some space.

It's even mentioned a bit when they say how that one empire uses slaves that level the MP conversion auras to fuel their armies, but it's not applied from the bottom up, that literally every village and town should have at least one resident aura mage who sticks inside the borders, levelling obscene amounts of skill levels just by having purify on 24/7.

Even at this point, it seems he's pretty much untouchable by regular monsters. Auras are supposed to be a slower AoE skill, but he was still able to survive a huge mob after waiting for them to get in melee range. If he hadn't hesitated, they wouldn't have even gotten close.
