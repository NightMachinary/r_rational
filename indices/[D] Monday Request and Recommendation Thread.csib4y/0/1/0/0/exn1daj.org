Mind you I'm not apologist and the story has its failings, but you've failed to mention one thing. Level Caps. In the story's system you must kill rare and relatively strong beasts to level at all. His build would have fucked him totally if he'd had a level 5 cap. He got lucky with a starting 18 or 19 cap. A build with no damage and little utility for 20 levels, is completely unviable when most people never break past 0, much less get into the 20s. This is rural kingdom and none or the character have a strong supporting organization that will carry them through enough kills to pick up momentum. So they make practical short term decisions.
