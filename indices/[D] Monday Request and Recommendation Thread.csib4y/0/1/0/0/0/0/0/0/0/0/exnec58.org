Put him up against a level 8 orc with a sword. How you think he'd do? My bad with the radius part. I replied from the app which only showed a clipped part of your comment. I guess what my point is, is that his build and other regen builds level very fast, and Do It at no risk. So the question is how strong do you become as opposed to someone who levels much slower than you but has focus, or might or w/e. As we've seen with Val, even at 5 Val is far more deadly than him. Is that always true? No. Under pack circumstances the aura is better. But all it takes is one slightly tough enemy without a frost weakness and Rain's dead. His build is very very risky. High risk, eventually very high reward.

His build actually get stronger the more pack oriented his opponent. In most games insect swarm type enemies slaughter most builds, as it's impossible to kill a 1000 locusts with a sword, while rain wouldn't be under any risk at all. So I suppose it matter mostly what kind of environment the combat occurs in or the world favors. So far though it seems to be the trend that essence mobs are singular and stronger, so most people probably favor champion style builds where you can be self reliant.
