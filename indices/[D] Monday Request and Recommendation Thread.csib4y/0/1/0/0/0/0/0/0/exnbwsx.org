Those are level 4 mobs with a fire affinity (weak to ice) . He's level 16. At 5, he'd have far less clarity, thus less mana, his radius would be far smaller and the damage smaller too. His build cannot fight strong enemies at all and he can't avoid hitting his teammates either. So he's weakish, and not a team player. At 5 he's asking to die.
