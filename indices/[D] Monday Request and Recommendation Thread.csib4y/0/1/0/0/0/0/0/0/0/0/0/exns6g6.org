I'll admit that Rain's build is risky, but I just don't think it's really much /more/ risky at its level than any other build at that level. Like you said, someone like Val with range can snipe him dead, but like in the last chapter where Val would've died Rain thrived, or back when they first met and he was going to drown thanks to a giant slime or something.

Good point on essence mobs probably being like bosses and influencing builds in that direction though, I can see that being why people either go for singular DPS or support, as we've seen so far.
