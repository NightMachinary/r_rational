Going off of people's reactions to Rain's regen, the transfer aura probably isn't used because it practically requires an Mregen build to be useful. At base, it transfers 1mp/sec at 20% efficiency, including to the caster. Apparently 500mp/day is a normal Mana Regen rate. Therefore, unless efficiency improves with level, an average mage can only gift something like 70 total mana per day sustainably.

Point on speed vs range, it's just weird for me to consider anything outside of melee weapon range short.
