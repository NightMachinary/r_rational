  What bugs me indescribably is that the rest of the cast seem to be incredibly awed by the build despite that the build is low level and could be done by anyone

I think you and a few others like [[/u/Addictedtobadfanfict]] and [[/u/meterion]] overselling how awed people are. They think it's a good build, but I haven't seen anyone actually fawning.

Lets use an actual example. Chapter 31, it's not particularly spoilery. But Rain has a 1v1 dual with another adventurer, he's level 12 at this point. His opponent is less than level 5 (since he's still trying to unlock a class). The dual is first to half health, and Rain just /barely/ manages it before he runs out of mana - and mana is his speciality.

Rain's build is very very good at three things: leveling, dealing with swarms, and provides great party utility. However it's got /massive/ drawbacks. Almost loosing a bout to someone under half your level drawbacks. He's got nothing up his sleeve to deal with smaller numbers of tougher opponents. He's got fairly low survivability and short range, already a bad combination. It's a highly specialised build that absolutely requires the support of a party to cover it's weaknesses.

The only thing that's really unique about this build is how fast it levels, but levels are capped by the highest level essence monster you've killed and all but really low level essence monsters are rare. There's no point optimising for power-levelling if you're just going to hit your cap and spend ages stuck at your current level; choose the build that does what you want instead. I can see why this build wouldn't be popular.
