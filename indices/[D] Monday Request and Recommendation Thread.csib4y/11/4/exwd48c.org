I'd recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirts_(novel)][Redshirts]] by John Scalzi. The characters know that they exist in a universe similar to Star Trek. The solutions recommended by the bridge crew shouldn't work, and only work if there is a main character around. The captain will suddenly make dramatic pronouncements, only to wait 3-5 minutes calmly before resuming where he left off. Leave on an away mission with one of the main characters, and you'll die as theyl make it back safely without you.

The setting itself is a silly one, but the characters slowly figure out how to game the system that they are in.
