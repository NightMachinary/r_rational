(I hope I'm not coming across as hostile; rest assured that I personally don't care whether a story is an /MLP/ fanfiction or not, I just think that recommendations are a Serious Businessâ„¢.)

  I can't think of one non-stupid reason to separate pony fiction out from the rest

Well, what about this one: /MLP/ fanfiction is literally about sentient ponies as opposed to humans, which may not fit with some people's aesthetic preferences, therefore we should differentiate it from the other fiction the way we do with NSFW fiction.

Or this one: It is factual that some people dislike /MLP/. However stupid their reasons, it is factual that these people will be annoyed if they receive an unmarked /MLP/ recommendation, and will (if they remember) be less inclined to listen to your recommendations in the future. Unless you consider those who would dislike an /MLP/ fanfiction for being an /MLP/ fanfiction literal scum of the Earth whose happiness is actively detrimental to your utility function --- and I don't imagine that you do --- their annoyance should be considered a negative consequence, as well as their being biased against accepting your future recommendations.

Or this one: Consider an r/rational in which all people who can enjoy /MLP/ fanfiction follow your policy. Those who dislike /MLP/ fanfiction would be biased against asking for recommendations there /at all/, expecting to receive an /MLP/ fanfiction in reply, and may well leave the subreddit altogether. Again: unless you consider them so evil their presence is detrimental to your happiness, you would not want this to happen.

Or this one: Consider an r/rational in which /everyone/ follows your policy for /all/ kinds of fiction. Porn, gore, slice-of-life, furry, edgelord fantasies, dubious XIV Inquisition tracts, fanfiction, nonfiction, metafiction, interactive fiction, published literature, movies, anime, manga, comics, plays --- all of this is being actively recommended without any disclaimers, an enormous mess. Would you wish to browse such a subreddit? Would you wish to ask it for recommendations?

  If you just don't like the genre it's simple enough to click back out

Mentioning that the story you're recommending is an /MLP/ fanfiction takes no more than three seconds. Following a link and determining that it's an /MLP/ fanfiction takes at least as much. If you expect more than one person to take note of your recommendation, and if at least two of these people will be such that they dislike /MLP/ fanfiction, and if you wish to minimize wasted time, then marking your /MLP/ recommendations is preferable to the alternative.
