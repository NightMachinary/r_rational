Most of what comes to mind aren't technically isekai, npbut might as well be, a few for you:

[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/release-that-witch/][Release That Witch]] - has a lot of what you're looking for, but I wouldn't call it rational and the MC's knowledge is OP\\
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safehold][/Safehold/ by Weber]] - lots of detail, which it sounds like you might like. Also lots of military and politics which you may or may not. Very slow series\\
[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30985483-cast-under-an-alien-sun][Cast Under an Alien Sun]] - I really can't let myself recommend this as it was a terrible slog for me to get through these (they read like they weren't edited in the least). But I did read them and other people on this sub do like them. And they do have what you're looking for, although you may end up frustrated like me at the /what/ and the /how/ of the MC's novel knowledge reveals.\\
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_a_Realist_Hero_Rebuilt_the_Kingdom][How a Realist Rebuilt the Kingdom]] - haven't read this one yet\\
[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break them All]] - slow updates; no real uplift just munchkining the magic system using modern knowledge\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] - Harry Potter fanfic with OP Hermione
