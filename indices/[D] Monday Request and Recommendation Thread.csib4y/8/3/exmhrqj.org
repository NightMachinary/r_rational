I couldn't get into A hero's war, after... quite a few chapters, I forget how many. I got as far as a short time after the MC (or one of 2, maybe? been a while since I read it) led a village of demihumans to a castle, and something something crossbows?

I don't even remember what it was that put me off, but I see if recommended now and then and wonder if it improved after the point I dropped it. I'm usually pretty forgiving/willing to keep reading mediocre fiction, so I tend not to come back to something I actually do drop, but it is recommended here a lot...
