Spoilers, but Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, post chapter 1000. This also happens to be one of the best rational/ist stories I've read.

  Disclaimer: don't read this if you can't handle a hundred chapters of poor English, though the translations are fine later on with the newest translator. The early chapters are also full of Cultivation tropes; it only goes HPMOR on you later on, starting gradually.
