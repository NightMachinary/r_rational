I'm looking for something rather broad: a protagonist at the top of their game. Just someone who is quite competent at what they do.

As an example, I recently watched (and really enjoyed) Chernobyl, which was fantastic TV. Jared Harris's Valery Legasov, as well as Stellan Skarsgard's character's bureaucratic competence and Emily Watson's aggregated scientist character are all good examples of what I'm looking for.

I'm sick of the Hero's Journey and interminable chapters or episodes devoted to characters figuring out their new special powers or what-not.
