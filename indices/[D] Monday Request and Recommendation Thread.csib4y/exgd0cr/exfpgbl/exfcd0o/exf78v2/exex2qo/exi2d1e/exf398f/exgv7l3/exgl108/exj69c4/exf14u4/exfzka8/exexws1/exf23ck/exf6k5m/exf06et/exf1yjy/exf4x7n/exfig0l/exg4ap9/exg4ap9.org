Minimizing wasted time is a good enough reason for me, thanks. I have changed my mind. Your point about porn or gore isn't relevant here, I think, since an aesthetic preference can't actually harm people unless they have a phobia against ponies as they do against spiders. Which is possible, I think, but a very rare eventuality that I don't feel obligated to prevent.
