Actually no idea. I dropped it around volume 20 where my immersion broke. The author seemed sure that an oversized army of < lvl 10 noobs + a few high lvl players makes an OP army. A single instance of acid rain could wipe out the entire army, but that never happens. And we know for a fact that ridiculously large scale aoe attacks exist, since the MC has used some before.
