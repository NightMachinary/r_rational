I'm looking for stories where the protagonist knows of the plot, but isn't necessarily the "main character" that the story revolves around. They then use that knowledge for a specific purpose, usually to get stronger or prevent something from happening, and then make observations about the main characters actions, changes to the setting, and how it all happened (my favorite part).

I'm not sure of what type of trope this counts as, aside from time travel or deconstruction, but Hero's War and Mother of Learning are prime examples along with many reincarnation/do-over/self-insert stories.

Just recommend whatever you think fits.
