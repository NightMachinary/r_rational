Population hasn't necessarily doubled, a low tech world means low population as well.

A lot of farms would probably become unusable, yes, as large trees pop into what were previously easily harvested fields of food. Maybe the Sahara becomes more livable if desertification was undone, but I doubt that there are many other areas where food production could increase. You'd get the Bikini Atol back I guess.

Mines just got refilled and oil Wells replenished, so I guess that's nice for environmentalists until the world recovers enough to start pumping tons of oil again. The Amazon recovers substantially.
