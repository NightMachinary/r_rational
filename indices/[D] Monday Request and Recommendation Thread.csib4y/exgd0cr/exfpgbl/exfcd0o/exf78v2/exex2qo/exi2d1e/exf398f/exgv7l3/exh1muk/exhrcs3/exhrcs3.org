Of course. Just because Magnus Carlsen is good at chess doesn't mean he can't (1) play other very good chess players and (2) face difficulties outside of the realm of chess, too. Ideally the conflict would just not come in the form of 'struggling with own skill' or 'unlocking hidden power'. James Bond is a good example. He's an awful person, but I don't think his tradecraft can be doubted, and he loses sometimes anyway because he's also pitted against competent antagonists.

I've never read any of those; thanks for the recommendations. I am familiar with some of the Dresden Files characters, and I'm looking to read more about the Blackstaff than Harry when I talk about 'competence.' Sorry for the fuzziness. I've been told before it's not only okay but that I'd be better off skipping the first few books in DF. Thoughts?
