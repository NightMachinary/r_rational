The key word there is â€˜typically'. When the fandom is not given, no offense is taken, and no attempt made to ensure the original recommender rectify the matter. Instead, a commenter may take it upon themself to state the fandom in the recommender's place, often with their own personal view on the story mentioned. However, when such a story originates from within the MLP fandom, ire is often directed at the recommended, that they would dare display such a work without warning. It is a double standard that many attempt to dismiss, but it is unarguably there.
