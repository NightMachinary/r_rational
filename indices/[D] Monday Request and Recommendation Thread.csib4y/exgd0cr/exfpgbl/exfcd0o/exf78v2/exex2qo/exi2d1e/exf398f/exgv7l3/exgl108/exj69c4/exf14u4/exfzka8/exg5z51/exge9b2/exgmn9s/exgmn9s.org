[[https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/][Omniscient Reader is Viewpoint]]. Translated from Korean, apocalypse + game system + sequential challenges. MC reads an in-world novel about a character who is in a time loop of the described apocalypse. Apocalypse actually happens and MC finds himself in the story character's 3rd loop. MC has read up to the character's 1000th+ loop, but has none of the OP boosts the character has, so he has to hack his own way.

Rational? Far more than most in the genre, but I can't judge the specifics.
