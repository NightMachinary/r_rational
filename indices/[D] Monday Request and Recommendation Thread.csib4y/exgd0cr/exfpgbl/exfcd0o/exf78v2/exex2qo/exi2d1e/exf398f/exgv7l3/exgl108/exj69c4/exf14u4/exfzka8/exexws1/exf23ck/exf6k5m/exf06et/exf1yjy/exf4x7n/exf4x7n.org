I don't get why. Stories about ponies are stories about people. If you just don't like the genre it's simple enough to click back out. I've been accommodating that wish forever now, and I think I'll just ... not. I've been on a reflective streak recently, and I can't think of one non-stupid reason to separate pony fiction out from the rest. We have actual smut posted on this sub, we can't pretend to some high literary standard.
