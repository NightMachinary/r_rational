I definitely noticed something about hero's war that made it feel less exciting. The plot, characters, and world are all fine, so I think it's something in the pacing or writing style. If I had to guess; Most successful webnovels I've read are really good at hyping up events that are going to happen in the future, so maybe A Hero's War seems dull in comparison.
