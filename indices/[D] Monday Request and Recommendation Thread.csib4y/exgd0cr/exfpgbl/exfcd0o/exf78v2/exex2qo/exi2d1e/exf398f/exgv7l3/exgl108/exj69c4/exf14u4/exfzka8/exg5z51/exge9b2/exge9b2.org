I don't have any direct recs but [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/64944-theirs-not-to-reason-why][Theirs Not To Reason Why]] came to mind when reading your desire. Give it a shot if you like / don't mind military sci-fi.

The protagonist is a prexog whose goal is to set things up and set things in motion for later successes - including future "MC"s - so that they're able to do what must be done. We don't get to see that resolution, though, IIRC. World-building is a little weaker than I'd prefer, but it's a great read overall.
