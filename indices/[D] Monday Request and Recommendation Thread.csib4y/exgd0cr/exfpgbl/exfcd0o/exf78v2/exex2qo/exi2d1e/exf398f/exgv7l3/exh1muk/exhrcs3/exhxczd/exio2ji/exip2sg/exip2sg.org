It's not irrational, but the characters don't do a ton of introspection, so I'm not surprised it's not mentioned more, here.

I... have a really bad habit of not finishing series that I enjoy or step away from for a little while. Maybe something to do with not wanting a good thing to wnd? Or be betrayed by a poor installment? So I have read all but /The Dark at the End/. It's been sitting on my shelf since it came out, basically :/

I should probably suck it up and re-read the saga.
