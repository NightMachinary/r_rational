[[https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3512#comment-1748221][Here's a quote from Scott Aaronson talking about quantum computers.]]

#+begin_quote
  We have a coherent picture of reality according to which quantum mechanics is true and the Extended Church-Turing Thesis is false. That picture is the one that I subscribe to, and that most scientists subscribe to, and that Google and IBM and Microsoft implicitly subscribe to. It's a picture that does promise more computational power than the Extended Church-Turing Thesis would have, *but only slighty and subtly more---as I like to say, more in a pattern that's so weird that no science-fiction writer, no sophist just stringing words together in a way that sounded good, would ever have had the imagination to invent it.*

Could someone recommend me sci-fi like this?
