I'm thinking maybe I should try this "Brandon Sanderson" character I keep hearing so much about; everyone says he has terrific worldbuilding (though a few add that the rest is rubbish). The library has several series, including Mistborn and Stormlight Archive, albeit Mistborn is currently checked out. Any recommendations as to which to check out first, series to pass on, etc.?
