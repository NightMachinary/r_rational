The first book of [[https://www.amazon.com/Street-Cultivation-Sarah-Lin-ebook/dp/B07W9J75R3][Street Cultivation]] is out on Amazon and I enjoyed reading it for free on royalroad so much that I bought a copy to support the author.

You can read the first five chapters on [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][royalroad]] if you are undecided, but for me, it eases some of the Cradle-withdrawal symptoms I'm suffering through.

It's basically taking the trappings of the wuxia genre and putting it in a modern-day setting, without letting the main character have anything special or unique. He has to dig himself out of poverty with nothing but his smarts, hard work, and a little luck.

Another wuxia recommendation is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25962/cultivating-earth][Cultivating Earth]]. There's only 20 short chapters out so far, but it's off to a strong start. It's about a cultivator who reached immortality by consuming all qi on a world for 4,000 years. This world resulted in our modern reality. To pay back the karmic debt, he's cultivating Earth.

It was recommended a few weeks ago and I'm posting it again to show how much I liked it.
