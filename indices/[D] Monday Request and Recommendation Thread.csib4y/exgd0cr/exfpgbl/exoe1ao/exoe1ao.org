I really enjoyed Street Cultivation. I read the sample chapters first, purchased it, and then devoured it in one sitting. Definitely don't regret my choice.

For anyone considering it, it's basically a LitRPG except followed through to its logical conclusion, with the main character having very, very little of the typical "luck" that LitRPG MC's tend to.

It's also far better written than the usual fare for the genre. The characters actually each have character, and the writing is solid overall - no awkward sentences that I noticed. The pacing is pretty good too, except maybe the very last bit - but that's debatable.

Overall, highly recommended for people who like LitRPGs but also dislike the mental masturbation aspect of them.
