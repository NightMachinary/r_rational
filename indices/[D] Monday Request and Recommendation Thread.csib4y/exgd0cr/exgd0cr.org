Last week [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/][Delve]] were recommended. It's a litrpg isekai and I think it have a really promising start with the protagonist having to learn the languages and not getting unique treatment. To be fair the protagonist haven't made any painfully wrong decisions, only arguably suboptimal ones. The main focus point from the situation seems to be how good the protagonists choice of build is. What bugs me indescribably is that the rest of the cast seem to be incredibly awed by the build despite that the build is low level and could be done by anyone, and (unless the game balance is rigged) should be inferior on certain points. Granted there are plausible explanations to why a certain build isn't widespread, maybe the search space for possible skill combinations are absolutely massive or maybe there is a stigma against aura mages or something. But it isn't explored and since the protagonist's class is widely known, auras are known, the protagonist only uses low level skills, it really comes off as poorly written powerwanking.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Sword-Bright-Lady-WORLD-PRIME/dp/1616149884][World of Prime]] were also recommended. It's similarly an isekai with implied DnD mechanics. Experience are gained from the skulls of dead sentient creatures and that have been to some degree been commercialized(mind you, still in medieval/feudal society so it isn't optimized). It revolves around the introduction of firearms to kill monsters without having levels and the societal conflicts of letting unleveled yield power that is comparable to those with levels. A lot of the NPC's makes suboptimal decisions but they do it from perspectives and motivations that seems plausible. The protagonist isn't super intelligent and mostly just survives on implementing ideas from our world. I have a lot of minor complaints but overall I both enjoyed book 1 and book 2.
