You're right about his power levelling, and I think it's the part that's the most impressive to his party. It is weird that you don't get experience for using skills on monsters, but you could work around it by using the mana transfer aura - or some equivalent skill to let others grind almost as fast as Rain. I'm surprised the adventurer's guild doesn't do it, but that could be cultural. Adventurer's might not consider sitting around a guildhall pumping out mana to be much of an adventure and the people who do might be getting a better deal elsewhere.

For short/range vs mid range. It depends on movement speed skills, but we've seen how fast Ameliah can run. If charge/leap/sprint skills are common among melee DPS I wouldn't rely on 50ft of distance to keep me safe. Even if there's a tank in front of you, you'll be in range of melee classes using skills to jump over your tank, and shorter range than any dedicated ranged fighter.

It's a decent build, but it's a very specialised build that's great in the right circumstances and limited outside them.
