Actually, I'd been arguing the opposite: that everyone thinks his build is trash when it's fairly decent and only going to get better. I don't deny that Rain's choice of skill/class/stats make him extremely lopsided, but when it comes to RPG land no man is an island until you reach epic levels.

We already saw what happened when Val tried to take on an essence mob solo, so it's not a particularly big drawback to rely on being in a party to raise your level cap. I'm pretty sure any build that doesn't include some kind of self-buff or self-heal isn't going to be totally self-sufficient, which fits most of the characters we've seen.

Also, I definitely would not consider Rain short range; he's a solid mid-range fighter what with a 50ft AoE. Plus, now that he's figured out how to use Velocity to trip up opponents, it will let him disengage from fights easier in the future. Plus, you're missing half the point when you mention the fast levelling: it's not just that /he/ levels fast, it's that his /skills/ do to.

Like when Ameliah says that his level of Purify is at, in a month, what it took her over a year to achieve, that's the other power of his build. MP regen is the real bottleneck for levelling skills, since as far as it's been shown monster XP doesn't funnel into skill levels. Even if his actual level plateaus, maximizing skill levels will give him an enormous edge over people who can't dump tens of thousands of points into spells every day.
