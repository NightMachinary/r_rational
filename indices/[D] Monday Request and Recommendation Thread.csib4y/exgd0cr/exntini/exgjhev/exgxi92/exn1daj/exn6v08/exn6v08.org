Looking at it from a local/munchkin perspective, you don't actually need to have that high of a cap to start going crazy with a pure aura regen build if you know what you're doing.

You need three points into Intrinsic Focus, Intrinsic Clarity, Magical Synergy to get a workable mana pool and the most efficient mana regen bonuses. If you really had a level 5 cap to work with (which leaves six skills, getting one at level 0) then Purify and Amplify Aura would give you the XP engine needed to skill level everything to max, and round it off with Refrigerate/Immolate for sufficient solo dps.

Everything beyond that is just fine-tuning the build and stacking more bonuses, but those six are really all you'd theoretically need to become a powerhouse in a month or two.
