The radius would actually be as I described, that's the base range for Refrigerate at its level. The power loss I already took into account, and it's really not a significant change (going from ~110dps to 93dps).

As for the mana levels, using the equations in chapter 30 for 10 focus and 70 clarity, a level 5 optimal aura mage would have 757 mana and 6315mana/day regen, or 4.3mana/min. With a fully-amplified refrigerate consuming 84mana/sec, they'd still be able to pull off the kind of move MC did at level 16, if cutting it a bit close.

I'm not trying to say that an aura mage at that level has no weaknesses or is broken, but they're still powerful enough that it shouldn't be unthinkable for someone to spec like that.
