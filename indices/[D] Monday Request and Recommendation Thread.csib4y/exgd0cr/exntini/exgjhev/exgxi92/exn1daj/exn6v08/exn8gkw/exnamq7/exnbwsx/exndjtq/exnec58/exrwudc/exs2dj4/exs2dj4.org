If you start with the assumption that adventurers can't afford to cooperate in the long term, that's true. But when you already have a medieval society backdrop, some degree of specialization should be expected. We've already seen A) someone can tag along with a party to get the benefits of a high skill cap essence mob, and B) adventurer parties can be formed around babysitting an inexperienced member. Centralized systems and individuals like guilds should logically be using their wealth to bankroll hyper-specialists that pay more dividends in the long run than having 20 flavors of warrior in your hire.
