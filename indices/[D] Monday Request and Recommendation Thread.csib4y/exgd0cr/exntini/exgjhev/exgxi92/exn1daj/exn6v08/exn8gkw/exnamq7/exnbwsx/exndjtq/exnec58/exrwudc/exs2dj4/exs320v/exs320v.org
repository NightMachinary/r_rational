  We've already seen A) someone can tag along with a party to get the benefits of a high skill cap essence mob

Sure, but it's rare to find a high cap essence mob. They're not something you can farm - at best, "tamed" essence areas generate level ~5 mobs.

Which means that this babysitter party also needs to be highly mobile /and/ have a really good intelligence network, in order to have the right person harvest high-cap essence mobs before someone else can steal them.

I'm not saying these things don't exist - but they're probably restricted to the nobility. And the nobility isn't going to go all-in on a glass cannon build like Rain's for themselves.
