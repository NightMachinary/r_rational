The main problem is that:

- In terms of party utility, that build sucks. Nobody would bring them along because they'd indiscriminately hurt both friend and foe.

- In terms of 1:1 fighting, you can't punch up.

The build of every adventurer we've met so far is geared towards one thing: being able to defeat an enemy that's higher level than they are, possibly in a party context.

Every adventurer needs to be able to reach that minimum bar, or else /they'll hit their cap and never level again/.

The thing about this system is that there's no real benefit to being able to wipe out hordes of low-level monsters. It gives you XP towards your cap, but that's it. In order to advance, you need to be able to punch up.

It's a self-limiting build. Which is why people don't use it unless they're forced to.
