  What bugs me indescribably is that the rest of the cast seem to be incredibly awed by the build despite that the build is low level and could be done by anyone, and (unless the game balance is rigged) should be inferior on certain points.

That is exactly where the novel died for me. I am going to rant a little because I thought this was the next big novel from Royalroad. It was foreshadowed that the MC build was special because everyone was outwardly reacting to it when he was using his aura purify spells. Then like 15 chapters later he used it around a mage girl and she uses the "system ui" to check what that spell was and shrug it off complaining that it was too much mana cost. It was such a letdown because firstly, this is the first time a character other than the MC shows that they got access to the system. Secondly, it shows how the author purposely led us on thinking that the MC was "special" with his system usage but apparently the whole population can use the system? Why did they show the workers freaking out in the sewer when he saw the MC use magic before this happened? What a big tease, let down, and expectation killer.
