If I'm understanding it correctly you are arguing against the claim that the build is good. None of us is saying that. We are saying that the cast seem awed at most things Rain does and that the world in general seems engineered towards making Rain look powerful despite a build of questionable quality. The cast are consistently awed at his mana regen, at the cleaning thing, and in recent chapters the possibility of getting shear with a build that isn't invested in Focus for damage. In recent chapters the group encountering a swarm and coincidentally NOBODY have any AOE, not even the other high level Mage, except our saviour protagonist.
