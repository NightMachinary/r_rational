Wait. You didn't know that everyone had access to the system? That's fairly typical for this kind of portal litRPG. I can't think of anything that foreshadowed it being unique to the MC. Quite the opposite, he started by looking up the skills he saw his party use.

  Why did they show the workers freaking out in the sewer when he saw the MC use magic before this happened?

They're level 0. It's made pretty clear that most of the population are level 0, and level 0s haven't got access to magic and don't see it often so they react appropraitely. You have to kill an essence monster (being part of a party counts) before you can level up.
