One of the requirements of Rain's build is to focus exclusively on clarity at the expense of all other stats. If monster damage scales reasonably, it wouldn't be surprising to see stronger enemies (e.g. essence monsters) capable of one-shotting him. This is presumably a problem for most mages, however, ironically, a lower level Rain would be much worse in a team than an ordinary mage since his dps is indiscriminate.

I like how fitting Rain's build is for him, exclusively. The skill leveling mechanic rewards quick leveling which would presumably be far less useful for a native having several years to hit their level cap. The over-mana mechanic lets him retain information allowing him to learn the local language and culture far quicker than normal. It's an attempt to make a â€˜game system' fit for the character while not breaking the setting.
