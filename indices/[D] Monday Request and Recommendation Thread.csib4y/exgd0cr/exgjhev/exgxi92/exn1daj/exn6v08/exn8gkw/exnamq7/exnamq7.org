But you would have refrigerate! Assume that your shut-in aura mage managed to get Refrigerate and Amplify Aura to where MC's were in the current chapter (6 and 9, respectively).

Between all his other skills, MC was putting out enough damage to solo kill an entire pack of feral fire dogs in just a few seconds with a 224% damage modifier. With only AA, that boost just decreases to 190%. With only 6 skills you'd still have a 20 foot sphere of icy death, no sword needed. And with some actual leather armor/gambeson like he had, tanking a few hits until everything's frozen solid wouldn't be too hard.
