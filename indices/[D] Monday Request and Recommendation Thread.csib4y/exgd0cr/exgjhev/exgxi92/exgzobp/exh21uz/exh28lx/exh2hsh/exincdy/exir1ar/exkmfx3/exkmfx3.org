Also something to keep in mind is that several of his abilities are super inconvenient without higher level passives. It's mentioned that his damage auras are very mana intensive which is only really staved off by the regen passives he took. Initially, he could only have one aura at a time, couldn't discriminate between targets, and couldn't adjust intensity. Each of these problems could be solved by taking another skill, but that would require a significantly higher level cap than most people might have.

Presumably, most people would just be better off taking a well rounded class, but our protagonist (inadvertently) takes advantage of having a high level cap by having a build that levels skills really fast.
