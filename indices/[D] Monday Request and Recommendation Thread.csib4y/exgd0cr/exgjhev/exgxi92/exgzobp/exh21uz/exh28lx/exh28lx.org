Fair enough. I suppose I just assumed things (or at least the people he was interacting with) were much more individualistic. But they shouldn't have acted as surprised / appalled as they did. And, like the other poster said, there's been other inconsistencies with how much knowledge people have and how they act or don't act related to that.

Really, it just needs a good editing pass.
