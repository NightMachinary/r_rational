I like Sanderson, I've read all his stuff and enjoyed it. I've even listend to his podcast and found a lot of wisdom in his writing advice. Even though I'd recommend you read his stuff, I do feel his writing is a bit too "by the numbers". An analogy I like about him is that he's the SFF writer equivalent of JJ Abrams rather than Spielberg or Nolan; a technically proficient mass appeal writer that hits all the right notes, but who takes zero risks and pushes no boundaries.

As to a launching off point, I'd say Mistborn 1 is as good a place to start as any. It does (or is in the process of doing) something which no other series has done, to my knowledge, which is to start at a low tech setting and progress it gradually towards a high tech setting, while giving due consideration to how magic would affect such a civ's development. He's currently in the industrial revolution part of that timeline (think american wild west frontier) and I've enjoyed the books set there a lot so far.
