The first Mistborn trilogy is my preferred rec, and I would highly recommend it over Way of Kings, if only because of it being 'complete'.

It gives a great impression of his more 'mechanical' writing style, and has several amazing Sanderson Climaxes, where a million puzzle pieces laid throughout the novel come together perfectly in ways you never expected.

The Way of Kings is arguably the better book, but you'll be waiting for the end of the series for over a decade.
