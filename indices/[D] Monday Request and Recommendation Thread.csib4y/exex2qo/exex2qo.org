[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] is okay, I guess. I mean, the writing's pretty good. But I clicked on it because I wanted to read HPMOR where Harry actually follows the damn phoenix, not a metaphorical one. There's already [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]] for that.
