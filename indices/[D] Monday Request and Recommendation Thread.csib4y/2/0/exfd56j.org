Just pulling what I can out of my ratfics folder:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/649448/chapters/1181375][The Culture Explores Warhammer 40k]] - An interesting experimental fic with some fun ideas, kind of trails off as I recall. More appealing to the hardcore Warhammer, casual Culture fan than vice-versa- spends a lot of time on the Culture supertech without really examining the deeper moral problems of a classic Liberal-in-the-philosophical-sense society meeting a universe that might literally, actually be evil. Still worth browsing at least.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good]] - fun with memetics and antimemetics, a great little mystery that shouldn't be spoiled too much here
