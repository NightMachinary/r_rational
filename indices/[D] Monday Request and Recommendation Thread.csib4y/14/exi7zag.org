So I had an idea for a story about our world merging with one full of magic. You know the horror stories they present in any fiction that includes teleportation about avoiding teleporting into things? Well the landmasses of the two worlds are essentially the same but completely different societies and levels of technology. So when everything merges some things (pretty much everything) do it literally. And only through the intervention of the gods do most living things not immediately die. What happens after is up to the people as the gods go dark for 5 years to "recharge".

This means electricity and water are gone as pipes and cables are cut off by dirt and plants. Trees, grass and bushes pop up in homes. Old world villages merged with cul-de-sacs. Farms in peoples backyards and popping up in the road. Buildings topple as plants and wood buildings replace important supports. Everything and anyone underground is likely buried. And now magical creatures find themselves in strange new environments and react badly. Some pockets of great holy power devoted to Order might survive unscathed but it's basically the apocalypse.

I was wondering what this subreddits thoughts were on how people would react? How they'd survive? Where would they go?

And also how bad it would be? I mean if this happened what would you expect the mortality rate to be? Would anyone survive if containment on pretty much every nuclear facility failed, missiles were buried, waste exposed to an unshielded environment?

And what would society look like in 5 years once things had settled? Would civilizations from different era's mingle? murder each other?
