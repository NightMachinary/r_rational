I dislike "rational" stories where maybe one character ever actually thinks about stuff. Like, people have been using magic in this culture for the last ten thousand years and somehow you're the first person to examine its underpinnings? Yeah right.

This is actually something I really like about KJ Parker's approach to magic - there's always intimations of a deep and complicated magical tradition, where people have tried to do things right and provide formal proofs of their theories (and which I feel like he's mostly cribbing from antique philosophers, but that's fine)
