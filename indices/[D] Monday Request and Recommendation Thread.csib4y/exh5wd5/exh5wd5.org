I re-recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22356/dreams-come-true/chapter/324904/01][Dreams come true]] for fun, thoughtless entertainment (~300K words, ongoing, currently 7th place at TopWebFiction).\\
The premise is basically co-existence as isekai and in reality, which makes for a nice contrast in storytelling and a fun non-trivial situation to try to exploit. The writing style is easily tolerable, the plot doesn't stagnate, and worldbuilding/magic system were fun with at least minor depth. There is some aspect of the early reality plot which is ridiculous, but that aspect can be safely ignored, having zero future consequences that are not easily attributed to bad writing (IMO). Overall, for my tastes, it is much better than the known alternatives in the "meaningless fun" category, so if that's what you are looking for right now - try it.\\
