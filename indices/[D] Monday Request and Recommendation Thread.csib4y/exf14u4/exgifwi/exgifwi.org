The Long Earth series could fit this, I guess? Premise is there's a device that anyone can make with supplies from RadioShack and a potato that teleports you to an alternate Earth with no humans and some minor alterations to things like species that exist and geology. Additionally, there's an apparently infinite number of these universes, and they can only be accessed sequentially, ie you have to go to each alternate Earth one after the other with no skipping. The consequences of this are pretty fascinating to me.

I personally liked the entire 5 book series, but some people feel like the quality gets worse over time. The setting isn't especially rational but I think it's pretty self-consistent. Also features a pretty good AI character.
