That's the thing, quantum computers aren't like having more, but not too many more, computers. They're different computers, and they do expand the set of practically-computable programs, but only in a weird and specific set of ways that very few tech reporters can accurately convey.

The point that the quote is making is that sci-fi very rarely includes subtle science like this. It tends to just be more of what we've already seen; /better/ computers, spaceships, weapons, resource acquisition, or energy generation.

I'm trying to keep the question open-ended, but I'm going for fiction with new science that's weird in a similar way to how quantum computers are weird.
