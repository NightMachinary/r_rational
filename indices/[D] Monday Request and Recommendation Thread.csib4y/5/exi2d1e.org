So I read most of [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/][Lord of Mysteries]] which was recommended by [[/u/awoods187]]. I'll give it a strong second. It's a Chinese webnovel, but the writing and translation quality is much better than usual. You can still tell that its translated, but it didn't bother me. I think the author has more western influences than usual, which may make it more accessible for western readers. The story is enjoyable, and has an interesting world. Think Victorian SCP with some dnd, lovecraft and xianxia mixed in. The power progression is reasonable without being boring, and the main character is actually clever and likeable. It's long and doesn't seem to have a strong overarching plot, but if you are okay with some meandering you will probably enjoy it.
