In Isekai (with or without a game system), %-wise, almost none of them make an effort to use Earth knowledge. Even among stories where the main character tries to exploit the world's mechanics, its usually focused around the new world with the old world mostly forgotten.

For clarification, 'technology' means engineering products from any discipline, from mechanical to materials to cosmetics.

A world with magic or game systems means that people in it can rely on magical technology to solve problems, which means less research would be put into non-magical technologies. An example of this is Shadow of the Conqueror ([[https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Conqueror-Chronicles-Everfall-Book-ebook/dp/B07TB4YSHX][on Amazon]]) which is plain fantasy, where the existence of healers directly results in poor medical competence.

The only stories I'm familiar that really try this

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war][A hero's war]]

  - Starts down the industrial tech route, then progresses to combined technologies

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced][Displaced]]

  - Uses mainly combined technologies (only the uplift character)

- [[http://www.hpmor.com][HMPOR]]

  - Uses muggle technology in the Games, but most of the time focused on magical technology

Any recommendations for me? I especially want ones with materials/chemical engineering, since there's a lot of untapped potential there.
