The Babyeaters are a spawning species that are somewhat less intelligent than humans, crystalline and silicon-based, highly rational, scientific and co-operative and perfectly at peace with themselves. And they eat their offspring. The Iktotch produce large litters, are more intelligent than humans, incapable of anything like a formal scientific method, protein-and water based (though not DNA based), four-limbed (usually), incredibly irrational and prone to bias, highly factional and prone to destructive wars. They enslave and brutally exploit other Iktotch, including their own children. Both species have a long evolutionary history of farming and were partly shaped by group selection. But the Iktotch consider cannibalism disgusting, if you're interested. I based Starwhisp on the mote in god's eye more than TWC but since TWC is also based on the Mote the similarities are there.
