Iktotch are biologically immortal and live for centuries, and the historical description says that they do have a shared culture, it's just mostly oral and informal. So Iktotch build on the knowledge of previous inventions that's either passed on or stolen from other Iktotch domains. The geniuses who invent new technology are always in positions of power and draw up plans that underlings follow. All the components have to be plundered or produced locally but that's part of the reason it's taken them 15 millenia just to get this far. And rocket factories, being the product of foresight, probably would have some internal infrastructure like roads and pipelines. Particularly clever ruling Iktotch will build planned settlements with internal barracks and factories but such planning never lasts.
