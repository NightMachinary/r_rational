It's also worth noting that ruling Iktotch (and any Iktotch that doesn't have its independence hormonally suppressed), have an intelligence comparable to a human of IQ 150-200, as far as the comparison can be made. A single Iktotch lineage probably discovered the atomic nucleus, fission, nuclear bombs, nuclear reactors and then nuclear gas core rockets over a few dozen generations of tinkering and passing on notes, equipment and designs (remember the Iktotch language is mainly used for passing on factual data) from firstborn to firstborn, but once the technology existed it would be stolen or copied by rival Iktotch. And those Iktotch groups that don't copy the technology dissapear into irrelevance or get invaded.
