[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow][I think this is relevant.]]; my suggestion would be to turn that into narration instead of dialogue. Also, I like to make the first sentence the Wham! line that pulls the audience in, instead of using an entire paragraph. That can take one of two forms, complex and simple.

Simple: Manehattan burned.

Complex: When Jake got up that day, he didn't expect that lunch would include tea and scones with Loki's daughter.

As to how much to share, my suggestion is: a lot. Pick a schedule (I suggest every week) and post here on that schedule, with the promise that every week there will be another X words. Precommittment and public accountability supports success.
