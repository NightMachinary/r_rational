I wrote the first thousand words last night once midnight hit, and will probably have the first chapter (which is mostly a prologue) done by the end of the day. I'm still planning to post to [[https://www.fictionpress.com/%7Ealexanderwales][fictionpress.com]] but I'm not sure how many disclaimers I need about the fact that the novel is being written in a month and probably won't be as high of quality as I would like.

Edit: [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3221980/1/The-Dark-Wizard-of-Donkerk][The first chapter (~6000 words)]] is now up. I'm lagging behind my outline targets - at the current rate, it would be a doorstopper epic instead of a nice and tidy 80K word novel. I'll have to work on that. The second chapter ~8000 words is also up.
