3395 words of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2gttf1/dbst_anyone_writing_a_rationalist_novel_for/clqy11s][my novel]] written at the end of day 2. Yesterday went nicely with 2184 words, but then I went to some friends who helped screw over my sleep patterns and I spent a large part of today in a haze. We'll see how tomorrow goes, given that I need to get back on working on my MSc thesis as well.

Mostly throwing random scenes together in Scrivener at the moment, without being too concerned of how they fit together chronologically, or even which ones will be kept in the final manuscript. I hope something sensible will finally emerge from this.

Excerpt from day 1:

  "This shouldn't be any worse than your worst nightmare."

  "I've heard more reassuring descriptions."

Excerpt from day 2:

  Then the ground under him shook, and those thoughts were pushed away, it being more urgent to find out what was happening. He heard the rumbling of stone under him, as the ground moved and earth shoot up; and then he heard the melody in the rumble, the sound waves that had pushed through the ground and broken it, and which then burst into fire as they made contact with the air, taking the shape of a woman who was standing in front of him.

  The Fire-Singer.
