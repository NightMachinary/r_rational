I'm going to give it a go this time, mainly to crank out a lousy first draft of a novel that I've wanted to write for ages ("hard fantasy" about language, culture, and qualia) but I keep getting bogged down in timeline and character minutia.

I think it'll be easier to futz with the details once I've got a /complete story/ than it has been trying to cram all of the subtext I want into each individual paragraph of a single chapter. Did my first 1000 words before work this morning, and I'll try to hit 5k by the end of my weekend on Monday night.
