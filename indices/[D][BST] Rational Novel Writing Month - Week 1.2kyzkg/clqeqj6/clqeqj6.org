  “We all know why we're here,” he said, looking across the group of ponies tightly gathered in the atrium. “Canterlot has fallen; both princesses are presumed dead, and what little radio chatter that's left has confirmed megaspell strikes on Cloudsdale, Phillydelphia, and just about every damn city with more than 12 residents.” His voice trembled as he spoke his next words, “Hell - most of us here saw Manehatten go up in flames ourselves.”

[[/cutealoo][]] Is the beginning attention grabby enough? /I/ think so.

[[/dealwithit][]] Also, I've gotten 2293 words! [[http://imgur.com/JhB1Ras][And a cover!]] /Fuck yeah!/ It feels great to be ahead of schedule (even by a bit), and I hope I don't lose too much steam as the month progresses.

Also, I'm unsure how much I plan to share a long the way, or even immediately after November. I definitely plan on significantly editing the whole thing when I'm through, but I love the encouraging words getting readership /now/ will bring. dilemmas!

Good luck to all, and I can't wait to read all the other stories getting created this month.
