Up to 1,860 as of a few hours ago, and finished for today. Because of Technical Difficulties (TM) I'm not going with what I was originally planning - what I spent /two and a half months/ planning - but I'm enjoying it so far, and am looking forward to making at least 50,000 words of progress on this.

It's tentatively titled /The Calm Before the Stars/ and is both Fantasy and Sci-fi. Not a blending of the two, just both existing simultaneously. Space-age fantasy, essentially.

The fantasy aspect is mostly present in the existence of Deities, singular manifestations of the collective conscience.

Earth is on the cusp of breaking free of its ties to the planet - our large population and potential for future exponential expansion through colonization has attracted the galactic Deities, those whose Followers span across galaxies. Some of Earth's Deities want to ingratiate themselves with these Galactigods, ready for the corporate takeover. Others are trying to scheme, trade, or simply steal in order to get their hands on the secret of FTL travel, in order to give Earth - and themselves - a fighting chance without being folded into a pre-existing Faith.

It's pretty preliminary, and my writing so far is just worldbuilding by writing to discover characters and settings I want to include.
