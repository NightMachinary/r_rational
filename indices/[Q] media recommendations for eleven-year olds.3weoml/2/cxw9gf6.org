Shockingly I appear to have beaten [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] to this but the So you want to be a Wizard series by Diane Duane is a pretty solid proto-rationalist YA series. Magic in the series is based on precise language and an understanding of the natural world and to be a wizard you have to take an oath to fight entropy. It also has a nice dusting of various mythologies.
