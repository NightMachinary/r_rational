I don't know if they count, but outdoorsy problem solving books like The Hatchet, Rascal, The Swiss Family Robinson, Jack London, seem somewhat rational to me. They're rather applied obviously, but there's a general element of take chargeism and creativity to be learned from these books that I think matches what rational books try to impart.
