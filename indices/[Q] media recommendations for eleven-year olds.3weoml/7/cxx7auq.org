Philip Puilman's /His Dark Materials/ trilogy is YA, but it's also got a /lot/ of stuff that only adults will pick up on, which innocent minds will not. It's actually kinda one of the themes of the story. Good choice, that.

Susan Cooper's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Is_Rising_Sequence][/Dark is Rising/ sequence]] sometimes has a female protagonist, and is interesting, but I'm not sure I'd term it rationalist.

Around that time, I was reading /Dune/, but it's ... well, strange.
