Don't know any rational movies.

For fiction that applies rationality to magic, I recommend the Incompleat Enchanter series by Pratt and de Camp, and the Lord Darcy series by Randall Garret. They're not explicitly "young adult" but they're definitely safe for kids. About the only reference to adult themes I can think of is when Lord Darcy pretends to be seduced by the Mata Hari expy in "The Ipswitch Phial" and that's all indirect.
