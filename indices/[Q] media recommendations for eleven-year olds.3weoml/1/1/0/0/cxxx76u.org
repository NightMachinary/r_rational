I'm not sure exactly how far we got but I read a heap before he wanted to read it himself and then we discovered [[/u/embrodski]]'s fabulous podcast and so we have been listening to that together instead. Final episode out very soon, I think!

As far as I can recall there wasn't anything else I wanted to skip. I'm pretty liberal really, I think introducing some adult concepts can lead to interesting questions and discussions. But I actually can't recall anything else in HPMOR that I would consider 'adult' but the depth of the content did lead to some interesting discussions about topics like 'how we know what we know' and the like.
