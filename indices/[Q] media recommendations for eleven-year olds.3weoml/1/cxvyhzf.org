The Deltora Quest series was pretty good. It wasn't explicitly rationalist, but contained some interesting puzzles in and of itself, and is appropriate for eleven year olds.

The Artemis Fowl books aren't rationalist either, but they do have an intelligent vibe about them, for certain, and is, again, appropriate for eleven year olds. They're very enjoyable.

It's been a while, but Detective Conan is a fairly intelligent anime. It's really just kind of Sherlock Holmes /pint sized edition/ but that doesn't make it bad, I enjoyed it a lot when I was younger. I can't say for certain it's all that age appropriate (the majority of the cases solved are about murders, after all) but it's not all that bad. Very little explicit violence, no sexuality that I can recall, easy to follow, episodic plots, etc.

While not rational, I'll throw in a recommendation for Code Lyoko. Well animated, action packed, while still being very good.

As far as rationality in fiction, I don't believe much of it in the current sphere is suited to eleven year olds. I would never let an eleven year old read HPMOR (Pretty early on, we're privy to Draco talking about raping a ten year old, with Harry providing justification for his viewpoint to the audience. His justification isn't incorrect, nor does it make it right, but it's the sort of complex issue I'd never want to introduce an eleven year old too. Particularly female ones) A lot of rational fiction is, in my opinion, too advanced and/or complex for a sixth grade child. Ironic, considering how Harry complains so much about people censoring things BECAUSE he's eleven, but it's true. A lot of the rational fiction we enjoy on this subreddit deals with themes that I find a little too mature for children. That's just a personal viewpoint I have, and I understand if people feel differently, but I can't see most eleven year olds marveling at Jake's orbital drop plan (other than going "Oh, cool! Explosions!") or at Aro's subtle manipulation of the Volturi (with a little detached vampire bling for flavor)
