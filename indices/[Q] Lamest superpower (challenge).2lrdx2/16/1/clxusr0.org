Let's assume it's an actual power where you do not need to consume more salt and stay hydrated. Otherwise it's a genetic condition like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis]]. As a result you have a near infinite resource of slightly salty water. We currently have a shortage of fresh water throughout the world and the problem with salt water is that the salt concentration is so high it's really hard to remove all of the salt from it. Sweat on the other hand is much easier to use for Osmosis to extract fresh water from.
