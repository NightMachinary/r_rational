Yessss. Plane-jacking via damaged circuitry and small globs of water in people's vital organs was one of my first weaponized thoughts as well - might be something a villain would do, maybe someone pissed off at what the technologically advanced society was doing to his poor water-starved village, in which he is a failure of a rain dancer :P.

Using it for communication is also brilliant and I hadn't thought of that - you can even do that on the ground actually, since the drops will fall down to the intended recipient and you can use the mega-drop trick to make it noticeable. Drop size and distance could be used for increasing information density, and although each drop takes you one second to create the recipient can get the drops slower or faster depending on your spacing - you could essentially do morse code, or some other alphabet.

I think creating droplets inside of objects is definitely where all the more advanced applications come in - just the ability to create a bunch of matter /anywhere you wanted/ within a subset of space should be a boon to engineering. My version of the thought was to put multiple droplets in a very enclosed space and then using the extremely high-pressure situation that would arise to some advantage - weapons, or energy. (The amount of energy you can get out of this is limited by the practical constraints of devices you can create, so it's hard to estimate how practical this is as an energy source.)
