I don't know! I think it depends a lot on the particular object. A rock will probably just get little cracks in it. A diamond? Who knows?

The way I see it, if it's extremely energetically unfavorable to inject water into an object, and then you just... /do it anyway/, you should end up with a lot of potential energy locked into one place. Theoretically you should be able to harvest the same amount of energy that it would normally take to accomplish the act.

There's practical limits of course - if the diamond just shatters, for example.
