Guys, these are a bit /too/ lame and many aren't even supernatural. They should at least be /room/ for creatively hacking them.

Here is my offering:

The Ineffective Rain-Dancer: You can spawn a single raindrop per second. Your range spans roughly any visible part of the sky (raindrop can be defined as a sphere of water of a certain small size, sky can be defined as a specific range of distances from the ground - not too close, but not out in space either, and your range is a function of distance from your body - the "visible part of the sky" bit is just a rough heuristic for how far the power goes).

If too easy, decrease accuracy over where the drop spawns.
