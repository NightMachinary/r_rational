    The ability to get lost.

  Being lost generally requires not knowing where you are. You can now escape from most places (like jail).

Earlier today I was reading (in one of the threads that was linked from here? on TVTropes? not sure) about a book in which someone had the power to get lost...and he used it while falling from an airplane. Someone else had "arrive late to anything", and used it to arrive late to the pain of being tortured.
