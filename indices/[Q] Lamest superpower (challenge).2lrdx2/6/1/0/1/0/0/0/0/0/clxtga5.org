You can.

It will be much more effective if you can specify a particular group to test against.

E.g. say you want to ace this challenge against these people. It could provide you with aid to try and ace the test, like hardware and software improvements people have done, ways to get access to super computers, skill to program programs. It won't necessarily be better than the best of them but it can synthesize the best of their different approaches and find shortcuts and tricks to beat them.

This would, of course, be seen as lame by many people, you using your superpower to try to beat a bunch of nerds in doing maths, and so be very in fitting with the challenge.
