The definition of test is "a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, especially before it is taken into widespread use."

"c : something (as a series of questions or exercises) for measuring the skill, knowledge, intelligence, capacities, or aptitudes of an individual or group "

So regardless of the exact details of the power 90% on the mark scheme isn't enough. It needs to have measurable standards for performance on a reasonably official scale, and is generally applied to a group.
