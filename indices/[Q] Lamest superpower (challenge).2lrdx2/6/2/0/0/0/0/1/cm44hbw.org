Plus there's the issue, the power doesn't say it tells you who to say the words to, or what body language or such to use. To end this political party you have to say "She never loved him, if you go to him now you can still have her back. She always wanted her Victoria dreams." Go.

Hence why it's a lot easier in a localized party.
