Wow.

Ok, I was pretty sure that I could weaponize pretty much anything but...yeah. Mostly, I got nothing.

Although, there's some really cool one, like these:

#+begin_quote
  The ability to hear the soundtrack of my life.

  Always have the correct amount of change in pocket

  I can close any door at will.

  The ability to unwrinkle or straighten anything.

  Knowing exactly how someone's sentence will finish, but never how the next one starts.

  Being able to pull $10 out of my pocket
#+end_quote

There's a few that are too obviously powerful, though:

#+begin_quote
  The power to make someone feel another person's emotions.

  Turning any liquid into alcohol
#+end_quote

Thanks for the pointers, and sorry for the repost.
