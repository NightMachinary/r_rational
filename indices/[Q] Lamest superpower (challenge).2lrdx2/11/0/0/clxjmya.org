Seems pretty breakable on a small scale. Proteins, for example, do not appreciate being straightened, so you've got a pretty horrific Touch attack at the very least. There's probably also some way to cheese gigantic buckytubes out of the deal, too.

And hey, it's not a repost. A crosspost at worst.
