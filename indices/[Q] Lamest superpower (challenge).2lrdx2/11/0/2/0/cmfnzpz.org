Yep. These are the ones that I actually /could/ figure out how to weaponize. Other ways to abuse the "correct amount of change":

- A friend says "hey, can you give me change for this hundred-dollar bill?" Repeat.
- Always have small objects to throw
- Always have a dime to use as a screwdriver, or a penny to use as a conductor

The soundtrack, of course, is great for information gathering and hypothesis testing -- when you start to hear creepy music then yes, the murderer is behind that door. When you hear Thus Sprach Zarathustra, then you know you've correctly solved your problem, etc.

The ability to straighten things is just horrifically lethal, as discussed above.
