Each nanosecond you get different, randomly selected superpower, but you never know which one you have at any time.

BTW when I was 5 I believed sth similar - I thought people must pray for a reason, so when they want sth hard enough it happens, but for me it didn't worked, so I thought maybe for me it works one way half the time (I want sth - it happens), and another way the rest of the time (I want sth - it doesn't happen). I even tried to test if it changes every hour or every day, or if there's timeout.
