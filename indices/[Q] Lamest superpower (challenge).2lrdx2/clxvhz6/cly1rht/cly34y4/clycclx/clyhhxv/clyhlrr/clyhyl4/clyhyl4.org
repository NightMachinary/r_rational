It's just your density, your shape doesn't change at all. For example, if someone was normally 50kg, and they started storing half of their mass, the only differences would be that they are attracted by gravity half as much it's twice as easy to change their speed.

In this case, if you were to gain 1000kg you would still look (and be) severely obese, even if you weighed the same.
