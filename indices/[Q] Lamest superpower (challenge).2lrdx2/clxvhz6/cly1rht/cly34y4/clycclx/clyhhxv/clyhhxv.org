  Ah! So, I can reduce my mass to basically zero, run at someone full tilt to get lots of v^{2} and then bring all my m back to produce a lot of KE?

Yes, but it wouldn't work quite as well as you might think. You still need to deal with wind resistance and losing grip (from having low weight) and the max speed your muscles can move. Also, your clothes and other stuff is unaffected.

  Can I store anyone ELSE's attributes, or only my own?

Only your own.
