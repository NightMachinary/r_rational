Yup. It can be used as a very effective disguise, but also carries all of the downsides of old age, like being weaker and such. Some of them aren't quite as useless as the others. Specifically: Mass (breaks conservation of momentum), losing calories (instant diet pill), dulling senses (painkiller), removing memories (eyebleach, operational security), reduced muscle mass/old age (disguises and deception. Also breaks conservation of momentum and mass).

They're more like super-strength-without-super-ligaments or super-speed-without-super-reflexes tier powers than truly useless ones.

As for wearing off, that isn't quite it. You need to actively store the attribute in order to lose it, and you go back to normal the second that you want to. Storing memories is the exception to this rule, as it is permanent once you decide which memories to store.
