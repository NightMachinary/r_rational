The Munchkin is the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG][Tabletop RPG]] player who plays the game to win at any cost, even if that isn't the point of the game. Perhaps the most ridiculed [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes][Player Archetype]] of all time, this player is rarely interested in the _ story _ behind the game. Indeed, his characters are little more than extensions of his [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar][own personality]] or whatever personality would give him the most bonuses.
