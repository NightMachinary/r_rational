I'm going to assume the dove fully fits into the space that you sweep through with your hands, so you can only force matter into existence where you can already push your hands through.

Actually, mechanically, let's make it be that the inside surfaces of your hands become an air-tight, dove-cross-section-shaped portal, wrapped around a dove, somewhere. As you pull your hands apart, you move the portal so two ends of the dove are somewhere, and the middle is between your hands. If you try to move your hands in a way that does not fit a dove, you encounter as much resistance as it would normally take to bend the dove that way (if you're strong you can use this to summon a dead dove).

This does mean that if you're in a closed room, each dove summoned will slightly increase the air pressure. I'm pretty sure the equivalent underwater does not actually cause a shockwave any more than it does for someone without this super power, but I could be wrong.
