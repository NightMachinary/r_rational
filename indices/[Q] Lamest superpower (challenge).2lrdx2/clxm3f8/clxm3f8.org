Controlling bugs. Duh. That's just so useless and unworkable.

More seriously, any "open ended" superpower is probably munchkinable in some way or another. What you really need is something that seems cool, but is restricted. Say you could only control bugs, but they had to be within 5 feet of you? You're limited to only the bugs that are already near you; if you try to run around too quickly you'll leave some behind, but otherwise you'll never come across a really significant amount. (Of course I expect someone to be able to munchkin this. The point being that while it's still usable, it's less usable than the open-ended version)
