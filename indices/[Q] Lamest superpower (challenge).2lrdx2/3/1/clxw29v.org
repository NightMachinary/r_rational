With a powerful enough particle accelerator on your side and a broad enough interpretation of the power, you could have pretty good prescience over a wide area.

Get a 2 mile wide beam of neutrinos shot at you at ~100 million times the intensity of the sun. The number of neutrino collisions in a person will go from ~1/year to 30/second. You can then detect all matter (by density) in your range by seeing where the neutrinos suddenly stop existing.
