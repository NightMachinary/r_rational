Ooh. Haaaahahaa. Well, that cannot be disproved, it's an axiom. Meaning that the net result of somebody with this power believing that, is exactly and precisely nothing.

I may have not been clear enough about what the power is supposed to do; It's an anti-falsification power; you cannot witness things that definitively contradict your sense of normality.

I've made some edits to the original post, with some examples (the most destructive of which is timestopping everything in your AoE forever).
