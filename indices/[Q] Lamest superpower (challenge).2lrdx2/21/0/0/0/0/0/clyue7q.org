The "understanding" that nothing could exist without god.

In a universe where god isn't possible.

The power can't even leave a nothing behind, because nothings aren't possible.

You have a horribly destructive sphere of annihilation out to the limit of the power's range, and I don't know what happens in the region surrounding it. Do they fold shut immediately against the user only to immediately be consumed in the next tick of the power's action? Does all of reality collapse at lightspeed in on the power user as spacetime are unwritten in light of the reality of the absence of a being without whom the power's user believes nothing is possible?
