"Fuzz Boy" can only grow hair on things he directly touches, and the hair only lasts a few hours. I think he can only grow human hair, evidenced by a prank he pulled on his little brother (the protagonist's best friend) involving water balloons with hair grown on them. He makes money by growing mustaches and beards on his peers, allowing them to sneak into adult movies.
