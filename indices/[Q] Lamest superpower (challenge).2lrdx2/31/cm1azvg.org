Giving the power to be calm and rational when in combat to the Hulk.

The ability to summon a random useless object, whenever you figure out a use for the object it changes what it summons.

To have all of Superman's powers but they either stop working or refills in power when it would increase dramatic tension. They always reset to normal if it would decrease future potential for drama though.

Power proportional to unused intellect, so stuff like munchkinning decrease your power.

Or for something that can actually be exploited a bit the inability to get bored.

Of course a better contendor for most useless possible power is to passively boost or weaken people near you based off how much they want to harm you. Obviously desire to harm = boost and conversely desire to help = weaken. You have no control over it and it affects everyone.
