- The ability to cause any one effect that is physically possible and expends no more than 1 millijoule of energy per second.

(that is, you can switch effects -- and any knock-on effects that have been caused wont be wiped out -- but only one effect may be active at once. 1 Millijoule/sec was a rough estimate -- it should be possible to tweak the threshold to make the power both sufficiently difficult to effectively use and sufficiently munchkinable) )

Also,

- The ability to forget anything that you don't want to forget.

Sakaki (Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya)'s power, as interpreted by Kyon: Big Damn Hero, is also a candidate -- possibly TOO lame:

- The ability to witness only things which you can explain with your current understanding of the universe. If that sounds confusing, you can imagine an 'absolute normality field' projected around you, where 'normality' is defined by your current understanding of what is possible in the universe. Inside that field, your sense of normality is never contradicted; events which are possible under actual physics but not under your understanding of it simply cannot occur.

(It's about the only power I can think of that is useless in a horrifying way. Any munchkining would, AFAICS, have to be done via someone else. And is likely to involve brainwashing.)

EDIT: /This third item may require more explanation/. It's essentially /absolute anti-falsification/. Here's an example. Supposing you are a bigot who genuinely believes that gay and bi people don't really exist, and someone bi enters your sphere of influence... then they will be unable to perform any act which would classify them as genuinely gay or bi to you. Which could be as little as a mannerism, or as much as having sex, according to your particular interpretation. Your AoE is 'anywhere you are currently perceiving', so if they are in another room then your power would probably have no effect on them.

Or here's another example: You believe that quantum mechanics doesn't work. Most likely, this has no effect, because if you believe quantum mechanics doesn't work, you probably don't have any idea of what it working would be like. (AFAICS, if you both understand quantum mechanics and believe it doesn't work, I think this would prevent anything at all from happening in your AoE ever.)

Now, if you believed something smaller -- like 'USB keys don't work', then they indeed would not be able to work in your vicinity. Not through any modification of their functionality, but physical prevention of any event that would prove that they did work. Again, your AoE covers only what you are currently perceiving, so people could use USB keys in your vicinity as long as it wouldn't lead to you discovering that USB keys do in fact work.

In other words, the effect does not alter the rules of physics to suit your preconceptions; rather, it prevents you from witnessing anything that is contrary to those preconceptions; it suppresses possible evidence.

So, a final example: 'No-one is strong enough to pull a train'. This wouldn't prevent anyone from actually being strong enough to pull a train. It would prevent them from using enough of that strength in your AoE to actually pull a train. If you thought that one type of train, a heavier type, was pullable and another, lighter, was not, and they in fact had the strength to pull either, then they could only pull the heavier type in your AoE.
