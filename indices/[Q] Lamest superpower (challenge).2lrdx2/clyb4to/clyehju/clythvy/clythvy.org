That's rather open to interpretation, actually; Because people generally don't act as if God actually exists or that their particular sect's way of seeing things is actually true, no matter how fervently they claim that he does and it is, it's questionable whether the average religious person's sense of normality is really that different. We need to look at what they actually do to see what they believe will really happen.

There's probably a way to abuse it, all right, but since the power denies the non-'normal' rather than creating the 'normal', it seems surprisingly difficult to achieve any great effect with it. The most interesting effect I've thought of so far that could be done with it, is a field of truthfulness (via brainwashing that 'people claims always match what they believe to be most true').
