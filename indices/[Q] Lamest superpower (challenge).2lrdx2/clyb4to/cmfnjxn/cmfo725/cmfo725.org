  Superpowers are generally defined by how they disobey physics. If you have to attach a battery and resistor to a wire to make sure that it's physically possible for a milliwatt of electricity to move through it, then the power didn't do anything at all. On the other hand, if we go into quantum physics, everything possible happens, and everything impossible happens for a short amount of time. You didn't narrow it down at all by saying "physically possible".

Well, given the electricity example, the kind of thing I was talking about would be just /making/ that 1mw of electricity flow through the wire. That violates physics because you have conjured free energy, but once that energy is in the world it must behave in accordance with the rules of physics. Another example usage might be for starting fires. Or of course, you might be able to charge a battery.. very slowly.

Yeah, Sakaki's power is pretty broken, just awkward and anti-scientific enough that it's a bit difficult to work out how to usefully exploit.
