  The ability to cause any one effect that is physically possible and expends no more than 1 millijoule of energy per second.

Just say milliwatt. What do you mean by "physically possible"? Superpowers are generally defined by how they disobey physics. If you have to attach a battery and resistor to a wire to make sure that it's physically possible for a milliwatt of electricity to move through it, then the power didn't do anything at all. On the other hand, if we go into quantum physics, everything possible happens, and everything impossible happens for a short amount of time. You didn't narrow it down at all by saying "physically possible".

I was thinking reactionless drive, where from your point of reference a milliwatt does a lot more than from the point of reference of the Sun, but then I realized that from you point of reference it actually takes no power.

  Sakaki (Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya)'s power

Her normality field extends to things she's witnessing through a camera. They are taking a series of pictures and showing them to her after the fact. Granted, it's only a fraction of a second, but there's always ways of taking advantage of that sort of thing. She can send messages back in time. I like how her power is actually more physically impossible than most of the stuff it prevents.
