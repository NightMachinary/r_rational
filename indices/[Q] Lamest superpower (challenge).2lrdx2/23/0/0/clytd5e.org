Haha I didn't even think of that! That's actually a fairly dramatic thing you can do straight out of the box!

I'm sure you can think of more though...as a rule unless the world-builder has taken steps to prevent it nearly /all/ supernatural powers involving matter manipulation can be used to /at the very least/ generate large amounts of energy if you're creative enough.

Hint: I'd probably start the hacking thought process by thinking of cool stuff I could do if I could summon water drops /in general/ without the sky constraint, and then go ahead and do those things while in an airplane or mountaintop.

You definitely need to integrate technology to do any truly powerful stuff, and how much you can munchkin this is definitely in proportion to your knowledge of the natural world and your engineering-style creativity.

This is also a good time to start fleshing out edge cases, such as what happens to the material which previously occupied the location ofthe summoned water droplet. Via your water droplet example, you've implicitly chosen "things get displaced (pushed out of the way)" - as opposed to say, things disappear. That itself is an extremely promising avenue for hacking - you can force stuff into some very high-energy, unstable situations.
