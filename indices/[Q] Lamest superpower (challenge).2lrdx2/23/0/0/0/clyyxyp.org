Just because I couldny think of anything before doesn't mean I can't think of anything else. It just means I had to go get on an airplane. ;>

Hm. Ok, how about this: create two drops so close to one another that you can extract vacuum energy from them.

Are the drops pure water? If not, can I control what impurities they contain?

How about creating the drops such that they turn a waterwheel? Not much power, but some.

Can the drops be created inside another object? Creating the drops inside a computer could short it out. Creating them inside a person's eyeball would make them highly unhappy. They'd need to be far enough up to do that, though.

How long does it take from the moment I use the power to when the drop appears? Can I do FTL signaling? If not, I can still use it for remote communication -- when my team sees the drop appear, that's the signal to go. Or have them set up a keyboard and I create drops over the relevant keys to spell words. Slow but workable.

It's a sphere of water, but you didn't specify liquid. Can I choose to have it be ice? Or steam? Or plasma? Or one of the weird variants of ice, like ice IX?
