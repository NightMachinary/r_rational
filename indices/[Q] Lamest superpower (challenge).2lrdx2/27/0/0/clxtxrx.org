i didn't say it wasn't good, just that as "superpower" is usually defined it is pretty much the worst. It doesn't make me any better at fighting it just lets me use crap laying around as a weapon so that means that i need to use my normal human muscles to hurt people (maybe with a little boost) and my normal human skin, bones and organs to resist damage and all I have the power to do is cause damage slightly more conveniently.
