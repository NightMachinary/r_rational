You can conjure a live animal, uniformly randomly chosen from a currently living specimen of the family [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muridae][/Muridae/]], at the approximate range, relative momentum, and precision of anywhere you can throw an object of the same mass and shape within your line of sight.

- You can do this about every three or four minutes, but it gets gradually harder and more exhausting without rest.
- The mice/rats/whatever are not under your control or direction any more than you can mundanely accomplish.
- The conjured animal does not 'dismiss' itself after a period of time.
- The specimen is selected from the world's current population of murids, and teleported to location you conjure it. You cannot choose a specific organism. It carries its natural flora, gases, pathogens, dirt, digested food, etc. with it, but does not transport any non-food items intentionally attached or fed to it. It arrives in the same condition it was, though momentum from the conjuration or pressure differentials could kill it.
- You will get something reasonably mouse-shaped; immortal cell lines, individual cells, cancers, teratomas, etc. don't count. You will not get unborn embryos on their own. Pregnant creatures take their babies with them.
- You can only conjure specimens on Earth, and if then, only while you are on Earth (assume a 100 km altitude edge of space, no "different Hubble volume" nonsense). You can't use conjuring to transfer information faster-than-light any more than you normally can.
- The critter disappears and reappears more-or-less instantaneously, with minimal sonic effect; it's not quite clear if the volume of air that formerly occupied the space where you conjured goes to where you displaced the conjuration from. In any case, you can't use the process to displace something out of your way.
- There's no obvious indication that you are using your power other than its result and the physical effects of your conscious intent (mind-reading works to detect it, mind-control works to use it). You can use your power with the approximate mental effort and intentionality it takes to pick up an object and throw it; random gerbils flying out of nowhere from a seizure are extremely unlikely, but in principle possible. Physical restraint has no effect on your ability to conjure. Inability to visualize the situation could effect your success, but you could still conjure something at an abstract vector from yourself.
