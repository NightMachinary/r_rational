This will be buried, but:

- Your muscles exert twice as much force as they "should", physically.

- You can predict the future; but when you do, it's always the worst outcome (for you) that could plausibly happen. The future may or may not be immutable

- You can control people's brains within a 1-foot radius. Not their minds, just their brains, up to the limit of modern brain-surgery. (I assume this is going to a hero?)

- You can kill plants with a thought.

- You can teleport yourself to a random point in space and back. No bringing your enemies with you.

- You can phase through a specific material, and only that material. (Varies in it's lameness a bit depending on the material.)
