  You can control people's brains within a 1-foot radius. Not their minds, just their brains, up to the limit of modern brain-surgery. (I assume this is going to a hero?)

Hm. I'm not sure what the limits of modern brain surgery are. It would be easily weaponized though -- lobotomies are pretty straightforward, and you could repair the damage once the person was in cuffs. Pain induction would also be an option. I'm not sure about pleasure induction -- is there a "pleasure center" in a human brain that can be poked? I know they can do it to rats.

  You can teleport yourself to a random point in space and back. No bringing your enemies with you.
#+end_quote

This would be an easy way to launch space probes. Although it would be most likely to land you outside our galaxy, so maybe that wouldn't be so useful.

Let's make some simple assumptions though: we're not writing a snuff comic or a NSFW comic, so the teleport will put you somewhere on Earth, only in a safe location (not into the core, not 100 miles in the air), and you can bring with you whatever you are wearing / carrying up to a small load limit (say, ~10 pounds). That means your clothes and your (e.g.) messenger bag go with you. You didn't say that there was a cooldown on the power so, if you teleport enough times in sequence, you'll eventually land somewhere near whatever destination you want and can proceed the rest of the way via normal transit. Not useful for traveling across the city, but useful if you just need to get to France from the US.

  phase through a specific material

If the material is air, then you would be immune to wind-based powers and I think to certain kinds of motion sensors that work off air movement. You might be able to get work doing things inside a wind tunnel, maybe adjusting sensors in real time.
