  I'm not sure what the limits of modern brain surgery are. It would be easily weaponized though -- lobotomies are pretty straightforward, and you could repair the damage once the person was in cuffs.

Lobotomy, yes. Un-lobotomy, I don't think so; that's why I specified that you had no more precision than modern instruments.

  Let's make some simple assumptions though: we're not writing a snuff comic or a NSFW comic, so the teleport will put you somewhere on Earth, only in a safe location (not into the core, not 100 miles in the air)

That's the advantage of being able to teleport back again :)

Space is big enough that you probably wouldn't end up in a planet or star, anyway. And yeah, no cooldown, that would just be unfair.

(I wonder how far you'd fall before you had time to react, though? That /is/ a pretty interesting idea for a power.)
