  You can predict the future; but when you do, it's always the worst outcome (for you) that could plausibly happen. The future may or may not be immutable

How much control do you have over what you're predicting? If you ask yourself "will I die today" every day, you can only get "yes" and "no", and generally "yes" is implausible. If not, shorten the time until it is. You are now immortal. At least until you get old enough that dying in your sleep on a given night becomes plausible.

You allow someone to do brain surgery, at the same quality as a team of the best surgeons in the world, without cutting open the persons brain? That is an awesome power.

  You can kill plants with a thought.

There are a lot of harmful plants that people would love for you to kill.

  You can phase through a specific material, and only that material. (Varies in it's lameness a bit depending on the material.)
