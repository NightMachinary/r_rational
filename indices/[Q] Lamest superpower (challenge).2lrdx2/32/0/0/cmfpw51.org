  How much control do you have over what you're predicting? If you ask yourself "will I die today" every day, you can only get "yes" and "no", and generally "yes" is implausible. If not, shorten the time until it is. You are now immortal.

Dying isn't very unlikely in dangerous situations, though - that's why they're dangerous in the first place. I think this would just make you die sooner.
