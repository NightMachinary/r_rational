#+begin_quote
  The ability to grow your hair at a slightly faster rate than normal humans.
#+end_quote

Human hair is used to mop up oil spills because of how absorbent it is and there are organizations who collect them from barber shops. Or sell your hair to be used as wigs.

#+begin_quote
  The ability to correctly guess how works of fiction will end after experiencing only a fraction of their content.
#+end_quote

You can fool others into thinking you are an oracle, ghost-write the ending to famous incomplete works, or predict the future by writing about events but with minor details changed to make it 'fiction based on a true story'.

#+begin_quote
  The ability to synthesize random numbers.
#+end_quote

You can encode messages without a computer.

#+begin_quote
  The ability to look fashionable in any clothing.
#+end_quote

You can disguise yourself among the rich and wealthy. You will appear wealthier than you really are and will gain respect in formal or business settings.

#+begin_quote
  The ability to know the local time.
#+end_quote

Can you know the local time of the Sun, the Galaxy, or the Universe to deduce the age of the Universe to a more precise figure than 14 billion years (repeat for nearby astrological objects)? You will never need watch and you can time anything down to the millisecond.

#+begin_quote
  The ability to instantly vaporize yourself (works exactly once, or obvious reasons).
#+end_quote

Any terrorist would love your ability to defeat bomb detectors and can you vaporize cut off body parts as well?

#+begin_quote
  The ability to know whether or not (a binary value) if the injuries you currently possess will be fatal in the 24 hours.
#+end_quote

I'm assuming that the power is just the ability to know if your body won't be able to heal in 24 hours without medical services instead of true precognition. You can test poisons with an antidote in increasing dosages until you have the smallest amount that can kill in 24 hours and just take the antidote. Test effectiveness of safety gear where you can get hurt, but won't die instantaneously and have trained doctors ready to help. There's a lot of ways to use this power in situations where slow-acting deaths which can be treated can tell you something.

#+begin_quote
  The ability to correctly guess the outcome of a situation, but only so long as you believe that outcome to be inconsequential (ie you don't believe you nor anyone else has any stake in it).
#+end_quote

Have people ask you random hypothetical situations where the majority are meaningless and you become able to predict the important ones, but you can't know which ones are important until after the prediction.

#+begin_quote
  Constant, can't be turned off, X-ray vision.
#+end_quote

MRI scans are ridiculously expensive. You just saved the hospital you work at a lot of money.

#+begin_quote
  The ability to always insert a USB drive correctly on the first try.
#+end_quote

You can now magically fixed smashed USBs into its normal shape.
