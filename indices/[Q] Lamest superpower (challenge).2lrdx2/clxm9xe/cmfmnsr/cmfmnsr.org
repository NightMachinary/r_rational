"The ability to correctly guess how works of fiction will end after experiencing only a fraction of their content"

Write the ending of the story based on some future event. Now you can predict the future by predicting the course of your own story.

"The ability to correctly guess the outcome of a situation, but only so long as you believe that outcome to be inconsequential (ie you don't believe you nor anyone else has any stake in it)"

Suppose you have to be 99% certain it's inconsequential. Someone asks you what the answer to the question they wrote down in this envelope is. 99% of the time it's inconsequential. The other 1% of the time it's not.

Can you just see X-Rays, or is this something where you're projecting so many of them that you can make out objects from the backscatter? If it's the second one, you could tune solar panels to that frequency and get electricity from it.

"The ability to always insert a USB drive correctly on the first try"

Fix the computer in place. Attach the USB upside-down to a turbine. In order to insert the USB drive correctly, you have to spin the turbine, generating large amounts of power. You're superpower must allow you to do this.
