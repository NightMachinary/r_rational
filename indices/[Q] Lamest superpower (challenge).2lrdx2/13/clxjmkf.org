The ability to determine the outcome of any coin toss I'm aware of before or during the fact. The ability to change any bottled drink to any liquid ever drunk only before opening the bottle. to be able to determine exactly the aroma everyone else perceives of me independently of my current hygiene. The ability to see a halo or horns on people if their last conscious decision was aligned with my morals (like horns on people who don't wash their hands coming out of the bathroom etc..) The ability to instantly calculate the amount of time something will continue to be edible.
