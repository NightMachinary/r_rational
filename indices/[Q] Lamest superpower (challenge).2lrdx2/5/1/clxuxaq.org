  The ability to correctly guess how works of fiction will end after experiencing only a fraction of their content

First use: Perfect lie detector. When someone tells you what happened in a situation, you can instantly tell that they are making up the story if your power triggers off of it.

Second use: unbreakable cryptographic communication, although the bandwidth varies with the specifics of the power. Get someone to send the necessary fraction of a purpose-made story to you, along with a key to interpret the results. For example: "the butler did it" means attack now, "the maid did it" means wait until morning, "the wife did it" means that reinforcements are incoming and so on. Alternatively, "your orders are what the last page of this story says."

#+begin_quote
  The ability to correctly guess the outcome of a situation, but only so long as you believe that outcome to be inconsequential (ie you don't believe you nor anyone else has any stake in it)
#+end_quote

How transitive is this, and what is the threshold? Assuming very permissive limits, you could pull stunts like "I have no money bet right now. That roulette wheel will turn up a 12. I guess I should bet now." or compound many small things together. "The home team will not score between 0:00 and 0:05 of the first quarter of the basketball game. The home team will not score between 0:05 and 0:10 of the first quarter of the basketball game..." and so on for every 5 seconds of the game. No one interval that size matters, so no one prediction fails.

  The ability to look fashionable in any clothing
#+end_quote

This seems like it would need to act as the opposite effect in order to make sense: You have the ability to look appropriate for any /situation/, as fashion is defined by where you currently are and what you are currently doing. It would be a great power for a spy, as they could go from a posh party to hiding as a homeless man in seconds.

  The ability to instantly vaporize yourself (works exactly once, for obvious reasons)

That looks like a pretty decent suicide bomb, and it's obviously undetectable. My numbers may be off, but I got 100 kg of TNT equivalent energy.
