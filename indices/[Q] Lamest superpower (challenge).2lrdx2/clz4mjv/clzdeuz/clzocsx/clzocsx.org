I think the unpredictability of it is kind of the fun of it, really. It makes every use of it a balance of risk to reward.

How it works would ultimately be up to you, but I think the way I would write it would be to make the negative consequences always roughly match the positive ones. If you try and use your power to make a really nice bird house, then the worst that will happen is you'll end up making a really bad birdhouse that breaks under the slightest breeze. If you try and use your power to stop an out of control train... well.

I don't think the person with the power should be able to /directly/ predict the negative outcome, but they should have a rough idea of what will happen, based on the action they're trying to commit.

That way, you can always 'cheat' by picking a negative outcome that's disastrous and drama-enducing, but not story-ending :P
