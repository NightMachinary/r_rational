Rather than completely useless powers, I'll try and figure out double-edged ones that are very unconventional or at least fun to play with in some unique way.

Coin Flip: The power to make any action either succeed or fail spectacularly... but you have no way to predict which way things will go. If you punch someone and use your power, you might send your foe flying, or break your own wrist. For extra fun, /YOU/ actually go and flip a coin each time the power is used in the story, so that the results aren't even predictable to you.

Killer Shadow: Your shadow is animate and capable of applying surprising amounts of force. But it doesn't always follow your actions, especially when you can't see it. Sometimes, it even seems almost /traitorous./

Super Solipsism: If you don't know something is there, it can't effect you. You can walk down the street with your eyes closed and ears plugged and the cars will just harmlessly pass through you. But if one of them honks loud enough for you to hear...

Respawn: Any time you're killed, your body disappears and then reappears in perfect health somewhere within a 100 meter radius. Any blood/biomass you lost also disappears, and any foreign bodies within you are left behind where you despawn. Your clothes and possessions may or may not move with you, depending on which way you think would be better for the story. Other than that, assume baseline human, and dying usually /hurts like hell./
