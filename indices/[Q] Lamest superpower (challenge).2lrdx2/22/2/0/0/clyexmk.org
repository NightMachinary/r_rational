Excellent. I can break thermodynamics, entropy, and all sorts of related shenanigans. Get above the altitude where rodents live naturally so that each will be coming up to me. They don't get colder, so I've conjured potential energy from nothing. Dropping them to their original height produces energy, violating numerous symmetry equations, -- and once one law of physics goes out the window, the rest follow.
