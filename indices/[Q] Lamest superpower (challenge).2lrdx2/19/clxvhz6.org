If you get half of a [[http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Feruchemy][Feruchemist]]'s power (from Mistborn), it would be pretty useless. You would get the ability to put some of your attributes in metal "batteries" of different types, but not the ability to draw them back out of the batteries to boost yourself like a normal Feruchemist can.

You would get 17 abilities: (they are temporary and can scale to any amount you can survive, unless otherwise noted)

- Reduce your mass (useful!)
- Reduce your physical speed
- Dull any of your five senses
- Reduce your muscle mass\\
- Reduce how fast you think
- Reduce your body's core temperature (useful!)
- Permanently remove memories
- Fall asleep without getting rest out of it
- Lose oxygen from your bloodstream
- Lose calories from your stomach (useful!)
- Become sickly
- Become apathetic
- Become unlucky
- Become less magical (maybe? it's unknown)
- Lose your connection to yourself, spiritually (unknown)
- Lose spiritual attachments to other people, so you don't connect to them (less empathy both ways, if I'm right, useful!)
- Become older.
