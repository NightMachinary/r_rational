The best this half-feruchemist can do equals what they could do without any powers. Being able to store /and then retrieve/ these attributes is what a normal feruchemist does, and isn't even close to the lamest superpower. Edited my post for clarity.

  If we're going with literal velocity then we have a wealth of powers such of surviving falls and saving up some speed from some launching mechanism for later.

Nah, it's canonically just muscle speed and reaction time, basically anything a normal person would consider "physical" as part of a person. It doesn't interfere with outside physics.
