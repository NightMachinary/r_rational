Hm. Suppose I store, say, 2kg of mass, then eat enough to regain the weight, repeat until I have 1,0000kg or so stored away? This would take a long time, of course, but maybe if I had a teammate whose power allowed me to gain weight / gain mass.

Does my shape change when I store / recall the mass (i.e., do I get thin / fat), or just my density?
