  Rob a bank. When the police chase you, get lost.
#+end_quote

Completely doable.

#+begin_quote
  Start a boyband. Make your target an honorary member. Also, you could make a lot of money as a prostitute. And you could sub for any member of any boyband that gets sick or something.
#+end_quote

The first one is skirting the definition of boyband- I'd say it wouldn't work unless they were part of the vocal group. It's magically fueled by the love of girls for boybands, they need to be up on stage singing for it to work. The other two are fine.

#+begin_quote
  Make them bored of fighting you. Make supervillains bored of crime.
#+end_quote

You can do the first, though for the second you don't have any ability to make people bored of stuff outside of your presence. It might not stick.

#+begin_quote
  Infinite source of food. Also can be used as fuel and reaction mass on a spaceship.
#+end_quote

Doable.

#+begin_quote
  Your test it to rescue the Crystal Empire from King Sombra.
#+end_quote

Probably not a test, so no. It needs to be a set of problems used to evaluate a group, with you getting a highish but not top tier mark, per the normal definition.

#+begin_quote
  Anyone can do that. The question is if you can make them talk back.
#+end_quote

Talk often carries a connotation of a back and forth conversation, so yes.

#+begin_quote
  If there's any supervillains that use chemical weapons, you are now immune.
#+end_quote

You're immune to things that cause substantive effects via metabolism, things that attack say skin are not included- sulphuric acid would still burn you say.

#+begin_quote
  Curse yourself with awesome.
#+end_quote

You could, but that's not a disability.
