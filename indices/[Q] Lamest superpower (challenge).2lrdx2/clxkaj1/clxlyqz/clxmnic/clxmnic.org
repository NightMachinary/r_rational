You can ace this test.

So you can perform better than 80% or so of programmers in designing a friendly AI.

Testing implies a tester who can verify the success of your abilities and acing a test implies doing better than the average.

Tests are often also applies en masse- if you're the only person your power may be less compliant. You can't really ace a test only you do.

With these powers if you attempted to apply them to situations they didn't fit they might just nope you. This doesn't fit my test criteria, you're on your own.
