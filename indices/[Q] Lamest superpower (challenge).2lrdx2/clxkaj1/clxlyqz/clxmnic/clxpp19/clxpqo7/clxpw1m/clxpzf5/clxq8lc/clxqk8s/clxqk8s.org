You could fail slightly less poorly than them.

I'd use a definition like this.

#+begin_quote
  something (as a series of questions or exercises) for measuring the skill, knowledge, intelligence, capacities, or aptitudes of an individual or group
#+end_quote

So it needs some comparative measurement criteria. If no one can succeed you can't measure it. It's off the scale.

Suppose the test was 'lift the planet'.

You're not really measuring strength in most people since they can't really do much to lift it. It's not a measurable power. You can't do better than anyone else. You'll always fail.

So the power would go 'fake test, not helping you, kthxbye'.

Or 'construct a friendly AI'

Ok, what are you measuring. Friendly AI construction abilities? How do you confirm that this is a real friendly AI? What are other candidates evaluated on? What would be a B grade mark, an A grade, a C grade?

If your answer is 'you decide' then the answer will be 'no'.
