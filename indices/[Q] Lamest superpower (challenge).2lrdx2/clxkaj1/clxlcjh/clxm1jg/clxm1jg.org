  Being lost generally requires not knowing where you are. You can now escape from most places (like jail).
#+end_quote

Indeed you can.

  Infiltration. Too easy. Be sure to read up on the boy bands in other countries.
#+end_quote

You may get some unexpected surprises when people find that Justin Bieber is infiltrating their neo nazi group.

  "Living" is an activity.
#+end_quote

It is, though I'd probably make the power more limited than this- people don't actively live, they breathe and such. Also, you have no control over autonomous functions-people will breathe and be hungry regardless of what your powers do. I'd imagine the story would have a lot of exploration of what boredom worked well to stop a person and have a lot of exploration of motivation and reasons people do things.

Suppose there was a religious extremist and you made them bored of religion to stop them. You then find out that actually what really motivated them was pleasing their companions.

  This test has a time limit of five minutes, and consists of one essay prompt. Drawings and schematics are encouraged. The prompt is, "outline, in detail sufficient to build a working model, plans for a stable cold fusion reactor, which can be built from under $1,000 worth of parts at an average Super Wal-Mart."

I'd probably use a different definition of ace- they perform better than the majority of testers around them, or they perform to the expectations of the tester. A test with an imprecise mark scheme like 'A working cold fusion machine' wouldn't be enough- suppose the machine actually worked via quantum bullshit, how would the tester evaluate this?

  Mind control? Way too easy.
#+end_quote

Not mind control, mind alteration. You can induce love in teachers. You can't control what said teachers do.

Dazzler is potent.

  Einstein, Machiavelli, Charlemagne, Nostradamus... At the very least, I'm sure there are some very good advisers available.
#+end_quote

Yes there are, though they may not know english or be happy to talk to you.

  "Avada Kedavra"
#+end_quote

The power would be about ending social interaction. It wouldn't give you any magical power to kill people, it would be a mental ability involving enhanced body language reading skills and intuition and mind reading to achieve the goal of ending parties.
