The coin flip power is really interesting. You'd need some way to manage / predict it, at least a bit, or you really couldn't afford to use it. Maybe if the results are always diametrically opposed, or if you can choose the "fail" outcome? So, you could say "I'm going to hit this guys with massive force, and he force is either vectored into him or into me."

I don't entirely like that...any other thoughts?
