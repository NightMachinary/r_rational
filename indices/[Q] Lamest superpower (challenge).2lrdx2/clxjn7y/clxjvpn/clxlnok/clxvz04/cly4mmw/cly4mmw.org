Let's say you're as popular as Beyonce. She makes $2.4 million per city. With your super-amphetamines and magical stage performance skill, you'll still only be able to pull one show a day, in order to hit prime time and get the right audiences (unless you have a very supersonic jet).

Let's be generous and say that with your impressive transportation from being an expert performer, you can make $5 million a night on average. If we call the price of the components and the making of a meal about $5 (being generous), then you can make a million meals, and feed 333,333 people.

Wow, isn't it interesting that the two numbers seem to be nearly the same? Though of course, I doubt you'd be able to keep the world interested with the same act forever, and practicing new acts takes time away from our philanthropic procedure...
