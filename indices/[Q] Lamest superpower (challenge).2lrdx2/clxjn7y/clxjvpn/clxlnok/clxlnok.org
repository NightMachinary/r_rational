Hm. How fast can you press your hands together and release them? If we say that a light clap counts as a press, and you're a super naturally fast clapper at 4 claps per second, then you'll be producing 4 doves per second (assuming that each dove is magically carted away as soon as it's created)

A person eats about 2.1 kg of food a day, which is roughly the mass of a dove (according to Google). There are 86400 seconds in a day, and 4 doves per second means that you can feed 345600 people per day at max rate.

So if you're on some super-amphetamines to produce nonstop, you could feed a country the size of Belize (with some really involved distribution system), or over 1/10 the United States.
