I'm currently writing S.I. in the form of a plaintext file, including italics like /these/, which I've been copy&pasting into GDocs for other people to read; no HTML currently exists.

As for what to make it look like, I do have one bookmark I archived for if-and-when I ever did get around to trying to formatting text to look non-awful: [[http://practicaltypography.com/][Butterick's Practical Typography]]. The points in the [[http://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html][summary]] seem to be at least as good an approach as any other I've found.
