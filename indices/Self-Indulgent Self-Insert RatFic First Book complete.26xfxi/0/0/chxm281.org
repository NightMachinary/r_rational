#+begin_quote
  wise reading
#+end_quote

Or as I might start calling it, 'golden feedback'. :)

#+begin_quote
  The metatext reminds me of how Blindsight begun, and I think it's pretty elegant and an intriguing addition. I think you could remove the "metatext description" from the final version, it feels a bit redundant.
#+end_quote

I'm guessing that by these, you mean the 'died and didn't know it' line and the 'unreliable narration' bit? If so, makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  The beginning is very exciting because it brings you straight into the action. I'm confused and want to know more.
#+end_quote

A classic piece of plotting advice I decided to explicitly follow: "Start with an earthquake and work your way up to a climax".

#+begin_quote
  I can't quite follow this sentence:
#+end_quote

I have a tendency to use too many sub-clauses and over-long thoughts; I can probably tweak that line a bit.

#+begin_quote
  I felt like the protagonist is probably modelled after the author?
#+end_quote

The protagonist is explicitly myself, if I'd gotten hit by a truck instead of started writing a new story. (The titular 'S.I.' can refer to 'self-insert', among other things.)

#+begin_quote
  The story has been pretty chill so far, which on the other hand means that I haven't felt much tension. It's not necessarily bad though, there's the same chill vibe than in the first chapter of Accelerando, but maybe a bit less intense. Or maybe I'm just in an apathetic mood, who knows.
#+end_quote

Hm... this suggests to me that I've been implicitly aiming for a feeling of blue-sky, distant, calm rationality instead of pulse-pounding in-your-face emotional responses. Being more consciously aware of this when I'm writing it could be useful, especially for those moments when I want to break the pattern.

#+begin_quote
  straigthforward, solid and easy to read. There isn't that much complexity or weirdness compared to other similar stories, mostly it's pretty simple action with some unique things here and there.
#+end_quote

Hm - I suppose since the first part was mainly a travelogue, 'straightforward' is to be expected. I do have some plans on cranking up the weirdness in Book Two, and doing so even further later on; so I can take the first part not seeming especially weird as a good building block.

#+begin_quote
  I haven't read that much amateur writing so I wasn't sure what it would be like, but I guess I can now see the difference between that and the writing of experienced and well-published sci-fi authors
#+end_quote

I'm not sure that my writing should be taken as an exemplar of amateur writing - but if you ever do get closer to putting your finger on the difference, I'd appreciate a heads-up. :)

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes I feel like events don't happen as naturally?
#+end_quote

This comes close to a writing issue I know I have. Often, I decide on a plot point I want to have happen, and then work my writing to arrange for that point to happen as naturally as possible; but I need to get better at this.

#+begin_quote
  straightforward, good quality and easy to read.
#+end_quote

Better than any of the alternatives I can think of. :)
