That link is massive overkill to the point of not being very relevant. I'm just trying to persuade you to not make it look like [[http://www.datapacrat.com/calendar/]] or [[http://www.datapacrat.com/True/LANG/EAIEA.HTM]] and instead make it look at least like [[http://blog.datapacrat.com/2013/06/26/nym-restating-the-reasons/]] and hopefully somethgin along the lines of [[http://qntm.org/all]] .
