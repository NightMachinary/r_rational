That's not what I mean. Say Anemone goes from normal space to a 6-hour-skip zone just before midnight, right in time to be hit with Skip 0 and sent six hours forward in time. Hot on her heels, Akalya enters the same zone just minutes later, but Anemone has vanished. Akalya wastes an hour searching for someone who isn't there, and is hit by Skip 1 and sent six hours forward.

Skips 2, 3, 4, and 5 pass without incident. Then when Skip 6 passes, Anemone reappears. She goes about her business for an hour until Skip 7 sweeps her further forward. While she is disappearing, Akalya reappears, none the wiser. She keeps searching for another hour, but Anemone doesn't exist then, so it's hopeless. Skip 8 sends her forward.

Anemone reappears with Skip 13 and disappears with Skip 14. Akalya reappears with Skip 14 and disappears with Skip 15. This happens again on Skip 20. They're practically right on top of each other, in the same place, in the same 6-hour-skip zone, in the same time period, but they never exist at the same time. Avoiding this would require either luck, or active coordination, I think.
