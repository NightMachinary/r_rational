Yeah, you're right. The chance is 1/7 of being physically capable of finding someone you're looking for, as long as you enter the zone from a zone with a cycle-length that is coprime with the new zone's, which is easy for a prime 1+6 zone. 1/7 isn't vanishingly small - if nothing else, you can leave and come back and search the area seven times, if you know to do that. But once you get deep enough that you're skipping more than a day, it becomes increasingly unfeasible to search the ruins, even if you're willing to burn decades of outside-time. It seems like something Sibi would have to worry about, if he's planning on entering the ruins to find someone specific. He knows how it works. Did he just plan on getting lucky?
