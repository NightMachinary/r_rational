Interesting thought. One hour is the approximate increment that the protagonist perceives that I picked artbitrarily, so, yes, that would be a 'modern' hour. This is a secondary world, modeled loosely on South Asia. I had imagined the ruins to be 50 million years old, based on old estimate for the Himalayas.

So a day would have been shorter by only a quarter of an hour when the Time Conduit was built.
