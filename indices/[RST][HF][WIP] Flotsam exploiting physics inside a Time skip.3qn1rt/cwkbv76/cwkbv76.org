I wouldn't expect to be able to find anyone in these ruins... If Anemone enters the ruins, then vanishes forward in time, then you enter before she comes back, then you will always be out of phase, both of you appearing exactly when the other vanishes. And the deeper you go into the ruins, the more possible phases there are, and the less likely you are to meet someone who crossed the thresholds more than an hour before you. Have I misunderstood the mechanics?
