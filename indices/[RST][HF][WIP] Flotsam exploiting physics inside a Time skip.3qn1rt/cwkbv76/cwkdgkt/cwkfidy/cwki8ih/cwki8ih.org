Agreed. If Akalya enters the time skip close on Anemone's heels she will never catch up. However if she arrives there at least 7 or more hours later (which she does) then she has a 1/7 chance of getting back in sync with Anemone. She has to hit that 1 hour slot in the 1 plus 6 hour period or its multiple. A small chance to be sure, but not vanishingly small. Does that make sense ? Let me know if I am wrong. Thanks for taking the time.
