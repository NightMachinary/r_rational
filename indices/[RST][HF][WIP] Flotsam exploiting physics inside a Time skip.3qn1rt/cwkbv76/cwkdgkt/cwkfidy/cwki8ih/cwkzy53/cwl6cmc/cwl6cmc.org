Sibi knows the chances of a rescue are slim. But Akalya offers him more money than he can resist, and he intends to make a single good faith attempt and offer condolences to the widow after the search turns up nothing. He knows enough not to go too deep into the ruins. His main fear is random predators from the past, but Akalya's high-tech weapon reassures him. What actually happens is partly for plot reasons, as mentioned before, and takes him by surprise.
