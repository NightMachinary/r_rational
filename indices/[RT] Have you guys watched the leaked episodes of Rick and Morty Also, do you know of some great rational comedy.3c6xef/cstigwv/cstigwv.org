I like that Rick is already a Munchkin Rationalist's wet dream in his insistence school makes you dumb because it teaches you how to blindly accept facts as "learning," along with some of his crazier escapades... [[#s][Spoilers for Various Episodes]] But even with that figured out, he really has no clue how to handle himself socially or emotionally. His relationship with Summer is tepid on a good day, Beth keeps him around mostly because of she kicks him out, she'll be without him again. Rick and Jerry wrote each other off a long time ago, and Rick is setting up Morty for a big falling out when Morty stops putting up with his adventure crap. [[#s][Spoiler for Penultimate episode of the season]] As much as he gives to science, it only gives so much back.
