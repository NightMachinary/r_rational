I absolutely love Rick and Morty, and I do think it's the sort of thing that people here would like. Not just because it's good in general, but because if you're well-read as far as fantasy and science fiction go, you'll appreciate the deconstructionist elements. It's "rational" in that it takes some of the absurd premises of science fiction to their ultimate conclusions, but not rational in the sense that the world makes sense.

The Meeseeks episode especially. It deals with the so-called House Elf problem really well, and I think if you want a comedic take on that, you can't do better.
