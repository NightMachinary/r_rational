I've never watched anything on Adult Swim, but I know some friends who loved Invader Zim (which I imagine may have a similar style to Rick and Morty, based on a 10 sec synopsis I read on Google?)

Initially I was excited to hear that Community was on Yahoo, but the first episode was underwhelming. Are you implying that it becomes the 'best evar' and I should pick it up again?

Re: other comedy... Dress to Kill by Eddie Izzard is a bit hypomanic in how he tangentially jumps from topic to topic, but I felt like I learned stuff about the Church of England and world history from his comedy. He's got a deconstructionist bent.
