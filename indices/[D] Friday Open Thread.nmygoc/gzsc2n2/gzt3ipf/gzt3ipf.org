Judicial corporal punishment evolved independently among many different cultures and is/was a feature of every pre-modern and early modern culture that is considered highly successful. This is despite the fact that corporal punishment isn't very rehabilitating. There is other merit to the practice besides reforming criminals.

It's deeply cathartic, both for the victims of crime and for society as a whole to see evil punished. When done publicly, it's somewhat of a deterrent against potential criminals, although arguably not very much since criminals assume they won't get caught. It also provides a constructive lifestyle/pastime for people with sadistic tendencies.

It's extremely cheap to implement to. The first city-states several millennia ago could do it easily, and today we could do it even better, safer as well.

We're talking strictly about punishment, but corporal methods could easily be combined with attacking crime at its roots (poverty/alienation/illness/etc.) as well as a penal system which also rehabilitates.
