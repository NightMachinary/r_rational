Why do you need the solution to be perfect? If it's for data visualization, it just has to be a fairly modest satisficer. Basically, you're overthinking it, and your time is probably better spent doing the bare minimum that is functional and focusing on other features. It'd not going to be perfect no matter what you do in all cases anyway, due to stuff like some users being colour blind, so you cant rely on that.
