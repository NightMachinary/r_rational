It occurred to me this week that the music video for, "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8][Once in a lifetime]]" would make for a very elegant, "bottle in the cosmic ocean" like the Voyager Golden Record, a representation of humanity as a whole:

- It's a New Wave song, which is itself a broadly influenced genre, but also has a lot of emphasis on artfulness, humor, eccentricity, and innovation. It'd minimize a single style being overrepresented and what style it does have is descriptive of human culture.

- The lyrical themes are universal to humans, even if they were intended for a particular generation's concerns. The meaning of life, authenticity, the inevitability of time passing, pursuing a stereotypically prosperous life, and the unconscious mind.

- Lyrics are in English, the most common second-language, third most common native tongue, the most widely spoken human language and the most common /lingua franca/. The vocabulary isn't overly complex, doesn't have many niche references, and has minimal slang.

- It features several dances and rituals from a wide variety of cultures ranging from Africa to East Asia as well as clips of the people in question. Byrne is wearing relatively widespread and timeless formal attire.

- As far as music videos go, the visuals and special effects are minimal. Most of the focus is placed on the people. It still showcases a few of the particularly interesting ones. The sounds aren't cluttered either, and it has both samples of singing and talking.

- On top of displaying the range of human motion, there are several closeups of the human face, the part of the body that plays the largest role in communication.

Admittedly I don't watch a ton of music videos. Feel free to suggest equal or better examples.
