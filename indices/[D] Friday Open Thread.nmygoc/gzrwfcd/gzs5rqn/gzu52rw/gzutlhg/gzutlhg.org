  Is "the entire history of the world I guess" a music video?

That's probably going too far in the other direction. :-)

But getting back to [[/u/Camaraagati]]'s idea about "Once in a Lifetime"... I mean, I don't think I can explain David Byrne to other /people/, let alone aliens. If that Talking Heads video is their only exposure to humanity I don't know what they're going to take away from that. They might not understand that legs are used for walking, for example.

And then I started thinking about other /good/ music videos (rather than the ones where the band is basically just standing around and pretending to play their instruments), and I couldn't think of any that would make much sense without explaining the context and metaphor used.

The closest would likely be one of those country music videos where the couple breaks up in the beginning, but gets back together at the end (I don't have a specific example). But that might give the wrong impression about relationships.
