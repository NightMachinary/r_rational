Way past the thread post date, but have you looked at Emacs and, specifically, Org Mode? Great slow burn if you want to invest a couple weeks and reap for alifetime.

To learn Emacs, I recommend starting with the built-in tutorial (really). That's C-h t when you open it up for the first time. (C is control in this context.)

A little on Org Mode: [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html]]
