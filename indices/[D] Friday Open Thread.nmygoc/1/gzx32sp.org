I am currently looking for useful productivity tools as I am gearing up for some major resource/time investment into politics/policymaking/campaigning.\\
I have a new android phone and a laptop with dual boot win10/ubuntu for this purpose, and am looking for good tools that will let me save time working with a small team. Security and data protection is important, open-source software preferred.\\
I am not looking for anything specific, rather recommendations or hacks for all sorts of purposes from multi-platform calendar synchronization to good news roundups and any useful thing I haven't thought of yet. I am tech-savvy and don't mind investing a few hours to make something work if the end result pays off over a timespan of a few months.

thanks for any tips!
