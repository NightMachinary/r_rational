I was curious about alternative punishments beyond fines and prison time for crimes. As I recently read in the news about the rise of incidents with people fighting, making a big scene, and calling the cops over masks, politics, and people unsatisfied with their service. You know people hitting flight attendants, throwing food at a waiter, things like that. Fines don't really seem to deter anyone especially the wealthy unless its a percentage of income which I believe is rare in the world and jails have their own issues. Though admittedly this is more of an issue for only certain countries. A buddy of mine suggested bringing back old time corporal punishment or public humiliation. I'm against corporal punishment as it seems way to open to abuse. But I think I could support bringing people known for dangerous behavior like drunk driving, constant assaults, or harassment to be punished by being put in the stocks in a public place or a walk of shame if constant jail time and fines don't seem to work. I also know several people who would accept a public whipping for reduced jail or prison time.
