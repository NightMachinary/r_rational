How about more guidance and help for criminals instead of more punishment?

Especially for those cases about people who call cops over masks or politics: More punishment is likely to only further divide the society, in my opinion.

Maybe for people who break the law out of sheer boredom or something like that public humiliation would help. But there's already something like that, without being explicit about wanting to humiliate: community service.

The problem with making the punishments worse to get back at rich people is that it's also affecting the other people. How would the law differentiate between the two?
