Ah I mean the stakes are pretty low (at the far tail if it's a useful tool it might be used by a few thousand people for data viz) but I don't think they have to be for a quick little toy like this? And any understanding gleaned would generalize -- outside certain neural contexts I rarely work in an optimization framework and so would like to deepen my understanding and intuitions re: what works best there and what doesn't.
