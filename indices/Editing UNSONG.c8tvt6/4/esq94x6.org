A few thoughts, although it's been well over a year since I last read the story so I could be misremembering a few things:

1. I thought that the notarikon in the chapter titles was a very strong touch and I would be very sad to see that cut.
2. "Planning to replace this with something where the theonomics have a machine that can sense whether a useful Name was spoken in their vicinity, but otherwise Names do nothing until you direct them with some kind of prayer." I don't like this. Such a machine wouldn't have existed until Names were a well-known phenomenon, plus it would remove the ability for the layman to stumble across a name which IIRC was a plot point at least once. Of course, I also don't think that understanding a Name when you invoke it is particularly hokey, so... take that with a grain of salt.
3. Same thing re: Ana joining the ship. I didn't find it hokey. To quote Good Omens, God's Plan is ineffible, and part of the charm was a series of "coincidences" that just work nicely for the plot. After all, everything is connected.
4. The Sohu-Malia connection could work and would certainly provide a reason for UNSONG to be a larger part of the story.
