As a mega-fan, the exposition that bothered me the most was the more laborious kabbalistic elements. The world is weird enough you can delete maybe 85% of the "this random pop culture is Adam Kadmon" style stuff.

I think the Malia Ngo thing is a good idea. It prevents even more confusion about why Thamiel doesn't control most bureaucracies. No reason for hellspawn to not be exceptionally obvious when on the surface.
