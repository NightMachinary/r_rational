The charm of this book is how completely off the wall it is. Some of these proposed changes, like removing wall drug and attempting to better justify Ana's introduction into the ship, make the plot make a bit more sense at the expense of the tone of the series.

Some of these changes are just base removal of flavour. I'm honestly directly opposed to most of these removals.

I'm extremely biased though. This was one of the best books I've ever read, and it feels like a shame to cut out bits of it.
