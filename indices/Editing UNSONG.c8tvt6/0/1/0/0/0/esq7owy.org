I think where I disagree is probably that I think a lot of the vingettes /don't/ build the world, they stand by themselves as individual ideas. In a lot of cases, these individual ideas were taken from previous works by Scott Alexander with only mild alterations. /To me/, a fair number of the vingettes stand out as being "of themselves" rather than properly integral to the world and part of the mesh, which is what makes me feel like they don't belong as part of the work.

Wall Drug is probably one of those big points of contention, because while I like the idea, it doesn't feel like it's very /Unsong/ to me, it feels like a different idea from a different story that wandered in and found a very uncomfortable home. To other people, it feels natural, or the coolness of the idea makes up for the lack of cohesion.
