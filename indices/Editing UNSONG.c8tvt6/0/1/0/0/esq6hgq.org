It straight up feel weird disagreeing with you on this, because you're probably my favourite author right now.

I like the mix between vignettes and plot. The self contained stories interrupting the plot (San Fransisco, New York Invasion, Richard Nixon) build the world in a way that I've never seen done in a series. It charmingly trivializes the whole thing, which is almost necessary when you discuss religion in the manner that Unsong does.
