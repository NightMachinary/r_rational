I don't have a bunch of suggestions for Scott Alexander, but at least he's pinpointed a lot of the problems that I have with the book, which is that a bunch of it is disconnected and ultimately pointless to the plot, better served as being a short story than a piece of the greater work.

(Authors putting every idea they ever had into a single book is a big pet peeve of mine. (Obviously when /I/ do it, it's fine.))
