I generally agree with the proposed changes, especially the removal of the Wall Drug sections.

Perhaps more controversially, I think a culling of the weaker, more arbitrary ‘fundamental interconnectedness of all things' passages would benefit the book, as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6brv2x/unsong_epilogue/dhph7cv/][they're what led to me dropping it initially]]. I ended up eventually picking it back up (to my great enjoyment!) but recall a few of those sections rather dragging on. But I guess they're one of the selling points of the work, and likely the author isn't trying to tailor it to my likes alone ¯\/(ツ)//¯
