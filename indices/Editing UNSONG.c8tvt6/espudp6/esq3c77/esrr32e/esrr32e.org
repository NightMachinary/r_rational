Personally, I feel like a lot of this would be a mistake. I loved the vignettes and flashbacks that weren't really connected to much else, however I do understand that it might not work in a published book.

With that said, some of these changes seem like they would completely change the tone of the story. For example, point 13 where you want to change the "speaking a name causes a feeling to rush through you" thing is a mistake in my opinion. Not only does it remove a memorable bit of backstory, but more importantly, we're talking about discovering a new name of god here. Whenever someone properly speaks it, they should absolutely experience something profound. You can still change it so that they don't understand the meaning and can't use it properly if they aren't kabbalists (or have had it explained to them by kabbalists) but needing a machine to recognise a name of god just seems way sillier.

I also disagree with the Sohu choice. Sohu being an eternal child and being kept as an idealistic hero who mimics Jala's stand against Thamiel is really powerful and is what makes her such a good character. It's what makes the finale where she dies refusing to hate her father so good. Just turning her into the symbol of necessary evil of the government with a demon aura just feels like you're fixing the small problem of Malia by making other parts significantly worse.

Finally, Thamiel. Thamiel is such a good character and his ending is one of the best parts of the story imo. Merging him and Sataniel works, but Thamiel can't be conflicted like Sataniel is in the beginning, and Sataniel can't instantly become like Thamiel when he comes back to the heavenly host. You need to show Sataniel somewhat gradually becoming better at being evil and I think it would be great if he added the second head here to feel his inner conflict so the rest of him didn't have to.

P.S. Aaron vs the drug lord was fine, sometimes a character can do stupid things and I think the situation was enough of an explanation.
