I like the idea of Sohu as Malia Ngo, which not only makes that mystery more satisfying but also turns Sohu's chapters into backstory for UNSONG, tying it more to the plot. However, I agree with [[/u/LordSwedish]] that it would be important to keep essential Sohu moments like refusing to curse her father.

I also agree with getting rid of the "Ethiopians have no souls" thing. It was fun but p-zombies don't really work in Unsong where souls make random laptops into sentient AIs and are required for the most common form of spellcasting.

I don't feel strongly about the Harmonious Jade Dragon Empire or Sarah Michelle Gellar but yeah, probably no harm in replacing them.

However, I would be quite disappointed by most of these changes. I found Aaron's failure against the Drug Lord very powerful, Wall Drug was great and while I know some people had fun ideas I never thought it /needed/ an explanation given how much weirdness is knocking around the setting, Not A Metaphor is an amazing name, etc.
