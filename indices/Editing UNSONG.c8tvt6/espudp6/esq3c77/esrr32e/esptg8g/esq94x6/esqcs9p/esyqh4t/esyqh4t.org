Much of this, especially the bits about Sohu and the notarikon, feel as though SA is expicitly satirizing people who disliked Unsong and requested for it to be changed in ways that fundamentally made it a different, differently-structured, and differently-written story.

Some of Unsong could probably be usefully edited or tightened up, but on the whole these edits as described don't strike me as useful. Also, the depiction of the edit reasons (particularly for Sohu's and Aaron's re: the Drug Lord) are almost blatantly trolling.
