I would probably also be fine with a restructuring so that it was more of a loose collection of vingettes, but as it stands, I don't think that's /particularly/ true of the structure, since there are protagonists who are following goals/journeys, there are just quite a few of them. The book should either put more emphasis on the plot and characters and less on the vingettes, or lean into the vingettes entirely (which will be hard to do while telling a cohesive story).

(If I were more invested, I would go through and count what all the chapters/scenes are about and plot it out on corkboard-alike to get a firmer look at the /actual/ structure. I haven't read it since it was published.)
