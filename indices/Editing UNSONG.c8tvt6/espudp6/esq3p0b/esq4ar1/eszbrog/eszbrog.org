This reminds me of /The Grapes of Wrath/, which alternates between vignettes and plot with every chapter. The vignettes kinda follow the characters around, in that they tend to be set near whereever the characters are in their corresponding chapter, but that's mostly it. I'm not sure how hard it'd be to make that work with Unsong, given that some of the not-immediately-relevant chapters have their own plots and characters.
