  I think I would just have the criminal and the brother be alone on a high platform like a bridge or a balcony, and at first the criminal would pretend to be a jumper but instead pulls a gun on him as he gets near him.

So... when exactly in this scenario does he have time to blindfold the Brother?

Also, wouldn't a laser pointer run the risk of blinding Criminal, or surprising him into pulling the trigger?

--------------

Suggestion: Building under construction, lots of scaffolding, no-one up there but the builders.

One of said builders heads out on a ledge with a gun and fires it into the air to attract attention (Where do the bullets land? Well, /he/ doesn't care.) Brother heads up to find out what the guy wants/talk him down, all other builders evacuated.

Crowd gathers beneath. Crowd includes Sister.

Guy With Gun takes Brother hostage, grabbing him around the neck with one arm and holding a gun to his head. Since Criminal's arm is around Brother's neck, Brother can't look down (and isn't really trying to, he's mostly thinking about the gun barrel pointed at his brain matter).

Criminal, however, /can/ look down. and is yelling at the crowd below. Possibly he's yelling at a police negotiator - a guy with a loudhailer and a psychology degree, who's trying to talk him into letting Brother go.

Criminal wants something. Possibly something political, possibly just to get his cause on the evening news. He's unstable, threatening to shoot Brother. Brother /still/ can't look down because of the arm around his neck.

It's at this point that Sister (possibly standing near to the Negotiator) can flip up her eyepatch for a moment, and stone Criminal. Bother's troubles aren't over - he now has a massive heavy unmoving statue around his neck - but at least he's not going to get /shot/ anymore...
