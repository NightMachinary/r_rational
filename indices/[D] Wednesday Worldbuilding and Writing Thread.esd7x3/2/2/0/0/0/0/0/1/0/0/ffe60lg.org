  I imagine the stone is a dark grey marble, and whatever weight the subject is - the stone is the same equivalent. It's also dense, so if you were to break it apart, there would still be stone inside.
#+end_quote

That's a problem, because... either it's ordinary stone, which is heavier than flesh, or it's abnormal stone (eg pumice) which has the same density as flesh. If it's ordinary stone, it can't be solid. Maybe it can have a honeycomb sort of layout, but you're really stretching it. It just plain doesn't make sense for it to both be solid (heavy) granite and be the same weight as flesh and bone.

  Or maybe it would be easier to stone a criminal and then sculpt her likeness onto it.
#+end_quote

This is clearly the way to go, especially if she can kidnap the criminal, change clothes with her, change her appearance (e.g. with costumer face putty), and then stone her. Much easier for a trained SFX makeup artist to do it before stoning than for her to sculpt (which will give tool marks).

  As for the baby concept, it will be stoned unless it literally exits out of the mother's body. The umbilical cord would snap off probably. And if you stone the baby, the mother wouldn't be affected.
#+end_quote

Umbilical cords don't really... snap off. They fall off after several days of their own accord.

The umbilical cord and placenta are part of the baby - but the placenta is also part of the mother. My first thought was that the placenta would turn into stone with the baby, but that would mean a stone organ with stone blood vessels entering the mother's endometrium would be a thing. Which would probably result in infection at the very least, and be very difficult to pass (that said, there's literally 30 minutes between a baby being born and the placenta being born, so, this really doesn't need to be worked out for your story...)

I guess if the baby was stoned, you could make it be stoned until the start of the umbilical cord, which would then fall off, but based on embyronic development this isn't nearly as pretty as it /seems/ to laypeople. (And converseley, if the mother was stoned but the neonate wasn't, the placenta and cord would be stoned all the way up to the navel? or maybe either way the placenta gets off scott free?)

  The other twin would need surgery to seperate themself, and prevent the spread of disease.
#+end_quote

I think most conjoined twins who aren't separated is because the surgery would be too dangerous: but I guess if one is dead, then you can "just" save the other (though they usually share a liver: how do you determine what happens to the 'shared' liver? what about those American women who are essentially one person with two heads, and they each control one arm and one leg?)

  and sell statues to artists for money
#+end_quote

artists probably aren't buying super realistic statues these days? I don't think there's much market for them - isn't art mostly about making people /feel/ things? Which you can't really do with one very well crafted statue? Selling them to rich people to display in their houses, or to like mob bosses who want to own their rival's corpse, might be a better option?

  he wound could be cauterized by only turning the limb to stone.
#+end_quote

How would the stone limb stay attached? Wouldn't that be a huge risk of infection? Or would the idea be a stopgap until a surgeon could amputate it?
