Appreciate your help

I imagine the stone is a dark grey marble, and whatever weight the subject is - the stone is the same equivalent. It's also dense, so if you were to break it apart, there would still be stone inside. So that tree branch wouldn't snap because it's too heavy but because the criminal loses all balance, so they would fall off and might take the branch with it.

If I ever get far with this story, she might have plans to fake her death and sculpt her own portrait, making the police think she stoned herself. So the stone material would have to be exactly the same. Or maybe it would be easier to stone a criminal and then sculpt her likeness onto it.

As for the baby concept, it will be stoned unless it literally exits out of the mother's body. The umbilical cord would snap off probably. And if you stone the baby, the mother wouldn't be affected.

But if a criminal were pregnant, she wouldn't want to stone an innocent life anyway.

The conjoined twins idea is extremely fascinating and too good not to explore in this story, so I would think the "power" would make a distinction between the two beings and only stone one of them. The other twin would need surgery to seperate themself, and prevent the spread of disease.

The power generation is a creative avenue to go down but probably too out there. Although she probably would use the power for personal gain at some point, and sell statues to artists for money etc

Some other ideas:

- The power stones the victim almost immediately but starts from the body-parts closest to the eye. So if they stick their arm out, the arm would be stoned first and then the rest of the body. So if the subject were bleeding out from an amputated limb, and the eye were to open and shut fast enough, the wound could be cauterized by only turning the limb to stone. Maybe you could make a device like a pair of digital glasses, where the lens opens and shuts in a millisecond to do this.

- Using technology to upgrade the eye's power - contact lenses that zoom in, infra-red/night vision lenses, AR censoring technology to filter out mirrors and reflections

- Using optical illusions to imprint images on the eye? But I don't know how that would be useful
