1. You are a Muggle in your mid 20's.

2. The year is 2015. You live in London.

3. A message received from your 16 year old self has information stating you were brain wiped of a younger sibling who was a wizard at some point.

4. You do not remember a younger sibling, nor do you have any evidence beyond family pictures that look a little off center. As if a person is missing. Several years of VHS tapes and old cheap DVD's are too badly aged to repair.

5. The message contains encrypted scans of year 1-2 textbooks from Hogwarts as well as notes from your 16 year old self detailing what you figured out traveling with your sibling to Diagon alley to purchase school supplies for years 1 and 2.

6. You have 20,000 pounds in savings. You are working a steady job to continue earning 1,600 pounds a month. (Not factoring in expenses.)

7. Your younger self insists that the higher echelons of government around the world are in on the secret, and are actively working to cover up the Wizards existence.

8. Muggles are seen as nothing better than Cattle, treat them nicely but no one really gets too upset if something bad happens to them.

Your goal is to bring down the statute of secrecy, while keeping your memory, and not dying. Ensuring that a war does not erupt is a secondary concern after the preservation of magical knowledge and casters. Wizards are hoarding knowledge that can benefit all of mankind, they can violate the known rules of physics, which is only more data for the Grand Unified Theory. They could prevent disasters, but don't. They took your sibling out of your life.

Rules:

- You are not immune to magic.

- Muggle repelling spells cover only the entrances to magical locations.

- You do not recover memories from a properly cast obliviate.

- Stealing magic is impossible. Investigating the genetics of it and the possibility of gene manipulation for it are far beyond your means until the statute falls.

- You can utilize potions, magical items, and creatures.

- Magic operates like heavily ionizing radiation in regards to electronics (but not living creatures). Dead simple mechanical and electrical devices will operate near magic, complex unhardened transistors / vacuum tubes will not.

- Magical shields block bullets, hand grenades and moderate kinetic impacts. A speeding sedan will be stopped by a shield, a bus will not.

- Muggles cannot learn legilimency or occlumency. Memories of a muggle can be extracted and / or stored in a pensive.

- Prophecy is real, but only in hindsight.

- 'Souls' are brain states. Magic of the soul is manipulation of the electrical patterns that represent the mind.

- Muggles can use the Flu / Side along Apperate / Portkey without anything beyond usual side effects.

- Ritual magic exists, but requires a magical individual to execute. (No sticking a wizard in the circle unconscious and activating either. Coercion is viable.)

Munchkin / what are the most efficient methods of achieving this goal? Assume the individual executing this are of slightly above average intelligence, but not strictly a rationalist to the point of sitting down to plan every possible outcome or examine their reasoning and biases at ever decision. Basic ethical concerns apply as well. The individual is not going to at first murder a wizard to gain access to his library and scan it into a computer. Small slides and forays into ethical grey areas could lead to this. There is no time scale of execution of this plan.

What are some methods of achieving the goal/ loopholes in the current rules?
