Step one: Email a backup of everything I have to Wikileaks. Anonymously, or as anonymously as I can.

Step two: Set up a system that will automatically email me a copy of the documents - along with all the other notes I upload in the future - to me if I ever fail to send it a weekly email by Monday morning. Send the email every Sunday evening that I remember to send it. Regularly upload my notes to the server, with the intention that if I am memory-wiped, I can reconstruct why I got memory-wiped.

Step 3: Hide several other reminders of the Wizarding World where I would come across them in the course of my daily life, should I ever be memory-wiped.

These three steps will give me a resilience to memory-wiping that will surprise most wizards.

Step 4: Attempt to enter Diagon Alley armed with a camera phone. (Yes, the phone won't work, but I won't know that until I'm there...)

--------------

Step 4: Recover objectives from email. Recognise that attempting to slip into Diagon Alley with a camera phone leads to memory wipe.

Step 5: Attempt to find evidence of missing younger sibling. Search through city records, church baptisimal records, anything. Google his/her name.

Step 6: If younger sibling is alive, attempt to make contact. If not, then send (anonymous email) evidence of probable death to police station.

Step 7: Attempt to recruit like-minded wizardly allies

...after this point, it /really/ depends on what happens...
