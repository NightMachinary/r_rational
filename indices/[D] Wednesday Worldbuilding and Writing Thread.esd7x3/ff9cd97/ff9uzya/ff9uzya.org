I really love this (abandoned) fanfiction, it's an isekai of a D&D wizard entering the Harry Potter universe at the beginning of the first book.

Some of the chapters are about a muggle police officer investigating magic.

She first gets on the trail because she's on the team that was to raid the house Harry stays in to hide from the death eaters, then finds out her memory is wiped after noticing paperwork flaws and goes back to the voice recording she took before.\\
Later, she gets bird watching groups to monitor for owl-deliveries of wizarding newspapers, and then eventually discovers who is getting them, and steals one, then gets into diagon alley by tricking a squib.
