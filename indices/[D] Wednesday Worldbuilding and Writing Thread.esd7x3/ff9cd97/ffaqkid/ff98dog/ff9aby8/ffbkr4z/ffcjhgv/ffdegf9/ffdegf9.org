I'm struggling to picture early-mid 20th century transportation in this paradigm.

Maybe the power supply problems are solved through electrified rails rather than large batteries (though some amount seems necessary, maybe somehow you can just get by with lead-acid). And if you really want to go off-roading, presumably you can buy a car with an internal combustion generator that then powers the electric motors.

I dunno, maybe this alternate history is possible.
