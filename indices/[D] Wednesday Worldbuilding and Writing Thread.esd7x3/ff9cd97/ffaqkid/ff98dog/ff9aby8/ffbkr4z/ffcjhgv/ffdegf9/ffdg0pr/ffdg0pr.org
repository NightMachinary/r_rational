Agreed, as bad as oil is for the environment it's energy density is something that made the modern world possible.

Transportation infrastructure would be different, my guess is a lot of it could be done via trains over land. However for ships over the ocean, you'd have to jump from sails to nuclear. Solar would be horrible for ships, and you have no space for the batteries to store energy.

Same goes for aircraft, WWI and WWII would look very different without oil. Not to mention plastics and synthetic material processing...

More I look into this, the more interested I'd be to see the scenario but it would have to be heavily researched to be a rational setting. Oil has had about as much influence, if not more, on society in the past 200 years as computing has had in the past 50.
