If I may further observe, it seems that you think that I'm approaching this scenario with the assumptions that nuclear energy is bad, communism is bad, and electric cars are good. I have none of those assumptions. I think nuclear energy, communism, and electric cars are tools that might or might not be useful depending on what you're trying to accomplish in what circumstances with what other options. I'm just trying to explore an alternate history scenario as objectively as I can.
