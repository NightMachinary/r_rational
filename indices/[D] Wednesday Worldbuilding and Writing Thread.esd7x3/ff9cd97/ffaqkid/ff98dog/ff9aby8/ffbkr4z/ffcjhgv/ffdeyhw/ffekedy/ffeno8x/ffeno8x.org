There wouldn't be any more motivation to switch to nuclear in that timeline than in ours. If they did (second point of departure in the "what if"), it'd work out better overall; nuclear energy is the cleanest and safest option (it outperforms everything else in terms of deaths per kilowatt hour, and that includes accidents like Chernobyl).

I don't know any reason communist countries would ban electric cars in favor of gasoline, that has nothing to do with who owns the means of production. Communism isn't weirdo backwards land, it's an umbrella term for a set of specific ideologies about whether it's okay to own things that other people use. Besides, stereotypically, communists like trains.
