I was thinking along those lines, too. In fact, because you can put your stinky coal-fired power plant far away from a city and transmit just the electricity, air pollution in cities might decrease, causing city-dwelling policy makers to care less about air pollution, making air pollution worse on average. Nuclear I hadn't thought of. Concerns about air pollution (and maybe global warming?) might encourage the construction of more nuclear plants in the 60s, with the increased chances of nuclear accidents. Re: shortages: I can see governments clamping down on private electric cars. In communist countries they might be banned entirely. In favor of gasoline vehicles perhaps? :)
