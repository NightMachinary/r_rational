Interesting! Switching out the Middle East for South America would give the United States an enormous advantage. We might end up with isolationism continuing through the 1940s, with America just cutting the Axis Powers off from battery materials. Same with the Cold War. I predict that by the end of the century, the US would have imperial control over South America, but not much to do with Europe or Asia. However, according to this map [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George_Barakos/publication/285538097/figure/fig4/AS:365519271153667@1464157993251/Map-showing-the-global-distribution-of-rare-earth-element-deposits-and-mines-Walters.png]] Rare earth metals are also present in North America, Scandinavia, southern Africa, China, and Australia. That would still give an advantage to the English-speaking world, but maybe there are some scuffles between the USSR, China, and Japan in the 1930s? /However/ however! Batteries in the time of our point of divergence didn't use rare earths. Electric cars in the early twentieth century would have had to use lead-acid, nickel-iron, and maybe zinc-carbon batteries (somebody please correct me if I'm wrong - I'm going off of wikipedia here) I don't think any of those components are especially scarce (again, correct me if I'm wrong). Perhaps a much larger demand for zinc would see some Great Powers meddling in Peru, India, and China? But I think we'd have tons of trouble with ground-water pollution.
