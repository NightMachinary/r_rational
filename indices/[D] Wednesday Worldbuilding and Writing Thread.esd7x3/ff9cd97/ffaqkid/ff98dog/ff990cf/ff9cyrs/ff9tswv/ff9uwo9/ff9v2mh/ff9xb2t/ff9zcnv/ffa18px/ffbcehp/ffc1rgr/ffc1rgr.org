The secretarial role is a good idea, although she is 18 so I don't know if that's unrealistic or not. She is also a sculptor and her mother works in a store that sells sculpts - would this cause any suspicion?

The rock would be a dark grey marble, and the detail would be extremely life-like. Although maybe variation in stone types would be an interesting idea to explore

I would imagine most of the victims would crack on impact of hitting the ground. And I'm planning in the beginning of the story the brother is blindfolded and held at gunpoint in a public place, leading to her being forced to stone the criminal holding him hostage.
