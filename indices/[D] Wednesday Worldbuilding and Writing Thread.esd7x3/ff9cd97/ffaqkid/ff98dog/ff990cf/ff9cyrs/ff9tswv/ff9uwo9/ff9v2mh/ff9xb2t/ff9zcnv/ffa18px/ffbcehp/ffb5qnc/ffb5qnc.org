  The power works by just transforming the subjects atoms into "stone atoms"

This has some real "conservation of energy" / nuclear physics type consequences, if you haven't already explored that.

Does the weight change? Like, say she chases a criminal up a tree, and the criminal is at the very thinnest part their body can support, and BAM, the eye contact happens, the criminal is stone. Does the now stone body cause the tree to snap?

There is no such thing as "standard rock" - choose something specific (sandstone? granite? whatever type of rock is common at her birthplace/the thing that cursed her's birthplace?) to ensure your descriptions are consistent.

  If the subject is pregnant, the baby will also be turned to stone

Slippery slope argument: you said a baby in arms won't be. Let's say you have a baby that was born at ~26 weeks and taken home at ~36 weeks, so it's still not "fully grown" but is independent/etc by the rules of the power. Now say you have someone with a baby at ~42 weeks in the belly. Are you OK with this?

Possible explanation: the baby is considered part of the mother for the purposes of this power until the umbilical cord is cut.

Problem: the baby is born, and the cord isn't cut yet. You curse the mother: does the baby, which is now external, get cursed? What about if you curse the baby but not the mother?

Solution: I highly doubt this will come up in your story, and pretty much anything can be justified here.

Complication: If you decide the umbilical cord is what matters, this needs to be consistent with conjoined twins. If one twin sees her, are both stoned?

Munchinry: Assuming she does it on animals that society has no qualms killing (i.e. most everything except dogs, cats, and anything endangered) she can do power generation stuff with a wheel.

Workaround: it takes some amount of effort for her to do it, which is unnoticable for killing 5 criminals here and there, but if she does 4 hour shifts changing rats in wheels, it probably becomes noticable. Also, breeding the animals probably takes more work than would be generated, unless you imagine that Lemmings really do commit suicide and you set it up next to the lemming suicide cliff.

Of course, it's not particularly likely to be in her plans if she wants to be Dexter.

(You can probably get around this if the stone is a shell of the same weight, though it still requires a fuckton of energy, it doesn't outright break physics).
