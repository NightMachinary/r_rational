Magic can follow whatever rules you want, obviously, but it seems rather arbitrary for the magic to recognize a cojoined twin as "seperate" and not a late-term fetus with different DNA etc. It kind of sounds like the "soul" is imparted at the instant of birth, but AFAIK there are no traditions in which that's how it works.

If you want the pregnancy thing as a plot point, I'd probably peg it to blood flow - i.e. cojoined twins and newborns with a functional umbilical cord would be stoned - or just, y'know, the fetus would die regardless and be entombed (although that would be pretty grim.)
