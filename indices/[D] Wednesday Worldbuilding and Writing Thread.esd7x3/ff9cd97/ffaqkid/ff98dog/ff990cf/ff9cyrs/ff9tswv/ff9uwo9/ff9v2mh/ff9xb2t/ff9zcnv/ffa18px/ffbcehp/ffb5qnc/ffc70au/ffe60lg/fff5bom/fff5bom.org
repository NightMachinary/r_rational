Ok, I think I'll just change it so that their mass is heavier as they are stoned.

The umbilical cord being stoned all the way to the navel seems like the way to go, and wouldn't really harm the baby.

I think the shared liver would be partially stoned which would make it unusable anyway - so they would still have to get emergency treatment. The one person with two heads is an interesting idea - I think the power would only stone one of the heads down to the neck. So the other limbs probably couldn't be used anymore.

I was thinking an eccentric rich artist takes an extreme fascination of the stone killings and wants to display custom statues like large animals, people in elaborate poses etc that would seem impossible to sculpt in some exhibit. Of course, that would create a lot of suspicion.

The mob boss who wants their rival's corpse is a fun idea, and would she would have no problem killing another criminal.

The stone limb would probably lead to disease if not treated, but not life-threatening. Maybe paralysis in that arm. The limb stays attached like a prosthetic arm that you can't take off. There wouldn't be a fine cutoff line where you can distinguish where the skin stops and the stone starts, more like a slight gradient so it doesn't snap and fall off. A criminal would then probably go to a back-alley surgeon to amputate it.

EDIT: I was also researching metamorphic rock types and how they change form based on increasing pressure. I think it would be interesting if the power could be trained and focused enough that the marble transforms to something like graphite, or diamond or even reaches a melting point. This would probably render the eye useless after such an exert of energy.
