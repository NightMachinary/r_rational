My character wants to be a serial killer vigilante (like Dexter) and kill criminals with her power.

She has a brother who is a police detective. How would she realistically find and scope out criminals to kill, without hanging around an alley waiting for a crime to happen?

EDIT: There is also an existing serial killer (evil) who's operating in the city who she wants to hunt down. This killer skins his victims alive, and the police have been trying to catch him
