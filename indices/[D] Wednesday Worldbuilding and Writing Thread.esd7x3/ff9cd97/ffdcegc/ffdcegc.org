I was actually thinking of this earlier this morning, but from the opposite perspective - the statute of secrecy is so /obviously/ doomed to fail that there must be serious protections keeping it up that we never see. So I was thinking from the perspective of a muggleborn wizard - how do you figure out what's keeping the secret and bypass it?

Your goal, if you want to make information resilient, is just to spread it around without arousing notice. Your problem is that you don't know what arouses notice - if you just tell a friend in private, how do you know that magical alarms aren't going off somewhere?

In the given setting (assuming the Harry Potter novels don't exist), I probably don't think of magical protections until too late. So in-setting me would probably start by telling trusted people as much as I think they'll accept, backing up the information in various locations, trying to feel out people who might be interested in being nodes in an information-spreading network, etc. I'll probably realize that the NSA could have red flags on obvious wizard jargon and not use it in electronic conversations, and certainly not put anything on the public web at first.

At this point, if the protection is magical alarms against secret-breaking, they're probably thoroughly going off and I get nabbed and lose the game. But maybe the magical protections are more subtle and, dare I say, magical. In which case I probably accidentally trip and fall while having decided that carrying all my evidence next to a river was a good idea, then hit my head and die of a brain hemorrhage.

Basically, my chances as a muggle don't seem great.
