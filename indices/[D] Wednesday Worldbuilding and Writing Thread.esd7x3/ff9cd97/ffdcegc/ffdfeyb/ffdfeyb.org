More subtle methods of detection of the statute would be I think counter to the wizarding culture introduced in the books.

In the 'fanon' the Unspeakables who would be executing things like this are given a heck of lot more power. In canon, they're only researchers at the behest of the government.

I think the largest difference between the muggles and wizards beyond the magic is the type of society and group dynamic they seem to operate on.

For as much as the Wizards say they have a government, it's small town politics and machinations. Lots of nepotism, conservative leads, not much political action beyond attempts at a violent takeover.

I'm not saying that muggle governments aren't like this, but globalization and the mindset is fundamentally different. Not to mention that even with the NSA example, they're going to be just as likely as an independent muggle to wrangle anything they can from wizards / those in the know.

I'd prefer to make the mistake and be picked up by the NSA spooks than have my memory wiped. The Government overall might be helping the wizards, but factions inside of it are not all in lock step like the wizarding world. (It's frankly impossible in my opinion for the statue to have been kept for any length of time in the modern world. People cannot keep secrets for months, let along centuries.)

So yes, perhaps the wizards have some arcane information detecting magic. In which case any attempt to disseminate information will fail, assuming it's operating on the information itself as an infohazard and not the method of information transmission.

The wizards might have detection in place for speaking, writing, signing and the like. I doubt very much they have magic for detecting encrypted digital data. You might suffer a few memory wipes to reach this conclusion with reminders in place though... Which is bad. You've got to assume repeat offenders of getting close to breaking the statute are just turned in to vegetables.

Wizards don't see the muggles as people.
