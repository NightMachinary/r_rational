Parents of muggleborns are the key. You can find them at King's Cross. "Hi, did you just drop off you kid to Hogwarts? Being a muggle who knows about wizards is such a weird situation, I'd like to have someone similar to talk to, could I get your number?" Should allow you to figure out if they are willing to help you without exposing you are working against the statute.
