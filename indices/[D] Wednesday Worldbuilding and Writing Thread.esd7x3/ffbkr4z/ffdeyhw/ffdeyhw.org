There'd still be global warming, since the electricity for the cars is still coming from fossil fuels. I suspect it'd be even worse, since electricity has more transmission and storage losses than gas does. Places with fossil fuels get exploited for oil just as much if not more so.

If this alternate world also switches to green energy... well there really isn't much available until the invention of nuclear power. Nuclear power is great but plants take a long time to build and are very capital-intensive, which would mean long power shortages as the market is slow to respond to demand.
