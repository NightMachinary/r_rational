Heavier reliance on infrastructure (electrified tracks, shorter range before recharging esp. with primitive batteries) might lead to more centralization, more crowded cities and towns. Worse roads, especially backroads; some areas might not bother with roads at all and just put in train tracks or similar (less accidents because you can't swerve off-road, but more fatal when they do happen.)

EDIT: towns built without cars in mind, such as if they intended to rely on a subway system, would have narrower streets and thus fire would spread more easily.
