The motivation to switch to nuclear would be the increased demand for electricity, supplying the need that in our timeline was supplied by gasoline. Coal would probably fill that gap at first, but nuclear would look more attractive as air pollution (and possibly earlier climate change?) became worse.

Communist countries might ban electric cars in order to decrease demand for electricity until they could build the necessary power plants. They might promote gasoline cars as an alternative - re-purposing their military production lines for civilians.

Or gasoline cars might end up evolving in third-world countries, again as repurposed military vehicles. That's if some Elon-Musk-type starts making gasoline cars in the west. :)
