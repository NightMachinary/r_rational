Thank you all for the wrinkles and details to what is turning out to be a pretty grim alternate history.

I'm wondering if this scenario might create the incentives for someone to invent a better energy source. 1920s hydrogen cars seem a bit of a stretch, though.

It might just be that the most likely scenario is that people abandon electric cars and switch to gasoline, just like this did in our time line :)
