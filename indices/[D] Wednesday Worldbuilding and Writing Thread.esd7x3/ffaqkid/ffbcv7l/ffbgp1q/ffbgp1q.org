This one's my favourite. WIPP is the name of the radioactive material storage facility:

WIPP (hw;p), n. [prob. <Eng. whip in reference to ancient religious flagellation rites] Ancient 18th century A. D. (approx.) underground religious shrine in honor of the salt goddess. Care with which the facility was aligned vertically within the salt stratum, precise geometric layout, and inclusion of valuable transuranics show the esteem accorded the salt goddess. (Note: Some authorities believe the shrine layout is a stylized image of a mythic sea monster in reference to the salt in the oceans.)
