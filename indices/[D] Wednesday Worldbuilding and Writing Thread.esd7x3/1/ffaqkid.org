Okay, this is really random, but you know all that stuff about creating a warning system for nuclear waste storage facilities? They basically have to stop people drilling there for 10,000 years.

I recently was reading through a bunch of documents from c. 1990 about this, and one included some science fiction scenarios of how the storage facilities would be interacted with on different time-scales under different conditions. I kind of love this.

You can find the document here: [[https://www.wipp.energy.gov/library/cca/CCA_1996_References/Chapter%207/CREL3329.PDF]] - I think it's about p180 on the pdf, but I've uploaded a screenshot of the first scenario here: [[https://imgur.com/a/Daj1jpb]]

Here's my summary of the scenarios:

"in 100 years" scenarios:

- "What if the world becomes feminist in 100 years and people ignore our warnings because we are old white men?" (full text above)
- "cult thinks the meaning of life is buried there so they drill" - their cult beliefs involve thinking that we are simultaneously in many alternate realities so they think all the stuff about radiation is from an alternate universe that does not apply here
- New Mexico secedes from the USA and joins Mexico and everyone forgets about the waste buried because beaurocracy... By 2091
- "what if it's so successful that it's expanded and lots more stuff is dumped, even non-radioactive stuff?" (answer: it's probably ok)

the 1,000 year scenarios

- in 2991 there are underground skyscrapers in all major cities and they are building a tunnel through the site, which they don't find because they are coming from below. This is actually reasonable if unlikely
- slaves are mining the area. Computers working through speech interfaces mean that nobody can read anymore. They ignore the written warnings and dig anyway

11991.....

- Virus on the androids that build underground cities makes them dig randomly. There's a very detailed description of society and its 3 tiers in this future. (There are the high class humans who run everything, the low class humans who get UBI and make art and or do drugs, and then the robots)
- spaceship crashes into the site (there's also a space war, I think)
- nuclear warning systems are basically Disney and the storage sites Disneyland. "Nicky Nuke" is the equivalent of Mickey Mouse.

And then they have The Industrial Scenario. 2000-11991 (this is like three times as long as any of the other reports)

- the area is used as solar farms
- so industry (esp magnesium mining) sets up around the solar farms to take advantage of the cheap electricity
- "For the much more distant future, the whole notion of industrial production may be replaced by concepts not yet available to us." => for example, they haven't anticipated 3D printing, which, if/when it reaches a certain level of sophistication, will do away with the need of a lot of factories as it's much better to download the design for a widget and print it at home than order it
- the magnesium extraction caused some of the magnesium to get contaminated with radioactive waste and be incorporated in metals in 2500, resulting in more stringent controls being reapplied
- in 2900, people start going to mine trans-uranic elements there, because they are no longer produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons, taking about 10% of the trans-uranic elements before they became too expensive to be worth recovering
- this process repeats several times before the year 4,000, using different resources

It's a kind of wacky and random collection of scenarios, none of which seem remotely plausible.
