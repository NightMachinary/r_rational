Maybe 'intern' is more likely than 'secretary'? Some sort of basic, extremely junior, no-access-to-confidential-records type position?

Also, marble is about two-point-seven times as dense as the human body. Either her victims shrink, or they gain extra mass out of nowhere.

They'd have to his pretty hard, but that makes sense. (Incidentally, there will probably be stone organs and stone veins to incredible detail on the inside, I imagine...)

  And I'm planning in the beginning of the story the brother is blindfolded and held at gunpoint in a public place, leading to her being forced to stone the criminal holding him hostage.

How does she fail to stone the people behind the criminal? Or, if everyone else is being kept out of the area, how does she get close enough to stone him without also letting her brother know that she is there at the time?
