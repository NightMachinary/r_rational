The range would be as far as she could make out another person's eyes without it being blurry.

If the victim's vision is short-sighted for example and she is up close, the power would only be half as effective, and the victim would either be extremely paralysed or more likely the outer skin would be turned to stone, but the brain and internals would turn into a magma-like mess.

EDIT: Here's some more information on the power

#+begin_quote

  - To turn people to stone both subjects must have direct eye-contact with eachother. Transparent material like windows or glass also works as long as both subjects can see eachothers eyeballs. An army of 100 could be stoned as long as they're all looking at the eyeballs.
  - If the subject or user covers one eye closed, the subject is still stoned
  - The power works by just transforming the subjects atoms into "stone atoms"
  - Sunglasses don't work against it. The range of the power depends on the distance the subject and user can see eachother's eyeballs - if both have 20/20 vision it'll be further than if both are myopic.
  - Blind subjects aren't affected. Subjects with extremely blurred vision aren't affected until up close. Although some subjects with blurred vision, who can still see the eyeball - will turn half to stone and their skin will become hard and rock-like. The results are varied, gruesome and unpredictable
  - Camera and screen footage of the eyes will not stone the subject
  - No strenuous staring is needed
  - The power affects humans, animals and all creatures with eyes and sentience, so not bacteria.
  - The speed of the power is instant, maybe a millisecond, although it might take a second for the stone form to replace the skin.
  - Mirrors are deadly, and so the eyes must be protected with some opaque material. Although, the power can be controlled with training, and then is able to be switched on or off at will. Because of the shifting molecules - water reflections will not usually stone the user, but I wouldn't risk it.
  - Clothes are stoned too with the subject, and carried items that are smaller than the subject's size - swords, handbags are stoned. But not if the subject is just touching an object. If the subject is carrying another live being like a dog or baby, they are not stoned unless they are looking at the eyeballs too.
  - Once you're stoned you can't be un-stoned. The stone material is always the same standard rock.
  - When the power is activated, the eye may glimmer a little but is not very noticable
  - Often when the subject is stoned, they collapse to the ground as their balance isn't controlled. All of their internals are also turned to stone.
  - If the eyeballs are camoflagued/hidden or painted into a background, the subject must still recognise the individual eyeball itself to be stoned.
  - If the subject is pregnant, the baby will also be turned to stone
  - Once the eye is blinded - (by laser, looking at the sun) the power is deactivated. A successful operation to regain sight will restore the power
  - Eye operations like laser eye surgery present no affect on the power
  - Theoretically the eyeball could be experimented on to reproduce its effects, though little is known about this
  - The eyeballs must be connected to the user to work. It is possible for the eyeball to be transplanted to another user, but modern surgery is not there yet.
