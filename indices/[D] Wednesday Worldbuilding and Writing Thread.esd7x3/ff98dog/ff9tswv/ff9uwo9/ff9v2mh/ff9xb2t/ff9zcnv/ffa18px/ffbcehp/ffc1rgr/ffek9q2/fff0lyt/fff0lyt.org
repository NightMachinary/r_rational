Ok, I've decided to change it so that they gain mass, as the marble would be naturally heavier. And I haven't thought about the stoned internals but that's a good idea

I think I would just have the criminal and the brother be alone on a high platform like a bridge or a balcony, and at first the criminal would pretend to be a jumper but instead pulls a gun on him as he gets near him. So there would be a panicked crowd at the bottom - and maybe the criminal forces everyone to stay put?

The problem would be getting the criminal's attention and forcing him to look at her eye, without bringing attention to herself - so I was thinking she always carries a laser-pointer in her pocket (because PTSD of stoning her father and toying with blinding herself). So she could discreetly shine it in his eye so he gets distracted and looks down? It's a big stretch. The key point of the scene is that she is forced to stone a criminal in a public place in order to save her brother.
