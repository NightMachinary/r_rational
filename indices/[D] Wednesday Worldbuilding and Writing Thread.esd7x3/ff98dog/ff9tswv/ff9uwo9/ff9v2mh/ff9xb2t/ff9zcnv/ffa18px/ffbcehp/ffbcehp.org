Her brother has contacts in the police force. One way for her to find out about crimes is by taking on some minor (possibly secretarial?) role in the station and just keeping her (unstoning) eye and ears open.

Better yet, she can take on a minor role in the court system, and (mostly) limit herself to criminals who slip away from a Guilty verdict on a technicality.

You're going to have to define exactly what is meant by 'standard rock'. Something igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic? Granite, gneiss, quartz, marble? Chalk, salt?

...diamond?

It's more or less a case of "pick one". But bear in mind that almost all rocks are way heavier than the original people were - there may be recently-stoned people dropping through (weak) floors or out of trees or similar. (And if it was a TV show there would inevitably be one guy, at some point, who got stoned just /as/ he was walking past a window so that he could dramatically fall out the building in front of everyone and /suddenly/ the police are /super/ interested in the question of who was in that building at ten minutes past four on Tuesday afternoon).
