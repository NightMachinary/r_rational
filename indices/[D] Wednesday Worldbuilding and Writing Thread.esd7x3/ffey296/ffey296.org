If you had to guess, what elements of reality are fictional? Like, if someone convincingly demonstrated they were an isekai protagonist or similar, what do you think the "real" world is like?

My guess would have to be the technology level. I'm hardly the first person to observe that our world has gotten pretty cyberpunk lately, so we could easily be in a sci-fi story. If we were fantasy, we would have to be a fantasy world where math controls the underlying structure of reality - one of those "mutually fictional" deals I guess. Or an urban fantasy where I'm not privy to any of the differences because it's all kept secret (which I guess includes a lot of action films, like Terminator), but that's a little boring.
