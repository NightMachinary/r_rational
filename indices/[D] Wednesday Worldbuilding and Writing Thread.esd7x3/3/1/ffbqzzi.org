I personally think you're a couple decades too late. Here's my best shot:

Make your own broadcast network and pick up some good shows. Imagine picking up Seinfeld, Friends, Big Bang Theory, NCIS, SVU, etc. Basically you would have the hardest part of the TV industry solved for a long time. Use the captive media to create or capture a worldwide political movement. Make anti-modernity a feature. Invest in major tech companies and use mergers to kill AI research. I still don't think it would work because of China.

Option II: Knowing about Crispr, push research that will make us dumber. Create a virus that would literally dumb down humanity Oryx and Crake style.

Option III: Aim for taking over Russia. Start nuclear war.

Option IV: Option II, but go smarter instead of dumber. Perhaps more intelligent us will be more trepidatious. Doubtful.
