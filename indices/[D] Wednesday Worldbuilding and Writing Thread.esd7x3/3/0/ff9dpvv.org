Well, the most definite solution without ethics is a nuclear world war. Kill all progress and advanced technology.

Utilize your assets to create an enclave, possibly several, and institute a philosophy / religious doctrine to avoid AI development.

Without this drastic an action, I see two possibilities.

Push Human uploading as much as possible, as an alternate to any problem you might want to solve with an AGI. Digital Humans will still be bound by familiar thought patterns.

You need to create an alternate AI you have to trust with the sole goal to kill any competitors.

Any other action will delay development. By 2040 computation will be developed enough for an independent actor without aide to develop an AGI.
