Reasons why he did it.

"The unopened cro magnon man was stupid and insane, but the one treated by trepanning had a generally higher standard of health. I knew this from my occult studies. The mental ailments flowed out of the skull, and into the spirit-world, leaving me with a complete, unfettered body. "

Since what studies I have seen indicate they have larger brains, or similarly sized brains, and the spirit world doesn't exist, this is unscientific. His motives, whatever they were, were poor, and not a good guide to how to act.

  In the story, trepanning is a metaphor (which I'm not claiming is rational!) for lobotomies and mental illness at the same time so maybe from a writers perspective, this is a ... fictional/logical story.

You're not really making an argument for it being rational.

For the recent superman story say, I can prove it's rational easily enough. "Lex Luther has consulted the latest science and statistics and come to the conclusion that Superman is a threat, he has rational goals and motives." I compare stuff in the story to the criteria by which we define rationalist fiction.

If you say something like "My story is rational because trepanning is a metaphor for lobotomies and mental illness." That's not an argument because you're not talking about anything that defines rationality. You might as well say "My story is rational because it's a story." Unless you can make an argument which shows how your story is rational based on what we see as rational fiction and elements in your story we won't think it's rational.

  I see my strongest relation to rationalist fic from deconstruction.

I don't see much deconstruction in your story nor am I sure what you are deconstructing.
