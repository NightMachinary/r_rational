Okay, so I wanted to listen to a bunch of full albums twice back to back using both headphones, but after I narrowed down my selection of music I wanted to use, I realized that it'd take a lot longer than I was willing to devote to the experiment, so I just picked a few specific individual songs. I listened to each of them once with the ZX110s, once with the Momentums, then once switching between them every 30 or so seconds.

Here's a list of all of them, in case you care to judge the quality of the test material I used.

I also listened to a bit of symphonic/orchestral stuff:

And I did some reading - I couldn't find anything official for some reason, but on Newegg the Momentums are listed as having 50mm drivers. The ZX110s have 30mm drivers.

So right off the bat, the ZX110s don't have much sub bass rumble for most songs even when they're cranked all the way up, and they're not quite as loud (though my iPod (7th Gen Nano - not the best audio processing of any iPod ever made but definitely better than most smartphones) has enough volume that I can just turn it up a few extra clicks and make up the difference in perceived volume). Also, being on-ears, the ZX110s don't have very good passive sound isolation and they're not the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They're not terribly uncomfortable, but they're on-ears.

On the other hand, I was quite mistaken about the Momentums' mids. Now that I'm paying attention to it, their sound signature is noticeably v-shaped - it's not extreme, but it's noticeable.

My main headphones just before the Momentums were Skullcandy Aviators (which I'm going to assume had an exaggerated v-shaped sound signature because, y'know, people who listen to top 40 crap are the target demographic for headphones like that, and that demographic thinks an exaggerated v-shaped sound sounds good). And for two of the 5 years I had the Momentums, I also owned the in-ear version of the Momentums (I used them for working out until one of the buds just stopped producing sound, just like almost every other in-ear I've ever owned in my life), and those in-ears had an /unquestionably/ v-shaped sound. The little Sony in-ears sounded very similar to the Momentum in-ears.

So it seems that the mids in the Momentums /felt/ more pronounced in relation to what I'd used recently, but weren't /actually/ more pronounced. I'm pretty sure these ZX110s are slightly anti-v-shaped. Juxtaposing those contrasting sound signatures against each other initially made it feel like the ZX110s had boomy exaggerated mids, but after getting used to it and directly comparing it I'm actually preferring the overall sound of the ZX110s. They have a relatively flat-ish response that errs on the side of warm, and I'm totally cool with a bit less treble because that just means I can crank up the volume (probably a lot higher than I ought to) without it being painful.

So I was mistaken in my assertions that "it'd be almost impossible to tell the difference if you did the Coke/Pepsi challenge with these headphones" and that the ZX110s are "the second-best sounding headphones I've ever used," but I /do/ think the ZX110s have sound quality comparable to headphones from popular brands in the $100 to $200 range (which may say more about popular headphones than it says about the ZX110s - after all, Beats are in the $300 to $400 range and they sound like $50 to $100 headphones but with added bass). I'd bet they sound better than the stupid Apple AirPods that teenagers mistakenly believe are expensive status symbols at a $150 price point.

I don't know what my conclusions are, here. The Momentums sound almost unnatural switching back and forth with the ZX110s; mids really make a difference in the fullness of the sound. When I play around with the volume to get them as close to the same level as I can, they really /do/ sound very similar - except the ZX110s have /just a touch/ less low bass and /just a touch/ less sparkle, and the Momentums have a distinct lack of fullness. I feel like the ZX110s would bump up from "pretty great" to "legitimately awesome" if the driver were bigger and if they were over-ear instead of on-ear. Your 7506s have a 50mm driver, and they're over-ears. You obviously already know Sony is capable of making good headphones, otherwise you wouldn't have the MDR-7506s. Is it really that crazy to think the MDR-ZX110s could be surprisingly good? Even better than other brands sold at 10 times the price?

At the very least, these cheap Sonys have shown me that I need to be paying more attention to looking for a flatter frequency response when it comes time to replacing the Sennheisers for real.
