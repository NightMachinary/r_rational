I think schedules and deadlines are one of the things that cause burnout for me most often. I treat writing like a job, but it's a job where I can take mental health days, or where I can start up new projects that are particularly tickling my fancy, and where I'm as minimally beholden to grinding through a lack of desire as I can be. I think what happens a lot of the time when people get burnout is that they get into this cycle of not wanting to do the project, then doing it anyway, which just leads to more and worse bad feeling toward the project. You can, to some extent, simply grind things out, but that doesn't fix the problem, it just makes it worse. Especially with serial authors, not getting at the root of the problem just means that the problem gets worse and worse.
