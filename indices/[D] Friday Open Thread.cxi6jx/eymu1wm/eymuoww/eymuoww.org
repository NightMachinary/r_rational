I have some writing experience myself. The only way to avoid burnout (in my experience) is to never stop writing. Make it a habit and set a minimum period of time for writing. Clock in and clock out at the same time every day. Never finish a project without having started another. Never end on finishing a chapter without having begun the next one.
