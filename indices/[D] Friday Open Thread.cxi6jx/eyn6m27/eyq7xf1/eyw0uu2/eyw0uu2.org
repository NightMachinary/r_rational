I read your comment soon after you posted it, and I decided to take some time to run the experiment. It's taken time because I wanted to listen to a lot of music, and doing that with the messed-up Sennheisers was inconvenient owing to having to hold the right ear cup onto my head to maintain the seal.

I already know most of what I'm going to say. I'll type up the response in a few hours, but right now I have to prepare and then eat breakfast, then go outside and do farmer's carries / loaded carries for an hour (I'm doing a sort of HIIT-like thing where I alternate between the loaded carry and brisk walking).
