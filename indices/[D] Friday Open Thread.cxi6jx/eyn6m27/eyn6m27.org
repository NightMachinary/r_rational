Am I just really really stupid?

About five and a half years ago, I got my first pair of legitimately legit headphones, Sennheiser Momentum (rebranded sometime in the last two or three years as Sennheiser HD1). The HD1 is currently like $199. When I got them on sale back in the day, they were $300 after $50 off. They're over-ears. Definitively the best headphones I've ever owned.

About 2 years later I got the Momentum In-Ears, for like $150 or $200, can't remember. The in-ears crapped out after just under 2 years when one of the buds stopped working, just like most buds I've ever owned of any brand (I've had lots of cheap brands of buds, including Skull Candy - I've had several expensive brands of buds, including Shure and Bose and Sennheiser). This might be a case of me mistreating literally every set of buds I've ever owned, so whatever.

I've previously owned over-ears from Bose and Skull Candy in the $150 to $200 range.

The pleather ear cups of my Momentums developed a gargantuan rip on the right ear cup about 2 or 3 months ago, when I started incorporating Farmer's Walks / Farmer's Carries / Loaded Carries into my workout routine (basically just pick up a set of heavy dumbbells and start walking - problem is that I did it outside in +90 degree weather). I've looked on Newegg and found "Momentum 1" replacement cups for like eight dollars, but idk if they'll fit and they're fabric instead of pleather.

So I got some eight-dollar Sony earbuds when my over-ears crapped out. They're legitimately 95% as good as the $150 Sennheiser buds. I was sincerely shocked at the sound quality of them.

One of my four cats, the oldest at 8-years-old by name of Venus, is very skittish. She was sitting on my lap today and got spooked, and once she's been spooked she's unwilling to be calmed down, so she stuck one of her claws into my left testicle and I was like "OH MY GOD FINE GET OFF ME THEN" and she jumped out of my lap and ripped my earbuds out of my ears and they smashed onto the floor. Once I finished feeling sorry for my testiculars and picked my headphones back up, I noticed the left earbud was broken in half with nothing but wires holding it together. It worked, but there's no way that would work with lifting weights or doing outdoor cardio.

So I went out and got some $15-dollar Sony MDR-ZX110s for fifteen dollars. */FIFTEEN DOLLARS./* They're about 3% better than the Sony earbuds that were almost as good as the $150 Sennheiser buds, and they're at least 87% as good as the $200-$350 Sennheiser over-ears. These fifteen-dollar headphones are better sounding than the normal-priced Bose headphones I've owned. In the process of choosing every set of headphones I've ever owned, I've demoed at least three exceptionally-well-known brands. These are definitely the second-best sounding headphones I've ever used. $15 bucks.

Is audiophile bullshit just bullshit? Like, I definitely can clearly and distinctly tell the difference between these new $15 dollar headphones and the ~$300 dollar headphones I've been using for the last 5 years, but it's mostly just a difference of slightly less treble and slightly more mids in the cheap ones. It's such a negligible difference that it'd be almost impossible to tell the difference if you did the Coke/Pepsi challenge with these headphones.

I've heard about brands like Audio Technica and AKG that have lots of options in the $50 to $100 range. Sony has several options in that range as well that are supposedly extremely good.

I've been thinking about the Bowers and Wilkins P7s for over 5 years. Like, I've been thinking all this time that once my Sennheisers finally crapped out (and let me be clear, these things would have at least 5 years of live left in them if I hadn't sweat all over them) that the B&Ws would be the next set of high-end cans I went for.

Has anyone here at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] had enough experience with high-end audio to tell me whether or not I should start saving up for the P7s versus getting an equivalent under-the-radar brand for a fraction of the price?
