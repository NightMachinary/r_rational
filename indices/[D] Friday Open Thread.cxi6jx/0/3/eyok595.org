Picture a large mob of angry people. They're all standing in a stadium, shouting at each other, screaming insults and laughing. Behind you is a guillotine, on your left is a cart already half full with severed heads and decapitated bodies. In your shaking hands, you're holding a paper. As the crowd falls silent, you have to read what is written on the paper aloud. Your survival will depend on the reaction of the crowd. People are staring at you, some of them expectantly, some of them with boredom, some of them with a piercing fury that already sees you lying on the chopping block. You start reading.

(note that this doesn't mean you have to censor yourself in terms of themes and story; just be really really careful not to give too much ammunition to people looking to take you down; Wildbow is a pretty good example to follow, and he still gets tons of hatemail, I'm told)
