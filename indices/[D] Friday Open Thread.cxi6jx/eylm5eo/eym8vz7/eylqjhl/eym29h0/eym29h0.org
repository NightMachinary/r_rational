Beating the crowd or person into submission through name calling, the questioning of their intelligence and salt.

In all seriousness there's the option of looking at what people comment, filtering out the noise and finding those with merit and then addressing them through the story. Maybe not the next chapter but at some point in the story.

Basically a silent author who watches the fire but takes notes.
