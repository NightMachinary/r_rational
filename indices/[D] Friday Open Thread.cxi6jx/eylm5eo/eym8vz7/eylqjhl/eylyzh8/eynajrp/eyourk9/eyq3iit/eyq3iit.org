I'd never even imagined HPMOR being on the radar of larger communities much less that it would be highly rated as awful. I would expect the common complaints like: "they don't act like kids" "the setting is totally different" but not that it would be infamous. I guess that's what I get for living in this echo chamber/subreddit.

Do you recall any specific examples of those threads? I'm intrigued.
