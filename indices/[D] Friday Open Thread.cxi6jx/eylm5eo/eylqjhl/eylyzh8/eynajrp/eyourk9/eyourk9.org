Every time there's a discussion/recommendation thread among the lines of 'What's the most awful popular fic?' (or similar) on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]], HPMOR is absolutely guaranteed to be the top pick, followed by dozens of comments congratulating themselves for how humble and mature they are for not falling for a 'cringe-worthy Rick and Morty--level wish-fulfillment story for loser neckbeards', deriding the rational fiction as an embodiment of [[/r/iamtoosmart][r/iamtoosmart]], and ocassionally calling EY a crackpot cult leader. To be fair, it's pretty much contained in various Harry Potter-related communities; on other forums, you'll sometimes see snarky remarks out of context, but no straight-out witch hunting.
