My daily drivers are Audeze iSINE 20s ($600 MSRP). Audiophile bullshit is mostly bullshit. A lot of it is hobbyist enthusiasm and diminishing returns.

Lower quality headphones usually sound a little muddier to me but for casual day to day use it really doesn't matter because there's so much ambient noise anyway.

Have you tried the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x? You can find them on sale or used for under $100.

Re: P7s, I don't know, what do you want? If you're reasonably happy with your Sony's, I can promise you that spending another $200 won't bring you to a totally new level of happiness. But if you can afford it, why not?
