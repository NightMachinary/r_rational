It could be an issue of the fact that I've mostly stopped spending my free time listening to music in the last few years. Like, in middle school and high school I'd go to bed an hour early every single night on purpose so I could lie there for three or four hours listening to multiple full albums in a row, sometimes relistening to a newly acquired album immediately after the first listen. But for at least the past five years, 95% of the time I've spent listening to music has been during workouts and the other 5% has been spending a few hours once a month going down the rabbit hole of clicking songs in the sidebar recommendations on YouTube looking for new songs to add to the workout playlist.

Most of the time I don't even know the names of the songs I'm listening to or the artist the song is by. It's just a bunch of random dubstep and trap and electro house and whatever other techno. That could be the reason I'm not hearing much of a difference, I almost exclusively listen to the musical equivalent of junk food.

But then it could also be that these super cheap headphones really /do/ sound just as good as decent-quality midrange headphones. I can definitely tell that the sound is just a little muddier and less clear than what I've gotten used to with the Sennheisers, just like the $8 dollar in-ears were definitely a little thinner than the Sennheiser in-ears, but it really doesn't sound like a huge difference in quality, it sounds like a balancing/EQ difference. And the Momentums don't have a perfectly flat sound signature as it is, they have more pronounced mids, just like these Sonys.

So that's two possible confounding variables, a similar sound signature combined with listening to nothing but techno.
