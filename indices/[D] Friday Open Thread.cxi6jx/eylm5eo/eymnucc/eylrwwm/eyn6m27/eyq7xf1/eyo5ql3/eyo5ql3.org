Well, I mostly buy midrange and the differences between really cheap headphones and things like Senheissers are night and day for me. It may just be that these differences don't influence your experience as much as they do for me or some others who splurge.

And while I can't speak personally I do know many think extremely expensive headphones quickly start to hit diminishing returns so keep that in mind when buying $300+.
