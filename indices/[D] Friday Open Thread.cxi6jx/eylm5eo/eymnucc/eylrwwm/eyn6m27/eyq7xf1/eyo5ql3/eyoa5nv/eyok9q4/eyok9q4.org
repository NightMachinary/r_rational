It would appear that the P7 has been discontinued and replaced by the PX and the P9.

The PX is wireless so that's out of the question because wireless is unacceptable. The P9 is $900 whereas the P7 was $400. [[https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816KTZYOOaL._SL1500_.jpg][Neither of them is anywhere near as sexy as the P7.]] That was the main selling point of the P7s for me, they're just attractive as all hell. I'm kinda bummed out about that. I got the Momentums back in the day because they were a little bit less expensive than the P7s. I should've got the P7s when I had the chance.
