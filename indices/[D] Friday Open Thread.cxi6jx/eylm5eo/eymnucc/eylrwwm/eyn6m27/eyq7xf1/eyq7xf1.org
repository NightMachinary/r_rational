As someone who listens to primarily classical music I find it's worth it to buy decent quality headphones/in-ears. There are a lot of caveats and things to keep in mind when you're looking into audio stuff.

The first is to have a very strong understanding of precisely what you actually need and are looking for. For listening to random music while you're exercising, the noise from your movement is probably going to prevent you from noticing a lot of fine detail, and you finding that $15 in-ears are nearly as good as $150 headphones isn't that surprising. In general, you want to avoid paying for any feature that you don't actually need, or that doesn't have a noticeable effect.

Regarding "well-known brands," when choosing consumer audio stuff (professional is a little different) the brand is not very important, and known brands can even have a premium that isn't justified by the product's quality. You have to look at each individual product model & how it performs & read reviews by people that know what they're talking about, and importantly, that actually do the tests with a decent methodology. And even then, at the end of the day the conclusion is going to be subjective.

I will say, looking at the brands you specifically mention having owned, they are all ones I personally would avoid in general (Shure, Bose, Skullcandy, even Sennheiser) due to either being low quality, overpriced or some other reason. If you read around (for example in [[https://www.head-fi.org/forums/][head-fi forums]]) you generally get an idea that there are a few standout models of headphones, IEMs etc that everything else is judged by. For example, my current set of headphones is the Sony MDR-7506 which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6#MDR-7506][was introduced in 1991]] and is still on the market today. Audio is particularly a case where "new" does not necessarily mean "better."

In the IEM case when I was looking for a "balanced" sound type set the standard for comparison was Fischer Audio-DBA-02, a brand which you may not be familiar with. I ended up going with the Brainwavz B2 which is essentially the same driver but slightly tweaked to have a stronger bass. The only reason I'm not still using them is that the cable deteriorated (became stiff & tended to break) so much that it wasn't really feasible to continue repairing it. Partly for that reason I replaced them with the Audio Technica ATH-IM02 which is honestly probably slightly worse sound quality despite being over double the price (although it could likely become better if I bought a specialised amplifier) but have detachable/replaceable cables & substantially better build quality.

Your use case is that you're using the to listen while exercising. This has unique needs (as you note - your Sennheisers are wearing out due to this.) For example, you might think about - can you easily replace the ear contact padding once it gets worn? How's the weight/comfort? Sound quality itself is just one of many concerns you might have, and sometimes it's not the most important. You mention you like the look of the P7s - this is a legitimate thing to keep in mind as a consideration.

I could see two different strategies you could go for. You could get the best "value" headphones spending as little as possible and just expect to replace them fairly often as they wear out. This would likely be perfectly fine as you can usually find sound quality that's almost as good as the high end (especially when being driven by a smartphone & not in a quiet environment) for much, much cheaper. Alternatively, you could go for a higher end set that you intend to keep for longer, but you do have to make sure that it actually has the features it needs & you have the knowledge you need to be able to make it last. Up to you what you feel is going to be better.

Regardless, doing research pays off heavily in this area. Not only product research, but understanding what actually matters, how to translate your own preferences into the terms reviewers use, how to read reviews properly, and importantly, learning which reviews to actually pay attention to in the first place. People's opinion of audio equipment is heavily influenced by what they've been exposed to before and even people who know exactly what they're doing and have a lot of experience have their own subjective preferences. So it's pretty typical to see a lot of positive reviews for even gear which is objectively crap or not worth the price compared to other options.

If you don't want to do research, it's going to be more difficult to get good value and you might have to accept paying more. Still apply a skeptical mindset of course and you should still ask yourself exactly what it is you're looking for, but if spending a few hundred dollars more for something you use a lot is less of an investment than the time and effort of learning about your options then that could be the better choice. For someone with a full-time, decently paid job that's probably going to be the case, unless you enjoy the process of learning about & understanding these things for itself in addition to its utility to you.
