I'm far from a Star Trek expert, but here's what I remember off-hand:

1) Genetic augmentation is illegal, and a character known as Khan is persecuted because of it. Not only is augmentation known to work but they live in a post-scarcity society, so there's no threat or need for resource wars.

2) AI research is strongly discouraged, with only one Android character in the show, Data, who is more obsessed with becoming human than anything else.

3) Cyborgs are hated, with the obvious example of the Borg Collective being portrayed in a negative light.
