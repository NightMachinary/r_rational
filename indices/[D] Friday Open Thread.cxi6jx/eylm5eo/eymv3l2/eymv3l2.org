Assuming you're dealing with a mob organized around a few or one persons, you can always counterattack. It is with hilarious regularity that someone blasting another for saying an un-PC thing will have very un-PC things themselves buried in their twitter history or whatnot.

While this doesn't directly eliminate the controversy, it poisons the well against that particular campaign against you and makes it likely your attacker will shut up for a while out of embarrassment or panic.

For a conveniently topical use of this technique, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/cxef7r/whats_going_on_with_funimation/eymgifp/][this comment]] or just the thread in general. In short, a voice actor was fired due to allegations of workplace sexual harassment. Old audio tapes of other voice actors doing blooper reels of homophobic/racist/etc jokes contradict the alleged victim's claim that their workplace was strictly professional, which is now being used to cast doubt on her other claims, and especially over the company's reason for firing him.
