I feel like this is close enough to the standard survival scenario on reality-TV that I'd follow the basic algorithm from Man vs Wild or Survivorman.

I'd scout a safe location for a camp, use my knife to build a temporary shelter and a fire, and then set up traps for small game using branches and heavy rocks or nooses and flimsy trees. A bow would be useful for firestarting assuming there's no supply of flint for my steel. I would avoid eating anything brightly colored -- if I'm desperate I'd probably just eat worms to start for protein, since I know they are safe. (Right? Shrug) Water is an easily resource to gather in a rainforest just by tipping leaves. Bugbites would be a big problem so I'd try to stay smoky and rub exposed parts of my body with aromatic oils stripped from plants.

Flooding would happen close to river basins, so if I have a good sense of when they'd start, I'd either head for higher ground and watch for a change in the underbrush so I'd know where the typical flood lines are, or if high ground doesn't seem to exist/I keep hitting rivers as I explore, I'd build a raft from deadwood and vines.

Re: tool making, I'd use my knife to make sharp implements out of wood for daily use and find a rock for keeping the knife sharp. I could probably make a crude adze (sp?) for chopping wood. The fire would help in drying out vines and leathers for material creation.

I have some other ideas about scouting and contacting local tribes, but the idea that I could even survive to make a raft or tan leather hides... It is ambitious, hard work! I'm more likely to focus on basic survival for quite a while that I wouldn't be able to accomplish any higher longer-term goals for a long time like months to years out.
