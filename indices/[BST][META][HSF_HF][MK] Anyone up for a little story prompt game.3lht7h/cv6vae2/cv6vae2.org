You are a refugee fleeing a war-torn country. You fled on foot from your home with whatever you could carry, but in the process of being transported/exploited by human traffickers, you have been stripped of all valuables (electronic devices, cash, jewelry, and other small high-quality items.) You are with your immediate family, along with a small set of rations from your home and whatever items you could conceal from the transporters during their demands of payment (a wristwatch, compass, lighter, pocketknife... and an old flip phone with ~$20 on it that you scrounged together.)

You are penniless and fleeing across the countryside on foot in a foreign land. You have some familiarity with the local language through T.V., but by no means are you fluent. Oh, and the countryside has unexploded land mines and ordinance.
