I would obviously need to direct my immediate efforts to ensuring my survival through sustainable means; sources of nutrients and calories.

Source of water. Find a river. If the house isn't near a river everything will be ten times harder. I would be forced to dig a canal and dam the river to redirect it to the house.

I have a fair amount of food in the cabinets and fridge. I don't know enough to say whether planting any of the fruits or canned goods is advisable, though I would definitely try. I would also be trying to figure out how animal traps work, possibly actively hunting, and foraging for vegetation that doesn't kill me. I would attempt to make a farm, though at the scale of the individual it might be more appropriate to call it a garden. Taking cues from The Martian, I believe I would be cutting up and planting all of the potatoes.

There's a car in the garage, we have a multimeter, an old generator if it's still around, the alternator in the car... I'm not sure what I would be doing with electricity, but possibly an experiment to see if computer electronics worked in a location with different physics, as indicated by the existence of a ringworld. Starting the car would also be a sufficient experiment, given the radio's electronics.

Determining the mechanical impossibility of the setting is not guaranteed. I don't believe we have classical physics textbooks. However, the nature of the scenario is still unbelievable enough to consider it most probably as part of a narrative or simulation.

The car is unsustainable for energy or transport, obviously. It has at most a full tank, but it's always worn down to near-empty before we fill it, so there is very little to depend on there.

I suspect I would be forced to reinvent toolmaking, or I would have to make do without a lot of tools at all. This would be difficult, considering I have no idea how to find or collect ore, no way to cut down trees save a hand saw and a powered... hedge trimmer? Nothing industrial. Depends on the width of the trees. We have weights, though I don't know what they're made of, and I don't want to be melting lead any sooner than I have to. I'm not sure how to get a fire hot enough to melt metals in the first place, even lead.

Let's see... cloth. Going naked is not quite viable. I want to protect the majority of my skin from bugs, wounds from accidents and prey (and predators), whatever dangerous light that sun is giving off, and the weather. I definitely do not want to die from "exposure to the elements," as that is, as I've heard, the most common cause of death in the wilderness, though I'm not sure how it's defined. I would regret not having a lot of tools, books, and other resources that are useless in non-wilderness, non-societal situations. I don't know how to make cloth, and it's probably too time-consuming anyway. Assuming I could catch any animals, I would be saving their skins, and trying to figure out how to tan leather and make clothes that way. Ropes are very doubtful without a lot of clever thinking.

We have a gun, but I'm untrained. I'd have to figure out how much ammunition I could spare for getting myself accustomed with it.

We have quite a lot of paper, and I'd be keeping a lot of notes to organize all of these concerns without a computer.

That's for day-to-day survival. I have no idea how I would be able to approach breaching reality. My first attempts would be attempting to contact whatever audience I may have, as well as brainstorming any other likely explanations. Your stated goal, finding civilization within a hundred years, is about as likely, practically speaking. You're on a fucking ringworld, you have an astronomically lower chance of finding civilization as on an arbitrary planet. I will admit that it depends on the exact population of the ring, but the most you can assume is one society. Going to the substrate of reality is no less insane, considering you have a hundred years (more like forty, as I'm twenty and lifespans are /not/ one hundred years naturally) of at most animal-driven transportation over no roads.
