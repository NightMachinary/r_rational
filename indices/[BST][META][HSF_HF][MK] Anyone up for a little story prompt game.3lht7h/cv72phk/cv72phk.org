You have all the resources in your home, including the building; which you discover yourself alone in, in the middle of a forest at noon.

There's an odd arch from horizon to horizon, and the sun remains in place, occasionally eclipsed; all the signs of being aboard a ringworld or Orbital.

It's plausible that you're the only sapient being on the continent. You likely have something less than a century to make contact with some form of civilization before you die of old age.
