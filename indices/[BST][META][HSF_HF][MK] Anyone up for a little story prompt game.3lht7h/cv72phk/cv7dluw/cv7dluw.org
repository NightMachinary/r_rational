Immediately, I need food, water and such.

I do the normal slow touch food taste etc etc thing to find foods in my environment that I can consume. I gather some earth and lay some seeds from my bug out backpack, along with setting up my water collector. I seek a clearing or make one for use of my solar panels to charge my electronic devices. I use my axe and shovel to set up basic traps in front of my doors and windows so entry isn't easy for invaders and prepare a basic flamethrower device with a candle and a hairspray can and some flammable oil to throw at intruders. I set up my fire extinguisher within easy reach too.

Once all that's done, I do an inventory of my house for food and how long parts will last. I have some emergency rations and some perishable food.

I use my battery powered hand crank radio to see if there's any radio transmissions nearby.

I browse my downloaded copy of wikipedia to see if there's any useful nature survival tips.
