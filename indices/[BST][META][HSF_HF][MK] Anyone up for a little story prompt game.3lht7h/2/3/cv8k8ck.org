I loudly and obviously start doing everything necessary to commit suicide, complete with note. Stop before pulling the metaphorical trigger. Having confirmed that if I am being watched it is by an uncaring being, I start seeing about survival. The water storage unit in the attic should be good for a few hundred litres until I can find fresh water. The fridge has potatoes, plums, onions, squash, courgette, avocado, mustard seed, chillies, garlic, apples, oranges, banana, bell peppers, tomatoes and carrots. If I can't grow something out of all of that then I am a failure at farming. A shame I could not bring the back garden: it had plum and goosberry bushes, tomatoes and courgette as well as good fertiliser and gardening tools. Plus my sun chair, that thing is fantastic. I eat as much of the perishables as I can force myself to consume in the time they have before going off: better to be fat on my belly than rotten and useless.

If all else fails I have my bow, though I am not as good a shot as I once was and the poundage will limit me to small game until I can fashion a better one. I understand the theory, but have never made a bow personally so I expect some failures. If I am lucky the animals will be unused to man and the hunting will be easy. After say 2 years the plum trees will be well situated and I will hopefully have gotten good at shooting things again, so I will go a wandering in search of life signs.

I could... probably make an electricity generating water wheel and get the freezer working again if there is a stream nearby. All it is is wires and magnets. I believe hard drives have one and there is no shortage of wiring in my house. The largest problem would be making it generate current at the right frequency.
