I would get a ball or wad up some clothes and tuck it under my armpit. Then, I would get my belt and use it like a tourniquet and extract the dart. If I don't have a belt, I would get a rope or long piece of fabric, tie it into a loop, insert a stick and spin it until there is an adequate tightness that I start to feel numbness.

Cutting off the blood supply quickly should buy my some time for examination, wound cleaning, and extraction of the poison.

First, I smell the dart. Are there hints of almond? I would think about cyanide. Does it smell sour, like vinegar? I would suspect an acid. Then, I'd examine the wound site. Am I bleeding excessively despite the tourniquet? Is there blistering, redness, swelling or necrosis? Is there a spreading area of numbness? Is it exquisitely tender to palpation?

Next, I'd clean the wound -- the solution to pollution is dilution (preferably with normal saline as an isotonic solution.) A liter of clean water mixed with two table spoons of salt should be adequate. I'd put this mixture into a compressible water bottle and get a sharp needle and puncture the bottle so I have a small hole. With a strong constant pressure on the bottle, I'd empty out an entire liter of the saline solution into the region of the dart entry point.

This is the point where my arm should be cleaned and bandaged. If there is local necrolysis, I'd wash it out again and suspect some spider venom, acid, or chemical. (Fingers crossed that it's not reactive with water!!) If not, I'd worry about a cardio toxin like a beta blocker or digitalis (think Bond in Casino Royale), a neuro paralytic like curare or botulinum, or a neurospasmodic like tetanospasmin. In all of these cases, we're screwed without an AED, IV fluids and an antidote.

If it's a hallucinogenic, we're in the clear.

I'll have a little more time to identify the poison by monitoring my vital signs over the next hour. At that point, I'd take off the tourniquet to restore blood supply and hope I don't die.

I would be able to identify a cholinergic/anticholinergic toxidrome by the "SLUDGE" mnemonic, which I characterize as "fluids coming out of everywhere from all orifices," or the opposing symptom which is goes by the nursery rhyme "hot as a hare, mad as a hatter, dry as a bone and the heart beats alone"

The key will be to stay well hydrated and treat symptoms if they arise. Fevers and infection will be the biggies (I'm SOL with cardiac and respiratory arrest, so I just hope it won't happen.) We should have some combination of Benadryl, aspirin, ibuprofen, iodine, and antiseptic on hand from our medikit to be used as needed.

(If MacGyver did this, I totally want to watch the episode! I'm sure I missed a few things, but that's what I could think of off-hand without a survival book, more extensive gear, or the Internet handy.)
