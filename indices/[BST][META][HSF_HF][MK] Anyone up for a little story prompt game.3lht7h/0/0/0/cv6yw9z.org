But wait, a problem has appeared! A commenter in one of your threads has taken the prompt to the meta-level, meaning that in order to fully participate in the challenge you must summarize what you are doing all over again in the comments. Of course if you do participate the inevitable result is to be trapped forever in an infinite loop of summarization and counter-summarization.

My level one personality's response: Embrace the loop! See how far you can take this before someone gives up or goes insane.

But enough about me, what would YOU do in this original situation?
