You are exploring a remote woodland and have encountered an abandoned cellar. In the process of looking through it, you manage to accidentally set off a spring-loaded dart trap which hits you in your upper non dominant arm.

You think it could have contained a poison or venom of some sort due to the dart tip containing a syringe. The nearest modern medical care is over a week away on foot, or at least 3 days away on bike or horse, the only forms of transportation available to you. You have a common field first aid kit and a number of other assorted items that you were able to carry in your backpack.
