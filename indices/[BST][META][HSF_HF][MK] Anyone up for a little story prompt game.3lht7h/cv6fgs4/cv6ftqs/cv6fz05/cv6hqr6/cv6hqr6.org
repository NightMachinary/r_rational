For somewhere called the rain forest water is surprisingly hard to find. Well water that is safe to drink, there is lots of stagnant water full of things with teeth and fish and things with teeth eating fish.

But mostly it's hot, intensely muggy, difficult to tell direction, full of insects that want to bite you, enormous amounts of noise and very few actually visible animals.
