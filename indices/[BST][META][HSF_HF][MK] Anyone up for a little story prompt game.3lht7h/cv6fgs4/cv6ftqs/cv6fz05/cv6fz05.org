The professional chef's knife is heavy in your hands you admire the long steel blade and the polished wooden grip. You think about the hundreds of hours spent using and sharpening this in your former life as a line cook. It was hot and tough work in that kitchen, but it doesn't compare to how tough this will be. Your blade is all you have in the world know, the only thing to keep you alive this deep in the rainforest, far from civilization, far from safety.

It's going to be a hard trek.
