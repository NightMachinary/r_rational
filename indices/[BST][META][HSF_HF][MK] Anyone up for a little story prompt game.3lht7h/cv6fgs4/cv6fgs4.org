To get this started here's one from me:

You possess a single stainless steel chefs knife with a blade as long as your forearm. That is all.

You are in the middle of the amazon rain forest (the more inaccessible parts of brazil) just three months prior to the heavy raining season when all the flooding happens.

What do you do?
