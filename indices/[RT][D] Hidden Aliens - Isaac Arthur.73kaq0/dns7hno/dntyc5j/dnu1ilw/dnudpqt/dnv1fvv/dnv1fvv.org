Again, I'm not disputing the futility of hiding. In the video, he says that an intelligent race hiding on their home planet is futile, and that a civilization that wishes to hide should create hiding spots elsewhere.

I am specifically arguing against his claim that predators are unlikely. I don't have a strong opinion either way, but the reasoning presented looks weak.
