No. It is about the depth of time. Even if resources are a meaningless concept to advanced civs (Because they are starlifting, and or miniaturizing hard) it would still be trivial to sterilize every planet in the galaxy far faster than life could arise. Or if they only want to kill intelligent life - to leave automated systems in local orbit to kill them when they discover fire. It therefore follows from the fact that we appear to not be dead that noone wants to kill us.
