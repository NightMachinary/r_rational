  While likely, this was not the question. It's more of an excuse for not answering it.

Your question was why he was so quick to dismiss the idea, and the answer is that he does consider it, and concludes that if there are super-predators out there (which he finds unlikely), we're already doomed to die, unless we become more powerful than them by the time they arrive.

  He seems to not be very creative or imaginative. The way he presents ideas ("This is what I would do...") suggests that he can't imagine aliens that are not essentially us. I find his arguments to be unpersuasive.

I saw it as assuming that alien societies not behaving irrationally. Of course, aliens could have a very different view of rational thinking (though successfully evolving intelligence, developing technology, and expanding into space would probably end up limiting the possibilities in some ways). Any potential scenarios you've considered? (Entirely serious--I'm not Isaac Arthur and don't share all his views.)
