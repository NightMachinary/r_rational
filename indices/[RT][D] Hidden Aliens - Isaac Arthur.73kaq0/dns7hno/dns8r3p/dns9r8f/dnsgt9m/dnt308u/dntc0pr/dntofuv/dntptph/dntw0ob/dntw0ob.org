  it assumes civilizations are common enough for those von Neumann-esque machines to take advantage of them effectively
#+end_quote

The idea was that a small capsule could be launched for a thousandth or a millionth of the cost of a large von Neumann probe. Only a very small fraction ever found a civilization, but when they did it paid off millions of times over. Whether or not this is more effective than a traditional von Neumann probe will depend on whether the ability to immediately relaunch makes up for the additional cost of the launch.
