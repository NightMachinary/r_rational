He has a pretty good reason for doing so. If they exist, they know we're here already and are coming for us regardless of our actions so it makes the most sense from a survival standpoint to expand and advance as rapidly as possible in order to survive their attack.

Likewise, if you're a predator race or just one that's supremely paranoid, the best way to prevent hostile (or any) intelligent life from challenging you is to spread out over the galaxy asap and prevent them from evolving in the firdt place---a process that would only take a few million years---an eyeblink in the history of the galaxy. The fact that we're here at all suggests that none exist or that we are so unlucky to have evolved and advanced just in time to be destroyed by this fledgling predator species.
