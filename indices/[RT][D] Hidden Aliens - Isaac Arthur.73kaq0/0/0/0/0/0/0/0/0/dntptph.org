Hmm, an interesting possibility (naturally; Brin is quite the accomplished SF writer). I personally find that scenario unlikely, as even when setting aside why they would put so much effort into subverting alien civilizations when there are probably far easier means of expansion (but as you said, we can't assume alien priorities), it assumes civilizations are common enough for those von Neumann-esque machines to take advantage of them effectively. But a good example nonetheless.
