  I saw it as assuming that alien societies not behaving irrationally.

I don't see it that way. First off, individuals may act rationally while collectives of rational individuals behave irrationally. This happens all the time. (Consider large companies that are heavily invested in lawsuits against themselves.)

Second, we just don't know the rules. You can't make rational decisions or draw rational conclusions without all the information.

  Any potential scenarios you've considered?
#+end_quote

I've actually been holding off on proposing scenarios. The scale is almost too enormous to contemplate: a galaxy's worth of stars and planets over billions of years. However, perhaps we could discuss some of the scenarios in David Brin's /Existence/.

In this scenario, imagine you're some sort of AI (as organic life can't exist on the necessary scope). Since information is information is information, and interstellar travel is inefficient, only communication matters. So you use all available resources to send the smallest possible packets of yourself to other worlds, all von Neumann-like. And since you're an immortal AI you're not going to waste time sending the infrastructure necessary to get a space industry off the ground. Instead, being patient, you just wait for intelligent life to evolve, and piggy-back off of it. You subvert the whole civilization, getting it to do what you want until you're in a position to use all available resources to send copies of yourself to other worlds.

This type of predator doesn't care about annihilating organic civilizations. In fact, they depend upon them. But it's still a predator anyways.
