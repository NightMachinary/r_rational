It is not a matter of creativity, it is a matter of the proper appreciation of time spans. Earth has had biologically generated oxygen for 2.4 billion years. This means that earth has been a visibly life-bearing planet for at least that length of time. Therefore, any aliens in our galaxy who have a priority of being the only intelligent beings in our galaxy have had 2.4 billion years to take care of the matter before we even showed up. For any aliens to show up with that mission statement at the precise moment where we also inhabit the planet would require them to have reached the technological capability of starflight with an utterly implausible timing, absent any causative factors.

So, the fact that we exist prove no such aliens exist.

/selectively/ genocidal aliens could exist. I mean, there is no anthropic argument against the existence of precursors who were worried about paper-clippers and other "Tile over the universe" agents arising and, oh, leave a death-star in orbit around every life bearing planet in the galaxy just in case. (The Moon is no Moon! Mwhaahaahaaaaa!) But we cant hide from such theoretical entities - we would already be unknowingly living our lives in the gunsights of their contingency planning.

And the omnicidal villains of popular sci-fi? Nope. Cannot exist, logical impossibility
