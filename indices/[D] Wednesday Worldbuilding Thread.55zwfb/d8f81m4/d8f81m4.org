I am slowly planning a Naruto fic which will retain the vast majority of canon elements such as grossly superhuman ninjas, talking and powerful summons, magical techniques like Henge, etc.

One of the big things I'm having trouble with is making the economics of the world work with powerful chakra. Having chakra available eliminates a ton of scarcity that can lead to wars, so what is there left to fight on?

Some of my thoughts from my planning document, pasted into reddit:

b. What resources do people fight over in real life?

i. Fertile land, strategically important places, places of religious significance, good trading areas, valuable deposits/ores

ii. What does chakra make less/more important?

Less: Energy, though limited by # of ninja and their strength, unwillingness of ninja to serve as generators

Less: Fertile land, to some degreechakra can create water, some types of earth, but basically no one can control the quality/composition of the earth produced

Less: Valuable trading areas, possibly.

To answer this, we need to consider the impact of sealing and ninja speed on trade. If seals can hold very large quantities, are relatively inexpensive, and can be sealed in each other, then trade is radically different because massive quantities of goods can be carried by few people. If sealing is limited by skill, and only high level ninja can or know how to make usful transporation/storage seals, trade is not radically affected.

More important: Metal ores for weapons-few people in the series can create metals, which can be tied to chakra creating only the primordial elements, not human created objects. Rinnegan black receivers are an exception, but those dissapear after the creator's death, and very few people have or can ever obtain/use a Rinnegan.

Not sure: Strategically important territories change-what does this mean in the context of ninja warfare?

What should Naruto infrastructure be like?

a. Not easily destroyed by a single jutsu, so it can't be near a river that often floods, unstable land, sinkholes, earthquake prone territory, avalanche prone mountains, etc.

b. Resilient infrastructure-->nice way to limit the capital investment of ninja villages and concentrate them into civilian locations

i. So here's a nice paradox: ninja provide power, water for crops, medical miracles, invaluable building assistanceBUT:

1. they live in ninja villages because ninja villages are secretive about techniques and want to keep them there.

2. civilian locations don't want ninja too much because that makes them an acceptable target for warfare by Naruto-verse standards

ii. Resulting situation:

1. Ninja villages and civilian villages are on similar tech levelsaustere but modern, constrained by threat of war for the former (ninja villages) and lack of cheap energy and security for the latter (civilian villages.)

2. Civilian villages have settled into an equilibrium where they hire ninjas for security, contract them for power generation, farm assistance, building assistance, hazardous work in general, and occasional warfare. D-ranbks are often those kinds of missions: easy for ninja, difficult for civilians.

3. BUT what do civilian villages actually provide? Well, they export entertainment/culture, they're often of religious significance (temples are generally never located in ninja centers because ninshu=/ninjustu), conventional trade because sealing is super difficult,
