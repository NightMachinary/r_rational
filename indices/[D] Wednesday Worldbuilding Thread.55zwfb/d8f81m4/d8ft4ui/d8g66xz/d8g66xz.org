I will post a longer reply when I have a computer, but first, thanks for the advice. I've thought about most, but not all, the questions you've listed, and your fic and quest are definitely on my mind in planning stage.

I'm trying to preserve Naruto canon more than you did, I think, though there are some AU changes I will probably make. I will probably make chakra created constructs permanent, partially because I think it makes the setting very different from real life in an interesting way. In canon it seems like chakra created water dissapears, but wood doesn't, so it's a little inconsistent.

I'm still thinking about ninja talent/power distribution. I'll probably end with roughly canon levels of power: S class are an order of magnitude (at least) above skilled Jounin (Kakashi and Gai transition to S so it muddles a bit), Jounin can take on many Chunin, and Chunin can take on multiple Genin. Though there are exceptions and complications: some S class are area of effect focused, like Deidara, Onoki, Nagato, Sannin with boss summons, some S class fall at the other end-- they're hero killers like Itachi, Minato, Raikage, arguably Sasuke. So there's lots of interesting combat to play around with even within the broad confines of rough 'power/abillity tiers'.

Ninja numbers will be canon, roughly, though not as many as the Shinobi World War arc implied. Admittedly, the World War arc had TONS of fodder ninja dying left and right, so maybe I just need to drastically revise my estimates of Genin proportion up.

I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of Naruto and Sasuke. I want to keep the conflicting ideals of the original but without reducing either to caricature. There's probably gonna be lots of allusions to Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke in my fix xD
