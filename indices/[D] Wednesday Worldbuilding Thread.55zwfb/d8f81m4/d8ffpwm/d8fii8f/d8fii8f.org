I'm interested in exploring summons more, but I prefer having them in their own dimensions, or at least in very far off places. Weird and fun wildlife still exists in Elemental Nations, like the giant bears in the Forest of Death, but they're not a big danger. I have to think about summons a bit more, that's true.
