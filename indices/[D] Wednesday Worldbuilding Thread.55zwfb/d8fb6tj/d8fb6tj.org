I'm surprised no one has written a rational fic of Young Wizards, since it's a story all about fixing problems with the universe and fighting against death. As such, here is my take on the setting that will hopefully lead to someone writing a good story. Keep in mind that I've only read up to A Wizard's Dilemma so there may be some details I don't know yet, but I'm going to focus on the basic premise of the series.

A wizard is, of course, someone who has taken the Wizard's Oath and has been taught how to reprogram reality using the Speech. Performing wizardry requires energy, which is gathered and allocated by wizards, so spells cannot be cast with impunity unless you're being subsidized. Outside of spells, the Speech can be used to communicate with anything that has a name including inanimate objects or the pieces of something larger, though anything other than sentient life tends to be content with their existence and disinterested in thinking rationally.

Every wizard possesses a manual of some kind, even if it's just a sourceless voice, to provide them with the specific information they need, which is actually a wizard itself that has decided to instruct and assist other wizards. Communication and cooperation among wizards is carefully coordinated through a hierarchy that operates across nonlinear time and multiple universes, and is of the belief that some information should be independently discovered rather than directly taught based upon the context of who it's going to.

Familiars is the term I've given to refer to non-wizards who know about wizards, though it can apply to massive scales. If an entire species or civilization knows about wizards, it's because they are technically the familiar to a wizard of equal or greater size. Familiars have a tendency to develop superpower-esque talents that are fed by their wizard's power, which the wizard frequently won't know about until after they manifest since the familiar technically always had the talent, they just couldn't use it.

The existence of wizards and their activities is kept secret from everyone else as part of a respect for anything that "lives well in its own way". The Powers That Be who created the universe could've just removed death and entropy from it, but chose not to because that would've destroyed everything that came about because of it. Wizards are employed to fix problems in the universe because they are a product of entropy themselves, so are entrusted to fix things in a way that the universe's inhabitants find more acceptable.

You may have noticed that I've given wizards quite a lot of autonomy and based a lot of their actions around judgement calls. That's because I want to emphasize the story potential for personal struggles against entropy and the difficulty at fighting it within yourself. My headcannon is actually that the Powers are a metaphor to describe wizards far more powerful than yourself, and that the avatars of the Lone Power are wizards who went rogue and may be inadvertently creating entropy.

Nita and Kit's stories are just their personal experiences in a setting so massive that the entirety of it can't even be perceived by them, their perspective is just suitable for their own corner of it. The cosmology is a fractal expanding in all directions across space, time, and dimensions beyond seemingly without end. For a series about high concept adventures and personal drama that can span whole settings and genres with a consistent theme of improving yourself and helping others, I think that's appropriate.
