To keep the AU relatively in line with canon, you could actually make the force relatively benevolent under normal conditions. It would explain why, although they are so cautious about the dark side, they are otherwise willing to trust the force's guidance and influence.

Also, another potentially interesting rational theme: since light-side is all about passively listening to the force instead of bending it to your will, even though the Jedi get less direct combat abilities and raw power, they get better precog than dark side users. Enough so that Palpatine's entire strategy was engineered around blinding the Jedi's long-term precog.
