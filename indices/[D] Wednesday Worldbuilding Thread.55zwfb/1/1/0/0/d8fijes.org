  The idea I enjoyed the most from the earlier threads was to give Anakin a fairly strong working knowledge of cognitive biases from time spent working on droid AI (e.g. C3PO).

There could be interesting interplay between the force and cognitive biases here. Perhaps the dark side interferes with the reasoning of the user and in such a way that it erodes the very ability to resist the temptation of using it in the future. Suppose that the dark side is actually more effective, especially if you're cornered in the middle of combat and don't have the luxury of being prepared for opposition, and an interesting dilemma presents itself: do you risk using the dark side to survive, knowing that the very act of using it will re-make your mind in subtle ways and may make you a danger to all you currently hold dear, or do you try to fight your way out without resorting to the dark side and risk dying and not being able to accomplish your goals? You may adapt the scenario to an out-of-combat situation fairly easily. Say you're a Jedi trying to negotiate a truce between two sides in a bloody war: do you use the force to manipulate the minds of representatives and achieve peace, thus saving millions of lives, knowing that the very act of subverting others will give the Force a degree of influence over your own mind?

And if you use the Force and win, do you trust yourself afterwards? Any value drift would feel perfectly natural and justified from the inside, after all, and not stand out as obviously caused by mental manipulation. This may actually be one reason for why the Jedi tend to be more communal and the Sith end up as loners: Jedi don't have to rely on their internal reasoning machinery, they have the option of asking their cohorts "do my actions and plans make sense in context of my stated goals", which provides a safeguard against being mind-fucked by the force.

Focusing on the influence of the force over the minds of users also gives context to how paranoid the Jedi are about attachments and why they insist on inculcating their prospective members in their philosophy from a very young age. The Jedi order is also the obvious fodder for a rationalist-aligned re-interpretation. I mean, they're basically a self-policed monastery for organisms afflicted with force sensitivity. And within such interpretation force sensitivity is really more of an affliction, rather than a blessing: you constantly run a risk of turning into a raging super-powered psycho if you slip up just once. This also may be a good answer for why the Jedi are so ineffectual politically: self doubt is so ingrained in their culture that they can't view themselves as an organisation that should be running the universe. They're basically a group of people trying keep each other from snapping by cultivating mental discipline and detachment: from their perspective getting involved in politics with all the inherent mind-kill would be one of the most terrifying things there is.

Basically, I think the feedback between the force and the minds of the users is one of the most interesting aspects to explore in star wars. The theme is also rationalist at its core, since it's concerned with having to function under conditions of not being able to trust you own reasoning.
