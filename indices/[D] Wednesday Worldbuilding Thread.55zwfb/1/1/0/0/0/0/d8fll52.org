I agree with you there, but there is one thing to keep in mind: it didn't work. The Jedi order collapsed because the culture they created made them incapable of defeating or even noticing the new threat the Republic faced. I like the interpretation that Luke is the one who found the balance between passion and restraint to found a new order.
