Actually it was 100k years, only the last thousand of which were in its current state. The flaws weren't necessarily inherent, the Republic had faced many tribulations over its history, but the collapse occurred due to systematic flaws that weren't fixed. Rome ruled Europe for centuries but still collapsed when it faced problems it couldn't solve.

The prequels weren't very good at presenting those institutional problems, but they were still there. The government had become impotent and corrupt while the Jedi detached themselves from the rest of society to the point where people no longer trusted them. The clone war and Palpatine's conspiracy is what pushed people over the edge, but it worked for a reason.
