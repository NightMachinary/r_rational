Two ideas I've been playing around with are rational!Star Wars and rational!Bleach. I know there have been threads about both on this sub in the past, but I haven't been able to find any stories that resulted from them, which makes me sad.

The main things I'd really appreciate some smart people's input on are:

- In Bleach, why doesn't anyone tell the world of the living about the afterlife?

Presumably it would be better for the living to be aware of Hollows and trying to develop ways to detect and fight them. At the very least, hand out mod-soul pills to mortals with high spiritual energy and train them to fight as a secondary security force to avert disaster until a shinigami can show up. The best explanation I've come up with so far is that Hollows are attracted to strong spiritual energy and strong negative emotions, e.g. fear, especially if those emotions are /directed at Hollows/. Telling untrained people therefore becomes a memetic hazard, and training someone without educating them also puts them at risk by making them juicier targets.

- In Bleach, why is everyone in the afterlife using swords and generally medieval technology?

TBH I'm tempted to turn the afterlife into a high tech utopia (dystopia?) given that they can have millions of brilliant scientists collaborating for centuries. Alternatively, maybe physics is borked a la "Unsong", and they have to rely on magic to cover for technology being unreliable.

- In Star Wars, should the force be Manton-limited, i.e. can a Sith snap your brainstem with a thought?

Making the force less powerful makes munchkinism more rewarding, but making it more powerful (or more rare, but that's kind of separate) does more to explain why people respect/fear it so much.

- In Star Wars, what's the closest I can get to recreating lightsabers?

They make no goddamn sense in canon, but it doesn't feel like it's Star Wars anymore if I drop them and just have all force users be Numberman-tier snipers. Maybe using the force to wield clouds of plasma..?
