Some thoughts on Bleach. (Note that I have seen about ~100 episodes of Bleach or so, and haven't read much of the Manga at all, and have been exposed to a bunch of fanon.) That all said, a few thoughts based on my understanding:

- Dead people stick around in Soul Society for a very long time aging extremely slowly. This means that plausibly the majority of the population of Soul Society is probably from 1800 or earlier.
- Also, most souls don't seem to need to eat unless they have very high spiritual energy. This means that the agricultural revolution is probably unnecessary and not strongly driven economically, and drives to modernize to produce more food would be either absent or decreased.
- All the scientists who've died would be dispersed among a huge population, and there seems to be suggestions somewhere that people forget their past lives when entering Soul Society (unsure if this particular point is canon or fanon).
- People age very slowly and tend to stick around forever, so there's plausibly less advancement of arts via generational changeover.
- Finally, training everyone to use swords makes a great deal of sense when your soul's form materializes as a melee weapon that gives you magical abilities; training everyone in riflery when their souls don't become rifles that grant magical powers seems like a waste of time. I think the vast majority of Shinigami etc get melee weapon stuff, and ranged stuff is not unknown but much rarer and tends to be more primitive ranged weapons anyways.

It seems like they give the Shinigami analogues of a bunch of electronics like cell-phone-like-things-that-detect-Hollows and stuff, so electronics might not be completely unknown amongst the Shinigami.

Note: it might be cool if in Bleach fanfic where some or even /any/ of the famous people who have died make an appearance, I can't recall ANY of the MANY famous dead people making an appearance in Bleach.

In Star Wars, Darth Vader needs to be able to use the Force to choke people. I am less settled on The Emperor being able to shoot lightning directly into your body, but using the Force to choke someone is an iconic scene.

Star Wars make no goddamn sense at all. Some books have nonetheless tried to do similar things, though, the first two off the top of my head were Frank Herbert's Dune and Simon Green's Deathstalker books. Both tried to justify people in a high-tech setting using swords as primary armaments. Basically, they had energy shields that would block almost any imaginable projectile weapon, so people had to use slower melee stuff to pierce the shields. In Herbert's Dune shooting the shields with lasers resulted in a nuclear-level explosion, making the lasters impractical for use at close range typically. In Green's books, there were extremely expensive energy-based guns that could penetrate shields, but they were bulky, expensive, and had ridiculous rechage times of like 2 minutes, because Green wanted to have the fights and battles be more like swashbuckling with primitive gunpowder pistols.
