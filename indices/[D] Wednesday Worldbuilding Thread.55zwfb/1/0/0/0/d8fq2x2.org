Dark side is able to bypass your pseudo-manton limit? The so if Jedi are still relatively unambiguously good in your rational!AU, make the force explicitly respect living being sense of boundaries. The dark side is all about making the force directly obey you through raw emotion and passion and thus can overcome this obstacle. It still isn't easy to bypass this limitation, even with the dark-side, requiring extra concentration and focus, so that is why even Palpatine and Vader don't just instant kill their enemies.

  The difficult question is whether he can, like, squeeze your heart.

So I would say that even for advanced force users, they need to utilize particular techniques to actualize their power efficiently. So maybe with a few extra minutes of concentration and some extra exertion of willpower, Vader or Palpatine could just directly squeeze your heart, however Vader is much more practiced at force choking (his first usage of it has probably burned itself in his memory) and Palpatine is much more practiced at force lightning.
