Two questions related to one plan for nanowrimo... If you could time travel to anytime post 2nd world war, what would you do to advance rationalism? Is there any research you could run early or promote more? History is mostly stable so you can gamble or invest and make enough money to promote research, but it still looks better if your work is peer reviewed, obviously. Time travel is in the form of living a life over again, so you can start work from a young age

And two. If a significant subset of people can remember more than one life and expect to live for many more - are their lives worth more than those of regular people? I mean in strict QALYs they are, but how do you do the sums and do you think it would be ethical to? Sums are harder because you don't know the upper limit on lives lived for certain, but as they go further back these people remember less and less of their past lives so you could say that at some point in the future they stop 'being themselves'...
