  If you could time travel to anytime post 2nd world war, what would you do to advance rationalism? Is there any research you could run early or promote more?

You'd get to shape the birth of computers and the Internet. For example, you might attempt to prevent people from creating an unfriendly AI, and slow down research into computers as much as possible.

Although if you're worried about existential risk during the Cold War, there are more obvious targets.

  And two. If a significant subset of people can remember more than one life and expect to live for many more - are their lives worth more than those of regular people?

If you shoot one of these people, do they just skip to their incarnation in the next timeline? That might make their lives worth /less/ than a mortal's. Normal people stay dead, loopers just have to sit in the corner until the next reset.

I don't know. It's easy to argue that they're worth more than normal people, but that rings false somehow. Narratively speaking, it seems like a justification for Protagonist-Centred Ethics, because the people you care about are explicitly worth more than the people you don't. And that sort of argument could very easily be used to justify any atrocity you like - "those people's lives are worth less than ours" is intolerance in a nutshell.
