I think I am going to have to write someone who dies in the next few years, because otherwise I'll be writing quickly overtaken near future stuff. Given that I don't think AI will be their first concern - if anything they are going to want to invent things like mobile phones FASTER because it's hard having to keep going back to before their invention. They may want to spread general rationality, though, partly to avoid war, but mainly because once you know about biases it's hard not to want to overcome them :-)

  If you shoot one of these people, do they just skip to their incarnation in the next timeline? That's true for most forms of death, yes, but in Harry August there is a way to kill them entirely by preventing them being born in their next life, and also you can wipe their memory just before death, which could be considered as bad as killing them. The ethical question arises because if you kill Hitler, for instance, you are preventing a lot of these people being reborn by changing the history where their parents meet...
