Yeah, I think the way I'll treat them is as follows:

1. most Genin don't make it to Chuunin

2. Remaining a Genin is pretty shameful, and not well-respected, but its not a bad job objectively speaking in terms of pay, risk, etc.

3. Most bandits are rogue Genin, occasionally Chunin, and rarely Jounin. Jounin are very well-respected in the village, very high pay, privileges, etc. so they don't have a strong incentive to leave.

4. S-class, on the other hand...they're strong enough to fend for themselves as missing-nin, so the 'cost' to going rogue is low for them. And since there's only one Kage in each village, and S-class are often arrogant (deservedly so), political conflict is often a motive for them to leave.

5. Genin who leave the village on good terms, who quit, can work freelance basically doing D-class missions, but its difficult because most clients/cities are understandably wary of a Genin that quits. So only unsavory or desperate people hire freelance Genin.

6. Hunter ninja who hunt down ninja focus on Chunin and Jounin-- they're in the sweet spot of dangerous and possible to take down. Genin are often not worth the trouble, S-class are too powerful for most teams to touch.

A big theme which I want to explore through early missions is life outside of ninja villages and what civilians think of Ninja, which is why I'm trying to hash this stuff out in detail.
