There's a few questions you should think about:

1. Are you sticking with canon tech levels? That includes wireless headsets, cell phones, satellites, and computers, but according to WOG it does NOT include firearms or explosives. This makes absolutely no sense, so you've got your work cut out for you if you want to rationalize it. We went with "forget it, it's pretty much all feudal tech."
2. Given your chosen tech level, how easy is it for civilians to travel? Is there trade? Common currency? Standard weights and measures?
3. Do jutsu create real matter, or is that (rock from an Earth Wall / water from a Wild Wave Wall / etc) just a construct that sublimates after a while? If it's just a construct then that will significantly reduce the impact that ninja can have on society.
4. What about energy? Does a raiton jutsu create electrons ex nihilo, does it move them from the surroundings, or is raiton energy not actually electricity? How hot are the flames from fire jutsu? Again, this has a big impact on how much uplift a ninja can provide.
5. How many ninja are there? How many civilians?
6. What percentage of ninja are genin / chunin / jounin / S-rank?
7. Why do ninja not run everything? There's at least two possibilities: they do, or they don't because they choose not to. Reasons they might choose not to: the Sage said not to and they are loyal to his teachings. They see themselves as the "thin black line" protecting civilian society and that honor and esprit de corps keep them from staging a coup. There is a powerful force preventing it. (What force?) The answer may be different in different countries, of course.
8. What about the bizarre parts of canon? Are you considering the filler episodes to be canon? (aka "are there actually chakra ostriches?") Did Mist actually have a purge of bloodline owners? Why? Did they have a training program that involved killing a fellow student to graduate, thereby cutting their available manpower in half compared to other nations? Why? Did Konoha actually think that Naruto was the Fox and treat him like dirt? Did the Hokage let them away with it?

Naruto is a great setting, but it's about the least rational thing I've ever read. If you want to come up with a rational version you're going to have your work cut out for you. I look forward to reading what you come up with, though. Good luck!
