This may not be particularly helpful, but I just wanted to say that I personally think you've already thought this out in enough detail that defining it any further probably won't be useful.

Unless economics is a specific focus of the plot (meaning you'll be describing business deals in detail) I'd say you already have enough written here to more or less explain how the economy works.

If you describe ninja as a limited energy resource protected by secrecy and maybe physical aptitude (meaning not everyone has the potential to become a ninja), then you already have an economy that more or less functions on similar principles to the real world.

Unless it's important to the plot, I wouldn't worry about all the little details until they become relevant. But as I said, this might not be helpful advice if your main focus is actually economic issues. In which case I would ask, "What specifically do you need help defining?" Because you seem to have provided a reasonable answer to every question you ask in the above post.
