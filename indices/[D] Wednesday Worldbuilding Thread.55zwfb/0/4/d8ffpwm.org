I posted this for an earlier worldbuilding thread involving Naruto where the author wanted to include ninja animals, but the discussion didn't go anywhere.

I have never seen Naruto, but I have an idea of how handle the intelligent animals that could also explain the unusual mix of technology. If there are at least some animals that can communicate with humans, they've no doubt voiced their grievances over our effect on their environment. As a resolution to a Princess Mononoke-esque conflict, there is an international accord restricting the use of industrial technology. It's been in place for so long, though, that reverence for nature has become part of culture and spiritual practice.

This means that post-medieval technology can exist, but the infrastructure necessary to produce it is rare since you need to reach an agreement with the animals before you build it. Even something as simple as a mine requires a lengthy process of ritual negotiation until the animals grant you access to their territory. Hunting is usually allowed, but restricted. Both humans and animals have rights to defend their territory from intruders, but pursuit or retaliation is forbidden unless they are acting at the behest of their social group.
