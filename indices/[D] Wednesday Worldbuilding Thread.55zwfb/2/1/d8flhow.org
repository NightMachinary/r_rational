Cousin! Check out [[/r/errantry]] sometime soon, there's a sale where you can get everything for about $25 at the moment.

And I'm with [[/u/oilwhail]] on this - the setting is already rational and the characters stick to reasonable mistakes (see: volunteering for the /Song of the Twelve/).

A rationalist sorry wouldn't even need to go AU; you could just use an original (or peripheral) character. The trouble would be in writing about... hmm, I've got a decent idea for the setting... Uh, writing the rationalist bits without an exposition dump. I mean, canon is basically just missing a sprinkle of /Luminosity/-style self reflection, but that's hard to write without turning into awkward non-fiction.
