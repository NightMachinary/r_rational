I've already bought the original nine books, I'm just taking big breaks in between reading them. The setting is pretty rational, but there were a few points that I thought weren't as clear as they should be. Duane's airy writing style is fantastic at communicating emotions and abstract concepts, but isn't as great at giving logical descriptions of what's going on.
