  In Star Wars, should the force be Manton-limited, i.e. can a Sith snap your brainstem with a thought?

I've always assumed that the force /could/ snap brain stems, even in canon, unless it was a jedi fighting another jedi. A jedi, I assumed, could just create a field of force energy around themselves that keeps the force near them immune from manipulation. A force field, if you will. As far as why they never did it to non-force users in canon, I just assumed it was harder - it takes more concentration and time to focus on a specific part of an enemy's anatomy than it would to just slice their head off with a laser sword. Think about how much time and focus Yoda needed to lift Luke's ship out of the swamp. Now imagine someone trying to do something like that in the middle of a battle.

As far as munchkinism being more rewarding when you give less power to the force, I don't think this is inherently true. Namely, I think the reward of munchkinism comes from its cleverness. So it might be true that you can only think of clever munchkinizations of a limited force system and have a harder time with a more powerful version, but the limit there is not inherent to the force system but to your own ability to think up clever uses for it.
