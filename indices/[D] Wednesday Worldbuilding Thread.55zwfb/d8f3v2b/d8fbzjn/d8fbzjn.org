I'm curious how you could integrate rationalist themes into Star Wars. Using power to gain more power, with the ultimate goal of improving life for sentients everywhere, is almost certainly a first step towards the Dark Side. It doesn't fit with the Jedi's space-Taoist outlook. As iconic as they are, I'd be more interested in a rationalist Han Solo - smuggler and con artist making the best of what he's got, suddenly thrown into a battle of space wizard knights with telekinesis and future-vision. Maybe not actually Han Solo, Rey has some of the same themes, or you could make up your own character and drop them in. But someone who isn't the Chosen One and who isn't a Force superstar. Rationalist heroes don't have a prophecy drop into their lap.

Don't worry about lightsabers not matching up with our laws of physics. Nor does FTL, nor do blasters, nor do shields. Unless you want to do something particular with those (c.f. [[http://english.bouletcorp.com/2016/04/13/sabers-light/][the Ljussk√∂ld]] ), don't question them. If your characters grew up surrounded by those things, they wouldn't think to ask what lightsaber blades are made of ("coloured energy, duh"), so there's no reason to bring it up. As long as the universe is consistent with its own rules, it doesn't need to match the real world.
