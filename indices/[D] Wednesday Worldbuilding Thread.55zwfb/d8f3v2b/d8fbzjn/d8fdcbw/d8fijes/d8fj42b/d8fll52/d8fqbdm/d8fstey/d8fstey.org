I think that's fanon. The explanation I got was from the official supplemental materials for the films, I was the world's most boring fanboy at the time, which said the war was created to distract the Jedi. Then again, if we're trying to rationalize the Star Wars prequels we should probably toss most of worldbuilding and exposition in order for any of the plot to make sense.

Even in the clone wars cartoons, little is ever sufficiently explained. Star Wars is a textbook example of an irrational story and there aren't any obvious ways to fix it without a near-complete rewrite. There's a lot of good ideas and narratively satisfying stories, but even the best parts of the franchise still have some significant problems when placed under scrutiny.
