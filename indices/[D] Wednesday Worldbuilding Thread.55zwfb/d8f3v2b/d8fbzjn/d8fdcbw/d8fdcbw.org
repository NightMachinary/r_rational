  I'm curious how you could integrate rationalist themes into Star Wars.
#+end_quote

The idea I enjoyed the most from the earlier threads was to give Anakin a fairly strong working knowledge of cognitive biases from time spent working on droid AI (e.g. C3PO).

  Rey has some of the same themes
#+end_quote

I initially wanted to write it with Rey as the protagonist, actually, but her story doesn't happen without the backstory, and dropping rational!Rey into canon Star Wars is a shortcut to Mary Sueville. So I figured what the heck, may as well rewrite the entire original story and then see where a Rey-analogue ends up.

  someone who isn't the Chosen One and who isn't a Force superstar
#+end_quote

Certainly not the Chosen One, yeah, but I think it's okay to have the protagonist be fairly gifted with the Force as long as they're up against obstacles that can't be solved just by applying overwhelming +force+power. After all, those will be the interesting ones :)

  As long as the universe is consistent with its own rules, it doesn't need to match the real world.
#+end_quote

I think the issue here is that I as the author need to know what those rules are to make sure everything stays consistent, and I was having trouble coming up with rules that allowed lightsabers and shields. I have some better ideas now, after reading the suggestions here.
