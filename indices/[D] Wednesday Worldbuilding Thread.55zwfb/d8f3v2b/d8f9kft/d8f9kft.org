Re Star Wars: most canon stories I've seen mostly treat the force as somewhat Manton limited. When Luke jumps off the walkway in /Empire Strikes Back/, Dark Vader doesn't lift him although he's lighter than some of the things Vader had just thrown at him in the previous scene. In /The Clone Wars/, you only see jedi use force choke when they're very angry, or their opponent is weakened, suggesting there's some resistance to it by default.

As for lightsabers, they actually make sense as a weapon if you have the insane skill level required to use them. The important thing about them is, they cut through basically anything. It's a bit hard to make comparisons since armour is mostly useless in Star Wars, but you can easily imagine that they can cut through armour that is otherwise impervious to small arm fire, making them unstoppable if you're skilled enough to get in close range in the first place. They're also easier to conceal, and harder to use against you if stolen than a rifle.
