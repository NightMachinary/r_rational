You mean, why isn't their technology more widespread? Or how do you make a plasma tube that deflect plasma shots? If it's the first one, just say it's way too expensive to be practical for anyone who isn't a jedi (and they control all the kyber crystal mines anyway). If it's the second one, who cares? Star Wars is science-themed fantasy. You don't need a reductionist magic system / tech tree to make good rational fiction.
