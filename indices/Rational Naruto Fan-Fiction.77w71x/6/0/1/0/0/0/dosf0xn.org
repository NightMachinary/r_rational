Well my idea is to have the whole shinobi world reconstructed and after reading many fan fictions I've seen that Naruto being a bit smarter is not good enough. S-rank ninja will have powers and abilities that represent their status. Characters who died in the original series will be alive. Their will be conspiracy in the Leaf village and the other villages will be explored to a nearly as great extent like that of the world of ice and fire by George rr Martin.
