I dislike the bits talking about "errors cascading in 13 dimensions", the initial descriptions of infusing that made it out to be some sort of transcendental experience to make simple seals, and things of that nature. I understand that the quest writers don't want to have to actually make a right system for how sealing works, but the particular way they did it seems needlessly pretentious. As far as I've gotten, this hasn't affected the actual plot of the story, aside from Hazo making a mistake and slipping into weird chakra space thing with a whale, which I found ridiculous.

My minor gripes with the gameplay mechanics/quest system boil down to the quest participants making occasional dumb decisions that I don't think in-universe people would have, and the dice system being overly simplistic. I've only just got to the part where one of the authors talked about redoing the whole system, so my criticism probably is a little late, but I disliked the amount of variance inherent in skill checks determined solely by dice. Even if large numbers of dice will average out to a fairly consistent value, it rankles that such a huge variance in abilities is even possible. "Oh, you prepared specifically for this opponent, and designed strategies for neutralizing them? Tough luck, your three extra dice came up to 43 points." I don't think anything like this actually happened, although I mostly just skimmed the die results, but it being possible is silly.

(Yes, the dice part isn't really inherent to the system, but I really just wanted to skin over that part

I also want to stress that I do enjoy the story. Just minor gripes about it that I can't forget.)
