If anything, I'd say the dice system was overly complicated. As it stands, it uses the results of d100s, applies them to a formula that takes into account both combatants' rolls and dice pools, and has degrees of success accounted for in a relatively-complicated formula [(your roll - their roll)/(your dice + their dice)^{.65].}
