I'm about halfway through Marked for Death, and it's very enjoyable. Well written, internally consistent, good character interaction. Aside from some gripes about stuff inherent to the questing and dice rolling system, I only have two complaints about the story. One, the description of the sealing system is rather obnoxious. It's like the authors set out to write the most [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] system they could come up with. Two, Kagome's dialogue. Repeating "stinking stinkers" and "boom, squish" is obnoxious and repetitive. The character himself is fine, but would be much improved by removing those dialogue quirks.
