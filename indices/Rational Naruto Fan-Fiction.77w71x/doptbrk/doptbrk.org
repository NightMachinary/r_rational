The naruto universe is mostly interesting because it has a social structure in which almost all the nash equilibriums suck.

.. Explaning: You know how murders are rare and almost always solved in some european nations? This is an example of a good nash equilibrium - Professional criminals rarely kill because they know the cops expend enormous effort on solving murders, and the police can expend enormous effort on solving murders that need that because murders are rare and mostly crimes of passion, so the total resource burn is not that high.

Everything about the naruto universe is the opposite of this. All their social structures are at stable equilibrium points that are very, very bad because the magic that can move the world fell into the hands of what is essentially medieval criminal cartels.

So, the rational thing to do in this universe is social reform, except that the villages would try and kill you for it. And probably succeed.

I so want to read a naruto-verse fic which is all about someone trying to exfil without getting on the wanted list, or just attempting to get clear of the entire social order.
