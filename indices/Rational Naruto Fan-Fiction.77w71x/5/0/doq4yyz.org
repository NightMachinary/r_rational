I've checked it out as someone recommended it to me yesterday. Yes, sadly the story is dead which is a shame. My one pet peeve with the story is that I don't like how the author just randomly made Kakashi been aware of Naruto's status as a JinchÅ«riki or not so much that but how in one of the chapters where Naruto goes to speak to the kyubi I don't like how Kakashi is just like yo and how Naruto isn't affected by it.
