I think the real challenge with Naruto is, as the grandparent says, the worldbuilding. Kishimoto had satellite dishes and refrigerators but ninja threw knives at each other. 100,000 ninja showed up for the war, so ninja aren't in short supply, yet we never see any chakrapunk. The daimyo are in charge, despite the ninja having a major military advantage.

Over at Marked for Death we tried to reconcile all this and create a rational world out of it. It was very hard, so you'll need to choose your axioms carefully.
