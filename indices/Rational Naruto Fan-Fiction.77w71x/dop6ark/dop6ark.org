In the vein of rational Naruto fics, take a look at /Team Anko/, /The Waves Arisen/, and /Lighting Up the Dark/. /Marked for Death/ also features a more internally consistent world than canon, with reasons built in for why the world is like this, and how ninja are all inherently glass cannons, especially as they grow stronger. Jutsu development and seal design are both incredibly dangerous fields that will absolutely kill you and everyone near you if you are not very very safety-conscious.

Beyond rational fiction, this concept of "Naruto but this time he is smart and skilled" has been done many many times. Feel free to completely ignore me and pursue the story you want to write, but I'd advise finding a premise or core idea that is more unique and distinctive. Doing something as simple as changing the protagonist can make things far more interesting, for both you and your readers.
