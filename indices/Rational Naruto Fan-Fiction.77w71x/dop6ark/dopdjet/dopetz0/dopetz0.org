Could you clarify what you mean about sealing? The way I see it sealing is intended to be a technical profession, but the quest masters don't want to have to actually design said technical profession (because spoons) so they just say one is there, which you can learn. Given the lack of hindsight and the penalty for slip-ups that the format imposes, this seems like a totally reasonable narrative choice.

The actual game-visible mechanics and societal systems and implications seem fairly straightforward, though, so I don't see why you'd be criticising that either.
