  13 dimensions
#+end_quote

For what it's worth, a dimension is just a parameter with which something varies independently of other dimensions. To quote Wikipedia,

#+begin_quote
  In mathematics, the dimension of an object is an intrinsic property independent of the space in which the object is embedded. For example, a point on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle][unit circle]] in the plane can be specified by two [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates][Cartesian coordinates]], but a single [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate][polar coordinate]] (the angle) would be sufficient, so the circle is 1-dimensional even though it exists in the 2-dimensional plane. This /intrinsic/ notion of dimension is one of the chief ways the mathematical notion of dimension differs from its common usages.

Saying errors can cascade in 13 dimensions just means that there are 13 orthogonal parameters needed to specify it. This likely sounds worse if you use laymen definitions and imagine the users are unfolding 13 spatial dimensions in their mind. If you just worry that it "sounds" jargony, well yes, but that's how people speak in technical fields. I find it hard to communicate at all about the technical things I'm involved in to people unfamiliar with it.

It makes sense that building simple seals /should/ be complex and difficult, because seals are much rarer than they would be if these seals could be made by the average ninja. This follows from the fact that Haz≈ç and co. find carpet bombing incredibly effective, and the only convincing explanation for that not being the de-facto form of combat involves supply restrictions even for the simplest tier of things.

My understanding is you don't get dice but (effectively) bonus points for situational advantage.
