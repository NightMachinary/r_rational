And if I thought Naruto the show was less annoying then I might care that DoS heavily followed the stations of canon. As it is, DoS removes the half hour fight scenes that are mostly just flashbacks or people panting, it removes edgy emo Sasuke, it removes the stupid bloody nose arousal thing, and in general it removes a lot of idiocy. Those things alone make it at least a 7/10 to me.
