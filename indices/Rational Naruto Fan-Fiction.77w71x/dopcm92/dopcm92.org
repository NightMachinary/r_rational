Try reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/][Dreaming of Sunshine]]. The point of divergence is that the author is born as Shikamaru's twin sister. She gets put on team 7 instead of Sakura, who goes into the medic corps. Naruto is his normal self, but Shikako (the SI/viewpoint character) helps him a lot with tactical thinking, and by the time of the Chunin exams he is using clones of himself transformed into kunai for surprise attacks/duplication of kunai.

In terms of slice of life and character interactions, she makes friends with Naruto and to an extent Sasuke early on. Naruto and Sasuke both lose their loner statuses, and they all become a tight knit team, capable of overcoming the ridiculous missions they stumble into. Sasuke also isn't the edgy emo kid he is in canon, which is an immense relief.

There's a lot more focus on the various women in the story as well, as canon did them no justice. No major spoilers, but Ino gets a summon contract and character development, Sakura gets to study under Tsunade much earlier, and Tenten helps with developing special storage scrolls that get her praise from Tsunade.

Lots of stuff with Shikamaru as well, and just generally a lot of well done character interaction.

Shikako also studies chakra a lot, along with sealing. In addition to being a good chakra sensors, she deals with chakra systems a lot, and is called in to help when Kakashi's sharingan starts malfunctioning. The whole chakra system is much more defined and predictable than canon.

Finally, yes, it is an SI fic, but the SI has a hazy memory at best of details about the world. She knows general plot points, but that's about the extent of it. There are plenty of missions and other important events that she has zero warning of at all. The fic also started before Naruto the series finished, and the author has said she thinks a number of things are dumb and won't be appearing in her story, namely Kaguya and the chakra tree thing.

The story is around 700k words right now, updating sporadically but without any huge hiatuses (last update was a week ago), and is currently plowing through the timeskip era.
