One more thing that merits mentioning: Naruto learns vastly more about his clones and how to use them, and much earlier on. You're probably pretty close to where he learns that skills and memories transfer back to him when his clones pop. For comparison, canon Naruto only learned this in Shippuden, which is years later. He goes on from there.
