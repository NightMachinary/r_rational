My thought exactly. The interesting question is what would determine which of karma's "harms" people come to accept as good and which "helps" they would accept as bad?

Part of it is that ideas which are good at spreading themselves would take over - memetic evolution, you know the drill. But the incentives are different in this setting than in reality, because helping other people would cause an equal and opposite amount of harm somewhere else - most likely, on a different continent or a different planet or something. You might not even notice the karmic balance phenomenon until nearly the entire world was colonised.
