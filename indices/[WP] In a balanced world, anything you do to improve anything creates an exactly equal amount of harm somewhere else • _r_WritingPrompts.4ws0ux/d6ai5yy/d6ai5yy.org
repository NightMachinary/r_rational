An interesting thought I had. Assuming 'harm' and 'help' are arbitrarily predefined at some point in time before this world develops instead of changing over time to match society's definitions of these two terms, then wouldn't society eventually adjust to see 'harm' as not really being harmful?

Or in simpler words, if an early society sets 'harm' to mean death, unnecessary suffering, and hunting animals, would a later society come to believe that death is good, enduring pain for no good reason is linked to beauty, intelligence, and kindness, and animals need to be eaten alive? Would societies adapt to constant pain by twisting their morals to perceive the 'harm' as a good thing?
