As you've commented elsewhere, it's not remotely possible to balance good and evil for all of seven billion humans' divergent notions of good and evil. The least exploitable solution is that there is an objective notion of good - in the story, not in reality - and that is what is being kept in balance. A Black And White morality, like next week's story prompt.

I suppose the way forward would be to find places where society's judgement of good and evil differs from the universe's / the author's. For example, in /A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero/, lust is a deadly sin and the protagonist is considered evil verging on demonic from the amount of porn she's watched. Perhaps there is some similar "evil" that society would consider an acceptable cost.
