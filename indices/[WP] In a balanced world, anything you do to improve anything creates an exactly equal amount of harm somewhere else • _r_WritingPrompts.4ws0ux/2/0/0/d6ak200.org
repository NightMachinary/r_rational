  You don't need to balance it for everyone, only for people involved in making any particular change.

That opens a huge can of worms concerning what qualifies as a single change, hew far responsibility stretches, and indeed what counts as a person and how their subjective notions of good and evil are evaluated. Surely there are people whose notion of good and evil contains contradictions? Insane people, if nobody else.

It's a prompt, there's room for interpretation. The interpretation that there is a single objective definition of help and harm seems less exploitable to me. I can't see a proof that your system makes sense, or that it will last 72 hours without some munchkin finding a loophole and becoming omnipotent.

On further thought, an even less exploitable solution would be to stop time. No changes can be made. Nothing good can happen, nothing evil. Perfect balance for eternity.

But the prompt actually specifies that the counterbalancing harm happens "somewhere else", so that at least gives us a limit on karma's powers. Anything that happens, happens, and won't simply be undone.
