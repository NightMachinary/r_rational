  “Who?” And then she laughed. “Oh, you mean the old Earth legend! No, that's all fake. Earth humanity's collective psychic subconscious wasn't well developed enough two thousand years ago to be in tune with the shape of the greater multiverse. Only the major religions from the last, let's say, five hundred years, are even remotely close to true.”

  “Whoa.” I suddenly remembered Seriphen's earlier allusion to “Earth humanity,” the implication being that there were humans on other planets. Wait, not just other planets---she said “reborn in,” as opposed to “reborn on.” She was using ‘world' as a synonym for ‘universe.'

  And then I realized she had casually stated that humanity has a collective psychic subconscious, and people have auras that can be read, and clearly people also have souls, because holy shit, there's an afterlife after all, and I was suddenly starting to realize just how deep into the rabbit hole I already was. It was overwhelming in the best way possible.
