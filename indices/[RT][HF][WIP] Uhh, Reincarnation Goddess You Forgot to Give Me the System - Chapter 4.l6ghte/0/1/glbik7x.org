You nearly had me, and now I'm just leery as fuck. I'll check it out!

Decent enough. Hate the start with the literal "record scratch You may be wondering how I got here..." in the first chapter. Seems neat enough to continue, little worried how often you're gonna repeat the MC telling themselves about their "master class in snark" and hopefully the chemistry with the kid that saved them doesn't devolve to the two of them speaking to each other in pure 'snark' and 'banter' because that gets old and tends to make the non-MC seem less like a person and more like a stand in hype man to show off how funny and clever the MC is.

Look forward to more!
