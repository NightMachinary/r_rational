Nah it's cool. I get what you meant. Just thought I would expand on that point. If individual mistakes are fine, so are patterns of mistakes if they have a meaning.

A rational story has more than just a rationalist robot. I think the key point of a rational fic is that the story itself progresses due to rational reasons.

While a character themself may be irrational, they could be so for rational reasons and the reader can assess that. The key point is that it is something the reader should be able to follow and see why these things are happening. Whether acknoweding they made a mistake, why they made it, or even a deeper character flaw if it repeats and they dont notice.
