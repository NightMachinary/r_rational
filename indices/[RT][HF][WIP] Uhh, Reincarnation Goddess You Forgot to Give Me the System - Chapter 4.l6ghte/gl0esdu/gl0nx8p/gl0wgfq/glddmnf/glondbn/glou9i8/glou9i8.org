I have little doubt the actual sounds out of his mouth, were all this real, would be "strength" my problem, personally, is writers being lazy enough to write STR when context would suggest it shouldn't be used. As an example, from someone not used to using that sort of abbreviation while thinking or writing, or in every case where someone is talking and not literally making the sound "str". I view this in the same way as if someone were to write LOL as a descriptor outside of a verbal context and a slight step above using emojis in story telling.
