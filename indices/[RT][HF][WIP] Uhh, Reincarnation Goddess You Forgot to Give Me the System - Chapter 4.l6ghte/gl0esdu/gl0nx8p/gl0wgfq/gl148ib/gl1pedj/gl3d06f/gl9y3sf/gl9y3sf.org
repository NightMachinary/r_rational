This is a great beginning. The story has a lot of promise and its really hitting the ground running. All the rational deduction seems good too. I'm curious how Ash is going to cope long-term with the fact that she is a mundane in a superhuman world. Its hard to say until we see more about how the system works, but I'm guessing it will be glorious munchkinry of some kind. I also like how the first native she meets properly seems pretty clever. Seems like a good companion for her going forward.
