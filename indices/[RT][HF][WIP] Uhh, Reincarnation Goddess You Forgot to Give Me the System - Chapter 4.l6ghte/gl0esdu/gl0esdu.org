So, I posted this story without much explanation last week and someone in the comments suggested I write up a little explanation on why it belongs in [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I'm a long-time reader of rational and rational-adjacent fiction (HPMOR, Ra, Unsong, etc.), and a longer-time writer-in-training. I've wanted to write something for this audience for a while now, and after the recent rise of the LitRPG/Isekai genres in the web-fiction-sphere, I finally had a story idea I thought might be a good match. The result is URGY, a story about a rational-ish girl who is thrust onto her own LitRPG/Isekai adventure without any special powers whatsoever, other than her desire to unravel the inner workings of the multiverse that she now realizes exists.

With regard to the "protagonist with no powers" setup, I can't deny I was heavily inspired by Will Wight's Cradle series. (If you're a fan of progression fantasy and you haven't read it yet, you're doing yourself a major disservice.) Imagine if the protagonists of HPMOR and Cradle had a baby, and that baby was a fully grown adult whose only special ability was her unparalleled ability to be inappropriately sarcastic.

I've crafted this story to be a puzzle. Every chapter will drop subtle hints toward something, whether it be the cosmology of the story's setting, the mechanics of the System, character backstories, and so on.

I can't say it will always be perfectly rational -- URGY's protagonist will occasionally make mistakes. She'll be wrong sometimes, because her working knowledge was wrong or incomplete. But such cases are intentional by me as the author -- and over time, she'll make fewer mistakes as she becomes a better thinker and a better person.

Thanks for reading, I hope you all enjoy the story :)
