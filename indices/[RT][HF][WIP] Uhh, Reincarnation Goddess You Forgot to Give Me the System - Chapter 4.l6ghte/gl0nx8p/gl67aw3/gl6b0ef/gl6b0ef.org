I love it, and loved it from the very start, but it's quality certainly... fluctuates.

I'd say the first chapter is great, second is boring, the rest is a solid "okay-to-good" with the exception of chapter four, and chapter eight, which are dogshit (though it pays off later) and amazing, respectively.

Really, the story hits it's stride in book two, which I consider to have been great all the way through.

Also, if you're going to read it, I recommend you don't. By which I mean, listen to the audiobook instead. Obviously this is subjective, but I find the format the books are written in to be very amateurish and hard to get through, with a lot of the lines only working right when you hear them, such that you can get a sense of /how/ they were meant to be said.
