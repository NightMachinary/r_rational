These chapters are kinda short, especially with us seemingly only getting them once a week.

That aside, I'm really liking the story so far. It's giving me /major/ KUSOMEGA vibes with the way that a lot of these concepts work, was that story an inspiration, or is it just a coincidence?

Either way, can't wait to read more.
