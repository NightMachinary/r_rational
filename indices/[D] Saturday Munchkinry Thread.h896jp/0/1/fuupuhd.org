Do the lies have to be to you specifically/directly? If not I'm pretty sure the average person receives more than a hundred lies a week. Take the $100/lie and uninstall your ad blocker.

There's also the usual type of oracle hax. Get someone to tell you the Riemann hypothesis is true and see if you get money, etc.
