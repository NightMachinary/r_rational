Obviously choose the $100 per lie. Then get a friend to lie to you constantly. Or just lie to yourself constantly.

On second thought the $100 per lie might not be a safe option. I'm constantly in denial of many things, and that could be considered lying to myself, so I could potentially drown in all the money that constantly appears.
