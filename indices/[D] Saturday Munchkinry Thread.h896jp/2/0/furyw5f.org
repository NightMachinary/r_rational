Can I just give everyone the same powerset by choosing a criterium that is the same for everyone? For instance, what if the criterium is the number of brains the person has?

As for power, how about a combination of :

- Immortallity

- The ability to make an extradimensional copy of the planet you are currently on except that it doesn't have any sentient creatures.

- The ability to travel to and from any copied world, provided the worlds creator gives permission.
