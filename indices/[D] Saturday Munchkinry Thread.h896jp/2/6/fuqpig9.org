The 'ability' to age faster (Or just die prematurely, Final Destination style). The ability cannot be turned off. The ability manifests in early adulthood and scales with your indifference or desire for other people's suffering.

If we can finetune it, we could have good people age more slowly, but I don't see any room for a negative power in the rules. Faking empathy doesn't work, because it's based on your internal motivations. Bad people die, including /very/ quickly everyone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.

Crime goes down, empathy goes up across the board, including in politics. Dictators, selfish career politicians and lobbyists disappear. Fraudulent religious leaders, teleevangelists etc disappear. Cutthroat corporate leaders and 'captains of industry' go away, replaced with less dickish successors.

It's probably not what you were looking for, but I bet it would work.
