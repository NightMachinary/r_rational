Interesting though I'm a curmudgeon and find it a bit of a thought police dystopia or mind control tyranny. I want to try it without the assumption that we can get utopia by just killing off enough "bad" people. What do you think of the free market version?

Metric: your active influence to increase the quality adjusted life years of others.

Power: regeneration toward your optimal age and fitness: reverses cancers, aging past your own desire, radiation damage, genetic defects ect.

The more good you do, not feel like doing, or want to do, then the better you get. People who don't make things better will die off in there time, but immortality is possible, will have name recognition and make an example. People work on thier incentives and this and the re are direct rewards to promoting eusocial outcomes and features to assist building offworld to avoid a malthusian traps.

This could be more or less abusable, but it doesn't resort to a dystopian universe acting as thought police, and it acts on effect vice potentially empty intent.
