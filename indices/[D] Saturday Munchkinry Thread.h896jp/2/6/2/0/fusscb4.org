This is my hypothetical system. Under my interpretation, sacrificing others to help out only yourself is indifference and makes you fall down the rankings. There is no rules lawyering this.

I think some of the people in this sub underestimate how much damage bad people do to those around them. There are no harmless Narcissists. There are people who like themselves a lot. I'm one of them. I bet this community attracts others like me. But /Narcissism/, as in NPD, is /never/ harmless. These are people who /constantly/ abuse and manipulate others. They don't think there is anything wrong with them, and almost all psychiatrists hate working with them because they are all manipulative assholes who will pretend to get better and switch back to monster mode the second they are out of sight. ASPD is the same but worse. Therapy is /actively detrimental/ in ASPD, because the 'patients' will just absorb the techniques to become better manipulators.

Seriously read up on cluster B personality disorders. These are people who are /massively/ detrimental to everyone around them.

And like I said elsewhere in the comment tree, switching from internal motivations to results gained is a terrible idea because it lets the worst assholes game the system. If Superman went around saving lives Monday to Saturday and spent Sundays raping children, he would probably still have a big net positive impact on society, while someone of less than average intelligence in a wheelchair would fall behind because they just can't operate on the same scale as others.
