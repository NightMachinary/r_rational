  Everything you say here makes it very clear you have not read much about Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Read up.

Alright, I concede that I am not a professional in this subject and so may not really understand what NPD means. Reading up on wikipedia/random internet pages has not helped me to understand why there cannot be a harmless Narcissist, and no other sources are within easy reach.

So, although I am highly suspicious, I concede that there could be a definition of NPD that precisely contains exactly those individuals that are deliberately harmful to others plus or minus certain caveats. But then this precise definition is what should have been chosen as the metric, instead of the current innate desires statement that does not seem anywhere near as airtight.

  I would be happy with this,

Then I am much reassured. Please look for such 'peaceful' alternatives whenever possible, because mass killings really really should be the last resort. I'm not so much of an idealist that I would think killing is never the answer, but I do think it rarely is the best or only answer.

  although the rules set by OP do not let us give everyone equal strength in the power.
#+end_quote

That's simple enough to work around. Even if the OP denies any metric for which every person is equal (like how many bodies they have or whether they exist), proper randomization can often still get the job done.

For example, define the metric as how close a person is to being conceived (sperm meeting egg) on an even planck time since the big bang. A planck time is something like 5e-44seconds and so is pretty much impossible for anyone to know or discriminate upon. Furthermore, there is no way to influence what planck time a person is conceived on, so this should be more or less completely random and should result in roughly 50% of any population (regardless of location/gender/race/any and all groupings) having strong supernatural clairvoyance that would let them catch any wrongdoers.

  then that leaves a hypothetical path for cruel people to pretend to be nice all their lives. Although, again, I don't think you realize how impossible that would still be for them.
#+end_quote

If they have very bad luck, their remaining lifespan could be measured in seconds, in which case pretending to be nice for the rest of their lives is incredibly easy. Naturally this is a rather extreme case, but it does indicate that pretending to be nice for the rest of their lives isn't absolutely impossible: it just has probability inversely proportional to their remaining lifespan.

The anecdotes about Narcissism were interesting, but I still worry about survivorship bias. It could be that only some bad Narcissists posted those messed up comments, while other (possibly harmless) Narcissists resisted their impulses and did not participate. Though I concede that this possibility could be precluded by the precise definition of NPD that I am unaware of.
