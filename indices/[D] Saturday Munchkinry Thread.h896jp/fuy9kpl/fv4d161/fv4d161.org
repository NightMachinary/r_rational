Mental Admin Privileges can, with practice, copy and paste someone else's skills into his own head. This can be done with a handshake (and a BASH script); meaning that, in very short order, he is going to have equal-to-the-best skills in just about anything.

Mr. Groundhog, if he can identify Mr. Mental Admin Privileges, can simply avoid touching him. His ability to loop back to and redo their first meeting means he gets the drop on Mr. Mental Admin Privileges, and can simply re-do their first meeting until he wins. I think I'd pick Mr. Groundhog as a major candidate for the winner of (B) (the only other serious possibility is that Mr. Mental Admin Privileges starts turning people into perfectly loyal drones, and manages to take Mr. Groundhog by surprise).

To optimise humanity, however, I think I have to take the portal guy. Mainly because of his matter-duplication ability; that gives him any amount of supplies, therefore any amount of money, plus it allows infinite energy generation in a number of ways; which are effects that the other two can't get.
