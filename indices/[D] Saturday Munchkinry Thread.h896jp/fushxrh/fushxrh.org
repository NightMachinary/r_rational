Askreddit thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h8p0kl/you_can_either_get_10000_right_now_or_100_every/][You can either get $10,000 right now or $100 every time someone lies to you for the next 2 years. Which do you choose?]]

If 100$ appears in your hand every time an untruth is directed at you, you have the ability to be an actual lie detector. I think you could probably make money with this even if you /lost/ 100$ with each lie.
