Can I get rid of the false belief after I'm done? If so, there are a few useful applications here in being a better liar or becoming more self confident in situations where that is a useful trait.

If you can't get rid of it though, that stuff becomes a dangerous double edged knife.

If it is irreversible and there are ways to verify that you used your powers, people could force you to do a value handshake. So if that is an option, you might be better off making yourself forget you have this power in the first place.

As for using it for ignorance is bliss style happiness: Nope, not happening. You live in reality whether you like it or not, closing your eyes doesn't make a bad picture worse, etc.
