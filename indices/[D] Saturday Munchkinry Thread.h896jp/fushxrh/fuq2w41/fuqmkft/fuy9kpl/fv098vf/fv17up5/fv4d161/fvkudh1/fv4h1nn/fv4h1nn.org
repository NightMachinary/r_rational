  Thinking in Portals. You can create an infinite number of portals of any size. You can place a portal in any place you know, from RL or from a picture. The edges of the portals are infinitely sharp. A portal can lead to any other portal forming a gate, from one portal to several (thus, a duplication device) or from several to one (matter fusion device).

it's totally flawed, even with two portals. What about putting a frame with portal into another portal?

also, just two portals with conservation of momentum would allow you to create a free energy device (for example, put one portal on floor and second on ceiling and you get infinite fall from which you can harvest energy from)
