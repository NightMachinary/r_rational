Second power isn't specific enough.

"Complete control over your software" is either completely useless or allows you to instantly create super intelligences. If your brain was a whole brain emulation that ran on Linux it would be a completely undecipherable mess and changing even the slightest thing without understanding the whole would irreparably mess you up. If you get complete understanding of how your brain works as part of this power, you could presumably port it to a real Linux machine and just add hardware until it can bootstrap itself into super intelligence.

Editing other peoples minds is unclear as to what range it works on or to what extend you need to know the other person and how it works in relation to the first power. In the free-for-all, can number two just overwrite the minds of the other two with a copy of their own mind? Can they do this to the entire world? Would overwriting Mr. Groundhog's mind inside a time loop carry over to the next loop/outside the loop? Does copying a mind copy, overwrite or erase superpowers?
