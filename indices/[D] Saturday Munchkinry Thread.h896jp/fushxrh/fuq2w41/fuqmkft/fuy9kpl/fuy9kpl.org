Long hypothetical:

You get to pick one of the 3 superpowers:

1. Mr. Groundhog: Ability to put yourself in a Groudhog Day-style time loop. You can hop in and out of the loop at will, pick the length (day, month, year etc) bring others into it, even create simultaneous loops for different groups/individuals. Loops within loops are also possible.EDIT: the power on others works on touch

2. Mental Admin Privileges: you can browse, edit, and work with your mind as if it ran on Linux. You have complete control over your software, and to some degree, hardware. Your memories are recorded as various files (text, video etc) and skills are applications. You can also do the same for other people, including copying, editing, swapping, storing, merging or deleting their minds.EDIT: the power on others works on touch, the mind is structured to mimic a computer system perfectly.

3. Thinking in Portals. You can create an infinite number of portals of any size. You can place a portal in any place you know, from RL or from a picture. The edges of the portals are infinitely sharp. A portal can lead to any other portal forming a gate, from one portal to several (thus, a duplication device) or from several to one (matter fusion device).

Question A: Which power do you pick, if your intention is absolute optimization of yourself and humanity?

Question B: which power would you pick, if you had to engage in a 3-way war against the users of the other two?
