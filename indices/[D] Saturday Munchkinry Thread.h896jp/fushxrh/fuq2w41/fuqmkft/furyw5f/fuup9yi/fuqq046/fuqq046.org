I mean, some sort of entropy-breaking energy-for-free scheme probably. Maybe something like "everyone gains the power to draw a loop of roughly 30W @ 3A DC from the eternal elemental plane of electricity; your power rating is how much control you have over it".

The criteria doesn't really matter at that point, so you'd probably want to pick something that doesn't drive humanity into weird directions on its own; and in that case, it depends on how the criteria works. If you picked "height", would be recalculated at every moment? Like, would kids have to grow into their control?

If that's the case I'd probably say something like "number of days older than 14".
