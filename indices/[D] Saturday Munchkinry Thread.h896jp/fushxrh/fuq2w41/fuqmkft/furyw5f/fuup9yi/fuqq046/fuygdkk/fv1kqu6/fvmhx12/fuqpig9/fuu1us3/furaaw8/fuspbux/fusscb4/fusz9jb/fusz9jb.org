  Under my interpretation, sacrificing others to help out only yourself is indifference and makes you fall down the rankings.
#+end_quote

Then your interpretation does not match the metric specified: "scales with your indifference or desire for other people's suffering." would certainly exclude people who are averse to causing suffering but do it anyway, and include people who love to cause suffering but restrain themselves from doing so. And I strongly disagree that the latter group deserves to die.

  There are no harmless Narcissists
#+end_quote

A stillborn Narcissist is harmless. A Narcissist in a coma is harmless. A Narcissist that has been shot into space beyond any other person's reach is harmless. Absolutes rarely exist. What makes things even worse in this case is that many people would hide their Narcissism, so we could hardly get a representative sample of Narcissists to determine the expected harm of a Narcissist. There could be countless secret Narcissists out there that have learned to curb their evil desires and so were never recognized as Narcissists. For example:

#+begin_quote
  they are all manipulative assholes who will pretend to get better and switch back to monster mode the second they are out of sight
#+end_quote

This sentence in fact convinces me that there could be harmless Narcissists. Because the fact that they can pretend to get better while in sight indicates that they /can/ curb their harmful desires. Naturally, the idea of being "in sight" differs from person to person. You could be "in sight" at any moment, since hidden cameras are a thing that exists. So a Narcissist that thinks he is constantly "in sight" could pretend to be better all the time, and effectively cause the same amount of "harm" as the healthy person he is pretending to be. Such a Narcissist would, in keeping up the pretense constantly, never be diagnosed with Narcissism, and be as harmless as any normal person, and so you would never find them in your sample of known Narcissists (look up survivorship bias), and yet the chosen metric will kill them even though they have not harmed anyone. I find that quite cruel and unfair.

Now, I do agree that there are /some/ (a minority? a majority? who knows?) Narcissists that are major problems and spread harm everywhere, but the chosen metric will not accurately target them. The potential for collateral damage in this scenario is immense. Countless innocents could die, and you wouldn't even get all of the bad guys. Personally I find the suggested metric as offensive as suggesting the entire Middle East should be nuked to defeat terrorists. The collateral damage would be immense and it would not be effective!

  And like I said elsewhere in the comment tree, switching from internal motivations to results gained is a terrible idea because it lets the worst assholes game the system.
#+end_quote

Indeed such a system would not be perfect, and allow people to game it. But in my opinion it would still be far more effective and produce far less collateral damage.

Also, since we are giving out superpowers anyway, why not just give people some form of clairvoyance? Let people see what actions other people have taken, then no one would be able to hide their wrongdoings, and there would be actual intelligent minds able to decide whether something is a wrongdoing rather than a system that can be gamed. Certainly, this would sacrifice privacy, but that is a far far far cheaper cost than literal lives.

Or, if you want to take a harsher approach, then since apparently blessing people with suck is an option, why not just bless people with powerful empathy? Give them supernatural empathy that overrules all their evil desires. It could still be considered a horrendous violation of people's minds, but that's at least way better than killing them.

  If Superman went around saving lives Monday to Saturday and spent Sundays raping children, he would probably still have a big net positive impact on society, while someone of less than average intelligence in a wheelchair would fall behind because they just can't operate on the same scale as others.
#+end_quote

The obvious solution here is to not use the *net* impact. Just consider the amount of harm done, with no subtractions. Why was *net* even considered here? The law doesn't allow people to commit murder no matter how much good they have done or will do.

Edit: Would prefer it if you said something instead of just down-voting... I'm sincerely hoping to convince you or anyone reading this that these kinds of "murder-everyone-with-X-desires" plans are terrible before you find yourselves in a position of power that could let you enact plans along such lines, and then discover the horrible consequences only when it is already too late.

Seriously there horrible downsides, and better alternatives almost always exist, so please look for them first.
