Let's hack it: you can generate novel mass/energy (in the form mas, eventually or of photons at a not significantly damaging wave-length, and in a non columnated spherical spreading point from your fingertip) proportional to the greater of your body mass, or the amount you are currently generating, with a damping factor of how many currently parenting humans have been born outside 20 ly of the event horizon of black holes obvious abuse of the abusable part of the ramp up metric provides, to prevent the failure states from being extinction events.

The hackable parts aren't accessible till we have humanity safely outside the failure zone. Failure is draconian, and we will have at least one system wide genocide to someone saying lets "pitch it and let's kill everyone" but people have infinite mass energy at their fingertips, if they can handle it , and if society lets people fall behind then one angry person can exterminatus a whole system. There's a wide spread between successes, and failure states here, but you get an abundance of choice and personal freedom. I hope we are good at preventing injustice and teaching responsability.
