I don't trust sociopaths not to game the system. Feed a village, terraform some land for the kids to play on, and painlessly assassinate a few business rivals to secure your position as the most powerful philanthropist in the city. I don't think the system would work if we allow the rich and powerful to have a force multiplier. The more good you /can/ do with a given amount of effort, the less you have to try or be sincere to secure a good ranking. Meanwhile, some well meaning but clumsy/wheelchair bound/unskilled person is at a severe disadvantage because what they can do just doesn't accomplish good on the same scale.

Also I do quite like the part where people with NPD and ASPD get wiped out. I cannot stress enough how much better society would be without these two tiny minorities of pretty much objectively evil people.
