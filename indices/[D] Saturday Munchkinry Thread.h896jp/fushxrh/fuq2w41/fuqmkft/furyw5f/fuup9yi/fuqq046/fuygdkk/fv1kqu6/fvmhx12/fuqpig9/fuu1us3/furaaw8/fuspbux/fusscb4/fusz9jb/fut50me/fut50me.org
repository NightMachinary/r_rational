  A stillborn Narcissist is harmless. A Narcissist in a coma is harmless. A Narcissist that has been shot into space beyond any other person's reach is harmless. Absolutes rarely exist.

A stillborn baby is dead. You can't count them any more than you can count a plant as a person. A Narcissist in a coma is indeed harmless, but that is irrelevant. If they ever wake up, they go back to being a Narcissist. If they don't wake up, they are not interestingly different from being dead. They could do a little good if we transplant their organs, though.

A narcissist shot into space may not have the ability to /act/ on their narcissism, but that doesn't change who they are. Sure, it would be harmless to exclude them from the 'power''s consideration, but again, pretty irrelevant. This isn't a gotcha. You could also just wipe out the rest of humanity and they would, again, be unable to hurt other people.

  This sentence in fact convinces me that there could be harmless Narcissists. Because the fact that they can pretend to get better while in sight indicates that they can curb their harmful desires...

  Now, I do agree that there are some (a minority? a majority? who knows?) Narcissists that are major problems and spread harm everywhere...

Everything you say here makes it very clear you have not read much about Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Read up. This is science. There is no psychiatrist on Earth who would willingly date a Narcissist, or even be friends with one, or see the people they care about do so. Of course, I'm sure some psychiatrists have NPD, but they sure as hell wouldn't seek out a partner who also has NPD.

  Also, since we are giving out superpowers anyway, why not just give people some form of clairvoyance? Let people see what actions other people have taken, then no one would be able to hide their wrongdoings, and there would be actual intelligent minds able to decide whether something is a wrongdoing rather than a system that can be gamed. Certainly, this would sacrifice privacy, but that is a far far far cheaper cost than literal lives.

I would be happy with this, although the rules set by OP do not let us give everyone equal strength in the power. Even without supernatural powers, I do believe the world would become a significantly better place if we expanded from making some cops wear body cams to making more and more powerful people wear bodycams. Starting with high level regulators and politicians, but I would quite happily expand to religious leaders, bureaucrats, teachers etc. Privacy is overrated. It might seem scary to let others know what kind of porn you enjoy, and we might want to allow for windows where you can turn the cam off, but if everyone was forced to always have a cam on, I do think the world would be a lot better than it is today. Barring dictators, etc. Maybe don't start by implementing this in China.

  Or, if you want to take a harsher approach, then since apparently blessing people with suck is an option, why not just bless people with powerful empathy? Give them supernatural empathy that overrules all their evil desires. It could still be considered a horrendous violation of people's minds, but that's at least way better than killing them.

This works too.

  The obvious solution here is to not use the net impact. Just consider the amount of harm done, with no subtractions. Why was net even considered here? The law doesn't allow people to commit murder no matter how much good they have done or will do.
#+end_quote

That's fair, although the other people I've talked to in the comment tree have talked about net impact, so that's what I went along with. If we change the power to get stronger the more deliberate/indifferent damage you do to others, then that leaves a hypothetical path for cruel people to pretend to be nice all their lives. Although, again, I don't think you realize how impossible that would still be for them.

I remember a professor giving a lecture some time back who talked about a study where they 'substituted' for the teacher for school children of various ages. They were studying how kids reacted to different kinds of rules changes. First they told the kids they were thinking about making it so you don't have to put your hand up today before you talk. Then they asked the kids, if they /did/ make that rules change, would it be ok to talk without raising your hand? Essentially every kid agreed it would then be ok to just talk. Then the experimenters said they were thinking of removing the rule against hitting each other, stealing each other's food and items, etc. They asked the kids, if they removed those rules, would it be ok to do those things now? The vast majority still thought it would absolutely not be ok to do it, because it still hurt other kids, regardless of what the rules were. But a tiny percentage of kids, /exclusively/ kids with behavioural problems, thought that of course it would be ok if the rules said it was ok. They didn't see a qualitative difference between rules against talking without permission and rules against causing bodily harm for fun. These differences persist all the way to adulthood, the only thing that changes is that the people who don't see the difference learn to pretend and give the 'right' answers when asked.

A few years back I was part of a few different mental health forums and a discord. It was fascinating to see how the chat rooms and boards differed for people with different issues and disorders. Lots of people struggle with severe mental illness but still want to be a force for good to the people around them. They feel terrible about having lost control and said something hurtful to a friend, etc. And then you look at the ASPD boards, where they trade tips on how to fuck with the normies, get away with crimes, trade gore pics and complain about how limited and overpriced the supply of real torture videos is on the dark web.

Narcissists by and large aren't /on/ these forums. Those with ASPD know they have it and don't care, which is arguably a lot worse, but people with NPD seem to mostly think the diagnosis is a fake illness invented by jealous psychiatrists who wish they could be as cool of an apex predator as them.
