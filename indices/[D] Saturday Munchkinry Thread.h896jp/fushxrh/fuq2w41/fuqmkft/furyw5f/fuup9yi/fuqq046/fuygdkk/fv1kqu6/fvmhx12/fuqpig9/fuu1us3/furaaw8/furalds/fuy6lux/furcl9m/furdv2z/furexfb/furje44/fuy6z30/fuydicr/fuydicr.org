  sociopathy is an incurable mental disorder, and you think these people deserve to die, because they have a brain disease?

/Everything/ in psychology is ultimately rooted in biology. You are a machine. So am I. You are saying "It's their brain that makes them evil!" as if that means /anything/. They can't be reformed. They can't be treated. They can't be convinced to behave. When a dog gets rabies you don't argue about whether the dog is to blame, you put it down before it can hurt anyone.

There are two interesting places where people with ASPD are overrepresented: Prison and high level leadership positions in business, churches and politics. They are 1% of the population and account for a /majority/ of violent crime convictions, including rape and murder.

There is no salvaging them. If you believe otherwise you should read up on mental illness in general and cluster B personality disorders in particular. Psychiatrists won't even touch ASPD, even the ones who will try to help with the other cluster B disorders.

  While at it, are you also willing to euthanize schizophrenics, or autists?

Slippery slope arguments are generally not very useful.

Schizophrenics have a hell of a bad time, but you'll find a much higher proportion of them in the homeless population than in prison. Some of them do also manage to live full lives with the help of medication and therapy. No such tools exist for managing ASPD.

Autism doesn't compare at all. The worst you can say about severe cases is that they have low quality of life and cost money because they can't take care of themselves. I have plenty of sympathy for people whose worst crime is costing society money.
