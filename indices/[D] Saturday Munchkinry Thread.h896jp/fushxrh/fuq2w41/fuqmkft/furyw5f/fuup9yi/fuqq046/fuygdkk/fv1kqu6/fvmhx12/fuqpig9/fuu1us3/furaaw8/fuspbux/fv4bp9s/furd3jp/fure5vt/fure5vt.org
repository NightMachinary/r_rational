Sure, a tiny minority of them would have gone on to bring us benefits that would have persisted beyond their death. However, I think you fail to realize how destructive these people are on average. Is it worth keeping people who on average destroy ten times as much happiness as your average 'good' person creates on the off chance that one day down the line we'll win the lottery and some of their cruelty will be directed in useful directions? Cruel people sometimes accomplish good things, but they are generally things other people could have done as well. Edison accomplished plenty of great things, but we also know he was a massive douchebag in business and in his private life. Same with Newton, who was a true genius. But how many /millions/ of assholes and frauds and abusers are we prepared to put up with to make sure we don't cull any future Edisons? Newton at least provided quite a big step forward for physics, but Edison's many inventions were things other people were working on as well. At most he brought us a few discoveries a few years or a decade early. Meanwhile he gleefully sabotaged and harassed people like Tesla, and actively obstructed other inventors who he thought were threats to his own reputation and businesses.

We are discussing hypotheticals here. In reality we don't have the resources to objectively judge how nice everyone is. But a magical system that automatically culled almost all criminals and jerks would be amazing. To the extent that these things are genetic, humanity as a whole would improve generation by generation as well.
