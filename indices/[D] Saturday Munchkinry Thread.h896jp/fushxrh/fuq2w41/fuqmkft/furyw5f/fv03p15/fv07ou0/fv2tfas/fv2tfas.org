It's not really in keeping with the spirit of the prompt to give a multipart power, unless that power is "Doing 'X' with the required secondary powers not to kill yourself while doing 'X'. (For example, superspeed without reflexes.)

As a workaround, I suggest picking a CYOA, and have the power be, "apply the results of this CYOA to myself as I would choose to fill out that CYOA." That way they can even choose to opt into the power system, or delay filling it out. Though the difficulty is picking out a well-balanced CYOA.
