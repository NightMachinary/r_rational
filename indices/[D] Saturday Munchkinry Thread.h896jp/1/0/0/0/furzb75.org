Wouldn't that just overwrite one unsubstantiated belief with another?

For example, before using this power I believe that my social skills are kinda meh, but I don't believe this "in the strongest way possible", there are tons of things that could change my mind.

After making myself believe my social skills are amazing so I ace a job interview and then making myself believe my social skills are kinda meh again, will it still be as easy to change my mind?
