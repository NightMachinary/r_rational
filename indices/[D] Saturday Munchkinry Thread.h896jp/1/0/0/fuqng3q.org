  Can I get rid of the false belief after I'm done?
#+end_quote

Sure. If you want to believe A but stop believing it at time T, then make yourself believe "It is /very/ important that I make myself believe A and then, at time T, make myself believe not-A."

Actually, that should work as a general motivation hack.
