Faith.

You can believe whatever you want, and when you believe, you really believe it, in the deepest and strongest way possible. You can create the exact description of what you want to believe in your mind and then you confirm the belief with the snap of fingers, and next second you really believe it. You just rewrite your brain and memories to think it's true and act on it.

For example, you can make yourself believe that you just had the perfect day of your life, or that you just returned from Moon trip, anything.

Of course, you can't gain any outside knowledge this way.

Would you use this power, and if yes, how? Would you try to use it to attain happines? Success? Knowledge?
