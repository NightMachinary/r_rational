You are probably right: I was assuming the safeguards required to transition from energy to mass (I was thinking you'd have to ramp up from energy but I did say proportional to your own mass, so that's not clearly stated) mighty be obvious and sufficient enough. Big picture I'm thinking you can toast yourself and your immediate vicinity, and with sufficient preparation you can set up your own penrose process, or erase your own planet, but sufficient that preparation should be obvious enough that people would be checking up on you or removing you access so you can only give yourself a bad sunburn or cook yourself before it kills you off before you kill off everybody else.
