No mechanism exists that could reasonably result in a hive mind as a result of people being too nice, and wanting outcomes that are good for everyone doesn't mean you don't care about yourself. If you are going to bother to reply at all, at least be serious. This reply is just bizarre. How is a world with more Hermiones and fewer Goyles in any way like a 'non sapient hive mind'? You're being ridiculous.
