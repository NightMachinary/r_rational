> The ability manifests in early adulthood and scales with your *indifference* or desire for other people's suffering.

If people are punished for *INDIFFERENCE* to the suffering of others, then they would be incapable of not acting to save others, even against their best interest, or if the suffering of the other is prerequisite to their happiness. You are basically training people to be constant martyrs if they do not want to die prematurely. Everyone who is not suicidal is forced to be an "altruism machine" 24/7.

Absurdly, it would slowly train people to neglect their own suffering and desires, which will make them more in need of being saved by others, which accelerates the frantic need to practice altruism.

You are basically creating a positive feedback loop between obsessive martyr behavior and rising levels of personal suffering, caused by self-sacrifice.

After several generations pass, and the only living people are those who were always martyrs, there would be no free will for practical purposes. Everyone would basically enslave themselves to the cause of "suffering prevention" 24/7, neglecting everything that makes them a separate person.

You pretty much created an inversion of the Atlas Shrugged scenario.
