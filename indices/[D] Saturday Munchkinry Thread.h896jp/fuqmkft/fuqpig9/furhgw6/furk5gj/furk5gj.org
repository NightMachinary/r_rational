Naturally the 'power' is not perfect. If I could add more criteria I could make society even better. For example, in its current form the power would favour people with William's syndrome, which is not ideal.

However, specifically for the religious folks you mention, the desire for 'divine punishment' or 'god's judgement' would count just as much as normal hate. It doesn't distinguish between "Stone him because he's gay" or "Stone her for not being a virgin," or "Stone him because he shot up a mall." If you hold ill will toward a group and want to see them suffer, you get docked points and fall down the rankings. Naturally, even the least cruel people can be expected to hold ill will /sometimes/, but it's graded on a curve. You only fall down the rankings if you are /more/ cruel than someone else.

We can tweak the system all day long. But as I imagined it, hateful religious folks don't get any kind of pass because of the religion part. If such a system went into effect, religious people full of hate would die off and religious people full of love would remain. You'd probably end up with about the same proportions of Christians, Muslims, Hinduists etc as we have today. Although I suspect we'd end up with fewer atheists, because clearly there is /some/ kind of supernatural shenanigans killing off the baddies and cultivating a kinder humanity. Although it could be aliens, I suppose. Clearly the 'power' would not be strong evidence for any of the currently popular religions.
