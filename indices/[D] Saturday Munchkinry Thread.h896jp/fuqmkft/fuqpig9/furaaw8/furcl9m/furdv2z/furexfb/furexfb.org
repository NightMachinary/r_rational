I wasn't aware that making the connection Antisocial Personality Disorder/Narcissistic Personality Disorder = Bad was considered engaging in a culture war. They cut cleanly through every demographic, from age to race to religion to nationality. The only notable pattern is that ASPD accounts for 1.5% of men versus 0.5% of women. Although in part that may be because women with ASPD get misdiagnosed with Bipolar or Borderline Personality Disorder instead of ASPD.

Frankly I'm a bit upset that you would equate 'Sociopaths are bad' with 'Jews are bad'. If you don't see why that's a disturbing opinion you're right, there probably isn't much point in discussing any further.
