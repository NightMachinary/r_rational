The lat part is blatantly untrue. The main motivation of sociopaths is not to cause harm for harm sake, but selfishness. There is plenty of examples (I would even argue that it is the majority) where the actions of a sociopath can be aligned with the good of society, at least in important aspects, in a way that benefits the sociopath AND us.

Sociopathy is not cartoon Evilness. Its simply pathological lack of emotional empathy. A trait that is pretty damaging in regular relationships with other people, but harmless or even useful in some jobs and lifestyles.

I mean, what would be the harm of a sociopath being say, a researched in far away Arctic outpost? Or a wilderness ranger? Or a lonely farmer who only contacts people once in a while?

Hell, off the top of my head I can think of countless jobs in which sociopathy would be a bonus! Spec Ops, CIA black-bag operatives, spies, bomber pilots, executors, debt collectors, bounty hunters etc, all those people would BENEFIT from being devoid of empathy, since the whole point of their job is to cause destruction and suffering. A normal person is not going to be able to drone-bomb a preschool because there are terrorists hiding in its basement. A normal person would not be able to give someone fatal injection and then go home happy. A normal person will not be able to storm a cartel hideout and shoot 20 people at point blank. But all those things need doing from the perspective of utilitarian greater good.

You also mention that a lot of leaders are sociopaths. Which is completely understandable, since pragmatic ruthlessness is a requirement for effective leadership. A good boss sometimes has to fire someone and thus destroy their life. A politician often decides to cut funding from something, causing thousands of people to die, sink into poverty or homelessness. A general sometimes sacrifices a city full of civilians to win a war.

Basically, a good leader is someone who with unshaking confidence would sacrifice 10 people to save 100, or sacrifice 100 if this choice has a greater long term practical utility.

If you get rid of sociopaths/psychopaths somehow, then each and every of those problems listed above becomes an Outside Context Problem for your civilization.
