  scales with your indifference or desire for other people's suffering.

  Faking empathy doesn't work, because it's based on your internal motivations. Bad people die, including /very/ quickly everyone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.

This seems rather unfair to be honest. People can't really change their internal desires, They can't just arbitrarily decide to want something or not, since a lot of that is very much innate. Otherwise people undergoing torture would just adjust their internal desires to desire being tortured and enjoy the torture.

Furthermore, just because someone desires something doesn't mean they will act on that desire. Desires can overrule one another. For example, I desire eating lots of snacks, but I also desire not becoming overweight, so I use the latter desire to curb my snacking desire and go on a diet instead.

In the same way, someone who desires harm upon others could rationally recognize that such desires are harmful to not just others but themselves as well. Then they can use their desire to avoid self-harm to curb that harmful desire and never act on it.

On the other side of the table, there are also people who desire other's wellbeing, but desire their own wellbeing /more,/ and so regularly take actions that hurt others for their own self benefit. Under the chosen criteria, since these people /do/ care for others, they won't suffer your aging curse at all despite regularly performing evil deeds.

All in all, this is a really terrible metric to use.
