  So far, no one has done anything wrong, but we can sort of see how an epidemic (of zombies) might spread from there, especially since the people who are going to go first are probably the ones with the most training in infectious disease protocol.

Yes. The problem seems to be that you don't get to the point of the whole country beginning to come apart. A few cities, maybe a little bit more than that, but not much more.

  Just look at real world diseases that actually threaten us even without the walking dead involved?
#+end_quote

The primary common factor not shared with the walking dead is that they spread more easily than zombie viruses do. If we made something akin to the flu, maybe even the Spanish Flu, which only turned you into a zombie at some point after it killed you, then we could probably get a further spread than if the disease relied on the transmission of fluids.
