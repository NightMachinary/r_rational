The everyone is infected method can make zombies more viable. In this scenario there is a global infection event and everyone who dies rises as a zombie, biting just causes more immediate turning in living subjects. This means that there are no true safe zones as there is always the risk of resurgence, if you want to make things tougher you could add in a possibility of over-exposure to zombie heavy areas increasing your risk of turning.\\
The Newsflesh trilogy took a similar approach.
