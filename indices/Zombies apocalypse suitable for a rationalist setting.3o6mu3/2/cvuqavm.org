Two stage virus: it had a pretty much unnoticeable first stage which effected 90%+ of the population, and then the first one turned, releasing particles telling the others to turn as well. So, you smell zombie on the wind and it gives a signal to your own dormant virus to switch you into a zombie in the next short while. For maximum effect have this secondary incubation period be about 8-16 hours, so that people can get on planes and such.

Now, some small percentage of the population are naturally immune to zombie-spores or whatever you want to call them. They are not, however, immune to a more concentrated dose of zombie matter like being bitten would provide. And there you have it: believable virus that does the job. Spores spread into the high atmosphere so that even isolated areas turn eventually.

However, you still need to make the zombies actually threatening to humans. Shamblers might seem shocking to domesticated humans, but back in our past we dealt with far most threatening problems than slow moving idiots while we have guns and building to fortify.
