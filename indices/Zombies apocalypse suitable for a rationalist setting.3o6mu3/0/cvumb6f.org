If you want to make the zombies dangerous to humans. I think the most chilling and effective kind of 'zombie' to me would be something closer to the symptoms shown in the film the signal.

Prettymuch the humans are still fully cognizant, have intact memories, functional bodies and all of their skills.

It's just.

Now they want to kill everyone. In simple, sane, rational ways. They just go out and maximize getting the highest body count. They are actually ENTIRELY THE SAME from before their 'turned' EXCEPT that one little tweak.

That is the zombie apocalypse that would horrify me.

The ZOMBIES act rationally, they just had their goal structure cored out and replaced with a simpler and more brutal one.
