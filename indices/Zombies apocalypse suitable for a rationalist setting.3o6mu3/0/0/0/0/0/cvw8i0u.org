I think probably want to kill humans although I suspect the mechanism would also make animal lovers and pet owners want to kill dogs etc.

The murder impulse is probably comparably fuzzy as other base human drives if we want to keep this somewhat plausible.

But it should be prevalent and more or less replace most of the other motivators people feel.

So self preservation is not built in. But the smarter people and thus any rationalist zombies would recognize that if they die then it reduces their body count/murder potential.
