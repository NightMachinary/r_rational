  Increasing their speed, their intelligence, and the rate of infection could all help.

Problem is, result will be more like superheroes than zombies. To balance it out, we can make "zombies" generally intelligent, but mentally unstable.

I was thinking about it once, and imagined world where "zombies" are just like regular humans... except they can't resist temptation to ruin things. If a zombies passes little child, he just HAS to kick him in the ass, even if his moral principles forbid it. And they love destruction too, like blowing things up for the sake of it, or breaking sophisticated machines (more sophisticated, the better).

If that's not enough, zombies can be made very powerful: every of their body cells produces energy from, umm, quantum magic. And infection can be spreaded via air.
