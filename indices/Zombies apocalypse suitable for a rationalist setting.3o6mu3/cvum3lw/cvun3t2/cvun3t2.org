The Night's Dawn Trilogy by Peter F Hamilton does this really well - the dead just start rising and people have to deal with it. It's also in combination with the idea that zombies keep old minds just with different goals.

Just a warning that the series has a huge number of threads going on at once, this may be a benefit or detriment depending on your preferences.
