Well, that wouldn't work with Ebola specifically because the "pooping your guts out" thing is /why/ it's so infectious. Without that it would probably be no more infectious and deadly than HIV. Which is certainly bad, but not end-of-the-world bad.

A nice "biological" approach to zombies that has come out recently are the clickers from "Last of Us". Having those zombies physically attacking people is almost an afterthought given that the pathogen spreads via airborne spores. In that case the zombies become more just a form of transportation to crack open defensive structures and get into peoples' personal spaces. The only downside is that they're still rather more obvious when they're in the infectious stage than someone with the sniffles would be. Maybe make up for it by giving the fungus super hardy spores that can contaminate an area for years?
