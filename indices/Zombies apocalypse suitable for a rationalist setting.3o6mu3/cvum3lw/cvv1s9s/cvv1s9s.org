A long incubation time would be the real killer in any bad disease. Ebola will never spread into a pandemic, it hits you too fast. You get it, and die within a few days. Those few days are spent pucking and shitting out your slowly liquefying internal organs. That doesn't do much to infect the rest of the world.

Now if you took ebola, and changed nothing else but the incubation period. Increasing it to say, three months...that's a long time. You can interact with a lot of people in that time. Sneeze on them, cough on them, have sex with a hooker who then goes on to sleep with a few hundred other people, etc. By the time people start shitting out their innards, half the population is infected and you're past the point of recovery.

So if you made zombieism a virus with an extremely long incubation period, it could get spread to a huge percentage of the population who think the worst they have is a cold. And then they start turning, and all hell breaks loose.

This also plays merry hell for the survivors because, how do you know if someone you meet is infected? They seem and act perfectly normal, everything's fine for two months, and then one day they turn in the middle of your camp.
