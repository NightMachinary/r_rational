I think increasing the incubation time and altering the infection pathways are the keys to making this work. Once a person is zombified it's generally pretty obvious, and generally speaking anything dumber than humans is not going to be much of a threat unless they have an overwhelming numerical advantage. So you need to get lots of people infected before they start turning into zombies.

Personally, I think it might be interesting to stop worrying about making a plausible disease and go back to zombie roots a bit. Make zombies /magical/ again. Turns out hell really is full, or alien attackers are reanimating the dead to serve as their invasion army, or there's a curse on the land that prevents the dead from resting within it. Then you can just set the parameters however you like and come up with solutions within that framework.
