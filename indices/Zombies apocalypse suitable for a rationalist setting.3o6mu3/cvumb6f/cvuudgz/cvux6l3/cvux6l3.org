I think depending on your supernaturality either the people they kill become zombies, or the vector is water or airborne with a long incubation time.

I don't think they DO distinguish between zombies and regular humans. But they DO recognize if a human or a regular zombie is usable in a rational sense.

And from sheer observation I think the zombies would tend to a kind of uneasy truce eventually with each other and any humans that are sufficiently psychotic.
