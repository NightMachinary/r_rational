Here's my minimal list required traits for something to be a zombie:

- It's dead
- It's macroscopic. Viruses are not zombies.
- It doesn't think beyond the most basic level
- Anything it bites will die in a short-ish timeperiod and then become a zombie
- A headshot will drop it instantly. Other than that they aren't unusually resistant to harm, but they can more or less ignore bodily damage short of total destruction.

You can add extra bits -- it can infect through scratching, it can run superfast, etc -- as you like, but the above traits have to be there.

Here's the thing: Zombies just aren't a major danger.

Most of the comments are talking about making the disease airborne, or giving it a longer incubation, or etc. That's not about making /zombies/ a global threat, that's about making a /disease/ a global threat. Whether the disease makes you turn into a zombie or just kills you is irrelevant -- it's the disease that got you, not the zombie.

Sure, zombies can maybe get a town or two, maybe even a big city, but they aren't going to take over a decent-sized country. As soon as word gets out of what's happening the military is going to take them out with machine guns (to the head) and bombs. Even if you could pull it off, you're still limited to, at the very most, one continent, since getting them across oceans requires miraculous luck or intentional human action.
