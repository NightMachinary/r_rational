There are a bunch of variables that you can tweak.

The biggest threat that zombies pose is that they they're an unknown; it would take time for epidemiologists to figure out that anyone bitten, scratched, etc. by someone with the disease will turn into one. I mean ... let's say that we're in a city of 80,000 people (which I am). I get attacked by some random guy who wanders into my backyard, he scratches me, I beat him to death with a crowbar, then what? I call the police, they come to the scene, and I eventually wind up in the hospital. While I'm there, my symptoms get progressively worse, meaning that there are lots of doctors and nurses around me. And that's when I turn. I attack the nurses and doctors; I wind up giving minor wounds to three of them. And it's entirely possible that they just think it's rabies or something like that and elect not to enact quarantine/isolation protocols. So far, /no one has done anything wrong/, but we can sort of see how an epidemic (of zombies) might spread from there, especially since the people who are going to go first are probably the ones with the most training in infectious disease protocol.

If the question is how to tweak the variables such that zombies are an actual threat ... I don't know. Just look at real world diseases that actually threaten us even without the walking dead involved?
