I wouldn't say that most zombie movies do that. 28 days later style zombies are more popular now- fast super angry zombies with quick infection.

Films have done some additional things to make zombies deadly.

Super zombies. If 1/100 zombies turns into some sort of augmented zombie that can take on military forces then you have a force which can scale in size to match the actual military which is currently around 0.5% of the populace in America, with less being frontline combat troops.

You can have this coupled with their flesh eating traits, as Andrei Kruz did. What if the more people they eat the greater their strength, abilities, intelligence gets? If you contain it early you're good, but if you leave them to gestate they're a lot harder to kill.

You can have a wider range of zombies. Dresden did this. Extinct species coming back to life and attacking people means you have a notably larger population of zombies.
