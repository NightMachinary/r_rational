This is going to be rationalist, right? It's not easy. Danny Boyle and Robert Kirkman both took the easy way out, skipping a month of time, bypassing the whole, "how did society get so fucked?" question. I've been stewing on this for a while....

First define "zombie". 28 Days Later isn't a "zombie" film according to purists. They're living humans that can be killed with enough damage, not just brain trauma. Non-zombies have some advantages to create an apocalypse. But disadvantages for a rationalist work. Fast zombies use a lot of energy and are limited to human mechanics. World War Z (the movie) style leaping doesn't work. You could concoct some "zombie fungus-strengthening the muscles" thing, but that doesn't work with a quick "infection to zombie" turnaround. And where does energy come from? If they're only eating hot flesh, they're going to run a calorie deficit almost immediately. John Ringo's books do an ok job with that. His zombies are driven into a murderous rage at the sight of normal people, but they do need food and water.

Even slow zombies need an energy source. How can they survive underwater and on land? And in a dark closet for a year? How can that be possible according to physics, much less biology? Where are the kcals coming from? Attack that question. Do they use photosynthesis? Do they hibernate?

Also, we live in a world with a substantial zombie literature. That's one of the hacks that Kirkman used in the Walking Dead. That's a world without zombies in popular culture. In TWD, people didn't understand how they worked (hence the big "we're all infected" reveal). Nowadays, first sign of a zombie epidemic and it's "headshot to recently dead grandma" all day long. Even airborne viruses take a long time to spread. Some rural places in, say Wyoming, would be weeks behind, say NYC. And they'd be watching it all on YouTube.

Finally, I think most apocalyptic fiction ignore the resiliancy of human societies. In the shittiest of times, people figure out ways to trade and to trust and protect each other. It'd be hard to get to an apocalypse-level, even with the dead rising. Personally, I don't think you can do a zombie apocalypse with "just" a zombie virus (I prefer a fungus). Human systems are pretty tough, it takes multiple failures to create a big disaster.

I am working on a little TWD fan fiction where yes, there's a zombie virus, but around the same time, right as people are fleeing the cities the road, as hysteria has peaked, an EMP hits, destroying most electronic-based technology. Was it a coincidental coronal mass ejection? Intentional terrorist attack? They're not sure yet. And may never know. Planes drop, cars stop. That pumps up the level of zombies pretty quick. No Internet, no phones. It's One Second After meets the Walking Dead. Then (following Forschten), those living with medical assistance start dying. And then, death from starvation. It's the only way I can see justifying an apocalypse.
