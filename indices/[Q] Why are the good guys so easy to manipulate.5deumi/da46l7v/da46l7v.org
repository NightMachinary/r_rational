People are easy to manipulate if you understand their goals and values; if you know what is important to someone then you can leverage that knowledge to motivate them.

"Society" is a single word that means (very approximately) "an agreed-upon set of goals and values designed to let humans live and work together." Those goals and values are things like "value other people's lives", "treat other people respectfully", "don't steal", "defend other people's property and life", and so on.

The word "good" means (very approximately) "someone who conforms closely to idealized versions of the societally-defined goals and values." If someone is good then by definition they are conforming to a well-known set of goals and values, which makes them predictable.
