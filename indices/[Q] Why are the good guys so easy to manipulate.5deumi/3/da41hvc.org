I think any non-stereotypical evil character would be equally easy to coerce. "Evil" doesn't necessarily mean "perfectly selfish"; even Hitler loved his mother (to the extent that he was incredibly grateful to the Jewish doctor that administered her palliative care), Eva Braun, and probably others.

This is a classic technique in fiction to give the hero a reason they can't just save the day easily. Superman /could/ stop the crashing airplane, but can he also save Lois? Spoiler: yes, he can, but for a moment you think he can't.
