Ok, I will try:

- Social connections i.e. friends and close acquaintances are good as they ground the person and give additional options, though they should be gotten in a way that the opponents don't know who they are (don't leave meta data).

- Should be used to public hate (if talking fiction let the person be a child of a minor politician or having attempted to ban drinking on Fridays etc.), this means that if the opponents use slander tactics they will be resistant.

- Ideally don't reveal the goals until completion (mysterious beats sneaky)

- Asexual (or some other difficult to attack orientation)

- Hard to manipulate hobbies e.g. wood carving

- Having "Blue and Orange Morality" might help if the opponents can't guess...
