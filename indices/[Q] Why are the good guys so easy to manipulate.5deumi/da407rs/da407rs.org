I don't think there's anything, like...unrealistic or unreasonable about a protagonist being successfully coerced with threats to a loved one. Humans are humans, not emotionless utility maximizers. Most people would go to extraordinary lengths to save the life of someone they genuinely loved. While it's frustrating when protagonists go so far as to risk many other lives to save their loved one, that /is/ "playing it like normal"--it's what humans do.

Protagonists willing to sacrifice their loved ones for the greater good can be fun, but it's not bad fiction to have an antagonist successfully exploit the protagonist's realistic vulnerability.
