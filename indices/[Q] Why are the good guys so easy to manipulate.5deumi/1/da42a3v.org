Hermione memory wipes her parents and sends them to Australia so she can't be manipulated, since she's traveling with everyone else she cares about. Part of her distress from Ron leaving was probably related to him becoming a weakness if targeted or captured.

A rational character who's aware of the danger of threats to their loved ones will take steps to protect against that weakness, be it through misdirection, obfuscation, protection, avoidance, and/or tactics and strategy in the event of contact with the enemy.

I can perhaps see a naive rational character not conceiving that an enemy would target non-combatants, and leaving that flank exposed, but for most cautious rational characters they'll consider their weaknesses and take steps to mitigate them.

If caught unawares, and a loved one is captured, then any protagonist will probably try to save their loved one at the cost of finishing other highly prioritized tasks, e.g. killing the bad guy. Perhaps in rational fiction they'll risk the life of their loved one if the loved one has a short life expectancy and no more secrets or pearls of wisdom to share. Otherwise, like the Tropical Sea-Haired One said, humans are humans.
