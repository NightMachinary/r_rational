  Hermione memory wipes her parents and sends them to Australia so she can't be manipulated

Errr...false. It was more so that they would be safe since, as unconnected Muggles, they didn't exactly have a wealth of options to defend themselves with. Other people had relatives, magical hideouts, fidelius charms...Hermione's parents didn't have any of those options. Not to mention, it's rational that Voldemort would have trouble tracking them down if they left the country as he's not very connected with the Muggle side of the world. Sending them away made the most sense.

Note: I'm not saying securing your loved ones isn't an effective tactic to prevent manipulation; I'm saying it's made explicitly clear in the HP series that this is *NOT* the main reason Hermione does this.
