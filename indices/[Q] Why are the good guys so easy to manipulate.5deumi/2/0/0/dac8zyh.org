I remember reading some advice of "what to do if someone tries to kidnap you", and it's all basically "scream, yell, kick, run, do whatever you can to get attention".

They might have a gun to your back, or a knife on your throat, and say if you make a noise they'll shoot you, or stab you, or whatever, but if they're willing to shoot/stab you in public, who the hell knows what they're willing to do with you when they get to where they want you.

So I think the "they'll kill me anyway" thing is, indeed, a really important connection that isn't made enough in fiction.
