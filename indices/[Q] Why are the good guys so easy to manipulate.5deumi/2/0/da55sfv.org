I saw the tail end of a Star Trek episode recently where Ambassador Spock refused to bow to pressure from terrorists, since he expected them to kill him regardless. Making that simple "they'll kill me anyway" connection should be on the list of Top 100 Things I'd Do if I Ever Became a Hero, because lots of them foolishly ignore it. Seriously, you put your gun down and expect your nemesis /not/ to shoot you? That's a blatant appeal to the scriptwriters.
