I get that; I understand Batman's main "power" is his remarkable intelligence (and it's becoming increasingly more difficult for me to accept that someone so hyper intelligent's answer to a crime ridden city is run around and beat up thugs, supervillains not withstanding, considering Joe Chill wasn't anything special)

But still, I feel like it's fairly simple to force his hand with something like that. He's a hero. He's given himself up for hostages before (I believe anyway, I'm not a comic book guy really)
