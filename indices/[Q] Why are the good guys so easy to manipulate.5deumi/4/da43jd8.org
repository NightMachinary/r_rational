Direct answer: Society's definition of "good" is pretty synonymous with "predictable". A "good" character is usually someone /dependable,/ who always does what he's supposed to, he may need some encouragement to get the ball rolling, but he'll eventually follow the pattern that the baddies set up for him and attempt to rescue the girl/kid/stop the nefarious plan, because that's what "good guys" do...

The other side of this is that often, in order to overcome the enemy, the good guy has to break out of his good guy stereotype to finish the job. Either by a sudden burst of creativity, or even dirty-deeding the dirty dealers themselves /because they'll never see it coming/... Works every time.
