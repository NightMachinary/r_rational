  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

Nope, see below.

  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Nope. Let's start a company because...

#+begin_quote
  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
#+end_quote

Nope. Look at the most recent fight, and judge the "intelligence" on display there.

Nope, but that's a high bar to pass.

  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

Yup. The system of adventurers and the Watch broadly makes sense, along with plate hunters, organized empires, etc.
