1. Rain uses his knowledge of programming to improve his interface and get greater value out in of his auras

2. Rains has multiple goals that are explicit stated: he wants he help people affected by the rank shift, he want to keep himself and his friends save, he wants to create a way for driven individuals to awaken.

3. On this point we can argue all we want. If you think the creation of ascension was dumb and useless this point isn't fullfil es, if you like it you do. In addition it seems to me that some people seem to think a rational fiction needs an mc that power wanks everyone while functioning like a computer.

4. No rain doesn't spend time going is rationality. But he is spending a lot of time on introspection and his clarity induced memory could arguably be counted in that direction.

Edit: hurr durr numbers don't go big, story bad
