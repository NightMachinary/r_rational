  3b) Recognize that early Delve (1-50?) likely brought more people to this subreddit than anything not on the podium (HPMOR, etc)

Huh? Just out of curiosity, how long have you been here? Or by ‘podium' do you mean some tautology like ‘precisely all stories that brought more people here than Delve.'

As an aside, this community is mature enough I don't think ‘work which clashes with its values and causes contention brought a /bunch/ of outsiders here' would be a plus anyway.
