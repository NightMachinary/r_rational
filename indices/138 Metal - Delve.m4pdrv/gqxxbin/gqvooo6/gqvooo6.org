Some might call it a bit of a do-nothing chapter, but by those standards it was pretty fun at least, leagues better than the bastion-fest last week. Of all the random POVs we get at various times Tallheart is one that didn't seem random and wasted.

Honestly, I would love if the story experimented with restricting POV to like, Rain, Tallheart, and Amelia. Whatever the flaws they have at least they get consistent focus, offer decent variety, and all interact with each other frequently.
