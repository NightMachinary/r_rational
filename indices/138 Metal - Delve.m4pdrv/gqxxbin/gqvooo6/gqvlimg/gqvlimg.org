Rune system is a pain don't see a way to exploit it since the only explanation of cap linits are "runes won't allow it" and "cap determined by metals used". It doesn't explain how different metal caps is explained either.

Since he's using different metals with different caps that means caps are using the highest cap as long as you have enough material for it. Meaning you could slap a plate of very high tier cold resistance armor and get a high cold resistance cap as long as you have the right rune combination and material for it.
