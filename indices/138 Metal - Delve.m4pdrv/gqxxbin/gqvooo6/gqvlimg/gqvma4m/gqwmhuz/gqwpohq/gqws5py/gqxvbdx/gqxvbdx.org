  More people on this sub -> more people writing rational stories -> better rational stories for me to read. That's my opinion.

It sadly doesn't work that way. The more it deviates the more likely the community is to split. [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is supposed to be about stories that follow what we consider rational fiction, the moment that deviates too much people will go / create better places for finding those types of stories.

The sub should grow, that's beneficial and something most people should want, but it should grow because more people that enjoy those stories learn about it. Not because unrelated deviating stories get posted here.
