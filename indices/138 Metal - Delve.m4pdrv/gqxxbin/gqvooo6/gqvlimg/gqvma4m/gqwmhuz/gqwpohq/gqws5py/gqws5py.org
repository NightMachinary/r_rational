Idk, Probably ~8 months? I don't know how to check besides going back through my comments.

Early Delve chapters generated a ton of comments and upvotes, consistently. I remember reading through them after I read each chapter when I picked this story up. It started falling off and now interaction is the lowest it's ever been.

As far as the podium comment I made, it was half in jest and half what I actually believe. I think HPMOR clearly generated a ton of interaction on this sub/for rational writing, from my POV maybe the most? Delve did the same, to a lesser extent.

I don't agree with your comment on outsiders. More people on this sub -> more people writing rational stories -> better rational stories for me to read. That's my opinion.
