1) Delve chapter gets posted

(pick one)

2a) Complaint about level cap

2b) This is not a rational story

3a) when the level cap is raised on patreon there *will* be someone who posts about it. Until then, read other shit.

3b) Recognize that early Delve (1-50?) likely brought more people to this subreddit than anything not on the podium (HPMOR, etc)

4) do it all over again next week

Until then, I think everyone who isn't a patron should have recognized that this is not a story worth reading every week. Hide these posts and move on.
