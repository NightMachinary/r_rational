Okay, I finally got around to binge reading this thing, and wow this is good. The logic and reasoning behind everything is really pretty solid - only the conclusion about there being a traitor felt like it was pulled out of thin air to me. The rest really made me feel like I was part of the group, trying to figure things out as it went along.

The pacing and tension is really good too. Very curious to see where this is heading - I'm hoping this will eventually progress to them dismantling the demon invasion itself, somehow.

(Also, I keep imaging HJPEV as being one of the kids in this school. Anyone else think a crossover would be pretty sweet?)
