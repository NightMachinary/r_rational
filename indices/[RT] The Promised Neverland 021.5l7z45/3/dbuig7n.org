I wonder what Krone lied about that the children didn't catch.

Krone knows that destroying the tracker will send off an alert (presumably since it will stop sending a signal). It seems weird that she says it shouldn't send an alert if you cut off the earlobe. Maybe these trackers aren't that sophisticated, but this could also be one of Krone's lies.
