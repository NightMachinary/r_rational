If it isn't rational, but it's fanfiction, then maybe it should go to [[/r/fanfiction]] or [[/r/parahuman]] or, I don't know, [[/r/marvel]] or [[/r/ironman]] if that exists.

There have been repeated concerns over the possible dilution of this subreddit, which I think is entirely reasonable. If a work isn't rational or rationalist then it shouldn't be here.

I hope you can understand where we're coming from.
