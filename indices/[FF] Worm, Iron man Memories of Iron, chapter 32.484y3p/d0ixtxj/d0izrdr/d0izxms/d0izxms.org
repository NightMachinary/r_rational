Meh, people on this sub are adults. We can make reminders/alerts for any stories we're interested in.

Obviously this is just a suggestion, as there aren't any strict rules for this, but I would suggest leaving "update" posts only for the stories that are distinctly rational and of high quality; which this fic doesn't necessarily meet.

Otherwise we're going swamped with stories that are just barely rational and more "look at this cool superpower!". Someone recommended /The Gamer/, for crying out loud!
