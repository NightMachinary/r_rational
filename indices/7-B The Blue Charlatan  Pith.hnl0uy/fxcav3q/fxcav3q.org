Ayyy. Great to see some rationalization from Ana's angle as to her actions. Very true to character for a person with a single achievable goal but several, often contradictory paths to achieve it. Interesting to see how well Ana's and Copycat's abilities interact, and to see how quickly countermeasures to her illusions can be dealt with.

Some confusion as to whether Wes is wallowing or scheming. My bet is on scheming.

Also excited to see how well r!Clementine will have reacted to someone who knew her house inside out(Ana) being a known enemy :) .
