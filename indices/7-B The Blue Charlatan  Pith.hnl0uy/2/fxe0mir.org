So, let's decide how much of what Brin says is bullshit!

#+begin_quote
  “I'm here to warn you: Paragon has launched an investigation into you.”
#+end_quote

This warning is obviously legitimate, and I suspect everything he shares with her on this front (such as how much info they have on her) is true. He has reason to protect his investments.

#+begin_quote
  “You're not understanding,” he said. “The system is designed to protect against anyone being compromised, including me. If I try to shut down an investigation, that'll send up flags. I'll get blocks placed on me.”
#+end_quote

I also think this is true, or close enough to matter. In this sort of world, with these kinds of powers in play, you sort of /have/ to take the measures he's describing. I suspect he's downplaying his level of power and influence somewhat, but only to make the reality of the situation more palatable for Ana. I suspect the truth is that it's less "I can't do jack shit" and more "There are things I could do that might help, but it wouldn't help /much/ and it would cost me a great deal, so it's not happening."

#+begin_quote
  “I wasn't a bully. I did everything I could.” He raised his voice. “You don't know where I come from. You have no right to judge me.”
#+end_quote

I doubt Brin was needlessly malicious and cruel like Lorne, but I don't think he really cares about the fact that people like Lorne thrive under the current system beyond a vague "yeah, that's probably bad" kinda way. He's openly nostalgic for a time when the system was even more oppressive, unequal, and stratified than it is now and makes his disdain for progressive political elements clear whenever he mentions them. I suspect he's more critical of Lorne's motives than his actual actions.

#+begin_quote
  “You knew Wes was an Ebbridge, didn't you?”

  “Yes.”

  “And you still let him use me, put me at risk, throw me into the fire. Why?”

  “Because I thought you two would work together,” he said.

  “Because you want to use us.” After thinking about it, I was fairly certain he'd only threatened Jun to pressure him into joining us.

  He shook his head. “That's not it.”
#+end_quote

Nah, that's it. Like, I'm sure he sort of vaguely hopes all his mercernaries will thrive in his service and live vastly improved lives thanks to it, and he might even make some of his arrangements keeping an eye vaguely towards that, but he's chiefly concerned with how useful they'll be. He put Ana and Wes together because he thought they'd work well together and be useful to him, and while he might have had some ideas about how they might be good for each other on a personal level or something, that didn't drive his decision making.

#+begin_quote
  “I donate the vast majority of my paycheck,” said Brin. “You think I live in a mansion like an Epistocrat?”
#+end_quote

The only way I buy this is if he considers the payments he makes to his shady mercs "donations." I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he doesn't technically have money to spring for a new body for Ana, but that would be because the money is earmarked for other purposes (paying other mercs, bribes, emergency body replacements for irreplaceable and much more valuable assets, etc.), not because he doesn't actually have it.

I'll also buy the fact that he lives relatively austerely for someone of his status and income level, but I suspect "relatively" is doing a shitton of work in that sentence.

#+begin_quote
  “I don't want your sympathy,” he snapped. “What I meant to say is -- I've buried a lot of soldiers. But if I tried to bury you, I think you'd claw your way out of the grave, even if your coffin was buried a hundred feet deep. Even if it took a decade.” He looked into my eyes. “I push you because every time you break, you end up a little stronger.”
#+end_quote

I think he's genuinely impressed with Ana's progress and determination, but not to this extent. He thinks she's a remarkably stubborn kid, but if she died tomorrow his only surprise would come from the fact that it took so long. He's also just flat out lying about his "tough love" "I push you to make you stronger" shit. Sure, he wants her to get stronger, that's good for him and he probably even gets to feel like a good person for a little bit whenever she shows improvement, but he's really just wringing as much use out of her as he can.

I like the meetings with Brin, it's fun to try and figure out how sincere he is and just what game he's playing at.
