To be fair, the Guardians aren't exactly the "good guys" either. The Principality is an oppressive and highly xenophobic regime that enforces a rigidly caste based society, the Guardians are the chief means by which that regime exerts power and enforces their authority, and the culture of Paragon (which is where Guardians come from) actively encourages Guardians to be less like Kaplen and more like Lorne. I'd honestly like to say that the Greenhands are the closest thing we have to the "good guys," except that their organization and movement has been completely co-opted by a mysterious conspiracy with unclear goals but which regularly employs fairly horrific tactics, so... yeah, there's no real group I'd call the "good guys," everybody's just shitty and awful in different ways.
