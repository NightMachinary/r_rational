Not sure how rare illusion vocations, or a vocation that could be confused as illusions, are but could this mean Ana won't ever be able to officially reveal her Vocation? Seems like that would kind of gimp her dream of being a Guardian.

It was nice to see Ana's viewpoint on the whole murdering-someone-and-taking-their-body thing (though not in that order), I'm not sure I agree with her choice, mostly because she seems to be essentially gambling with her life that a better option will work out, but I imagine not having official papers for the body you occupy would limit one's future options too.
