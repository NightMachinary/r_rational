It's... Bastion! I do love the chapter titles. Holding down M1 for Bastion is the way he gets POTG, but I thought it was Symmetra at first because she can too. I wonder how long this has been planned because I think this story started before the Bastion and Torbjorn thing was revealed.

Also, Athena appears to be blue team, but oh boy she's scary.
