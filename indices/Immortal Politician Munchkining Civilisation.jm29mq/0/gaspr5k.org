I think the main thing will be the ability to keep the peace.

Watch Matthew Colville's videos about politics, specifically the ones about how war is the natural state of human civilization, and how prolonged peace is only possibly due to concerted ongoing effort by dedicated diplomats.

Not being at war is of course a boon to civilian economic development, progressive social dynamics, and scientific advancement. Political stability above all else is the key to the creation of lasting superpowers.

Your immortal character would basically spend 90% of their work life convincing belligerent short-sighted political figures to not declare war. Perhaps even attempt to convince the public that war is in fact horrible. This will be difficult.
