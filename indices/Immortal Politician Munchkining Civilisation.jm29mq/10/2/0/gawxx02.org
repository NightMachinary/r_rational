Not really. It seemed to me that it was tacked on at the end.

Although Asimov went back and wrote a prequel to the original Foundation novel that had the same character in it, to show that he had been involved in events all along. One of the secondary characters of Foundation may have even been retconned into being that same immortal character; I don't remember.
