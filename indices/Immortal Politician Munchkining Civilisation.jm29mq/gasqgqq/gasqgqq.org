Though not quite the same, the entire sub-genre of 'self insert' alternate history is vaguely similar. A character from the future (sometimes the author, sometimes not) wakes up in the body of some past ruler or other important person. The most common route after that is to attempt some form of civilizational uplift - medicine, technology, social structures. Occasionally, that character is reborn again and again as their heir, allowing them to rule all the way to the modern day. More often they only get the one extra life though.
