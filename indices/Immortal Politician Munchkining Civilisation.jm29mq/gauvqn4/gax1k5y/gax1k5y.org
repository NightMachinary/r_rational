That does assume that you're the "can't be killed" category of immortal, rather than the weaker "will not die naturally" version. And some varieties of "can't be killed", e.g. Leareth from A Song For Two Voices, aren't good enough; he reincarnates quickly when killed, but not necessarily near his previous location, and he takes some time to reestablish continuity of memory and self. That would be insufficient to be an implacable eternal king with a monopoly on legitimacy.
