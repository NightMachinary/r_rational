[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red][A Journey of Black and Red]] might be worth a look. It's about a vampire living in the 19th century united states. More of an adventure story really, but the protagonist is immortal and has political aspirations. (though it takes a while to get there)
