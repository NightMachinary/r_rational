If you're an immortal leader, I don't think you need to do /literally anything/ to muchkin civilization aside from being an immortal king and not being awful at the job. One of the primary issues with governance is the peaceful transfer of power from one generation to the next and the resolution of disputes when there is no higher authority to arbitrate.

The immortal king is basically cheat codes for infinite authority and his authority flows downward. If you're a subordinate duke/noble/mayor having a succession crisis, normally IRL you'd fight it out. Normally you could fight him or hope his succesor thinks different/is too weak to enforce it/doesn't care, but that's not the case here. The immortal king has been around since before your family existed and will survive until after you're dust, and he is always in a position to arbitrate /and enforce/ succession issues. This essentially ends all significant internal conflict on an empire level.

On a practical level, the immortal king would be a combined secular and religious ruler. The country could likely expand to the limits of what can be controlled by a single person without much trouble (roughly the height of Rome until new tech is invented). Beyond those borders, it would be wise to engage in holy wars to create buffer states of believers of the Immortal King, but aren't directly under his administration.

Anything beyond that comes down to your beliefs on what drives human advancement. Some people believe that if you've got enough people with enough food/free time, then advancement will follow afterward as people are free to get educated and invent. In that case, this empire auto-wins handily. If you believe that instead conflict and changing civilization level pressures are required to push forward humanity and avoid internal signaling spirals, then the Immortal King would need to engage in some A-B testing for his provinces.

Regardless of what you do, he's got insanely strong cheat codes on. Depending on the time period, I'd say it's arguably better than 'infinite money' or 'infinite food'.
