Remember that people would easily notice that after few generations their leader is not aging. This could be used at you advantage (could give you a godlike status), but could also put you in danger (assasination attempts, etc).

By the way, making the leader really 'hard to kill' would open much more possibilities, because he could also act as warrior or help with scientific experiments.
