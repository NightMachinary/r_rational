There is a side character in a RT-Fantasy story called Mother of Learning: Quatach-Ichl, a millenia-old Lich, king of a state formed by undead nobility who were all-at-once exiled from the biggest empire of the land. There isn't much treatment of how he ran his society, but there was clearly a significant transhumanist element to their particular focus on Soul Magic and long-distance teleportation.
