The first thing that comes to mind is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480][A Song For Two Voices]], but it's not a great match and the explanation is a moderate spoiler. It's not the main protagonist who fits your description. The main antagonist, Leareth, is someone who has done exactly that for two millennia. He frequently has private conversations with the main protagonist, Vanyel, via a shared lucid dream, in which they talk about the subject and what he's tried, and why he is currently trying a different, horrifying plan which requires invading Valdemar.
