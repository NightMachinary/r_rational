Is there some other way of giving the protagonist crippling suicidal depression you'd prefer? It's only a slight exaggeration to say that you did not actually read any of A Song for Two Voices; book 1 is essentially a prequel.

IIRC, ASfTV actually adds far more agency to Tylendel than canon; it's implied during his death scene that he has Foresight of Vanyel becoming the ridiculously powerful mage who can save Valdemar and that it requires the trauma he's about to be put through, and that Tylendel has a genuine choice between he and Van's well-beings and Valdemar's future, and chooses Valdemar. That definitely isn't in canon.
