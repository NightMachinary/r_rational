A definite issue. Unless there was something keeping you thinking and moving on a human timescale, you'd need a human-scale effective government to do your day-to-day operations for you.

I've seen short fiction pieces where immortals effectively sit in a room thinking, and by the time they've made a decision about something like lunch, generations or centuries have passed, and entire cultures have risen and fallen. If they're thinking about what to do about a particular political problem, everyone involved in the original problem is dead and if the problem itself is anything more than a footnote in history, it may have warped all out of recognition.
