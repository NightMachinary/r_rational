No, personality is almost entirely irrelevant. This is a fact about human psychology as shaped by evolutionary pressure in hunter-gatherer environments. Charismatic people create echo chambers automatically unless they work very hard to prevent it, and often even if they /do/ work hard to prevent it. The higher the status differential (and it's a safe bet that an immortal emperor would max that out) the stronger this effect gets.
