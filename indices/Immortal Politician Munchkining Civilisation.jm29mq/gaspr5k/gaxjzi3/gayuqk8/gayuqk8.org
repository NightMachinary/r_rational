True, but the World Wars also collectively killed slightly more people than the Spanish Flu, and the Cold War almost killed everyone several times. Whatever benefit they had, knowledge wise, was almost certainly not worth it in terms of the human costs; not only of the wars themselves, but the impact to political ideology.

And the World Wars happened due to rapid changes in the political power structures in the form of German unification, followed by a period of peace caused by the efforts of several diplomats. Extending such a period of peace is feasible; the World Wars started more or less because these people died. It is also possible to go about unification-like power structure changes slowly enough that nobody will notice.
