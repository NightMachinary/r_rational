People dying is not the same as civilization dying. Setting the threat of nuclear weapons aside for the moment, I'm not at sure we can know the technological advancements brought on by the competitive conditions of WWII and the cold war weren't "worth it" on a macro scale. Its unethical on a personal level but if we are talking purely at the civilization level they may indeed have driven worthwhile changes and advancements. The space program probably wouldn't exist without the cold war, and while you can argue that private companies are now pushing that front, the execs driving those projects probably wouldn't have been as inspired to do so without NASAs accomplishments.
