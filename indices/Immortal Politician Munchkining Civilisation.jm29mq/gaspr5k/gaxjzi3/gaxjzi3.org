  Not being at war is of course a boon to civilian economic development, progressive social dynamics, and scientific advancement.

That's not necessarily true. It is certainly true that peace can allow more resources to go towards advancing civilization, and long-term instability is a problem for a region, but there's also an argument that occasional wars are really important for preventing stagnation. The World Wars, for example, played a huge role in women's rights and mostly ended colonialism, while the Cold War was a huge contributor to technological advancements. Having an outside threat does a lot to unite people and get them to work together for the better of the country as a whole, in the absence of one people will make a much bigger issue out of small disagreements.
