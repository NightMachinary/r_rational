Asimov originally created the three laws as a deliberately broken logical framework for writing detective stories and similar puzzles in a science fiction universe. They were never supposed to actually be real or realistic, they were designed to be broken in an interesting way.

The problem is Asimov started taking them seriously, to the point that when he was watching 2001 for the first time he loudly complained that HAL was breaking first law.

So I can't take the development of the zeroth law seriously. It's all part of this huge retcon from an Asimov who'd caught fandom disease.
