I would recommend the quest "What Can SV Teach an Evil Sorceress? writing, roads, bloomeries, gunpowder, & sailing, maybe" over on Sufficient Velocity. It involves the quest participants communicating with Immortal Ruler with timeskips showing how she takes advantage of their advice and information. I think it does a great job showing some of the difficulties in actually pursuing the whole "uplift" plan in the real world and the limitations that even an Immortal Ruler will operate under.

Here is a brief biography of the Immortal Ruler:

Bianca the Undying is a small, evil woman who knows magic and has not died, despite looking like she probably should have at some point. Her early life took place in the Paleolithic, in which she has said that she traveled around quite a bit and came to understand the malleable nature of populations of people and animals and even the land itself. At some point she was trapped underground, to her displeasure. She remained trapped for a /very/ long time.

When Bianca got out, she found her way to a community of eight tribes living pastoral and agrarian lifestyles in the local Copper Age. She made these people hers and they relied on her for magically enriching their fields so that they did not need to slash, burn, and move around a bit, unlike their neighbors. Bianca and her followers formalized their relationships into the Eight Ways Pact. Later, another tribe joined Bianca's followers bringing small horses and the Bronze Age and their pact was updated with a ninth directive.

Bianca has an agenda that requires her to have more power than she does right now. She believes that achieving divinity will get her that power.
