It is not, but makes some of the weirder setting elements (there's a religion which is not widely believed, but is literally true) look less random.

However, those same elements make it fairly major spoilers for the ending of PMMM, and PMMM is /short/, so I would strongly recommend watching it. Not necessarily before starting To the Stars, but probably before Vol. 2 of TtS.
