I started reading the collection you linked two which is entitled "A Song for Two Voices", although I admit I didn't read much beyond the first part. I don't know if there's some other way that I would have preferred, and I don't blame the author for following their source material, but it does bother me enough that I haven't been able to get myself to return to the rest of the material. So it's just not for me, and anyone who is ok with spoilers can see why and decide for themselves if they still want to read it.
