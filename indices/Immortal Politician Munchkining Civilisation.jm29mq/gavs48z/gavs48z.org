You might be interested in something like CK3 if you wanted to try your hand at doing this in medieval sims slash grand strategy game yourself. Others have noted that the transition of power is a difficult time for society prone to rebellions and upheaval that hurts commerce and science.

One thing that wasn't mentioned so far is that an immortal ruler had time to become increasingly competent at ruling. Naturally the assumption on most of these stories is that the SI is already competent. But that's mostly just munchikining.

In fact being immortal one might have personal experience in governing certain areas of the realm and know lots of local traditions and be known in folk tales. They will have large amounts of fame and prestige that command respect. They will know all of the feudal vassals from birth. It's kinda hard to rebel against a king who taught you when you were five and not feel like a rambunctious child.

You might know more of the terrain in your realm during climate cycles. You also have a different mentality when looking at infrastructure. Kings can look at new roads and say "I want to invade my neighbor so let's build a road" but an immortal can say "we will get slightly more trade and scientific advantage by interacting with more people" by building that road. This makes reinvesting a great idea.

An immortal king might be able to father immortal children. Which has problems and benefits. But even if not they can tie themselves to nearby dynasties bc they will outlive their partners. Still being married to one neighbors daughter after being married to another neighbors sister and another neighbors aunt would likely cause more peace in the area.

You also have a great way of controlling the public opinion via propoganda and blackmail. If you're the only person still alive from 200 years ago, no one can really argue with your version of events.
