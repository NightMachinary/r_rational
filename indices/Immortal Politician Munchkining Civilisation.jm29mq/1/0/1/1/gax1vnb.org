  Given real world examples of people being willing to alter their entire conceptions of reality even when it requires literally impossible logical leaps because a charismatic figure asked them too... I don't think calcification of society would be an issue for the God-King.

What? No. That is a large part of why it would be an issue for The Emperor. Charismatic people aren't immune to their own charisma, and reflected charisma (everyone around you thinking you're wonderful and ineffable) doubly so. They will believe whatever you tell them, but /so will you/. If you were in this position, you would calcify just as much as your bureaucracy.
