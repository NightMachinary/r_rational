There is a difference between an echo chamber and the literal inability to find alternative views. Once you know you are surrounded by yes-men, it is remarkably easy to dismiss their opinions as meaningless repetition, hell just pronounce something obviously stupid every now and then to see if you've got any genuine company that will point it out.But your own ability to progress is unhindered, particularly when you can phrase investigative requests well. Hell, if we are going full brutal god-king then I imagine your servants would get the picture by about the 3rd time batch of executions for providing a report that simply said "all your ideas were great and nothing is wrong with them" that you preferred a more critical outlook.The key issue as to why it would be so easy is because we have passed the key threshold from 'significant' power to 'absolute'. Normal Charismatic people have restrictions on the measures they can take; once a Cult of Personality has settled in, you do not.

(The inverse is also true, it is entirely possible, and I would argue more likely, to spiral into increasing levels of moral perversion and debauchery. If we are going to through in evolutionary pressure, then I'd wager the human psyche is not stable, there is no perpetual static state that can be achieved. Our minds are shaped by our environment, but the effect can be reinforcement or inversion or any mix between depending on the individual and their reactions to such stimulus.)

edit: Thrilling points by way.
