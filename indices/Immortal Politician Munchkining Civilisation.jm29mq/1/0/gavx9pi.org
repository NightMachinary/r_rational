The problem I could see with taking up the role of immortal god-king is that there's a real potential issue with calcification of society, power structures, and so on. Your subordinates would find the way you like to rule and build around that, their successors would find it easiest to just continue in the same vein, and so on. And it's unlikely you'll be able to be a perfect ruler in every single aspect, so things which became problems under your rule would never be able to be brought to light or rooted out by a change of leadership. They'd become intrinsic parts of society, ingrained, even if they were definitely bad for society as a whole.

It'd probably be better to share power in some manner, to allow yourself to be slowly moved on your stances, and to have some flexible back-channels to all levels of society so you can get real information on what the people of a given generation really want. It might also be an idea to not rule the entire species, but to allow other powerful countries and societies to exist - they might be able to come up with things that you didn't, or things which would have been very difficult for your own ruled area to achieve.

Maybe some kind of behind-the-scenes arrangement where you rule an area (covertly or overtly) for a century or so, then fade away, allow more democratic forms of rule to take place for two or three centuries, then come back under another name to clean house while keeping any improvements and new ideas which had bloomed in the intervening ten generations or so. You could even rotate between three or four large countries / empires / superpowers this way. Or spend some years here and there ruling much smaller areas - cities, towns etc - to keep up with the views of the populace and how they perceive national and international politics from the grass roots level.
