I don't have a beta or proofreader and I am aware of the many grammar errors lurking beneath, despite the fact that I swept it over one or two times for such errors.

It's also scary for me to post something here, even though I post the same damn thing on three different forum, but I don't receive very much feedback. People aren't interested in original content.

The story I posted is not all I have written so far, just some that had been edited at least once. (6K posted in that thread versus 11K I have written so far)
