It's the name of the planet, but earth is earth.

I have no intention of replacing phrases with unnecessary phrase or speech.

It would be like calling tanks barrels instead of just using tanks just because British in a different timeline opted to use 'barrel' to conceal the development of an armored fighting vehicle.

I will just use tanks. The reader will know what I mean, and I don't have to explain to them that particular bit of trivia, and the readership don't have to memorize that unique piece of terminology.

Besides, they are not speaking English anyway. Just treat it as a translation convention.
