Is there any reason why we're doing a cyclical repost of that particular recommendation? I'd say sticking it in the sidebar or something would be enough, since it's exactly the same post as you made here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2frknq/rtreposteverything_by_ted_chiang/][1]], and here [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3kxox6/rtrepost_everything_by_ted_chiang/][2]].

Of course getting a mod opinion would be better here and it doesn't really hurt anyone, I just don't see a benefit in that kind of thing.

And if we were to argue that we could do that to improve the visibility of top recommendations then I'd argue to make a repostable list or a sticky post would look much better in that case.
