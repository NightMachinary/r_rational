Agreed. I've spend a few cycles thinking about telekinesis for world-building / story purposes:

When you allow unlimited range and no size limits, even without all the phase changes/etc (so basically just kinematics), you are now a literal existential threat--literal planet-wrecking capabilities are at your finger tips (ram Moon into the Earth, ram Earth into Sun, etc.)

Letting yourself be used as a battery to generate (pretty much) free energy is probably one of the more altruistic things you could do.

t3tsubo's idea of becoming a cult leader is probably the most plausible path to victory, if you don't have ethical qualms with messing with beliefs.
