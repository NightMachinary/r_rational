Oh wow that's a nice comic!

Of course the first person would be circumspect with sharing its knowledge. He could take over the world with that kind of power. But eventually he'd get old, he'd want to have an heir. And would he be willing to never tell his wife and children the secret? So long as he doesn't die with the secret (and for this challenge I'm assuming the secret doesn't die), it will get out one day.
