Right, it depends on how smart and paranoid the original guy is. Just brainstorming myself I could see the originator setting up the cult such that he is just a mid level member (by all appearances), and simply does the TK in the public display of miracles that the [fake] leader displays, especially since there doesn't need to be any physical or otherwise noticeable gestures.

As per my original scenario, I would argue that your characterization of the 3 letter organizations is off - if there was no chance of capture they wouldn't attempt to kill the cult - what's the incentive of doing that? It would be capture ideally or negotiate if they fail at capturing. I'd assume they'd succeed at capturing sooner or later - they'd just drug the person unawares. I left my idea here since I'm not so confident on know what these organization would do with an unconscious person that had demonstrable TK powers and could also commit un-preventable suicide the moment they woke up and found out they were captured.

Also I'd assume the originator is smart enough to only teach it to those cult members sufficiently brainwashed - which by my definition means literally zero sense of ego/self preservation and would commit suicide/atrocioties/personal humiliation on request. Members like that wouldn't teach their families, in fact they likely wouldn't have families.
