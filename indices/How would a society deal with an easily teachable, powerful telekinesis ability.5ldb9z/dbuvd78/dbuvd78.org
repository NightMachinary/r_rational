It depends on the values and how rational the personperson who figures out how TK works is. For example, I could see your typical [[/r/rational]] min-maxxer try take over the world - probably by starting a cult/religion where s/he alone can perform "miracles". Then they could teach the TK to those who are sufficiently brainwashed into the cult in order to gain even more credibility.

At some point the 3 letter organizations would probably have intel/surveillance on the group from all their anti-terror networks, since even if the leader is ultra secretive/vigilant it's unreasonable to expect the entire group to escape attention. Should the CIA/FBI/KGB figure out the TK is legit and not a hack, the originator and/or the small circle of "practitioners" would probably get disappeared.

The first few attempts at kidnapping the TK users would probably fail due to the agencies not knowing the extent of the TKs abilities, but eventually someone would probably let their guard down.

What i CANT see happening is for TK to spread to the general populace unless the originator is holding the idiot ball. There is literally no incentive to teach anyone if it is as easily learn-able as the prompt says.
