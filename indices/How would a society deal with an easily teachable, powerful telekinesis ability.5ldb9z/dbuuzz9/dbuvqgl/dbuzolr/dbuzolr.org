A strong tradition of total anonymity? Everyone wears burqa and uses voice changers all the time?

If everyone in a society has a perfect weapon that cannot be blocked or traced and works over any distance, everyone in the society has veto power over everyone else's life. If these powers were given to everyone in the US right now, bare minimum all celebrities and politicians would be dead in five minutes. Most likely everyone in the world would be dead very shortly, but the people who are in the news are definitely the first to go.
