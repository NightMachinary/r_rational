Well, in the show, they gave themselves death feedback but they also keyed in methods of killing that would not trigger it (the impure cats, the psycho buster), so essentially a monopoly on force by the governing body was reestablished.

And I think that they would not be outcompeted because the way the death feedback society was created was once the PK slave dynasty civilizations self-destructed a group holding onto advanced technology came out of hiding and forcibly performed the death feedback engineering on everyone.

So I think the best solution is to have a global movement to enforce creation of a death feedback-like situation. I suspect the numbers in favor of it would be greater than those against, so those in favor would probably win out. If people can cooperate in the prisoner's dilemma (and often they do), they can cooperate on this. And yes you would have to key in more complicated methods of force that do not trigger the death feedback in order to deal with mishaps or lapses.

As an aside, there was an interesting fic of Shinsekai Yori on here a while back:
