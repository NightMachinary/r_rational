You're now giving an extreme amount of agency to literally EVERYONE in the world though. A select few individuals (with large systems behind them) have control of today's nuclear weapons, hence the lack of (extinction level) world war. Imagine if every single person now had the power to exert however much force they wanted on anything in their sight line (the horror is magnified if the proposed TK can work through things like the Internet or television) with absolutely no identifying markers. It would be anarchy.
