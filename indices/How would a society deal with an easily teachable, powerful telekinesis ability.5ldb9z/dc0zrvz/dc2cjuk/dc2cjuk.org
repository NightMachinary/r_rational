  And I think that they would not be outcompeted because the way the death feedback society was created was once the PK slave dynasty civilizations self-destructed a group holding onto advanced technology came out of hiding and forcibly performed the death feedback engineering on everyone.

My reason why they'd be outcompeted is that a single person who doesn't have death feedback can go into that village and murder everyone and no one there can do much about it (which is pretty much what happens at the end of the anime).

The copycats are only a threat if they have the advantage of surprise, otherwise they're easily ensnared with TK (as seen in the anime).

The psychobuster is anthrax (per the anime), if you released that in a village you'd wipe it out, TK or no. Hardly a counter to someone using TK indiscriminately. It is also not really available (which is why at the end they go on a quest to get it), so the village can't really expect to be able to use it.
