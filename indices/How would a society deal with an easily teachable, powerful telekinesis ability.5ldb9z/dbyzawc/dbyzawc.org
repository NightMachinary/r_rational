Has anyone noticed that you can fix the problems with this scenario by changing just one variable in the power -- the anonymity factor? Worlds in which use of the telekinesis is not anonymous develop varying societies relating to the anonymity range of the setting, from a telekinesis power where every use of the power is tagged and stored worldwide in some kind of information grid, possibly psychic or possibly technological, and in which global societies are possible, right down to tribal societies in worlds where the use of telekinesis is only detectable by gestures.

Then there are interesting cross class societies resulting from when telekinesis is introduced into a high tech world which is able to develop the technology to detect use and broadcast that information into a global information net allowing for a global society. However, if for some reason the global information net broke down, if technology was substantially interrupted for any length of time, then the society would fall to the tribal level and never be able to climb back up, never able to recover the use of technology to allow for a global society. This would be a world in which strict enforcement of the law is everything, absolutely essential to preserve the backbone of civilization. Perhaps much of the population would be employed in telekinesis use monitoring and law enforcement?
