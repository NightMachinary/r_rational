Perhaps there could be some sort of advantage to being ignorant? For example, in Wildbows /Pact/, people who were unaware of the magical world were generally left alone by spirits and had pretty strict protections.

Vampires already have plenty of rules that govern them (Can't enter houses without permission, repelled by crucifixes and garlic, ect.), maybe you could add one about harming/breaking the masquerade to people who don't already know about the existence of vampires? This would motivate both of them not to tell their loved ones for example, because while it's too late for the protagonists, their family may be safer living in ignorance.
