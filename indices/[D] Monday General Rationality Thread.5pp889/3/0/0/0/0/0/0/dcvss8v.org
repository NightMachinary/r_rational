I do feel like the cop on some level "knows" she's a fictional character; she consciously does things for the sake of "drama" (e.g. taking up smoking e-cigarettes because it looks appropriately cool).

Is that too meta? To have her, like, literally know she isn't real and thus act in ways to drive the narrative? She has a sense of horror that if she ceases to be interesting she will no longer exist? I feel like it would take a far greater writer than I to pull it off.
