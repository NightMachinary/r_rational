Not my vampire yaoi story but in the same universe. We have a vampire hunting duo (two young independent women kicking butt!), one is a police officer, the other is a kindergarten teacher with magic powers.

They find a vampire. And.... they proceed to start being vampire hunters.

Can someone help us justify /why/ the hell they don't do what /any sane person/ would do, which is to report this to the police, the press, the world at large? We can't say they don't trust the police because /one of them is a police officer/. I don't really feel great about there being a vampire conspiracy in the police department, in the media, etc because that's just as hard to suspend disbelief from as them just deciding not to tell, and I'd rather not have to incorporate a worldwide conspiracy into our worldbuilding, /thanks/.

tl;dr is there any Rational reason that protagonists might not go to the police/media?
