I'm assuming from the chain you're talking about RB. If not, then this comment is moot as I couldn't figure it out (and so it's probably not as big of a hint as you think).

If I did guess right, what's wrong with hinting about it? It only gives it away if someone searches for more information about it, in which case kuilin just lowered the barrier to get the idea.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is: posting about ideas that are painful when perceived, but need to be searched (like blue waffle, tubgirl, goatse, etc) isn't such a bad thing. It's still up to the person who finds the hint to take a risk and search - you're just offering them a slower version of google searches.
