If victim blaming is what makes the victims more competent at their goals, I'll victim blame all day. That's kind of the point of being a rationalist, eh?

And I find the argument of "victim blaming" pretty poor in this case. It's like abusers who say "this is your fault". I think classism is a much bigger part of the ongoing problems then racism, and that the left tacitly support classism.

So I have to ask if advocating political violence is really accomplishing your goals, or if it's just serving to speed up growing tensions, give your enemies an excuse, and alienate people who would otherwise by sympathetic to your goals.

Because I'm really not seeing any benefits from it.
