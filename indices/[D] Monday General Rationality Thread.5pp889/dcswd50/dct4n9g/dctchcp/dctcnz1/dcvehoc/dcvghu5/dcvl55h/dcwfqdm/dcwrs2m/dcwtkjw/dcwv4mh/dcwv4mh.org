Trump supporters get called fascists, but of course /you/ only mean /real/ fascists. Ignoring the fact that people on your side will take it as tacit endorsement of bashing not-really-facists, and that after getting called fascists so much red-tribers aren't going to be any less afraid just because you say you're only in favour of bashing legitimate fascists.

It doesn't help that

  seem to be a huge number of people who are so far gone with their nationalist tribalism (and that can go ahead and include the nationalist tribalism of the San Francisco professional class and bourgeoisie) that when they say "politics", they just mean a Red Tribe against a Blue Tribe.

Is one of /the/ major complaints about the blue tribe. While the red tribe (not the leadership) has recently shown a willingness to at least tolerate new ideas like marijuana-legalization, and has dropped a lot their religious overtones.

From where I'm setting it looks a lot like the red tribe has gotten a lot less tribalistic, and the blue tribe a lot more.

Of course if you only respond to one of these points, make it the first one. That's the one concerned with actual outcomes, not tribes.
