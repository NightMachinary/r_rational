How do you reconcile a Flair advocating the initiation of violence, with civilization?

Serious question as the growing trend towards legitimizing the use of physical violence against people who speak or express *thoughtcrime* is disturbing, more-so disturbing to see from a respected peer.

Note: please do not misunderstand me, neo-nazi's or the like are about as hateful and pitiably wrong as they can be, they are a great example of what everyone should dislike, but to put it politely, that does not excuse initiating violence in anything short of clearly preemptive self-defense.
