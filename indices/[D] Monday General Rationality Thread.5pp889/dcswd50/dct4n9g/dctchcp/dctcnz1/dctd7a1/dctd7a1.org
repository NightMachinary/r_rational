Whoever is at the top of the queue (has the most seniority) is the head mod. They ultimately control the subreddit, and if they're in any way unstable they can block all the other mods, or otherwise damage the subreddit.

I would recommend that if [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] is already filling that role, you step down and then step back up, putting him at the top of the queue. I don't feel uncomfortable with you being /a/ mod, just with you having ultimate control over the subreddit.

We have had a lot of trouble with that in [[/r/halifax]] in the past, and it did significant damage to the community.

Most of the people I've been seeing called fascist aren't, unless we're doing the motte and bailey thing, or you're the only person who's using the term right. I don't think it would be hard to extend that definition to cover my grandfather, or just people who aren't in favour of affirmative action.

I don't really want to discuss that anymore though. Regardless your recent advocations for political violence have made me very uncomfortable.
