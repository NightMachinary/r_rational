  I don't think it would be hard to extend that definition to cover my grandfather, or just people who aren't in favour of affirmative action.

No, as far as I can tell, people who don't like affirmative action are not fascist. Period. Fascism is a fairly specific thing, in which society's problems are uniformly cast in terms of a war or conflict between racial, ethnic, or national groups (roughly). If you don't conceive of most issues in terms of race war, you're very likely not a fascist. If I disagree with you about politics, you're very likely still not a fascist. There are vast, vast domains of views that aren't going to get any talk of violence from me, because they don't involve literally murdering me.

  I would recommend that if [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] is already filling that role, you step down and then step back up, putting him at the top of the queue. I don't feel uncomfortable with you being a mod, just with you having ultimate control over the subreddit.

This can probably be arranged. Care to file a mod-message so we can set up the process? I trust [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] for this.
