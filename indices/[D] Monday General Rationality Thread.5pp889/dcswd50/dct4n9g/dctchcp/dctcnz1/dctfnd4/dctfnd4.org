I don't agree with your political viewpoints, and I'm pretty pacifist. BUT I also hate witch hunts.

Would you ban/sanction someone in this subreddit for their behavior or comments in another subreddit? Or would you ban/sanction someone in this subreddit for politely expressing viewpoints you find abhorrent but the rest of the mod team finds unobjectionable?

If yes, then I don't like your modding policies and would prefer someone else without those policies. If no, then I don't see any reason for you to step aside.
