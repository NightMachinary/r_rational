Okay, once I wrote that, I started seriously thinking about this. Here are some of my thoughts:

- Less Wrong is a really old site that hasn't been maintained a lot. Reddit is also old, but it's actively maintained and new features are added once in a while. People like things that are new and fresh. We may believe we as rationalists don't care about things such as these, but I believe people actually care - I hate to admit it, but at least I do.

- When I still used Less Wrong to some extent, there were some trolls and mass-downvoters. Whereas in [[/r/slatestarcodex]] there are active mods and even Scott frequently goes there and aforementioned phenomena either don't exist on the subreddit or they don't bother me me so much that I would have paid attention to them. Also, because of reddit's voting algorithms, it's not possible to downvote with multiple accounts on reddit and you can't just make new accounts and troll on [[/r/slatestarcodex]] because you have to gather some karma first. There have been some stunts on Less Wrong where one person has upvoted his own thread 20+ times with multiple accounts.

- I really really doubt any of the big writers like Scott, Luke, Alicorn, Yudkowsky etc. are going back there.

- There's a lot of historical baggage that goes with Less Wrong. Some negative things that come to my mind are: some amount of drama, Roko's Basilisk and all those other thought experiments about torture and the trolls and mass downvoters I mentioned earlier. It also centers heavily around CFAR, MIRI and Yudkowsky+Sequences in particular and there are lots of people in the rationalist community that aren't particularly obsessed with those. My personal opinion? I admire Yudkowsky tremendously for kickstarting the rationalist movement with them, but I don't think the Sequences are up to the kind of scholarly and scientific standards the community deserves nowadays - which doesn't mean they aren't and haven't been ridiculously useful.
