I'm not on [[/r/slatestarcodex]], so I can't really comment about the differences in hubs.

I think they're at least trying to update some of the things you mentioned, if that helps a little.

- Updating the code base
- Removed downvotes in the interim
- I've seen increased activity from CFAR in writing things (e.g. Anna Salamon), and it at least looks like they'll continue to churn out content in the near future.

I agree that LW has lots of historical baggage and all your concerns are valid. Just thought you'd like to know that some effort has been in place to try and update things.
