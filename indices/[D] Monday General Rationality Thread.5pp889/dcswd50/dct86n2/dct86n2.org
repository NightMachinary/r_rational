LW has a lot of tech debt and doesn't have good features. I hope the LW renaissance happens, but I hope more it happens on a better platform. LW would be fine as an archive for works like Yudkoyski's, Yvain's, Luke's writing etc.

A renewed central hub for the community would be best put somewhere than LW. Still, better LW than nowhere at all...
