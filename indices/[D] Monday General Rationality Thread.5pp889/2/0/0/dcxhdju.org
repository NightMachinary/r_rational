A bad English speaker who speaks another language well will still give people the inconvenience of having to translate bad English into good English.

However the misrepresentation and disgust components don't apply. A Spanglish or Engrish speaker really does think in Spanglish or Engrish (if they are serious about learning the language then that language will start to appear in their stream of consciousness little by little), but that doesn't have to be disgusting to their interlocutors, just disconcerting.
