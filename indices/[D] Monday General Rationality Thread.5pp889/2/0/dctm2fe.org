I agree with the part about good English, with the caveat that some forgiveness is appropriate for speakers/writers for whom English is not their native tongue. Learning a foreign language is an admirable endeavor, but a difficult one as well. Those who choose to undertake it should be encouraged and forgiven for grammar mistakes that native speakers have no business making, to some degree. Most of the reasoning in your arguments doesn't apply to them anyway because presumably they are competent with their native tongue and have perfectly coherent thoughts using it, but fail to translating them properly to English.

That said, it can still be annoying to communicate with someone who can't properly convey their message, regardless of the reason for it. People practicing a foreign language by interacting with native speakers on the internet should try to avoid complicated topics that require extensive vocabulary, and should also try to avoid arguments and debates, since their position will be severely weakened by their less coherent framing of it, and both parties are more likely to end up angry at each other due to the lack of proper communication.

The best approach would be to, as 4chan would put it, "lurk moar". Read conversations between other native speakers to see how they write, but try not to interfere too much and annoy people until your skills grow high enough. Or maybe it's just a better approach to not do your learning in online forums because many of the posts you read are going to use bad English and you will learn bad habits from them.
