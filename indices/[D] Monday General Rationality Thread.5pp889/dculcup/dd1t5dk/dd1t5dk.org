Reporting back as one of those who asked you about the original post: I didn't think very hard about it afterwards, and have never experienced the described pain. It's possible that focusing on the possibility shortly before [[#s%20going%20to%20sleep][spoiler]] would cause me said pain, but I haven't really bothered to put that much effort into it to be honest.
