Thanks, that's good to know because I basically abandoned the place a long time ago and at some point it felt like everyone gave up on the "rationalist hub" idea after it was suggested. It it works out, I'd be kinda proud of the rationalists at beating incentives related to group dynamics.

But I'd still like to know why that solution is better than people gathering at [[/r/slatestarcodex]] for example.
