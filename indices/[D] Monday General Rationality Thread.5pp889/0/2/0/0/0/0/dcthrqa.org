  Would you ban/sanction someone in this subreddit for their behavior or comments in another subreddit?
#+end_quote

Without calling on him when he doesn't want to be called upon, there's at least one user on this sub whose username indicates either a liking for antisemitic humor or, alongside his flair, possible white-nationalist views.

I've never done anything to ban him, because he hasn't broken the rules of the subreddit. That's not to say I /wouldn't/ penalize him if he deliberately broke the political detente on this sub and tried to use it as a propaganda platform, but he has yet to do any such thing.

So the guy whose views I deeply disagree with, stays.

  Or would you ban/sanction someone in this subreddit for politely expressing viewpoints you find abhorrent but the rest of the mod team finds unobjectionable?
#+end_quote

Absolutely not. The mods work as a team.

  If yes, then I don't like your modding policies and would prefer someone else without those policies. If no, then I don't see any reason for you to step aside.
#+end_quote

Given how I don't handle the mod queue as well or as often as I should, I'm fine with stepping to junior mod, actually.
