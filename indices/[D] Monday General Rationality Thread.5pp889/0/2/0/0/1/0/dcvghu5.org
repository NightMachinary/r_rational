You seem to have missed a bit:

It's easy to take no moral stand when it's not your ass on the line. To talk of "initiating violence" by punching a neo-Nazi while fascists /hold state power/ and [[http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2017/01/shooting-of-anti-fascist-at-uw-biggest-scar-on-seattles-peaceful-weekend-of-protest/][antifascists /get shot by fascists/]] is nonsense.

Congratulations: you're not a Hermione.

Invoke basic consequentialism here: tell me what you /expect to happen/ if we do fight Nazis, and what you expect to happen if we /don't/ fight Nazis, instead standing by on the /presumption/, in the /absence/ of evidence, that they will obey democratic norms and protect human rights.
