Here's for example a bunch of articles on how Russia has been portraying Ukraine as a fascist state [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution][after it broke further away]] from Russia in 2014: [[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/russian-propaganda-ukrainian-rumours-anger-hate-crimea][Guardian 1,]] [[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/13/russian-propaganda-ukraine-fascist-protesters-euromaidan][Guardian 2,]] [[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/08/anti-nazi-group-secretly-helping-kremlin-rebuild-russian-empire.html][TheDailyBeast,]] [[http://www.stopfake.org/en/tag/fascist/][Stopfake,]] [[http://ukrainianpolicy.com/the-uneasy-reality-of-antifascism-in-ukraine/][etc.]]

Interestingly enough, while doing all this Russia was also ok with hosting members of real neo-nazi groups from all across Europe on its own territory ([[https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/03/24/europe-s-far-right-flocks-to-russia][1,]] [[https://news.vice.com/story/austrias-far-right-party-signs-pact-with-putins-party-after-meeting-with-trumps-national-security-advisor][2,]] [[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32009360][3).]]

The problem with +Punching-Harder+ Bashing-The-Whatever principle is that they are more likely to attract [[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B0][individuals who just generally like bashing things.]] And these people in turn will be more easily manipulated when some political entity or another decides that the group of bashing-lovers has grown large enough to become a convenient cat's-paw for its interests.

There are others points to consider as well: when you are agreeing to reduce the conflict to the crude physical level, you're basically also agreeing that the winner will be not the side that's more clever with its rhetorics, arguments, and legal tools of fight, but the one that's just the fittest in the environment of physical confrontations.

In street attacks and fights it's also not very easy to avoid misunderstandings and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titushky][deliberate provocations.]]

p.s. I just wanted to reply to your question and offer a perspective, since I don't think continuing the debate right now would help anyone change their opinion right away. So if you have any counter-points in favour of why bashing-the-x is a valid strategy, please reply with them and I'll read it without responding any further.
