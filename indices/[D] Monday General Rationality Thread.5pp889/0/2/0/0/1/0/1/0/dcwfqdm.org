  What did you think of the size calculation in the You are still crying wolf post on ssc?
#+end_quote

Which "size calculation"? I also think the post is disingenuous, since it seems to assume that "racism", "homophobia", and "fascism" are equivalent charges. They're not. Maybe Trump likes black people, insofar as he ever has a consistent opinion or interest about anything but money. I know he's got Jews married into his family, and I know he waved that LGBT flag. He's still a fascist, in the same way that Mussolini was a fascist even though he didn't give a shit about Jews.

For definitions, we're going to use Wikipedia, because it's easy to reach, and if you don't like something, you can reach for primary sources.

  Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism

The page continues:

  Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[7] Such a state is led by a strong leader---such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party---to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[7] Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.[8][9][10][11] Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.[12]

Now we've got a checklist of features. Let's see how many fit:

- Strong leader/cult of leadership? Check.

- Views war and imperialism as good for the nation? Check, but also shared with most other nationalist and imperialist ideologies.

- One-party state? /Very/ check: the Democratic Party have been locked out of effective power since the Reagan years. Now, I'll be the first to say the Democrats suck, but they don't suck in such a unique, incomparable-to-the-Republicans way that a sane, fair political system is /expected/ to institute one-party hegemony over a period of decades.

- Autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies? A platform point. Very check.

- Totalitarian? Increasingly and worryingly authoritarian, as has been the "bipartisan" consensus during these decades of Republican hegemony. Call it half a check.

- Complete mobilization of society? Actually, this is the strongest break between Republicanism, Trumpism, and traditional fascism. The Trumpist base seem to like this idea, but Trump himself and the Republican Party seem to prefer a /de/mobilized population who quietly serve the capitalists at the top. I'm gonna call it no check at all, yet.

So, out of six possible points for features of fascism, we seem to be able to wrack up 4.5/6.

  I generally find both the "kill the jews/blacks" and the "kill whitey" tribes equally below contempt and generally not a problem.
#+end_quote

/What/ "kill whitey tribe"? I've only ever heard about these people on the internet, so I'm dubious that they exist /at all/ and aren't just a paper tiger of propaganda. The Movement for Black Lives Platform did not call for killing white people: the worst you can say about it is that it said the wrong things about Zionism, which is another topic entirely.

Now, for the case of "kill the Jews/blacks", yeah, those guys are small-but-significant in numbers, and Richard Spencer is one of them. Punching him is /how/ you keep his tribe small in numbers. However, the general kind of fascism you need to lay an eventual base for "kill the Jews/blacks"? 4.5/6 points checked.

Remember, the Germans in the 1930s did not actually expect Hitler to kill all the Jews. They may have hated Jews, sure, but the Final Solution was kept secret because they expected even good Germans to balk at its extremity. Allied soldiers heard about the death camps, and considered it to be vicious anti-German propaganda, /right up until they liberated those camps/.

That refusal to believe the evidence, because the conclusion was just too wild to be true, was /precisely how/ the Final Solution happened. A political Refuge In Audacity.

Do we know /precisely/ what the new fascist government of America is going to do? No, we don't. But based on the patterns they match, including the ones they call up themselves ("Drain the swamp" is taken directly from Mussolini), we can expect horrendous, historic evil.
