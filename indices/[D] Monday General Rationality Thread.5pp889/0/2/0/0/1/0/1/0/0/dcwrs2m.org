What I fail to understand is how political violence it going to improve the situation in any way. If you're seriously worried about that, you need to

- Not get yourself on any lists so that you're a priority target if civil war breaks out

- Prepare the infrastructure/supply-chains for eventually fighting that war

  - Figure out how to communicate securely.

- Try and implement social policies that help the rust-belt/poor-rural-whites. They are legitimately disadvantaged and voting for these people out of fear. Just for some reason their disadvantage doesn't count?

You don't need to go out in the streets and make people, who are voting for trump out of fear, feel afraid. That's retarded.

What political violence is going to do is make them feel justified in purging their out group.

Don't slowly escalate. That's not a fight, that's a dominance game. You need to fight you put people down fast and hard, you don't butt antlers.
