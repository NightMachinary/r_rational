  Try and implement social policies that help the rust-belt/poor-rural-whites. They are legitimately disadvantaged and voting for these people out of fear. Just for some reason their disadvantage doesn't count?
#+end_quote

Of course their disadvantage counts, and as long as we're playing the tribalism game, I should note that up until Trump, I was /ecstatic/ about the way the Rust Belt's famous "white working class" was voting. You'll remember that everywhere those guys determined the outcome of the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders won. That was the first time I felt like class consciousness and a sense of common material interests were coming to the fore in the United States.

Hell, it was the first time I felt like I could come out of the closest as a Jewish socialist from Brooklyn without getting labeled un-American.

  You don't need to go out in the streets and make people, who are voting for trump out of fear, feel afraid. That's retarded.

That's quite right. I don't believe in a "basket of deplorables". Fascism operates off of fear, uncertainty, and chaos. This means that, /especially/ in a two-party system, most of the people voting for the fascist /are not themselves ideological fascists/.

If someone voted for Trump out of fear that Clinton was horrible, well, she /was/ horrible. We can talk. If someone voted for Trump because, out of two candidates who spoke to their economic situation, he alone was on the general-election ballot, well, /we can talk/. Actually, if someone voted for Trump because they wanted him to "take our jobs back from immigrants", /maybe/ we can talk, /if/ they're not actually so self-sabotaging that they can't be persuaded to support a broad working-class program.

There's one place I draw the line to stop talking, though not yet to start fighting. That's the hypocrites: the ones caught up in the tribal cult who think that it's /fine/ for /Trump/ to support universal health-care or industrial, but that exactly the same things coming from /Democrats/ were heretical, filthy communism. I can't talk to those people because they're only thinking about tribal affiliation, not policy. They don't even /really/ want the industrial policy or health-care. What they /really/ want is the flag-waving and military parades. I'm not terminally interested in those things. I'm terminally interested in industrial policy, health-care, minimum wage rises, breaking up big business, etc.

Now, problem is, I do think a good quarter or third of the total population falls in that last bucket. There really do seem to be a huge number of people who are so far gone with their nationalist tribalism (and that can go ahead and include the nationalist tribalism of the San Francisco professional class and bourgeoisie) that when they say "politics", they just mean a Red Tribe against a Blue Tribe. They don't actually think of /issues/ at all anymore. Everything is symbolic, nothing is material, and if Vladimir Putin personally enslaved American workers as household servants, it depends more whether he's waving a hammer-and-sickle or a Russian Orthodox cross when he does it. That's my impression of, for instance, the Slate Star Codex commenter crowd, and /they scare the shit out of me almost as much as Nazis do/. Because they're the proto-Nazi, the one who's looking away from the real-world human suffering and putting all his attention on that big, awesome streaming banner and these spiffy uniforms. This is [[/r/rational]]: we /ought/ to find an all-style, no-substance ideology anathema here.

Then there's the place I draw the line for preemptive violence. That's open, knowing, self-aware fascism. Not being deceived. Not voting one way when you could have gone the other out of misguided fear, or hope. That's the line: when you consider epistemic and moral truth to be determined by membership in your tribe, thus setting up life in general as a war for supremacy between those tribes, then you are fash, and you should get bashed.

I mean, this is the kind of thing I keep saying to my leftist comrades, but they mostly seem to be holding to a party line that this isn't Real Fascism yet, that mere activism can still make some kind of difference.

/I'm/ trying to come up with plans to leave the country, since I don't really think I'm a good candidate for guerilla war.
