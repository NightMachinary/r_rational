  We've already discussed how the red tribes leadership doesn't represent their interests, right?
#+end_quote

Yes, which is why it's very important that the Red Tribe /turn on their leaders/, right now, and not on their fellow Americans who have different tribal markers but are actually fellow proletarians. That doesn't mean voting for Democrats, it means joining the demonstrations right now, joining the general strikes we're trying to build, and helping us try to mount a revolution against the whole fucking system that's keeping America on track to Third World living conditions in the richest country on the planet.

  Can you honestly say you're not lumping the trump supports in with the facists, as one political block?
#+end_quote

In the specific case of punching Richard Spencer, yes, I can say that honestly. Even when I've been at demos with Antifa blocs, they don't get violent unless leftist demonstrators are attacked first.

(Maybe they did get violent at a demo I wasn't at. I know our demos in my city were notably tame last Friday.)

  Do you think that trump supporters behavior don't enable facists?
#+end_quote

Depends which behavior.

#+begin_quote
  Regardless of your intent, or whether you want to be associated with them or not, that kind of talk enables facists.
#+end_quote

If any kind of leftist or even self-protective talk among prospective victims of fascism, enables fascism, then you're actually just victim-blaming.
