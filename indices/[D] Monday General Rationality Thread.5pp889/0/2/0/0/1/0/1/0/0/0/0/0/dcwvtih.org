  Motte and bailey. Trump supporters get called fascists, but of course you only mean real fascists. Ignoring the fact that people on your side will take it as tacit endorsement of bashing not-really-facists, and that after getting called fascists so much red-tribers aren't going to be any less afraid just because you say you're only in favour of bashing legitimate fascists.

It's not motte-and-bailey. It's that you're clustering me in with bunches of people I haven't chosen to affiliate with, whether or not I actually think like them. /You're/ doing the tribalism thing here.

I'm an organized activist, so I /have/ an actual political affiliation whose views I endorse enough that I feel responsible for answering questions or quibbles about their/our platform. I am /not/ automatically responsible for every asshole on twitter or tumblr with whom you cluster me, and it's worth noting that I treat others the same way.

Richard Spencer, for instance, is the head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think-tank. It's /official/ with him, as my DSA membership is with me.

I seriously think that if the Red Tribe is so utterly panicked that /everyone who's not Red Tribe is trying to destroy them/, then they've frankly fallen for fascist propaganda. Or just plain gone crazy. Again, that is in no way grounds for violence against generically Red Tribe people, but luckily, we don't /actually have/ any such violence. On the other hand, it makes the Red Tribe sound like, let's call it, Palestinians: "everyone is holding us down, that's why we have to kill them all!"

Instead we've got journalists being charged with felonies because they happened to be covering protesters during a protest and the cops don't like the protesters. Meanwhile, what was it, eight states are passing laws to criminalize or financially penalize nonviolent civil disobedience.

I mean, maybe you think protest is a "Blue Tribe thing", but doesn't it seem awful dangerous for common ground to you to /criminalize things/ for being "Blue Tribe things"? That's overtly saying: "if you get too Blue, we will arrest you, charge you with a felony, and put you in jail for years at a time", all for doing something that we all agreed was a necessary part of democracy before (remember, civil disobedience has been used by nonviolent segregationists in the South). That's /actual state violence/ by Red Party legislatures against what they're assuming will be Blue Tribe people, actually deliberately destroying common ground in the name of having your tribe exterminate the other tribe from public life.

But tell me again how my reddit flair is making it impossible for fellow Americans to coexist.

  Is one of the major complaints about the blue tribe.

Note the /entire parenthetical I put in/ addressing that explicitly.

  While the red tribe (not the leadership) has recently shown a willingness to at least tolerate new ideas like marijuana-legalization, and has dropped a lot their religious overtones.
#+end_quote

It's really weird that you say "not the leadership". This makes it come off that your claim is, "the red tribe's voter base has shown a willingness to tolerate legalizing marijuana and secularism, but their actual elected officials are still entirely committed to not doing those things."

You're talking about this as though blog output or some other symbolic measure was the measure of politics, rather than, you know, /public policy/.
