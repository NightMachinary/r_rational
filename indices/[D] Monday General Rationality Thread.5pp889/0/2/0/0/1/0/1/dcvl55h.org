Congratulations: You are making pronouncements about my [[#s][enduring nature of my personal character based on a rather limited data set]], specifically you determine I'm unwilling to speak up against evil when I call you, a mod here, for what seems to be [[#s][advocating the initiation of violence against an undesirable political faction]] . .

"Fighting a group", and random assault without follow through, seem two very different things, but that may just be my distaste for useless violence.

I'm going to assume we disagree on where society is in the sliding scale between civilization and it's breakdown, and have common ideas about when violence is necessary, and maybe even when the initiation of violence is moral. I still question your lauding of a sophomoric assault, assuming your talking about the neo-nazi in DC, but I've never bought in to symbolic violence.

Just so I can try to understand your worldview:

What did you think of the size calculation in the [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][You are still crying wolf]] post on ssc?

What is your definition of a fascist? /Edit: well said Jiro/

I'm of the one of the target descents too, but it's been at least three generations since my family was practicing Jewish, so dunno if I consider my ass on the line. I generally find both the "kill the jews/blacks" and the "kill whitey" tribes equally below contempt and generally not a problem.
