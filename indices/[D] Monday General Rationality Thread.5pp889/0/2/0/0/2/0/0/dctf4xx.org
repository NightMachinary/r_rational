  This can probably be arranged. Care to file a mod-message so we can set up the process? I trust [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] for this.

Thank you for being reasonable about that. Ironically that makes me trust you for that position a fair bit more, but it still seems like a good thing to do. And I appreciate your allaying my fears.

I don't feel like a lot of people who say things like "bash the fash" have that clear of a definition of fascism, but it's good to know that you're so unambiguous on it.
