Fascists are not merely "the outgroup". They are advocating and acting for my personal extermination. You'll have to forgive that I've got no tolerance for them. Mind, on this subreddit, I don't expect the subject to come up: fictional characters might be fascists, but subreddits don't exactly have the means to exterminate anyone.

Also, [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] is closer to a "head" mod than me. We don't really have a /leader/ as such.
