Yeah, that potential is part of why I like the story so much - even after one and a half arcs, she's barely interacted with much of the canon cast. Those she has spent time with (eviscerating) had no chance of drawing the real her out of the sociopath shell. She's already made her choice to hide behind the comfort/purpose of the shell, so it seems unlikely she'll change without external intervention. I'm feeling optimistic for the next few arcs.

Goal-wise, it seems deliberately vague. She's made some allusions to having big ambitious plans, but she's also a fan of Machiavelli, so wouldn't be surprising if she wants power for power's sake or to "maintain the state."
