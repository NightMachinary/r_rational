Low odds on it being just for power. She strikes me as a mix of lawful and chaotic evil. Her evil has a compass and at the moment it's aimed at people whose line of work makes them more...deserving of the consequences. Basically committing evil at evil but with minimal regard for collateral damage to innocents. If you're not her victim, she's like an accidental vigilante antihero to Brockton.
