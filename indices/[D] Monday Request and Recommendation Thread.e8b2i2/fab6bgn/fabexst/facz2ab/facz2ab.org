Spoilers for Waves Arisen

I find it kinda shit how the big turning point of the story is essentially just a bug in the game. Like, it's really not something that should be happening in any system that is trying to be realistic, but here you have it as a central plot point. There's no explanation for the water clones making more chakra than they take to produce, it just is how it is. It's a huge spot of lameness in an otherwise brilliant story.
