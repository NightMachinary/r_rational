Not sure if Naruto: Need to Become Stronger is on the wiki or not, but if you haven't read it, it's very good, and very rational. Hands down best world building I've read in a Naruto fanfic, and the characters are all different enough from their Canon counterparts that everything feels fresh, but there's no jarring difference in genre between the characters as in waves arisen.
