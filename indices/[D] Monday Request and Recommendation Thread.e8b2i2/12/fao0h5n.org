I'm looking for recommendations for stories that have a mediocre beginning, but are overall very good.

My logic for asking is that Iv'e been +lurking+ here long enough to have probably tried the beginning of most recommendations, and so I hope to find a hidden gem. For example, I find the beginning of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Amy]] to be unreadable, while the story overall is excellent.

Regarding genre, I personally dislike horror and worm/MLP fanfics, but maybe others will find such recommendations useful, so anything goes.
