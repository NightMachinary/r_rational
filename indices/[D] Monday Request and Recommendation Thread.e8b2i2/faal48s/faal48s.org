I'm repeating my ask from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dy4bm2/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f80rvur/?context=3][three weeks ago]] in case anyone has more ideas. (See below for my reaction to the recommendations there.)

I'm looking for stories with realistic portrayal of skill acquisition (in contrast to the infamous "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkMontage][training montage]]"). Hopefully, focusing on motivation/[[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Tsuyoku_naritai][determination]] and overcoming setbacks.

The difficulty should lie in the training, and the path towards improvement known. The first part of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]fits perfectly, but then the focus shifts considerably. The best example I've found so far is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go][Hikaru no Go]]. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protector_of_the_Small][Protector of the Small]] is also quite good.

Also tangentially related are stories taking place in a learning environment: the first few books of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter][Harry Potter]], [[http://www.hpmor.com/][HPMOR]] minus the battles, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem][Anathem]]>! (minus the ending)!<. There was a post asking for academy-centered stories and I've tried [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17879100-super-powereds?from_search=true&qid=8LNZlfqkqx&rank=1][Super Powereds]] based on a rec there; but it's not quite what I'm looking for.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

- First rec was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lowell#Trader's_Tales_From_the_Golden_Age_Of_The_Solar_Clipper][Tales of the Solar Clipper]]/,/ and I've read the first two books in the series, about a newly-orphaned kid working his way up the position rank on a spaceship. The setting was perfect, but the story unfortunately disappointing. The first book started out promising, but by the second book it becomes apparent that the protagonist has no real obstacles in his path: he passes his qualifying exams without too much struggle, comes up with amazing business ventures, and have half the female crew fall for him by book two. It was a good idea, and I thank [[/u/iftttAcct2][u/iftttAcct2]] for recommending it.
- Second rec was the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0753FP6SP?ref_=dbs_w_series&storeType=ebooks][Cradle]] series, and I've read the first book. It's a cultivation story and was an interesting read. The main character had real struggles to contend with, and he approached them open-eyed and with resourcefulness. However, the focus of the writing is more on the adventure/epic-saga and of acquiring magic power-ups than on methodical skill-acquisition /per se/. This is not a complaint about the book, just a mismatch for my personal taste, and I would be open to reading more of the series if the focus is different in later books. Thank you for the recommendation [[/u/xamueljones][u/xamueljones]].
