Holy fuck the RoyalRoad community's response to a kiss contained to a single paragraph is so incredibly disappointing. To summarize the handful of comments and reviews I was able to stomach before I stopped looking at them, it got a resounding "The minor romance subplot blindsided me, despite the previous straight one at the beginning being more sudden and awkward, and I don't believe or acknowledge that dudes can be bi, so I'm going to call the MC gay; I'm not homophobic, but anything that even acknowledges the existence of TEH GAY is completely unenjoyable to me, this was a good story until we were BETRAYED, 0/10"

This isn't just a few people, even though it's probably a vocal minority, it's practically 95% of the most recent reviews.

The characters are a liiiiiittle bit wooden, but I would figure the author is still finding their voice. They had a pretty interesting idea for a magic system; would be super cool (if complicated) to actually flesh it out, or even better, actually instantiate it in a game.

I'll rate the story 3/5, shows promise, and the RoyalRoad community 1.5/5, at least some of them care.
