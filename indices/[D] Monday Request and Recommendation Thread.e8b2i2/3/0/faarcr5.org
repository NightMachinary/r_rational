I'd definitely recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27904/the-nothing-mage][The Nothing Mage]], which has a neat take on things - there's a really well developed theory of magic, and the main character blows that theory out of the water (in a believable sense, not in a "you are the chosen one so the rules don't apply to you" sense)

But there's still a structured curriculum for students with a clear path for advancement, and he just has to figure out how to get his freaky magic to fit in to it (after developing the tools to do so).
