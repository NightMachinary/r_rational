I haven't actually read Outliers and I hadn't heard of Range. Thank you! One the specialize/generalize question, I think the common element both sides share is metaskills. If you improve your skill-acquisition skills, you don't have to worry as much about how much time you devote to acquiring one skill versus another. Make Time and Better Faster Stronger are especially helpful there.

My next project is the metaskill of working with other people - specifically the skill of productive disagreement. It's very hard.
