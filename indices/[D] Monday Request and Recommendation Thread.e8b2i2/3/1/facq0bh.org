I'd recommend reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. It has a fairly good description and interpretation of skill acquisition. Beware of the 10k hours rule it's kind of bs and bad rationality, there's plenty of criticism of it online, but overhaul if you are interested in skill acquisition and what it entails it's a good book.

​

There's a cap on how good people can get at anything, and the effort required grows exponentially. People can technically get to the top 10% on X competitive field in less than 6 months without much effort, but getting those last 10% becomes exponentially more difficult and more often than not the potential benefit is not worth the effort.

​

So stories where the point is train / work hard and get better indefinitely tend to seem silly to me. There's a cap, and the benefits after a certain point aren't worth the effort.

​

In fact I'd much rather have stories with cool magic systems with power caps where conflicts are won with strategy, planning and tactics rather than X is better because (s)he worked harder for longer.
