I've got two requests:

Stories about exploring interesting mechanics (probably, but not necessarily, magic). Something like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break Them All]].

Stories that actively explore the nature of "narrative", or have other meta-narrative elements. Some stories that fit the bill here are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com][A Practical Guide to Evil]] (wherein stories are just part of the way the universe works), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth The Candle]] fits the bill to a lesser degree. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]] tries to fit in here, but (at least as of chapter 17) hasn't really delivered all that well for me.
