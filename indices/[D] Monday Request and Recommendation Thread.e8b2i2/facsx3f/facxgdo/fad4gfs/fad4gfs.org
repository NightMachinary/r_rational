  I much less strongly recommend Wildbow's "Pact"

Seconding this half-recommendation. The mechanics of the world are fascinating early on, and a lot of interesting tools and symbolism are set up. Then you keep going, and going, and going, and realize you've been in this endless state of high tension/combat, for all 950k words, and half of the combat feels like an asspull to just let the story end. Really felt like a step back from Worm's structure and rigidity.
