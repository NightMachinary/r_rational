I tried it a few times. I haven't managed to not crash it past 10 actions. It doesn't seem much better than something like cleverbot, except for the fact that it's slightly (though not by much) better at keeping track of what was said. It's also a bit less random, but still pretty bad at preventing contradictions.

I kept spawning in the wilderness and then suddenly leaving the kitchen to enter the living room of a house I had never entered.

At least it's ok at grammar.
