Is it theoretically possible to get this working on Windows with Cygwin or otherwise? I tried for a few hours and I think I got most of the requirements in place except tensorflow which is a bitch... eventually gave up and I'm thinking about starting over tomorrow using Windows Subsystem for Linux (which I've never used before) instead of Cygwin.

Wondering if it's even worth the effort to try or if it would just be better to wait for an official Windows port.
