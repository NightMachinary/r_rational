Have you read [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] yet? Sylvester has /some/ form of morals, but they basically boil down to "protect my friends, don't hurt children". Given that they're usually sent to some war zone or another as kid spies, that leaves him /a lot/ of leeway to cause mayhem with his social manipulation abilities and penchant for firebombing.

It takes a while for him to develop his goal, like more than a third of the book. The beginning is a bit meander-y and reads like a "monster of the week" TV show, but they do contribute to the plot and worldbuilding.
