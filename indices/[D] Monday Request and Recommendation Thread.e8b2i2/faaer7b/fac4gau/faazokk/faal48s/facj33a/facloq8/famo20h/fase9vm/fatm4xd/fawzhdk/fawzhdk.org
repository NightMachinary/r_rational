I'm glad that you are feeling optimistic, I'm feeling doubtful but remain hope.

It's probably a personal thing but I kinda dislike doing evil for power. I love antiheroes and people that make evil/morally questionably choices for a good goal because it creates interesting internal/external conflicts.
