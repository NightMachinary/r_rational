It's very late and I'm writing this on my phone so please bare with me.

I just stumbled upon a short (by web novel standards, 42k words) fiction called Twin.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14758049?view_full_work=true]]

It's a cross between the universes of Hetalia and Twig. If you know anything about those two fictions, you can tell immediately that the product is going to be very interesting.

Hetalia literal country in human form plus Twig Mad Science gone extreme, spice it up with total war, and what could go wrong. Apparently, a lot. I personally haven't read or watched either of those but it's not needed beyond the bare minimum.

I'll leave the very excellent summary/hook and subsequent trigger warning here.

  Once upon the time, the United States of America won his independence from Great Britain.

  Once upon a time, the Crown Empire reclaimed his colony.

  Once upon a time, the Crown States of America put pen to paper and began to write.

  They say that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

  This is a crossover involving the characters of Hetalia in the world of the web serial [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]. It contains spoilers for the entirety of Twig.

  Twig contains many instances or mentions of war, violence, sickness, body horror, massacres, and various other terrible things I have likely forgotten to mention; while I will not write graphic descriptions of any of these, dark themes are present throughout the setting and will be present here as well.

Shame it is dead/very slowly updating. Goes to show that there is gold hidden in those sub 50 kudo fanfics on page 204 of general/no relationships fictions. Now let me sit back up into my level 5 hazmat suit and head back into page 205...
