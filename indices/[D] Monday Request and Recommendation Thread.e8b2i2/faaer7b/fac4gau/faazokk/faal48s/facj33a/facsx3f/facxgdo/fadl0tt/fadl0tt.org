- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140][SCP-140,]] “A Chronicle of the Daevas” --- is a book artefact that seems to be capable of retroactively warping the entire reality and its history if given the chance to spin more of its intended narrative.

  #+begin_quote
    SCP-140 must never be brought closer than 15 m to any source of standard ink, human blood, or other fluids suitable for writing.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717474/1/Horry-Patter-and-the-Philologer-s-Stone][Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone]] --- Something seems to have gone very wrong in the canon HP-verse, and now words and narrative not only have their own power but have also become corrupted.

  #+begin_quote
    Horry awakens to the all-encompassing sensation of safety and wellbeing. Which is his first indication that something is utterly, horribly wrong.

- The entire [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext][/Thursday Next/]] series is full of original ideas, but there are also story arcs in which the protagonist ends up literally travelling inside an in-universe piece of classical literature. The worldbuilding mechanics may or may not be to your liking, but they're extensive. As a bonus, the series also features antimemetic mechanics and an entity merely witnessing which implants copies of it as mind parasites.

    He knew that he could stretch the boundaries of the story a small amount, sniffing along one side of the lane or the other since it wasn't specified; but if the text stated that he had to bark or run around or jump up, then he was obliged to comply.

- In [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJenniferMorgue][the 2nd book]] of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles][/the Laundry Files series,/]] the protagonist has to be injected into the narrative of a rich and paranoid antagonist to stop them because that person has left no other available vectors of attack or assassination.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14770070/chapters/34158194][Harry Potter and the Methods of Ricktionality]] --- there's a scene in which Rick explains how the rules of their metaverse are keyed into pattern-matching the ideas of "Rick" and "Morty"

  #+begin_quote
    We're stuck in a sub-multiverse with a Rick-based physics.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OneOverZero][1/0]] --- a webcomic with no 4th wall, in which characters often explore the machanics of such a setting. Some good ideas and humor, but low quality graphics.

- There was a MLP fanfic (don't remember the title) in which the protag was trying to explore the rules of the MLP-verse's narrative, with things like Pinkie Pie having an ability to be aware of whenever someone mentions parties, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustHadToSayIt][You Just Had to Say It]] showing observable and reproducible consequences, and so on.
