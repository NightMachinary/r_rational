For your second request: I highly recommend: "Shadows of the Limelight" by AlexanderWales. It's a perfect match if you haven't read it, and really gets into meta-elements. [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows-of-the-limelight-ch-1-the-rooftop-races/]]

I much less strongly recommend Wildbow's "Pact", it's a supernatural action thriller where magic is strongly based on narrative.Theatrics, personhood, and consistency add strength to your actions and the rule of 3 is hugely important for example. I'm not a big fan, I prefer more concrete powers and the overall tone didn't appeal to me, but you might enjoy it. There's also a read along podcast, Deep In Pact, and the Pact audiobook project (not very far).
