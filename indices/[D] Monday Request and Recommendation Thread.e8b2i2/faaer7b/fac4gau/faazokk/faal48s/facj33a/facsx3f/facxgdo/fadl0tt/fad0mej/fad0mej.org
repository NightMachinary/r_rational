For your first point, I'd recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27904/the-nothing-mage][The Nothing Mage]] (for the second time in this thread, actually) - it's got a really interesting system of magic that's sort of like physical wavelengths of light, and the main character's magic is way off the charts in a way that makes his magic nearly useless without a lot of research.
