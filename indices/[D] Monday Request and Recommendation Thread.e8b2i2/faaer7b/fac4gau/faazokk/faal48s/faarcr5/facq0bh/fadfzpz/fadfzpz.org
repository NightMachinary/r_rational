I think you'll love the manga/anime [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/8300/Baby_Steps][Baby Steps]]. I'll copy the recommendation by a deleted user from a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6lffd4/monthly_recommendation_thread/][previous monthly recommendation thread]] (also check out other answers in that thread because they fit your ask even though the ask itself is deleted):

  The main character starts practicing tennis out of a worry for his health and physical aptitude. He slowly climbs up the ranks using a combination of analyzing correct body movements, his opponent's strategy, and continuous training. This training part is actually an important theme in the story - he very diligently practices everything until he gets it perfectly right, sometimes spending hours on a single movement. He's taking a lot of notes about these things in his notebooks, and it's clearly explained what he's supposed to accomplish by this. Also, I think it subverted the usual sport anime tropes by applying real-life logic. It was some time ago when I last watched it, but it might even count as fully rational.

Does anyone have any recommendations of books/web series that fall into this category and also feature rational elements?]]
