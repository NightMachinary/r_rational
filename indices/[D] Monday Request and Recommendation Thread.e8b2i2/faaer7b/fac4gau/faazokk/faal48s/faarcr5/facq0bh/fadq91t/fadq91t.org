If we're talking about non-fiction about skill acquisition, then [[https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=mastery&qid=][Mastery]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time][Make Time]], and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733966-smarter-faster-better][Smarter Faster Better]]. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles][Principles]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865.Good_to_Great][Good to Great]] are more specifically focused on business and management, but I'm just a writer and ESL teacher and I still got a lot out of them.

I'd LOVE to see some fiction about someone mastering a skill.
