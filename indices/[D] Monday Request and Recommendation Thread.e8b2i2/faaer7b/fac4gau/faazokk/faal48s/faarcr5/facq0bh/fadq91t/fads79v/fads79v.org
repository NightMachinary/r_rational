Thank you for the rec, I have indeed read /Outliers,/ as well as /Talent is Overrated/ which has a similar theme. Let me answer your kind suggestion with another one. From your last sentence, it sounds like you'd appreciate the complementary strategy of developing a broad range of skills to a good level, rather than drilling on that one single skill. The new book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range?from_search=true&qid=JJ6R7Yh45m&rank=3][Range]] describes this idea as a direct counterpoint to Gladwell's /Outliers./
