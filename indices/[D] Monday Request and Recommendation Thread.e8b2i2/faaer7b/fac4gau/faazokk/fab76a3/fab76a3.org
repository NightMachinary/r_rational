Interesting recommendation.

You might check out the "SAYER" podcast, it's a kind of sci-fi horror fiction podcast. Give the first two episodes a shot if it sounds interesting to you.

Hook: You are awoken from stasis travel on Typhon(an artificial moon) by SAYER, a fully self aware but limited AI, that manages everything on Typhon. Fans of this sub should be able to imagine how terrifying that is.
