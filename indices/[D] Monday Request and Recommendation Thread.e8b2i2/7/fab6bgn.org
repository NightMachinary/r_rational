Anyone have recommendations similar to Delve? I enjoy the MC actually doing the math and planning for skills, although I do wish he took things a step further and mapping out long term goals and trade offs. I generally appreciate cycles of unlocking something new, planning to exploit/max it, rinse and repeat, litrpgs tend to make these explicit but then the numbers eventually become meaningless. It reminds me of the early "The Gamer" manhwa.
