Are there any decent fantasy wilderness survival stories out there? For example, I really enjoy reading the first few chapters of a lot of isekai stories where the main character is stuck in a forest/cave/desert and being able to fireball the wildlife is balanced out by the wildlife being able to shoot lightning back.
