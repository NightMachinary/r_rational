I love the same thing I'm always on the look out for more. The ones on top of my head that I can recommand are:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality][The Perks of Immortality]]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26165/gamble][Gamble]] (This one is on hiatus)

[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/chronicles-of-primordial-wars/][Chronicles of Primordial Wars]] (This one is a translated chinese webnovel, might be very different to what you're used to if you're not familiar with asian fantasy novels)

And that's it sadly, good survival novels are hard to come by, most start out decently then fizzle out after a few chapters. There is a novel that I think deserves a mention though; [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25012/the-acts-of-androkles][The Acts of Androkles]], this one is not really a survival novel but I get very similar vibes from it plus it's incredibly well written and engaging. I highly recommand it!
