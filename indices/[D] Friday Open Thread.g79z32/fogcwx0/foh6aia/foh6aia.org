After years of extremely slow progress on the book series I most want to write, I decided to try something different and just write a short Isekai. 16k words in a week.

I kinda hate that it's been so much easier.

It won't classify as rationalist, but it's got a typical genre savvy asshole MC who figures out how to break the system, this time with Wisdom, healing and the ability to magically see through lies. Instead of some kid nobly sacrificing themselves to save somebody else's life, I had the MC be a schoolyard bully who got Isekai'd when he accidentally put himself in danger by pushing another kid to be mean.

I'll put it up somewhere when progress stalls or the story is done. Mostly just wanted to say 'Yay I did something' and 'I hate that this is so much easier'.
