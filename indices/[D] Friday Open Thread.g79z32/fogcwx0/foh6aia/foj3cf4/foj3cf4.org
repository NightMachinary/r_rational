Yeah.

When I wrote my last fic I wanted to think about the economic structure of the world and I asked on a ton of economy sites about what a certain situation would look like, and nobody ever answered.

Eventually I gave up and just improvised the economy part with vaguely-plausible financiababble and in a few days I was done. Nobody noticed the difference.

I'm realizing that I'm still a little pissed off about that.
