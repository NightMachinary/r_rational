Well, I read it, but I don't know enough about the setting to provide much useful feedback. It sounds like the tech levels are high, but if so communications and the ability to get up to date information on things like stock ownership should be much better. There should never be a need to consult records that are days old. If markets are still running, all data should be available at the push of a few buttons.

There is clearly some sort of major catastrophe going on, but I don't know enough about it or the world to say how people should react. I do find the lack of communication strange. Nobody ever leaves a factory to produce unwanted goods for weeks, because that costs /money/, which the economy values over anything and everything else. Similarly, short of the apocalypse, stock prices don't bounce up and down 20% outside of the very peak and bottom of market cycles, with very short lived exceptions for disasters like a major pandemic. Look at the Corona crash - -30% across the board in less than two weeks, followed by moves of only a percent or three a day. I guess there might be a more serious pandemic going on in the story, since all those deaths flew under the radar, but the window during which prices move quickly should be pretty short, or you'll need new disasters for every subsequent window of price chaos.

Anyway. I don't mean to sound critical. My observations are skewed by the fact that I am not familiar with the setting. Some or all of what I said may be dead wrong because there are important factors that don't exist in reality but which would definitely shape things in this world.
