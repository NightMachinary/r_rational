Cheers. So the one in my world isn't a creature-like thing like in the SCP, but it's got the same basic setup where they make it so you are most likely to discover it in a special room cut off from everything else. Though in my case the person in the room gets to communicate with the rest of the team outside to dictate what information must be destroyed to stop anyone discovering it again too easily, and then everyone has a nice long brain scrub to forget all about it until it's time to repeat.

In my world the bad thought is realizing what destiny wants. It's not a living thing and it's not sentient, but once someone realizes what its ultimate goal is, it uses that person's brain capacity to work toward that goal. And it's not a nice goal. Someone knowing what it wants is not an instant loss condition, but it basically shifts the entire universe into Hard Mode until the knowledge is wiped out.
