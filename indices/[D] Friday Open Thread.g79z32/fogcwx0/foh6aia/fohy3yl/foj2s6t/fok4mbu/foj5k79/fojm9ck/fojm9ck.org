They're really cool in fiction though. I have one in my story that is super annoying for the people whose job it is to search for obscure magical threats, because every time they discover it they have to wipe their memories of it, only to discover it again soon after. It's the only low hanging fruit left for them to find, to the point where they have to start leaving messages to themselves so they can catch themselves early when they're about to discover it.
