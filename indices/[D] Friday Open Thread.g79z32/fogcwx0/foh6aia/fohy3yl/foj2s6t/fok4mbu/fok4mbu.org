Oliver Sacks has a book about migraines that talks about migraine symptoms as an infohazard (doesn't use that word though). Turns out that if you describe symptoms of a migraine to someone who gets them, you can sometimes induce a migraine immediately. My partner generally gets only one kind of migraine, but she ended up having a different kind for the first time while reading about the symptoms in that book.
