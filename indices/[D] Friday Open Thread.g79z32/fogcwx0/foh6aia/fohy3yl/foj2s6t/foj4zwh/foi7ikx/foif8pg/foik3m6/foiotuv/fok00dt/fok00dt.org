Thanks for clarifying. I thought you were expressing people mixing up a reference to x as x, but that wasn't quite what you were saying.

I can't think of any fallacies that are structured like what you proposed.

I had a long comment proving it was the 'correlation, not causation' fallacy, but I ended up /disproving/ it as that fallacy instead.

Whoops.....
