I kinda want to say no, because for the most part most infohazards aren't that dangerous.

I'm going to start by stating my personal definition of infohazard. A thought or idea that results in a major, fundamental shift in your worldview which may or may not be traumatic. Some people might say that I'm just defining 'hard truths', but they are very similar things to me.

The issue is that every person is a lock with a specific key-infohazard that actually harms them. As one can guess, due to how most keys don't fit most locks is another way of saying that most infohazards aren't dangerous to most people.

The most obvious example is Roko's Basilisk. Most people correctly treated it as another Pascal's Mugging or just as a silly hypothetical, but there were a few who were adversely affected by it. Therefore while most discussions about infohazards don't actually have any, a few do. And while most infohazards aren't dangerous to you in particular, a few do.

And you can't actually know for sure until it happens.

Fortunately, infohazards are like a mental virus which means it's possible to protect against them or to inoculate yourself against them.

- You can simply avoid all topics about infohazards as a general precaution.
- You can be more selective and only avoid infohazards about topics that you feel deeply passionate about. For example, if you care a lot about AI, avoid Roko's Basilisk. If you have trouble dealing with death, avoid philosophical considerations about whether or not there is an afterlife. If you care a lot about winning and deeply, /deeply/ hate losing anything, you should avoid losing The Game. That part is a little tricky, because it requires you to know your hot-button topics.
- You can learn to study other people's viewpoints of the world, especially people who you strong disagree with. So if you get overwhelmed, you can fall back on re-framing your worldview in a way that helps with the existential dread. By knowing how other people think, your mindset becomes more flexible and robust.

Personally, I think dealing with a few infohazards/hard truths are a good thing for people when it comes to maturing and expanding one's mind, but it's something that should be done only if the individual is in a healthy place mentally speaking and ready for it.

TL;DR - Nope.
