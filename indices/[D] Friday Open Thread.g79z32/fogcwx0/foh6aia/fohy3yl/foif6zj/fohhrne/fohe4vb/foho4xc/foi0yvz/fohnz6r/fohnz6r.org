You mean resource on learning ancient philosophy? My recommendation is [[https://historyofphilosophy.net/][History of Philosophy]] podcast, which have [[https://historyofphilosophy.net/later-antiquity/hellenistic][an entire 25-episodes long section]] dedicated to Hellenic philosophy like the Epicureans and the Stoics. They also covers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle before that if you want to do them first.
