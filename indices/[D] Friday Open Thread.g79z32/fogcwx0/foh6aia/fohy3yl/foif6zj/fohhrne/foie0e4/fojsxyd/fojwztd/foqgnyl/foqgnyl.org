Yes, Outer Wilds is excellent! But it requires a bit more traditional gaming skill than the others, so I'm watching and contributing ideas as my girlfriend plays it since she is much better with a controller. As a non-gamer I got too frustrated trying to accomplish simple things. My question actually came because we are just about to finish that one and I'm thinking about what's next!
