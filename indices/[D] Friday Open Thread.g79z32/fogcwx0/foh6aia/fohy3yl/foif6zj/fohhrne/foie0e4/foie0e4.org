I recently revisited The Cat Machine, a puzzle game where you attach colored conveyor belts to floating islands to guide trains of cats around. When I first played it, I was struck by how I never really felt like I had any breakthroughs into the structure of the puzzle or how to go about solving the levels, yet still got better at the game. Replaying it five years later, I breezed through all the levels I tried, despite still not really having a fundamental theory of how to play this game.

So check that out if it sounds like a recomendation.

I've also been playing a ton of Tetris on [[https://jstris.jezevec10.com/][Jstris]].
