I've been playing a lot of puzzle games lately, mostly because they slot into my schedule a lot easier than most other games would. /Filament/ came out lately, and I've been enjoying it. It feels like there's been a spate of conceptually simple puzzle games that have relatively good production values, which I appreciate. /Puddle Knights/ was another one. You could have done the same game in an incredibly low-fi way, but it would have lost something, at least for me.

One of the other things that I've been enjoying about some recent puzzle games is the way that they'll break their framing device, but saying which ones do that would be a spoiler I'd think you'd be better off discovering on your own.
