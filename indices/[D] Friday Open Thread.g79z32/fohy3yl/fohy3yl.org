Is the concept of infohazards itself an infohazard?

I ask because I've seen a fairly consistent pattern play out on this subreddit a few times that goes something like this:

1. Person 1 mentions infohazards
2. Person 2 chimes in saying they know of one in real life but don't want to share it because, by it's very nature, it causes harm by being spread
3. There's a parade of comments asking to be DM'd the infohazard's details, presumably because not knowing is judged to be worse than whatever the infohazard itself is.
4. This requires sharing the infohazard which presumably makes people worse off than if they had never heard of it in this first place.

Just something I've been wondering about lately. I recognize that, if this is the case, I am guilty of bringing up the topic again, so sorry for any harm this mention of infohazards causes.
