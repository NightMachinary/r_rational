I would add /Snakebird/ and /The Pedestrian/. /Return of the Obra Dinn/ is another puzzle/deduction game that I really liked, but not in theme with the others. /Baba Is You/ is generally great, but very low fidelity, which mostly manages to work for it. /Superliminal/ has high graphical polish and does some interesting stuff, but I thought was weak as a puzzle game.

Plus the Zachtronics games, naturally, but those are mostly programming games, which is a different genre. /For the most part/ I think presentation adds a lot to them, which is important when you're stuck listening to the same music or looking at the same screen while you figure it out.

Edit: I've heard good things about /The Outer Wilds/ as being in the vein, but I'm waiting until it comes to Steam to play it.

Edit 2: /Path of Giants/! I finally remembered, it was bugging me all day.
