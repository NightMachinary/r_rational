I'm trying to submit a game to Steam, and the process is really getting to me. I keep finding new pages of places where it wants another four sizes of logo. I think I'm nearing 20 now? They're all different enough sizes and aspect ratios that I need to re-layout the relevant bits to do a decent job. I haven't even started on its inexplicably multi-tiered process for uploading an executable.

Itch is vastly nicer, but from what I've heard has about 1 in 500 the number of users, so I'm still stuck putting up with it.

On the bright side, two of the prototypes I've started while procrastinating on this stuff are pretty compelling. No rationalgames yet though; I think my next focus is going to be on things that are fun during quarantine.
