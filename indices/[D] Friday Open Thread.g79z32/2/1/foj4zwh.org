If we had SCP-level infohazards in real life, then yes, discussing them would absolutely be an infohazard. However, usually bringing up real-life infohazards in these sorts of discussions also tends to bring up information which serves to inoculate against those infohazards, and overall, in the context of a highly networked culture where memetic spread occurs rapidly, the benefits of inoculation likely outweigh the risks of exposure.

As an example, [[https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202044.pdf][Bursztyn et al. (2020)]] investigated the effects of Sean Hannity's downplaying of coronavirus and discovered that Fox News viewers who tended to watch Hannity more than Tucker Carlson were more likely to get coronavirus and died as a result. That's a decent of example how real-life infohazards tend to work. Antivaxxer propaganda is another good example of a memetic hazard with a significant death toll. Becoming more aware of bullshitters and ignoring them is a good way to keep yourself safe.
