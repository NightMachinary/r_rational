For me they are more related than you might think.

Where do virtues come from? Usually they are qualities of a person that lead to positive outcomes for themselves and society. Cultivating these virtues is a round-about way of increasing utility. You focus on the action first (likely to lead to a result) rather than the result first (likely to result from an action). There are edge cases where they do not align but they can be very similar in outcome, if not approach.
