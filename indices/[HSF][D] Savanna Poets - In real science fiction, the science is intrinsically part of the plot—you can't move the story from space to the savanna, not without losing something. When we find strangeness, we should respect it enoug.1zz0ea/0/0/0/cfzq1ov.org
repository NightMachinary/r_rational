  All science fiction plots have analogues in sufficiently lawful fantasy plots, though the reverse is not true.

The contrapositive is certainly true. All fantasy plots have analogues in sufficiently soft-core science fiction plots -- most of which are "Doctor Who", "Star Trek", or "Twilight Zone" episodes.

This was a point emphasized in the Science Fiction Literature course I took in college: the major point of science fiction is to examine how the world works in the presence of some /novum/, some component of reality that has been changed from how things are in real life right now. The more plentiful and the larger the changes constituting the novum (for example, a reality based on five colors of mana rather than a few handfuls of quarks and field quanta), the "softer" the science fiction.

Yet when you see this literary logic, that the in-story reality flows from the novum, you've got proper speculative fiction. The opposite is true, too, of course: the hardest science fiction is Speculative Science in which the in-story novum contradicts /nothing/ we know about reality right now. A fair portion of the stuff you've written falls on that end of things: you're literally engaged in speculating about the effects of a novum you yourself are trying to build.

(Note that this lets us preserve a distinction between speculative fiction and things like fairy tales, which have no rules to their reality and often don't even follow the narrative logic of a fantasy story.)

This way in which soft scifi still functions as science fiction in the /literary/ sense can be seen most clearly in just those shows mentioned above: the original purpose of /Twilight Zone/, /Doctor Who/ and /Star Trek/ was to provide a framing story for filming one speculative-fiction short-story per episode/serial, with each single story being driven by its own novum and examining that novum.
