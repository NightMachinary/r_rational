All science fiction plots have analogues in sufficiently lawful fantasy plots, though the reverse is not true. I think the idea is that a plot is Space Opera if it can be transposed to a Western, /or/ a historical setting /plus/ the sort of magic that humans already used to believe in, without having to invent especially new and interesting magic.

Although this would make E. E. "doc" Smith Not Space Opera because you can't /actually/ put Kimball Kinnison and Eddore and Arisia into the old west. Eddore and Arisia are not classical deities and you can't transpose them onto classical deities without losing the story...

Which you might consider a reductio because "doc" Smith has always been considered classic space opera, but now that I stare at this argument I have just written, I think "doc" Smith is actually science fiction masquerading as space opera.
