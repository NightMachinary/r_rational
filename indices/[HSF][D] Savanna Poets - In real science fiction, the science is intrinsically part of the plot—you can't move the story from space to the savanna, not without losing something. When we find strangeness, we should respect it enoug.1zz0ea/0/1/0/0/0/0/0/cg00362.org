  When I was a kid I melted a toy gun on a heater and I really, really wished it would turn into a real gun overnight. It didn't, and this was my first contact with empiricism.

Yes, we all have stories like this. I swear that 100% of all "rationalists" have a story like this. If you are on this subreddit and had never tried acquiring superpowers of any kind by any method, you should really go try it.

Actually, I'm embarrassing. I have /several/. There was the time I took the Wizard's Oath, the time I bought a book on telekinesis and tried to learn it, the time I asked God to keep me from ever growing up, the time I attempted acausal trade with a future superintelligence, and probably some others I can't remember.

Except for keeping from growing up, none of them ever worked. That one may be experimental error.
