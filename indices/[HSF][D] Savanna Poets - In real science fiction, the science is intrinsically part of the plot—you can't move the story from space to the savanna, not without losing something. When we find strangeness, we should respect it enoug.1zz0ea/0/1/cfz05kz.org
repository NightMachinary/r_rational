That's a good point and I don't have a perfectly viable counterargument against it.

That's just very rarely how fantasy is written, often it's focused on people and not on something that could be a technological or a scientific concept. In that case I'd say 'magic' is just 'science' by another name (technological or scientific concept to be precise)

  I fully believe that savannah people could understand that story

It'd be nice to know what exactly does "understand" mean in this context. If you use 'magic' as a placeholder then you are not supposed to understand it in most cases because you can't understand magic. Technology is something that can be understood, magic can't.

Then you have books like Accelerando of Blindsight that are filled with technological concepts and it would still be utterly incomprehensible even if you replaced it all with magic.
