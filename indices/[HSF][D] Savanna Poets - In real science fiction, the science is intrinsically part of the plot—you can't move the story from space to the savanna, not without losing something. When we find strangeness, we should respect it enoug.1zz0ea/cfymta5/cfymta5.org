I've long heard that comparison made, and I've always thought that it falls down when you start allowing for fantasy.

Is a science fiction story no longer a science fiction story when you put it in the Middle Ages and add in magic? Let's say that I have a story about an aggressive hegemonizing swarm - robots that build more of themselves, and whose only goal is to build more of themselves. I can pretty easily "fantasize" that - the robots become golems made of mud, they have their instructions written on a piece of paper held inside their head, etc.

I fully believe that savannah people could understand that story, with the science replaced by magic. Yet I also believe that that's a science fiction story. So either that phrasing of what science fiction is needs to change, or there are whole swaths of stories that I've wrongly classified as "not space opera".
