  That's just very rarely how fantasy is written, often it's focused on people and not on something that could be a technological or a scientific concept.

I think a good question is: does the magic behave more according to the rules for nonliving materials, life forms, or minds?

- Nonliving materials -- "hard" fantasy that's more like scifi
- Life forms -- traditional fantasy literature, based on Romanticism, in which a fundamental component of the in-story reality acts /alive/ without being reducible to anything nonalive. Can still be very lawful.
- Minds -- mythology and fairy-tails, based on attributing volition and even conscious sapience to fundamental components of reality. Usually not very lawful, since the in-story reality is literally being bent around the desires of living minds that aren't reducible to anything else.
