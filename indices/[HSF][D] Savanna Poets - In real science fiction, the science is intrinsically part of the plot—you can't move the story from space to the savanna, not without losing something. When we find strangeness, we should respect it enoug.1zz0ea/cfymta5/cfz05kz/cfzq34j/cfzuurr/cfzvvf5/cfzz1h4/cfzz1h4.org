It's a long time since I've read the books, but at least some duels in the movie versions seem to follow that pattern, especially those in which Gandalf fights. Yeah, but Dragon Ball Z and the like of course.

Anyway, I think that's slightly bad influence on young people. Wishful thinking is useful in some situations, but I think it would be better to teach kids that you can /actually/ bend the reality around your desires, but to do so you must do the physical act of bending and wishful thinking in itself doesn't change anything outside your own mind.

When I was a kid I melted a toy gun on a heater and I really, /really/ wished it would turn into a real gun overnight. It didn't, and this was my first contact with empiricism. Well, fortunately market forces are stronger than that and I could just buy a gun from the black market if I really wanted to. At an older age I bought lottery tickets and I really, /really/ wished I would become a rich man. I did this many times until I realized that the simple act of buying a lottery ticket doesn't bend the reality enough to make me a rich man. One of those lottery simulators made this really intuitive when I played something like thousands of rounds and didn't win anything but dimes and kept playing like forever and never won a jackpot.
