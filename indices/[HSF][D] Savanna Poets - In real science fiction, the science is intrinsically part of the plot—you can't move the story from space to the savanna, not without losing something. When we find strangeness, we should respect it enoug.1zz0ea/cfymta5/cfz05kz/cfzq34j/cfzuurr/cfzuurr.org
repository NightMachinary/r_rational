Oh this was surprising. That distinction is actually what I had in my mind, but I was afraid to generalize my little experience of reading fantasy literature to the whole genre because I wasn't sure if this actually holds true for most fantasy books. If you look at magic battles in Harry Potter or LOTR for example the simplified version of them goes something like this "I use the power of FREE WILL to beat you! - I use my even stronger free will to counter your spell etc."
