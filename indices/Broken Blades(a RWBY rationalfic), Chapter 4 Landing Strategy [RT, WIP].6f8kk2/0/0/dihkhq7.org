Length: I wanted to set myself a weekly update schedule to avoid the pitfalls in terms of consistency I fell into with my last fics and because this is the first betaed fic I'm writing and schedule helps the betas, but expect chapter length to increase once I get home(i.e. for the next update or the update after) and can use a real keyboard to type rather than a 9 inch tablet screen. Worldbuilding: Thanks! It's been genuinely interesting to try to preserve as much of remnant as possible while making it all fit together. (well, almost as much as possible. I have cut out a few things to serve my purposes and darkened everything up a bit.)
