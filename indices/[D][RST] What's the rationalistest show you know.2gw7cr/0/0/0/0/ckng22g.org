I think that must have been what I didn't like. In the movie /Men Who Stare At Goats/ there's this whole "is it real" thing that gets built up over the course of the film, and then, in the last three seconds before the credits roll, [[#s][]] Which seems to defeat the whole point of everything that came before it.
