/Death Note/ comes within spitting distance, but has some flaws, and sometimes seems to be pretending at rationality rather than /actually/ being rational. I'm fairly sure that there are other anime series that come close as well, but I'm not a huge anime fan.

Movies ... some of them at least touch on the themes that I like, but I wouldn't say that they're /rational/ unless I really lower the bar. /The Man from Earth/ was, for the most part, a nice, rational exploration of the concept, but I remember it falling down near the end (though I can't quite recall why). I really liked /Her/, because I thought it was one of the best treatments of A.I. I've seen in a long time. But again, that's spitting distance, not actually rational. Oh, and obviously /Primer/.
