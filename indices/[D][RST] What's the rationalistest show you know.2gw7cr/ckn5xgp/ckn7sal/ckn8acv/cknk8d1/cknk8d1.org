The other problem with Sherlock Holmes is that he lives in a very lawful universe/world and that his laws are always justified (even when they wouldn't normally be). For example, the only reason a watch would be several hours off is because of foreign travel. There's no way you just got the watch and haven't changed it yet. Or your kid played with it. No, foreign travel is the only explanation.
