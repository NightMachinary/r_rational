As far as I understand the term, yes. With a few rare exceptions (namely rape), I don't think any act is always an absolute evil. The consequences of an action are how I judge whether it was "good" or "bad," and the intentions of the person acting is how I judge whether they are "good," "bad," or "stupid."

And for that exception, the reason I consider it always evil is that there are no good consequences or intentions for rape. Even unlikely "repopulate the species" scenarios don't really work: if the breeding pool is so finite that you need to FORCE people to breed, rather than convince them to do so in order to further the species, then the gene pool is probably not diverse enough to be sustainable anyway.
