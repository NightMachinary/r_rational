You're making a ton of subjective claims and treating them as common-sense. It's okay if you're just explaining your preferences, but that's not the tone of criticism you originally took, so I'm going to answer it in that respect, since you're also just making a ton of objective statements that have no backing:

#+begin_quote
  The problem with the airbender plot is pretty simple: it goes nowhere and affects nothing. It's a sidequest; you get bonus exp and gold for it, but you can skip it. Take the airbenders out of the season, what happens? Well...Kai and Opal are gone, so that's good.
#+end_quote

This assume you'd WANT to remove the airbender plot. I had no problems with Opal and Kai. I liked Kai more than Opal, she was kind of flat, but I don't see how removing them is automatically "good." He's not a Tier 1 character, but he's not a BAD one either, he just doesn't get enough screen time to really be interesting. They peform the roles they're there to perform: not everyone is going to be a fully fleshed out and intricate character. There are just too many of them, and not enough time.

And the airbenders as whole were not a distraction or a "side quest." It was core to the season: "Change." I enjoyed it. I think it was interesting and compelling and worth watching and set up a whole new branch of lore in the world of Avatar, namely the role of the new airbender nation being wandering monks acting for balance, like jedi knight errants.

  It runs out of steam entirely on its own accord. It just...isn't going anywhere. There's no narrative force sustaining it. There's nothing concrete and immediate to accomplish once the airbenders are gathered, gathering them doesn't seem to affect anything, Korra doesn't really care, no one is trying to hurt them except Zaheer, and Zaheer doesn't actually care about them at all; they're just a plot device to get to Korra. So it's a sidequest. You do it, get the bonus exp and gold, flesh out the world a little...but it's eminently skippable.
#+end_quote

It does not run out of steam at all. If the airbenders hadn't been there, Zaheer would have just gone around killing more world leaders, maybe kidnapped someone else Korra cared about to try and get her to come to him. Maybe that would have been more interesting. I would have been happy if that's the path the story took, personally, but I'm fine with what it did instead. Again, still tied to the core theme of the season: The Red Lotus are agents of "Change," this time in a not so great way.

#+begin_quote
  Korra doesn't care. She goes on the adventure because she has nothing better to do. So our main character doesn't care at all. That's not good.
#+end_quote

You said this earlier too, but... what do you mean "Korra doesn't really care?" What exactly makes you so confidently assert such a thing? She gave herself up to save them. How is that not caring?

#+begin_quote
  The Red Lotus lose all their strength as bad guys because we simply have no idea what their goals are. Are they bad guys? We don't know! Is Korra in danger? /shrug, no idea! What will happen if the Red Lotus wins? Your guess is as good as mine!
#+end_quote

Why do you need to know their motives right away though? Isn't it okay to not know? The tension comes partly from *not knowing.* If someone tried to kidnap you, would you have no tension because you didn't know if they were going to kill your or give you ice cream? No, you assume they're not friendly until you have reason to think otherwise. Makes perfect sense to me.

And isn't it interesting to have a period of time where you wonder if they're actually not bad guys? If they'd told you from the beginning that they wanted to end the cycle of the Avatar, they would have been far less interesting, to me. I liked the ambiguity: I liked that moment in the spirit world where maybe, just maybe, Zaheer was going to give an explanation that turned everything on its head and made Korra turn away from the White Lotus.

And once you DID know why they wanted her, it fit perfectly with their anarchist worldview that if they want to end all rulers and make everyone equal, they'd do away with the Avatar.

#+begin_quote
  Also, keeping the ostensibly main character, Korra, completely uninvolved with the plot because writing around superpowers is hard ruins the plot anyway. Watching the villains run around while the main character pouts and says, "Gosh, I'm angry!" is not gripping. But that's a whole 'nother can of worms.
#+end_quote

Okay, this is the first thing in your post I really actually agree with. I don't like Korra much. I think she's too stupid to be interesting, and the writers are giving her the idiot ball on top of that low intellect. I remember in the first episode of season 3 when the guy on the bridge was like "I don't want to be an air bender! Make it stop!" and she said "I'm sorry, I can't do that," and I said out loud "Um... yes you can, Korra. You can do that." Unless losing Aang meant also forgetting how to fix people's chakra points and/or spiritbend

Also, why she didn't depose the Earth Queen is just beyond me. Like... she was KIDNAPPING AIRBENDERS and forcing them into a secret army, and she LIED TO THE AVATAR ABOUT IT! Totally abusing her power is a bit more fuzzy in terms of what crosses the line between "maintaining balance" and "being kingmaker," but the airbender kidnapping was exactly the kind of thing the Avatar is meant to stop! AND SHE JUST LEAVES. Like "OOooh, if I ever see her again I'm gonna [something unspecific]!" But she just leaves with the airbenders. HEY KORRA, YOU KNOW SHE'S JUST GOING TO CONTINUE KIDNAPPING AIRBENDERS RIGHT?!

GAH!

/calms down.

So we agree on that, more or less. Moving on:

#+begin_quote
  You did mention liking the Red Lotus, but what no that is just no. None of them had personalities except Zaheer the Serious Boring Flat Guy worthy of Tenzin. Gazan's non-character was utterly ruined in his final confrontation with Bolin and Mako, and P'li or however you spell her name awkwardly vomits up exposition about her Tragic Backstory so that when she gets fridged for Zaheer's development the writers might be able to trick themselves into thinking it's gripping stuff.
#+end_quote

First, I disagree that Tenzin is boring and flat: not every character is going to be open minded and progressive and into excitement and adventure, and it makes sense for him to be the way he is. It would be better if his "stodginess" were due to being more rational rather than more traditionalist, but that doesn't make his character a bad one.

And I liked Zaheer as a Dangerous Idealist. He showed how an airbender can take their culture/ideals of freedom and detachment and crank them up to 11 to become a villain. The rest of the Red Lotus sadly didn't get enough screen time to really flesh them out, but that leads me to my main criticism of Korra, which is kind of in line with yours:

#+begin_quote
  I do agree the ending scene was cool. LoK has some cool ideas. The execution, however, is consistently abysmal.
#+end_quote

I think it's really a matter of being too short. The first season's plot was almost perfect up until the very end, where they seemed to have crammed a whole extra season's worth of content and reveals and character arcs into 2 episodes. I HATED what they did with who Aman really was (though that might just be because it differed from what I had in mind: the world's first pure spiritbender) and how Korra got Aang-ex-machina'd all better. (though I did hear a cool fan interpretation that makes the ending to season 1 actually better: when Korra stood at the edge of the cliff and started crying, she was about to commit suicide, and that's what Aang meant by "When we reach our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change."). So I think those issues would have been better if the season was longer.

Same with season 3. I definitely think the story would have been better if it was longer: if we had more time to get to know the Red Lotus characters, if we had more time to see the impact the of the returning Air Benders, if we had more time to get to know Kai and Opal, if we saw the world thrown into chaos by Zaheer going around and killing world leaders, etc.

But for what it was, I think it was done well. I think it's fair enough to say that I enjoy the worldbuilding more than anything in the story, but I didn't find the story repellent, and I did like the dialogue and characters overall: Asami is no Sokka unfortunately, but Mako and Bolin work well together... far better than either of them do alone like in season 2.
