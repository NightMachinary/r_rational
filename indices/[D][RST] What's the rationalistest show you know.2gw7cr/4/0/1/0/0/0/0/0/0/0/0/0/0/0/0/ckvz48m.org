Korra's interest in the airbenders is all tell, no show, and it's not even much tell. It seems to be more a function of getting evicted from Republic City than anything. Same with Beifong, whose actual effect on the course of the story is basically nil. Neither [[http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2dntjg/s3_korra_is_princess_zelda_can_we_talk_about_that/][Korra nor Beifong function to move the plot whatsoever]]. This is not true of Tenzin and Mako, making them the main characters once more.

The problem with Zaheer's motives isn't that the details are secret, but that the direction, if you will, of the motives is secret. Did he want to hurt Korra? Who knows. Was he bad for the world? ...Hard to say. Zuko gave some painfully bad exposition amounting to, "He's a bad guy definitely a bad guy it's Zuko saying this so you'll believe it." But it's the barest telling and no showing.

Beifong didn't have any character development in season 3 being given a not-so-tragic backstory for no reason in order to resolve a relationship with her sister established in the previous episode for no effect whatsoever on the plot isn't character development. It's pure filler. Also: Lin teaching Korra metalbending for some reason other than "nothing better to do" rather than Suyin would have been so good. Surely someone must have suggested it.

  Asami?

  Prove herself as an Airbending Master, so her father treats her with respect. Getting her tattoos in the finale is the culmination of this.

Interesting take on Asami's character. I hadn't considered her as a secret airbender, communicating with her father through their spiritual connection. ;)
