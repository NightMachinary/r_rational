Woops, read that as Jinora for some reason.

In that post you linked to, I mostly agree with [[/u/MagicBoats]]. I think the people who enjoyed this season enjoyed it for the world building, but there /was/ still a plot: it just wasn't central to the season.

I don't like Korra as a protagonist. She's boring and dumb. But she still had a goal. You can assert that this goal was unimportant *to you,* but you cannot objectively say that *the audience* doesn't care about it, because I'm part of the audience and I did, as did [[/u/MagicBoats]]. Trying to argue that we only care about it because we cared about Aang is just silliness. I cared about it because I care about the air bender nation. Aang was just the face I associated with it in series 1, but he's not in this one, and yet I still care about it.

That's the problem with the half of your critique that I disagree with. If *you* found it frustrating that Zaheer's motivations were kept secret, that's fine. But that does not make it a bad writing decision, because I would have found him much more boring and predictable as a villain if they were not.
