Okay, let me try this another way. Maybe saying s3 had no plot is too strong. But most of the main characters are devoid of character motivation. What drives Korra over the course of the season? How about Beifong? Asami? The Earth Queen? The Red Lotus? We learn Zaheer's motive in the finale, which is too late, but we never learn about the others.

The reason Tenzin, Mako and Bolin end up feeling like the main characters of season 3 is that they had some motivation and purpose. Tenzin is rebuilding the air nation, Mako and Bolin are reuniting with their family and trying to protect Korra.

The lack of motivation from some of the ostensibly most important characters in the season, Korra and Zaheer most damagingly, is what creates the feeling that the show has no plot.

Kai and Opal suck because they can be removed from the show with the barest superficial changes. It's like General Iroh from season 1 again. Or Asami from all 3 seasons. Or Bumi and Kya from season 2. Suyin is the same, actually. I expect the Fire Lordess in s4 will be just as pointless.
