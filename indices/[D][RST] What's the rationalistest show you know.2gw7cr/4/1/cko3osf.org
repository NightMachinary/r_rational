Okay, no. I liked the show, but in no form and shape can I imagine that we can stretch the word "rationalist" in order to include it in that description. A show being /good/ and a show being rationalist aren't the same thing by far.

EDIT: But I guess the original poster asked for just the /most/ rationalist show, and since I don't really have any suggestions of my own that I would feel properly qualify for the title, I shouldn't have complained.
