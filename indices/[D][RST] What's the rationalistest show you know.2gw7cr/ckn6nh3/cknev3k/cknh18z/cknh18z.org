Yeah, it's a shame they had to [[#s][]], I think the last four episodes are all a little weak in terms of writing and voice acting of incidental characters.

The [[#s][]] was a bit of an ass-pull, but I also appreciate that someone on the writing team was keeping track of these things and realised that they needed something to do that. I wouldn't necessarily expect a tv series, especially a kids tv series to be so dedicated to continuity.
