Well, yes and no. Airbender is one of my favorite shows ever, but about half the main badguys are pretty much just pure sociopath/megamaniacally evil. Which is fine, not every bad guy needs to be complex: some people really are megamanical and sociopaths. But when the MAIN antagonists are, it does detract a bit from the overall story, I think.

On top of that, the ending was a total deus-ex-machina. Not just Aang getting hit back into the rock in the exact spot that somehow unlocked his Avatar state again and lets him kick Ozai's ass, but also the whole concept and execution of "spirit bending," as cool a concept as it was.

One of my favorite scenes of whole series was [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol040QSq_kk&channel=PrincessAzulaTV][Aang's conversations with his past selves]], where he kept asking what he should do about killing Ozai, and they kept responding, indirectly and then directly, about how sometimes you have no choice but to kill. I actually teared up a little when he was talking to the past air nomad:

  Yes, all life is sacred...

  I know, I'm even a vegetarian! I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever, and I've never used violence except in self defense, and certainly never to take a life!

  Avatar Aang, I know that you are a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well. But this isn't about you: this is about the world.

  But the monks taught me that I have to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free!

  Many great and wise air nomads have detached themselves, and attained spiritual enlightenment. But the avatar can never do it, because your sole duty is TO the world. Here is my wisdom for you: selfless duty calls for you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world.

This was a beautiful bit of dialogue, and was incredibly well thought out way to introduce what's usually a family-unfriendly, but still very true, aesop into the show. Sometimes you just don't have any good choices. Sometimes, a death is the lesser of two evils. And when you're facing an incredibly powerful magic emperor who will never stop until he rules the world in a fight to the death, that's kind of one of those moments (unless you want to cut his arms and legs off, cauterize the wounds, and keep him in a jail cell until he dies of old age, which is really just torture combined with murder). The lion-turtle even said something like "the pure heart can weather the shadow without being consumed by it," which I took to mean "You can kill without being tainted by it if you do it for the right reasons" or some such.

But, because it ultimately WAS a kid's show, and having the child main character kill the bad guy would have been a no-no, they pulled spiritbending out of nowhere and got a nice and peaceful and happy ending, with no character development or harsh compromises or sacrifices.

So yeah. I love the show and ultimately agree with you that it's really well written and rational, but it does fall prey to some bad writing tropes, in my view.
