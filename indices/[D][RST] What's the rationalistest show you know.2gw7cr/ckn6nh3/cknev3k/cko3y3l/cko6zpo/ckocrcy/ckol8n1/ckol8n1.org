Well I was very careful not to talk to anyone about Season 3 until I could watch it all at once (I hate knowing anything about new shows/seasons before I watch them, at all), so for me conformity had little if any influence.

So that's why I enjoyed it. There are other things too, like the lack of heavy-handed romantic subplots and the more dangerous/lethal tone to the story.

What did you dislike about it?
