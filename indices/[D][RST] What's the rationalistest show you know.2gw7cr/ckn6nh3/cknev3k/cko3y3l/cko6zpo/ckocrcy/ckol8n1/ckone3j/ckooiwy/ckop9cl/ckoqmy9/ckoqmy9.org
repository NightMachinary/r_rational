What on earth do you mean those aren't plots? They most certainly are. You seem to have a very narrow definition of "plot." Taking the part I happened to mention literally and exclusively without context would be just a "goal," yeah, but as you watched the show I was assuming you'd know the rest of the details that made it a plot. Namely, the conflict and obstacles that got in the way of the goal, and the character development of the protagonists along the way to help them reach their goal. They were plots.

As for the second spoiler, honestly I'm not even sure what you're saying. I enjoy comedic shouting as much as anyone, but this was a bit incoherent :P What was the "most inexplicable decision in writing history?" What "twist" are you referring to?

Normally I'd be merely interested in such an analysis, but your perspective is so strange I'm fascinated XD
