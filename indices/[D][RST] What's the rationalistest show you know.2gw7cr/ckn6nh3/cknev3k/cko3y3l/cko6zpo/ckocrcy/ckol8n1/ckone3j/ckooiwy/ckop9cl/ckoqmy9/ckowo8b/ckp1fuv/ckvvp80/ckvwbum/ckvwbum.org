  What drives Korra over the course of the season?
#+end_quote

Bringing back the Airbenders. Everywhere she looks there are people blaming her for messing the world up. She brought the spirits to the world, but no one's particularly happy about that. She can't send away the giant trees in Republic City. She even lost the past avatars! She pretty much sees herself as a failure.

But! At the very least, one good thing that's come of everything is that now the airbenders are back. After almost 200 years, the world will have all four nations again, instead of relying on the descendents of one family who, if wiped out, would make them truly extinct again.

So her motivation is to make sure the airbenders are found and properly trained and join up with Tenzin so that she finally has a positive mark on her record of Avatarness. Bringing balance to the world is what Avatars are supposed to do, after all. This motivation carries her all the way through to the metalbender city, where she's almost kidnapped: after that it becomes a "find out what the badguys are up to and maybe beat them up" thing.

  How about Beifong?
#+end_quote

Pretty much just trying to protect the Avatar. The family drama at the metalbending city was a subplot, but her motivation is clear, if one dimensional.

  Asami?
#+end_quote

Prove herself as an Airbending Master, so her father treats her with respect. Getting her tattoos in the finale is the culmination of this.

  Zaheer
#+end_quote

Like I said, I liked that Zaheer's motives were secret for so long. It gave a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty to the story, the lack of which would have been mind-numbingly predictable otherwise. "Oh he wants to kidnap the avatar so he can kill her and end the cycle? Yeah, like that'll happen." At least when you aren't sure WHY he's gathering his friends and trying to kidnap Korra, there's some sense of mystery and suspense. I was really half expecting him to say something to Korra in the spirit world that revealed a sinister conspiracy of the White Lotus.

  Kai and Opal suck because they can be removed from the show with the barest superficial changes. It's like General Iroh from season 1 again. Or Asami from all 3 seasons. Or Bumi and Kya from season 2. Suyin is the same, actually. I expect the Fire Lordess in s4 will be just as pointless.
#+end_quote

Generally agree with all this except for Suyin. Her character actually felt fleshed out and interesting, and played a particular role in character development for Chief Beifong (who I kinda expect to die in Season 4 after so much character buildup).
