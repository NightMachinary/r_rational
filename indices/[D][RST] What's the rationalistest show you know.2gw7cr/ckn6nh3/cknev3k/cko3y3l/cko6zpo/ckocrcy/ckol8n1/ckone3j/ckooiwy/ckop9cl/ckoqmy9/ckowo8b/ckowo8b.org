I don't want to do this whole post in spoiler tags, so, you know, s3 LoK spoilers....

The problem with the airbender plot is pretty simple: it goes nowhere and affects nothing. It's a sidequest; you get bonus exp and gold for it, but you can skip it. Take the airbenders out of the season, what happens? Well...Kai and Opal are gone, so that's good. Zaheer needs a different way of blackmailing Korra and different bullshit powers, and some other plot device is needed to beat Zaheer at the end.

That's it. All of the ways in which the airbender plot tie into the main plot are highly substitutable; it wouldn't take much work to write them out entirely. It doesn't merge with the Zaheer plot; it gets totally eaten by it. But the Zaheer plot doesn't replace the airbender plot. It runs out of steam entirely on its own accord. It just...isn't going anywhere. There's no narrative force sustaining it. There's nothing concrete and immediate to accomplish once the airbenders are gathered, gathering them doesn't seem to affect anything, Korra doesn't really care, no one is trying to hurt them except Zaheer, and Zaheer doesn't actually care about them at all; they're just a plot device to get to Korra. So it's a sidequest. You do it, get the bonus exp and gold, flesh out the world a little...but it's eminently skippable.

There's nothing wrong with sidequests in particular. A:TLA had some good ones. The other problem with the airbender plot is that no one cares. Korra doesn't care. She goes on the adventure because she has nothing better to do. So our main character doesn't care at all. That's not good. But Tenzin...well, Tenzin has been frightfully boring for 2 seasons, and his Close Fatherly Bonding Relationship with Korra is primarily informed. So Korra doesn't care that Tenzin cares, and the audience doesn't care because seriously, if Tenzin was written out of the show, what would change? Remember, all of this is happening before the fight in "Ultimatum," the first and only good Tenzin scene. It's a good Tenzin moment, no doubt about it, but it comes way too late to make us care about what the character cares about.

But suppose it were Aang. We care about Aang, and we probably think we care about the Air Nomads because Aang cared about them, but that's really us just caring about Aang. Yet I think even if it were Aang on this sidequest, not Tenzin, it wouldn't go very far. The simple fact is, Restoring an Ancient culture is boring. If you read about a real-life version on the news, you would think it's neat but not really care. A fictional version is even more boring. Perhaps this problem could be solved by showing how it would affect the rest of the world, but the show doesn't even try. So...the main character doesn't care, the primarily involved character no one cares about (at least, they shouldn't because he's objectively boring, flat and mostly irrelevant to everything), and the audience has no intrinsic reason to care and aren't given a related reason to latch onto like Restoring Balance or whatever. Also, Kai. Kai is so bad. He's even worse than Wan. I don't know how the people behind such great characters like we had in A:TLA can make such bland, forgettable, irrelevant characters like we get in LoK.

As for the Zaheer plot, it doesn't work first of all because it depends on keeping Korra out of the action. Neutralizing your main character and only interesting facet of the show because writing around her superpowers is hard is a bad idea, but that's not really the problem. The real problem is WHY WOULD YOU KEEP THEIR MOTIVES A SECRET OH GOD.

This blows my mind. The airbender plot I can see happening. Someone has what seems like a good idea and only later do they realize it goes nowhere and does nothing, by which point it's too late. But keeping the Red Lotus's goal with regard to Korra a secret? That...that...is just...so wrong...I can't...my brain....

The Red Lotus lose all their strength as bad guys because we simply have no idea what their goals are. /Are/ they bad guys? We don't know! Is Korra in danger? /shrug, no idea! What will happen if the Red Lotus wins? Your guess is as good as mine!

The bad guys don't need to state the details of their evil plan, and of course you want to save a twist for the end, but we need to have some sense of their motives and the consequences of the different possible outcomes of the conflict. Otherwise, there's no tension and we don't care because we're not presented with anything to care about. The Red Lotus got Korra with paralysis dart things they never use again and how did they get those anyway--oh no! ...Right? Because...something bad will happen...probably. I mean, they've got to be the bad guys, right?

The Red Lotus suck anyway, but that's just the usual bad writing that is LoK's standard. The choice to obliterate the tension they can create in the scene and the threat they pose /by not telling us if and what threat they pose/ is just...so wrong.

Also, keeping the ostensibly main character, Korra, completely uninvolved with the plot because writing around superpowers is hard ruins the plot anyway. Watching the villains run around while the main character pouts and says, "Gosh, I'm angry!" is not gripping. But that's a whole 'nother can of worms.

Also, neither of the plots involved Kai being gruesomely murdered by a gang of rhinoceros bears.

This is all just off the top of my head, and there's so, so much more wrong with season 3 (some of which isn't the fault of season 3, like the horrible problems with Mako, Bolin and Asami's characters, which come from seasons 1 and 2).

I notice that most of your comments about what you liked about the season were world-building things, not story or character things. There's nothing wrong with that, but Cool World Building isn't the same as A Well-Told Story with Engaging, Sympathetic Characters. You did mention liking the Red Lotus, but what no that is just no. None of them had personalities except Zaheer the Serious Boring Flat Guy worthy of Tenzin. Gazan's non-character was utterly ruined in his final confrontation with Bolin and Mako, and P'li or however you spell her name awkwardly vomits up exposition about her Tragic Backstory so that when she gets fridged for Zaheer's development the writers might be able to trick themselves into thinking it's gripping stuff.

I do agree the ending scene was cool. LoK has some cool ideas. The execution, however, is consistently abysmal.
