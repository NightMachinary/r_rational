How about Avatar: The last airbender series.

The characters are introduced as typical good/evil, but this is deconstructed through the series into believably complex characters and politics.

Everything in the plot is character driven, and there are no deus ex flashbacks to retcon character driven causes onto events that seem arbitrary at the time.

Although its hard to show characters problem solving without an internal monologue, to the extent that its possible the characters get around problems by coming up with plans, working things out and building contraptions. Note: there are also occasional calls to mysticism to fix problems, so its a mixed bag.

There are only a couple of moments of rational exploration of the magic in the world, and they're heavily laced with the mysticism of the universe, but the rules of the world are for the most part set out explicitly and followed.

There aren't really any puzzles for the viewer to follow, and there are no description of rationality, but you wouldn't expect that in the medium.
