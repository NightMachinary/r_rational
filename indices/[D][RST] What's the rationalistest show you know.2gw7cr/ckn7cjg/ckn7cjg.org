What about The Lost Room series. I don't know if I'd call it completely rational fiction, but it does have the same feeling of rationally investigating a world of seemingly inscrutable effects that you get from some rational fanfics, trying to expose the underlying mechanics, and using logic to kind of munchkin around the limitations of different powers and things. Its a good series anyway, so if you watch it and decide its not really rational then you won't feel too bad.
