A second thought (started as another reply to keep the discussion separate):

Farscape seasons 1-3 are more rationalist than most tv shows. The main character has motivations and actually is extremely out of his depth for most of the show. He lacks knowledge of things that are basic fundamentals for other characters in the show (including not knowing how to brush his teeth with their tools).

He tries to use reason to solve his conflict with the Peacekeepers (though they refuse his reasoning due to their different viewpoint).
