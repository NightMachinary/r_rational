I think Game of Thrones is actually quite rationalist.

All of the characters have complex backstories and reasons for their actions. It avoids the trope of cackling madman for all of the main characters (and for the supplemental characters, you never see enough of them so it may just be one aspect of their personality).

The characters act according to their own best interest, and are rarely saved by deus ex machina. All sides define themselves as the good side (and there are certainly more than 2 sides).

The rules of the world are actually sane and consistant. The reason so many "unknown" magical things are happening is because the world has a high/low magic cycle, where it goes through a period of thousands of years of low magic before going through a few hundred years of high magic. So the lack of knowledge about fundamental rules of their world can be explained by poor record keeping and lack of a true education system.

Though it does have a significant advantage over other shows. For Game of Thrones, characters have the weight of the book backing up their characters, and many of the examples above are not well portrayed as rationalist in the tv show. But they are well portrayed in the books.
