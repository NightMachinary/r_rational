Yes, but Sherlock Holmes (and House) is not really using rationalist methodology either:

#+begin_quote
  But when you look at what Sherlock Holmes does - you can't go out and do it at home. Sherlock Holmes is not really operating by any sort of reproducible method. He is operating by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction. Maybe it's just me, but it seems to me that reading Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise. Holmes is a mutant superhero. And even if you did try to imitate him, it would never work in real life.

Though its worth noting that Arthur Conan Doyle did use 'forensic' science (in the not-quite Holmesian sense) to exonerate two people: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle#Correcting_injustice]]
