You can actually take [[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159][Yale's Game Theory class]] online, with all of the lectures in series (Youtube, HTML transcript, MP3), all the course materials, handouts, blackboard notes, etc.

You can also check out the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/dbe/introduction_to_game_theory_sequence_guide/][LessWrong Introduction to Game Theory Sequence]].
