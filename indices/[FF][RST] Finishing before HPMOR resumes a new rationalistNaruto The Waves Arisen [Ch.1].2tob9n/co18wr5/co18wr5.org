I'll be impressed if the author actually manages to finish a novel-length story in about 20 days (read 50,000 words). Either the author already has the whole thing written, or has the story planned out in extreme detail and this is a NaNoWriMo-like challenge for himself with plenty of free time to do it in.

I'll read the chapter tonight and post my criticisms on the site then.

Good luck [[/u/Wertifloke]]!

... /Later Comment/ ...

Does it qualify as an 'acasual trade' if I used my model of [[/u/Wertifloke]] to understand that he's holding future chapters hostage unless his readers leave reviews, as a reason to leave a detailed, hopefully insightful comment?

Does anyone know of good sources on Game Theory? Preferably online, but books are good too.
