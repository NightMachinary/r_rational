  Does it qualify as an 'acasual trade' if I used my model of [[/u/Wertifloke]] to understand that he's holding future chapters hostage unless his readers leave reviews, as a reason to leave a detailed, hopefully insightful comment?

Not an expert here, but this seems like ordinary causal trade to me; you did something that your model of the world expects to causally cause them (or make it more likely for them) to post.

Now, if they had originally posted all the chapters at once with the expectation that people would comment /anyway/ - now, /that/ has a chance at being acausal. Not really, because your model is nowhere near detailed enough to actually make acausal trade possible, but at least that would be the kind of thing that could work if the models were better.

Hope that answers your question.
