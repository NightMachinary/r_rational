Ok, nice I liked the chapter. =) The plot progression still feels fast but now it has at least concluded some aspects and given that the mages dont seem to be proactive, as well as the archmage taking a break it will finally slow down a bit. And hopefully Nics life will now return to a more mundane lifestyle focusing on the character progression and worldbuilding around him. Right now the whole school still feels way to 2 dimensional and will need some storytelling , same goes for Nics new friends.
