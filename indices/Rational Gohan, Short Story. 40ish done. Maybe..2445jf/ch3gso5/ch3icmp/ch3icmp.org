I'm also interested to see where it goes. I've got some plans thought out, some are more ambitious than others lengthwise.

I've literally never written a work of fiction longer than a two page English essay, so I'm fairly terrified of biting off more than I can chew. (Hence the five chapter mini-story.)

Any thoughts? Characters you want to see, suggestions on any and everything? Critiques? I'm a blank slate where this is concerned, virtually anything you can say is valuable.

No pressure.
