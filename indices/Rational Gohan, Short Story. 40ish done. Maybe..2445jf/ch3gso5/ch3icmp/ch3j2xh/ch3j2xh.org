I think it's going remarkably well so far considering your inexperience with writing fiction :) It explains the roughness to the prose, but that'll fade with revisions and experience.

I really like the way you're describing Ki, as it's exactly how I always envisioned it. Having to actively reinforce certain parts of your body makes perfect sense considering the way the characters in the show's toughness so wildly varies at times.

I am curious to see how Vegeta reacts to this. Remember, he did in fact think of himself on Namek, so I always found it odd that he never brought it up again later in the series. Even without Dende, he did know about the existence of senzu beans, after all.

Minor thing: Korin says "I don't want to trust you kid. But I've made the same mistake with your father." What he means by this isn't immediately clear; on the surface it sounds like a contradiction. Maybe think of rewording it?
