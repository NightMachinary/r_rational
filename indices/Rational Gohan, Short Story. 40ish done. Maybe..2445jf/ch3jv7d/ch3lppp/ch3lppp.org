That sounds like an interesting sort of story, besides the art not working what ever become of it?

I really liked Dragonball Z, and loved Dragonball, but they really did jump off the deep end pretty much right after the Saiyan Saga. Introducing "Power Levels" that were inconsistent from essentially every angle, the zenkai concept, the way gravity seemed incompatible with everything. (How is it that a man who can lift 50 ton boulders with ease and blow up planets and who canonically weights 80~ kg possibly give a shit about 100x gravity?)

I always justified it to myself by imagining Goku/Vegeta's bodies were made of absurdly dense material. Dense enough to fuck with the normal laws that govern how dense objects can possibly be, just to make the math work out with how strong they were compared to the environment vs. the numbers given. (Which is something I think I'm going to keep in any fanfiction I write, definitely anything close to "rational" fiction.)

Also, I have a couple plans for how zenkai is going to work to prevent it from being overpowered while keeping with it's canon usages. We'll see anyway.
