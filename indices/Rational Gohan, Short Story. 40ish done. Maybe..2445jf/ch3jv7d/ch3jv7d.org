What coincidence, happened into this sub on a long chain of links and saw this. I wrote a storyline for a graphic novel not unlike Dragonball (which remains unpublished because the artist is lazy) that dealt with a lot of those ideas.

While Goku always bounced back from injuries with plot-like speed, the whole zenkai concept didn't really come into play until somewhere around issue 180 (around when the show transitioned over to Z). I suspect it was a quick way to retcon a lot of things for Toriyama and provide a way to for his protagonists to gain huge power in short periods of time (and the concept vanishes as inexplicably as it appeared along with any mention of numeric power levels after they started needing scientific notation).

In any case our story had nothing to do with DB other than being a similar flying kung fu laser brawl; but the rationalization for how a character increased the level of mystical spirit power they could utilize was simply through intense practice and experience. We also added an element of danger in that trying to channel too much of it could fry your mind or body and leave you permanently crippled, vegetative, or dead, so there was a well known reason for characters to be afraid of simply pushing themselves to the absolute limit repeatedly, as it was impossible to know where the exact, razor thin line between "I can" and "I'm dead" is.

When faced with do-or-die scenarios, several characters of course realize this and go for broke, however in the majority of cases they burned themselves out and accomplished nothing in the process.

Quite a bit of the interpersonal storylines involved the embittered old folks cautioning the brash youngsters against such excesses, as they had seen so many shooting stars flare out.

But yes, given zenkai and senzu beans, it really made absolutely no sense for Goku, Piccolo, and Gohan not to be beating each other half to death on an almost daily basis because unlike Bejiita or the various other villainous characters, they knew with great certainty they wouldn't actually kill each other. I'm sure Toriyama realized this but it probably would have seemed like cheating. Piccolo and Gohan could have hopped into the Seishi to Toki no heya for like, 20 minutes at any given time with a dozen senzu beans and come out with Gohan at whatever stage of super saiyajin was necessary for their current predicament. (in fact one of the biggest WTFs about the post-Cell storyline was that Piccolo apparently completely forgot about Gohan after Goku's second death and never even bothered to spar with him occasionally, leading to one of the most tragic cases of ruined character development I can remember in young adult fiction).

There's a similar rational line down to why the Namek warrior caste didn't practice fusing on a massive scale, because a half dozen of them together would have trivially defeated Friiza, and their species apparently lives thousands of years. The moral quandary of six individuals to secure a planet for millennia doesn't seem too rough.
