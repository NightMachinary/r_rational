Is there a reason why Arthur must have been pulled off at the moment of death?

He lived for a lot of years before Joon. For all we know Arthur was pulled at the same time and the DM just made the thing happen first and kept Joon in stasis or something. He is literally omnipotent afaik. There is no reason why the "real" universe couldn't have had heat death already.
