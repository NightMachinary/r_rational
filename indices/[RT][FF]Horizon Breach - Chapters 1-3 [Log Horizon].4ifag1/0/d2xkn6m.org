  :END:
Players once trapped in a video game world find a way to connect it to the original world... but since the video game world is a real world in its own right, they get to keep their powers, and people back on earth can figure out how to use them as well. Politics ensue.

Log Horizon fans will get the most out of this, but it's written so as to be relatively understandable by people not familiar with the source material.

I've been throwing around the idea of how to write a story about the world as it discovers magic, and this is the final result of several iterations, including that experiment I did with the guy in his cabin, and a thread about how to limit magic spread.

Thank you very much to all the [[/r/rational]] users who helped get the first two chapters squeaky clean and out the door, as well as the users who responded to all my what-ifs.
