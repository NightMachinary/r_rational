  Just out of curiosity have you read the novels, or is this based entirely off of the anime?
#+end_quote

Anime, but I'm making extensive use of the Wiki. I can't stand reading fan-translated work, as everything just feels so stilted.

  Though I'm probably biased as I don't really like her much.

To be honest, my internal reasoning just boiled down to having to pick someone from LH so readers would be familiar, and because Shiroe is more difficult to write (he's smarter than me), Minori was my second best choice. Isuzu probably would have been a good pick... but I honestly completely forgot about her during planning.

Don't worry, though-- she won't be the only character to go through.

Thanks for the typo checking, by the way!
