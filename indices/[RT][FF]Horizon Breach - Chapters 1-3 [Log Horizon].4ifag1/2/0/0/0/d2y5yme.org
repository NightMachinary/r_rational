  Gotcha. I've watched Seasons 1 and 2 twice each and can't remember it, which makes me pretty confident it hasn't happened in the anime. Might be worth looking into the timeline on when that occurs to see if it messes with continuity.

Chronologically it's bound to have happened-- Plant Hwyaden bought the Cathedral the same way Shiroe bought the guild building, but where just more proactive about enforcing their power.

Oh well, even if I'm wrong, I doubt we're getting S3 anyways with S2 sort of flopping and the author's tax evasion, so I don't think anyone else will call me out on it :P
