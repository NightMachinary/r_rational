Enjoyed it pretty well overall! A few quick notes:

In chapter 2, still not sure why Shiroe didn't just private message Akatsuki with what he wanted: she implies that he did something to "flush out" her prey by forcing them to go into hiding? Doesn't really make sense to me.

In chapter 3, the revelation that people in our world have classes and can use skills like in Elder Tale is a rather drastic plot point. I have to wonder how it occurs: did people in our world develop the ability to cast Elder Tale style magic the second Minori came through, or only through exposure to her does the "game-ness" of levels and spells, even physical action "spells," spread to them? Also, she should know better than to teach someone an aggro-gaining move as their first thing: she's lucky the Prime Minister's bodyguards didn't shoot him.

Also curious to know what the developers of Elder Tale think of their game suddenly becoming a real world, and why they haven't been brought in on the meeting. Maybe they were the main source of information to brief the Prime Minister on the game, but if so that should be mentioned, since otherwise their absence is noteworthy in the narrative.

Lastly, I don't remember where in the series it was shown that heroes can be stopped from respawning. Is that from the light novel? In any case, Shiroe should definitely have told her to hold that information back. There's no reason for him to treat our world government with any less suspicion or caution as other potential enemies, which is exactly what they are, and he's smart enough to recognize the potential conflicts that are surely on the horizon.
