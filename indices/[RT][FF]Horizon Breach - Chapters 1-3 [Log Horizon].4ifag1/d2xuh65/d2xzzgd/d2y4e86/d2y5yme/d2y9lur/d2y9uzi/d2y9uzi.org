The wiki had something about how their fates were undetermined. I figured it wouldn't matter to shiroe, because he got a plausible reason to smear plant hwyaden.

As for the season problems, Log Horizon pulled pretty decent ratings, even if the DVDs didn't sell fantastically, and the tv network that funded it cared more about ratings. At the same time, though, the people who funded LH get government money, which puts LH in kind of a pickle.

Regardless, we're basically out of canon material, so maybe by the time there'd be enough to make S3 the author would be forgiven.
