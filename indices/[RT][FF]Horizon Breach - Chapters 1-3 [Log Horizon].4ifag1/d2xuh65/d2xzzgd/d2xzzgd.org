  Also, she should know better than to teach someone an aggro-gaining move as their first thing: she's lucky the Prime Minister's bodyguards didn't shoot him.

She's earning her "sorcerer's apprentice," nickname :P. More seriously, I'm trying to exclusively use moves listed on the wiki, and the other samurai abilities are all damage-dealing, so not something she could really have him do in a crowded office.

  Also curious to know what the developers of Elder Tale think of their game suddenly becoming a real world, and why they haven't been brought in on the meeting. Maybe they were the main source of information to brief the Prime Minister on the game, but if so that should be mentioned, since otherwise their absence is noteworthy in the narrative.

Elder Tale is based in the US, so they couldn't get to japan fast enough. And because this won't come up for a fair amount of time (if I bother mentioning it at all) many of the game developers would have been online for the release of the new expansion anyways, so they're themselves trapped in the game world.

  Lastly, I don't remember where in the series it was shown that heroes can be stopped from respawning. Is that from the light novel?

I honestly don't know-- I grabbed the info from the wiki.

Everything else delves into spoilers, but thanks for your review and typo-checking!

(Lander is short for People of the Land, by the way, so "Lander Noble" is as intended.)
