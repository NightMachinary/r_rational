My story, The Daily Grind, gets posted here every time I release a chapter. Personally, I'm not entirely convinced that it's 'rational' in the way some people think about it. I'm basically writing my own spin on the style of banter from Buffy The Vampire Slayer along with bizarre reality bending balls of gel light. It doesn't feel like a rational world, even when /sometimes/ the characters take time to utilize their most powerful too; common sense.

I guess what I'm saying is, on the mock "rationality scale", I'd say a 4/10 is enough?
