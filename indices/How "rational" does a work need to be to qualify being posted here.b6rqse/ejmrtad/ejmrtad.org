7/10 on the old rationality scale. /s

More seriously, if the work has at least some focus on thinking, with care and attention toward internal consistency, it's probably okay, but if a bunch of stuff happens that doesn't make sense, prepare to get ripped to shreds. Generally speaking, the mods won't remove stuff that's "not rational enough", but the community will (probably) downvote stuff that fails the sniff test.
