My preference ranking of posts:

1.  Explicitly rational/rationalist fiction
2.  Thoughtful, well-cited discussion posts about rational/rationalist fiction
3.  Rational-adjacent fiction
4.  Other fiction that has strong appeal to [[/r/rational]] for some other reason
5.  Other fiction
6.  Low-effort discussion of rational fiction
7.  Discussion of fiction in general
8.  Discussion of rationality in general
9.  Memes
10. "Hey this reminds me of thing that happened in popular web serial"
11. Other discussion
12. Trolls/spam

Anything at a 5 or below is at risk of being removed, depending partly on community response, attempts to justify it by the OP, and the amount of effort put into it.

In other words, I won't usually nuke a good discussion thread just because the OP should have posted it in one of the weekly threads (seriously, we have a lot of them), or because they put very little effort into their post. But if the thing you're posting is fiction, you should make sure that it's not /just/ sfnal or fantasy fiction, and if you're posting discussion, you should put effort into making a point or adding something of value.

(With regards to 5 in particular, this subreddit has gotten big enough that authors who are looking to self-promote will sometimes come here just because it's got a lot of eyeballs, take one look at the sidebar, and through motivated reasoning just say 'eh, close enough'. We don't actually have the necessary bandwidth to read everything that gets posted to this subreddit though, which is one of the reason that policing on the basis of whether it's rational enough (or [[/r/rational]] enough) is unfeasible, and doesn't /usually/ happen, though there have been one or two flagrant cases.)
