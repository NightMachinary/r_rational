It doesn't have to be rational at all in order to justify a recommendation if it's something like hard sci-fi (and you explain why you recommended it in the post, well enough to get it approved). SEE: everytime Netflix makes a vaguely science-fiction themed TV show, or when Silicon Valley did a Roko's Basilisk joke. For self-promotion and regular posting, the unwritten rules are a little more stringent, but generally, if you've made the attempt to be rational, it's worth posting here, even if only for discussion or critique. I know [[/u/alexanderwales]] doesn't like chapter spam (which is why WtC updates in chunks, IIRC) but that's not going to get you stopped unless it's really low-effort. I'd advise making a post introducing your story when you write the first chapter, and then worry about subsequent discussions when you've gotten over the [[https://writingcooperative.com/that-dreaded-30-000-word-wall-8b7fb8d71bd0][30,000 word hump]] and are sure you can be consistent. If your story /really/ impresses people then they'll start posting your discussions for you. But you can always message the mods just to be safe.

(sorry for the ping, but I figured this is a context where it'd be good to have some confirmation as to whether I'm misinforming this poor soul or not)
