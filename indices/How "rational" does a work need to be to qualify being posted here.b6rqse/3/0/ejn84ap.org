That seems... very broad. Especially points #2 (motivations) and maybe #5 (world-building) are very common in fiction - ASoIaF seems to fulfil #2, and probably #5 as well, yet I would not readily qualify it as rational fiction. I would also very much hesitate to qualify Captain America: Civil War as a rational work, but it does rather thoroughly explore #2 - probably more thoroughly than, say, HPN20.

I'm not sure I could myself propose a guideline, but it seems to me that #1 is the most important watershed between rational and non-rational fiction, and everything else is merely supportive. I'm not sure if it is a /good/ idea to define rational fiction that way (#2 + #5 seems a very good guideline for "good stories", even if they are not "rational" by lacking #1), but it seems to be closest to what most people intuitively qualify as rational fiction.
