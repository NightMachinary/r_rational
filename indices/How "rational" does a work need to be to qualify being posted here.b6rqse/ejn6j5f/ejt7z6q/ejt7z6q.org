Have there been many Xianxia recommendations? Is there anything as good as Cradle? Every other Xianxi story I've tried to read ended up having one or both of the two major problems with the genre (that Cradle has avoided so far through my read through, though I am only at book 4), namely: The main characters are irredeemable psychopaths with nonsensical motivations and / or the power differentials in the setting make absolutely no sense whatsoever and the author doesn't even attempt to justify how or why the hordes of weak enemies bother to exist / fight the overwhelmingly powerful god-people.
