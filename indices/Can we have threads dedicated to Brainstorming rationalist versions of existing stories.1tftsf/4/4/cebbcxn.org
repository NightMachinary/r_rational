This is a great idea--I was thinking this myself, just the other day.

I think a good title might be "A Rational Animorph" (echoing the classical definition of man as a "rational animal." I also considered "Man is a Rational Animorph" but that just sounds sexist in a way I dislike, despite its lack of sexist intent.

I think the "upgrade" you've given Rachel is pretty solid and can be used to great effect. Reminds me a bit of the "Acts of Caine" series by Matthew Woodring Stover--Stover concieves of the protagonist's "willingness to go further" as a sort of game-breaking superpower.
