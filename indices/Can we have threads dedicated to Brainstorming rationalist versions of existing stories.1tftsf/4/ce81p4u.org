I have, on occasion, floated the idea of Rational!Animorphs. What I really like about the idea is that you don't necessarily need to upgrade your main characters /that much/, because you can spread the power across the five (or six) of them.

- Jake becomes much better at actual tactics. He reads up on military history so that he has something to fall back on when things get really hard. He's very good at instrumental rationality: using what he can to win more and making sure the blade cuts the enemy.

- Marco is the designated skeptic and science-guy. He's also the one keeping the bigger picture in mind, something the others sometimes forget and tends to question the alien's motives more than the others. He's also the one who thinks things through the furthest, looking at all aspects of the battleplan (before initial combat, after that it's Jake's call) and munchkin's their power the hardest. He's also (together with Rachel) one of the main consequentialists of the group.

- Cassie is great at psychology. She understands people and their biases, but also knows how to use the dark arts and manipulate them. She's also the one who has the easiest time seeing the aliens as persons and looking at their different values. Furthermore, her knowledge of animals gets a major upgrade, which aids the rest of the group in using their powers optimally.

- Rachel is the one who goes furthest in order to win, who is willing to sacrifice the most. Her values differ somewhat from the others, in that she doesn't mind all the fighting and even enjoys it. After Jake, she's the best at snap decision making and getting the job done. (To be honest, I'm not quite sure what rationality upgrade to give her. She's mainly characterized by being freakishly good at fighting.)

- Tobias, apart from being a bird, is a good all-rounder. He's able to lead, is smart and can be willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. His main upgrade would be a strong adherence to the truth. He can't stand falsehoods and helps others see what's really out there.

- Ax's main role would be "token alien", but he's also the one with very different values from the rest of the team. I'd need to do some figuring out how this shows exactly, but Andalites should definitely think differently than humans.

The story would be quite similar in the beginning, but escalate quickly. The animal forms allow for excellent stealth missions and they'd resort to sneaking in explosives into the Yeerk pools. Open confrontations would be avoided but probably still happen frequently (no plan survives enemy contact, after all). In response, the Yeerks (and especially Visser Three) would escalate as retaliation, which would lead to open war a lot quicker. The Yeerks would also be better at infesting key persons, giving them more power to cover up these escalations.
