Rational Superman. Only, instead of Superman, the focus is either on Lois Lane or Lex Luthor. I've always found (certain interpretations/portrayals of) Lex Luthor to be rather compelling. He'd got an iron will, he's super-intelligent, and he provides some pretty compelling points against Superman even when Superman is the big blue boy scout who never does anything wrong. So his thing would be about first discovering that Superman has a secret identity, and then trying to find some way to either kill or control him. I don't know, might be the next thing that I work on.
