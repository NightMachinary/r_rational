/Alternately/, the tale of Romeo and Juliet becomes a story about two houses who are locked into a feud over something less trivial. The Montagues are deontologists, while the Capulets are consequentialists (or something). This would be a lot better if you had two philosophies which are more or less incompatible, with Romeo and Juliet forging a third way together which synthesizes the two.
