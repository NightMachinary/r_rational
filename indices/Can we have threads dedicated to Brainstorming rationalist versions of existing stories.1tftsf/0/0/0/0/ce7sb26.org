That's why I proposed moving the feud and its closure into the foreground. For all that the relationship is the point, it doesn't provide enough conflict to drive the story. But as the heroic couple manipulates matters to stop the killing, with both sets of parents as antagonists and no one to trust but eachother, there should be some excitement.

Because healthy couples /don't/ spend all their time staring into eachothers' eyes and feeling love. They go out into the world and make a difference. Much as HJPEV doesn't sit around just thinking.
