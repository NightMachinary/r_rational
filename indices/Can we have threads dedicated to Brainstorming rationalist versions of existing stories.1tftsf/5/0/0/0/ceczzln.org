I can't now find the article I was thinking of, but half an hour on the [[http://directory.eliterature.org/works][Electronic Literature Directory]] or the [[http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Fiction.html][Eastgate catalog]] should provide you enough data to see for yourself what I'm talking about.

Briefly, the main "hypertext fiction" community is closely tied to liberal arts academia, and inherits the toxic culture thereof. There's a heavy focus on formal experiments of the sort that one can write about in a thesis, rather than on making use of the medium to say something that needs saying.
