Deus Ex (the video game, the original not sequels).

It had a pretty cool story complete with conspiracies and ethical dilemmas, but the story was obviously second fiddle to the magnificent gameplay.

Bonus points if you can make the rationalfic have multiple plot paths like the game. Maybe as [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_fiction][hypertext lit]]? Hyperlit is /very/ Deus Ex.
