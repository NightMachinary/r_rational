  Assassin's Creed done with a whole lot more idealism, as a way of teaching meta-ethics. Just to make it ambiguous who "deserves to win", the Templars are attempting a Phlebotinum Singularity using Bostrom's idea of a Singleton (ie: have only one decision-maker in control to prevent existentially-risky wars), while the Assassins show a better understanding of real human values but favor a more anarchist politics (needless to say, they refuse to use the Pieces of Eden on people and treat them as highly dangerous) even if this means violence is more common. This gets back to the conflict from the first game about how one defines ideals like "peace" or "freedom" in a complex world of multiple, conflicting ideologies.

So you basically ignore all the future-Desmond stuff, except for the first game.

I highly approve of this.
