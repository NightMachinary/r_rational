I [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][already tried my hand at Terminator]], though there are a lot of holes that need plugging to make the Terminator canon actually work. If you've got a time machine ... well, you wouldn't use it to go back in time and kill someone's mother unless you were a somewhat autistic AI.

I'm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Day-That-Santa-Stole-Christmas][trying to write the rational version of Santa Claus]] in time for Christmas, since there's a lot of lore there that doesn't make all that much sense. Santa's got panopticon surveillance of all the world's children (at the very least), the industrial capacity to dwarf the smaller nations, and the ability to reach every house in a single day. /And he uses this to distribute presents./ I've got two more chapters written, but I'm sort of stuck wondering what the central conflict really is - right now, I'm thinking institutional inertia from the elves, but I'm not sure that can be concluded in a satisfactory manner.

But yes, in general I support the idea of threads dedicated to "What would a more rational version of X look like?". If you start posting them, I'll start commenting on them.
