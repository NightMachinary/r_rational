A single chapter from the yeerk viewpoint as they simply /crush/ the animorphs would probably be more realistic. In the series the yeerks were downright incompetent.

Like... why are the yeerks focused on a single town? Six guerrilla fighters ruining your small-scale invasion? You have the resources to run more than one small-scale invasion concurrently.

Or why are they so bad at security? No ability to seal the exits? No guards at entrances? No snipers? No video recording? No identification? No passwords? No strict scheduling? No two hour waiting periods in isolation?

Plus they suck at actually invading. Why not infest /the rest/ of familes ("I think we should eat at McDonalds...")? Why not take over a hotel and then waltz into rooms every night and infest the guests (to be fair, they did take over a hospital but /only one/)? What about the bathrooms at conventions? At the theme park? Airports?

I really like the books, but I try not to think about how little the enemy is trying when I read them.
