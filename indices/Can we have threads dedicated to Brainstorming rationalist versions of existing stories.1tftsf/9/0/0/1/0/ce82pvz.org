I'm not sure how I feel about the Patronus 2.0. When I first read it, it was a Crowning Moment of Awesome. When I found out Harry was going to obsess over defeating Death, I was kinda disappointed, because that's not how Death works in the real world anyway. I also felt that Rowling's original idea of Dementors equaling clinical depression was being thrown aside.

When I found out Yudkowsky is preachy about his transhumanism, the scene started to make me /deeply/ uncomfortable. In fact, transhumanism in general, taken as an ideology rather than an idea, scares me a good bit: Yudkowsky and his Extropians are some of the best of the bunch, but the general majority of transhumanists often come off like really creepy, greedy, domineering people.
