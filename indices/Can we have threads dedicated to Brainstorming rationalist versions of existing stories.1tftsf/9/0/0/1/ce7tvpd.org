I can't speak for what previous versions of the story or chapters said, but currently chapter 7 doesn't come off as soapboxy at all. This goes to the general misuse of what "soapboxing" even means... it's not "has an opinion on something and goes into detail as to why." It's also not just a matter of disagreement on some moral issue (meaning, if you think it's judgmental to call a society where an elite nobility feels entitled to get away with whatever they do to lower classes "backwards," calling someone making such a judgement out for "soapboxing" is equally incorrect).

  The other large part is the Patronus v2.0, which works much better than the original version because the main character believes and is apparently correct about something that the author thinks is true.

Right, and because the topic at hand is "magic," it seems really odd to me that people bring this up. By definition, any rule of magic works in a story because the author ultimately decides that's how it will work. It's not like the belief contradicts anything else in the HP world, and it's internally consistent. So what's the issue?

JK Rowling wrote in a spell that worked based on the Power of Love to shield someone from an "unblockable curse," and the implications of that were never even mentioned again. Compared to that, Patronus 2.0 is probably the most rational form of magic in the series.

  I think the big reason that people don't want to classify HPMOR as an author tract is the negative connotations of that label... It's not a negative thing to have a work of fiction that quite explicitly expresses the author's viewpoints in great detail, but it's poorly done most of the time.

Which is why I distinguished making a story to push an idea vs using a story as a medium for communicating ideas. HPMOR is the latter, and regardless of connotations, referring to HPMOR as an Author Tract fails to distinguish it from the former. Which means now we need a new word for those type of stories, which seems silly and unnecessary to me, when we could instead just recognize their differences and stop calling it that.

Edit:

As a counterexample of "true soapboxing," there is a scene in one of the last Sword of Truth novels where a teenage girl, having just turned a magic trap around on her would-be-killer, then proceeds to lecture them for two pages about the nature of evil and good, the differences between them, and basically an all-around reiteration of the author's beliefs on the topic, while the villain is slowly crushed to death. Keep in mind that none of this was new at this point: he'd been doing similar things for at least half a dozen books now. But apparently he felt the need to put yet another monologue into yet another action packed scene and turn yet another of his characters into a mouthpiece for his ideals, thus extinguishing their individuality from the other protagonists, who by this point had virtually all already joined the hive-mind.

The context is the most damning aspect: behind enemy lines, just barely having escaped from death, it takes an Author Tract of truly onerous proportions to have a character decide this was a good time to give such a lecture... to someone who's about to die anyway, no less.
