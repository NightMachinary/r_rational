I've had a vague idea for a *Rationalist [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers][Starship Troopers]]* fic, not strictly contradicting canon but working on the premise that the narrator of the original has a very limited perspective, so explaining the background of the story universe in more hard sciencey detail.

One element would be a more complex understanding of the arachnid enemies, who in the original book are a human level technological society. My idea being that they are hyper specialised but still human level intelligence, think a whole breed of savants in a particular field, but with virtually no ability to change skills.

I would then contrast with the human society, and try to give a more realistic account of how a society where citizenship is dependent on military service would work. There may also be opportunities for game theory style discussion of how the relationships between the different species work.

Only problem is I have a lot of background info dump material but not really a plot in mind... Vague idea is to have viewpoint character as a science officer on one of the military ships, who is the only one remotely qualified in the area so has to deal with everything from stellar formation to novel viruses on the ship.
