Anybody feel up to attempting a rational Romeo and Juliet?

It kind of inverts the original story, but I think the result should be a workable story in its own right, especially since the original tends to get read backwards. Instead of a couple who do everything wrong ultimately leading to both their deathes with a feud as backdrop, it could be a couple who work together to end a feud with a really healthy relationship as backdrop.

The title couple should show off things like clear communication, frontal override without sacrificing enjoyment, outside view, trust, concern for eachother's happiness... basically all the elements of a really healthy relationship. The idea would be to teach readers how to love the same way HPMoR teaches them to think. Because it isn't obvious, and the selection of fictional role models is terrible.

Bonus points if you can write it in iambic pentameter without getting in the way of the story.
