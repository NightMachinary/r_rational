  The title couple should show off things like clear communication, frontal override without sacrificing enjoyment, outside view, trust, concern for eachother's happiness... basically all the elements of a really healthy relationship. The idea would be to teach readers how to love the same way HPMoR teaches them to think. Because it isn't obvious, and the selection of fictional role models is terrible.

Source: my relationship has survived this long due to both of us occasionally managing to get this stuff right, when so many of our friends have been through tragic, pointless relationship conflicts, sometimes from relationships we knew were going to suck in the first place.
