Author-tract seems to me in danger of becoming the new "Mary Sue," meaning a real negative trope that loses its meaning by overdiagnosis.

I'm aware that Yudkowsky calls his own story an Author Tract, but that doesn't mean he's right to do so. When I think of Author Tract, I think of books like The Elementary Particles, or authors like Ayn Rand and Terry Goodkind. Not HPMOR.

There's a clear distinction between ideas that people fashion a story around and stories that people put their ideas into. HPMOR is the latter, and thus while it at times clearly reflects the values of its author, it doesn't sacrifice the story for them.

At the end of the day, anvilicious writing is to some degree relative. But along the spectrum, it strikes me as odd that someone would desribe HPMOR as so. I've never read a single chapter in HPMOR that took me out of the story: even the most monologuey sections still fit the characters and context.

The same cannot be said for true author tract "stories." Anyone who has read The Sword of Truth can name the moments when the author clearly sacrificed his story and characters' integrity for the sake of soapboxing. Even when agreeing with that particular soapbox, it's annoying and obvious author-tracting.

I'd honestly like to know at what points Yudkowsky has done the same.
