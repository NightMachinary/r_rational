I 100% definitely agree with the Patronus v2.0

It just a very very silly thing. And the idea that he can cancel all other patronuses just by saying a few words is perhaps even worse. Because it implies that people actually think seriously and comprehend all of the input really needed before their patronus breaks even though from their entire life they have been casting patronus in the exact same way that it would be ritual rote.
