Chapter 7 was the first time that I thought the story was suffering for its soapboxing. That's the chapter where Draco says he's going to rape Luna, and Harry gives a big speech about how backwards their society is. It's since been rewritten a few times, and I still feel that way on rereading.

The other large part is the Patronus v2.0, which works much better than the original version /because the main character believes and is apparently correct about something that the author thinks is true/.

I think the big reason that people don't want to classify HPMOR as an author tract is the negative connotations of that label. The label has negative connotations because so often it's done poorly, and this is basically the argument that Yudkowsky makes when he says that HPMOR is an author tract. It's not a negative thing to have a work of fiction that quite explicitly expresses the author's viewpoints in great detail, but it's poorly done most of the time.
