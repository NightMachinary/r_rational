I understand the impulse to read into a story based on knowledge of the author, but I try to discourage people from doing that with novels whenever possible. ("Literature professors hate him!")

Barring revolutions in medicine or computers, ultimately the author will one day be dead and gone, and their work is what will remain. The story should be taken on its own merits: authors are entitled to speak about what's important to them, but we should only judge them for doing so when they sacrifice the story to do so, and I don't believe Yudkowsky has so far.

As for the Dementors, I feel like it's an acceptable shift, especially the way it was framed: creatures that suck out the hope of everyone around them and instill despair can do so for a variety of reasons, and when trying to rationalize them it seems to me you have two options:

1) Make them the avatars of "Despair," which is rather silly if you understand what depression is from a biochemical standpoint (Do they just go around in a magic field that zaps serotonin/dopamine?)

Or

2) Make them the avatars of a concept that in itself naturally evokes depression.

And "Death" serves pretty nicely as a universally hard-wired cause of despair and fear. Fits the animal theme of the Patronus fantastically too: animals certainly can get depressed, but fear of Death is a human thing.
