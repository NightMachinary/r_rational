I don't think we can. It doesn't really fix/rationalize things about Harry Potter; it's more often just an Author Tract for Yudkowsky's views on rationality.

It is one of the premier examples, but we shouldn't promote a /deliberate/ Author Tract (as in, he has /come out and said/ it's an Author Tract) to gold-standard status.
