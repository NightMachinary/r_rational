I would love to see a "rationalist" rendition of Star Wars: What does it mean to use The Force, why does the Emperor want to control everything, how does the Rebellion actually function, what would Stormtroopers look like if they weren't plot-terrible, etc.

I'd personally love to see it from the perspective of Leia, with Luke nearly out of the picture, and watch her grow from the freedom fighter politician into an empire-conquering rationalist who remakes the galaxy into a better place.
