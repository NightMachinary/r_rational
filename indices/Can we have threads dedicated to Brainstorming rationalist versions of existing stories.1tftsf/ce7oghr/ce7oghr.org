  We need stories that go to the logical extremes and don't stop. The stories where the hero takes the logic of the world, whatever it is, and makes it work for them, and achieves as much as possible, never mind the challenge or even merely reaching their original goal.

You appear to be describing stories that engage in Serial Escalation or try to go Beyond The Impossible. I SUPPORT THIS VERY MUCH AND SUGGEST VIEWING LOTS OF GAINAX OR TRIGGER ANIME AS PREPARATION.

Now, as to desired rationalfics:

- /Assassin's Creed/ done with a whole lot more idealism, as a way of teaching meta-ethics. Just to make it ambiguous who "deserves to win", the Templars are attempting a Phlebotinum Singularity using Bostrom's idea of a Singleton (ie: have only one decision-maker in control to prevent existentially-risky wars), while the Assassins show a better understanding of real human values but favor a more anarchist politics (needless to say, they refuse to use the Pieces of Eden on people and treat them as /highly dangerous/) even if this means violence is more common. This gets back to the conflict from the first game about how one defines ideals like "peace" or "freedom" in a complex world of multiple, conflicting ideologies.

- Tengen Toppa Gurren Rationality. Absolutely nothing is changed from the original, since the characters' hotbloodedness really is the best way to use Spiral Power. Tutorial in so-called Fun Theory. In fact, just go watch all of the following to learn about Fun: FLCL, Evangelion, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Little Witch Academia, Kill la Kill.

- Rational /Attack on Titan/. Instead of being a tutorial in blindly aggressive fascism, the story focuses on Armin and Mikasa more, and steadily becomes a portrait of what it actually means to live in a world constantly on the brink of existential risk. Hopefully someone manages to cover the "life worth living" point that x-risk guys sometimes miss.
