Oh, and /while I'm at it/, someone really needs to do a rationalist-focused deconstruction of /Dune/.

Basically, it's an entire series starring almost nothing but transhumans who all behave as what are, by our moral standards, /incredibly, massively backwards psychopaths/. The bizarre thing being that they are explicitly stated to have physical, mental, and even /spiritual/ capacities well above us, and are even (again, /explicitly/, in-universe) noted to have avoided domination by UFAI (by banning computers and replacing them with advanced mental powers in humans). At least in my eyes they should have "gone transhuman" and Lived Happily Ever After a long fucking time ago. Instead, they spend their time backstabbing the fuck out of each other and instituting feudal regimes we moderns would consider cripplingly, idiotically reactionary and backwards.

It's like a whole series spent portraying, in the /coolest/ way possible, the near-terminal moral failure of a universe-wide human civilization.
