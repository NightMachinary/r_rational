  And humanlike transhumans, etc.

Well /that/ was deliberate. Their two universal religious taboos are: never make a mutant/transhuman that's completely divergent and biologically separate from the human species, in the sense of being unable to breed with a human, and, never make a machine that can think. (And on the other hand, if the transhumans are made in lines with what humans want, won't they be /mostly/ human by default? Humans don't, by default, come up with Completely Alien Person Designs.)

I choose to accept that much of their backwardness is because they threw away technology after the Butlerian Jihad, which I now /choose to interpret/ as a full-scale interplanetary/interstellar war against a full-scale UFAI. Nuclear weapons may have been used to the point of destroying whole planets and stars.

Basically, they're trying to avoid UFAI and Unfriendly Transhumans as much as possible. This results in human civilization stagnating like hell.

Material resources being limited? Strangely enough, for such a backwards civilization they're generally portrayed as quite wealthy, by our standards. Even the Fremen sietches have full-scale industrial factories capable of processing plastics. If their equivalent of a /Bedouin tent village/ has plastics-processing factories, they're actually pretty rich.
