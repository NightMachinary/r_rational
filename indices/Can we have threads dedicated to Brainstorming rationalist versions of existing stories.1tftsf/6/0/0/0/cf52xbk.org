I put it to you that Clippy the paperclip maximiser is more comprehensible to a human mind than either of the God Emperors of Dune, what with causality - defying powers and similarly post human mental capacity. Basically, incremental change and selection effects give you "Completely Alien Persons (who are biologically human + spice)" over ten millennia.

Nuclear weapons can certainly glass surfaces, but to destroy a planet, a star, or (worse) a fully powered interstellar UFAI... You'd need something a lot stronger.

As to plastics... The reprap project is almost there, and will certainly be within a generation. I don't think anyone has done quality work on the implications of replication - capable home manufacturing infrastructure. There's an inflection where the industrial base required to support a given level of sophistication stops expanding, and instead rapidly shrinks!
