  I'm not so sure that's true any more.

Every one of those flaws except for one were guilty of active participation in a plot to murder 1000 allies, and set as many demons on a city. (Not to mention servants of someone who set a /corruption/ demon on a captured city for political reasons alone.) It may be monstrous, but it doesn't make you a monster, not when the only other options are worse.

The only compromise that I see as truly monstrous, rather than just brutality of necessity, is the support of Heiress, and I can't blame her too much for that. She has her own plots at hand, to mitigate the damage, and it really could have been /do that or die/.

Well, and letting the Heroic equivalent of Heiress go on the day she became squire, rather than slitting his throat and mutilating the corpse, but that didn't seem quite as evil at the time... Which really isn't saying much.

  But he's also one that is quite possibly corrupted by the very same demon whose banner her now gets to take into his possession.

I never believed that, I assumed the delay was, quite simply, from the fact that when your child has grown up with your devil lover, it's a little harder to check for a demonic corruption.
