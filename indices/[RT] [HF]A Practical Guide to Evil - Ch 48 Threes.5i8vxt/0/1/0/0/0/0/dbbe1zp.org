Exactly. She hasn't become a different beast, she's just discovered mercy doesn't pay. She's discovered that heiress isn't going to hold back just because she's holding back, and so she stopped holding back. No mercy, no sparing individuals, just... winning, without holding back.

But what she does to heiress isn't inherently who she is. It's a turn towards the monstrous, but it's not the entire path. And she was always a monster, deep inside. Just like William was. Just like every named we've met, with the possible exception of Conjurer and Thief.
