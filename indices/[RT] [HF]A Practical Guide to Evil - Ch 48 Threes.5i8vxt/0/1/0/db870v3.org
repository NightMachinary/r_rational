  It may be monstrous, but it doesn't make you a monster, not when the only other options are worse.

How many monstrous acts must be committed before we decide the person is a monster?

My thinking is that Catherine did not need to break every bone possible in Akua's body. Akua has been trained to withstand torture; obviously she doesn't enjoy it, but it's not going to make her see the error of her ways or intimidate her into submission. Catherine's goal was not just to sideline Heiress for a matter of weeks while she recovered, but to exact revenge upon her as brutally as possible.

So it seems to me that that brutality did not serve a purpose; honestly, Catherine revealing the murder of her follower to Heiress was probably much more hurtful than broken bones. Catherine's physical assault of Heiress came across not as necessary, but as Catherine finally having a chance to unleash her anger at her foe when she was unable to defend herself or resist. That Heiress is also a monster doesn't excuse Catherine sinking to that level.

That was my take on it, at least. And really, there is an argument to be made that the brutal assault of a defenseless foe in front of a group of soldiers who were to be murdered DID serve a purpose. I doubt any of the Gallowborne felt anything but justification as they watched Heiress being beaten and broken. And it probably reinforced their loyalty to their commander. But justification is not justice, and assaulting with a defenseless prisoner is something a monster does.

  I never believed that, I assumed the delay was, quite simply, from the fact that when your child has grown up with your devil lover, it's a little harder to check for a demonic corruption.

If Catherine herself had never remarked on (as she has, several times), I would be inclined to agree. The fact that it has come up more than once in the story though makes me think that it's foreshadowing, a la Chekhov's gun. We'll see!
