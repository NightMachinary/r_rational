  Catherine just finished a ritual where the Angels agreed that she should be the ruler of Callow. Now, who would be a good person to inherit the country if the ruler is, say, removed from power? A governor might be a key choice as an Heiress...

I believe that Catherine rejected the offer of becoming Queen of Callow. It wasn't the angels "agreeing" that she should rule Callow, but a trap to get her to trade the name of Squire for a heroic Name. Had she accepted, I think she would have become an agent of contrition like William was. Since Catherine rejected the offer, I don't think it's possible for Heiress to inherit the position from her.
