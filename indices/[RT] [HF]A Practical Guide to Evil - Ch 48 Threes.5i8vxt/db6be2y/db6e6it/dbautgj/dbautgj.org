William won his third battle as he was "fated" to do so. As he didn't press his advantage in disposing of her soul. And this allowed her a chance to begin a new pattern. One in which she didn't leave him half dead to begin a new instance of the rule of three. One in which a "rule of 1" left him dead and disposed of.

Heiress is a little less cut and dry to me. It can be argued Akua "won" their second engagement in the imperial court/mock battles. As neither side suffered major setbacks and Catherine used the opportunity to profit from the interaction (alliance with Jupiter) i can it being cosmically declared as a draw. But possibly a win for Akua for bring it to occcur in the first place.

The situation on the Blessed Isle is a win for Catherine in my eyes

Matchford was a win for heiress due to men and aspect loss on Catherine's

And latest engagement Catherine was ultimately forced onto a "even" 3/3 trade with Akua. So draw, or possible win due to return of aspect.
