My feeling is it probably is, but the problem with heiress is... /just when I think she's been crushed/, she comes back and does something to hurt Catherine just as bad. So I'm falling into paranoia, because everything is going too well, and the /uncivil wars/ don't really feel like they should have /started/ yet.

Anything that would really earn that name is probably up ahead, and it's not pretty, whatever it is.
