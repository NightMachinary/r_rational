Hot damn! An excellent chapter; one that delivered an uncomfortable combination of long-awaited justice and stomach-churning cruelty.

And as always, I feel like Catherine has probably overlooked something and am waiting for the other shoe to drop. She herself said she was waiting for Creation to retaliate against her and I feel the same. Some things that drew my attention:

  “You'll surrender the standard controlling your demon to Apprentice before a bell has passed.”
#+end_quote

Granted, Apprentice is the most knowledgeable mage in Catherine's camp. But he's also one that is quite possibly corrupted by the very same demon whose banner her now gets to take into his possession. This seems like it was not a great idea on Catherine's part until she's SURE that he is not corrupted. Warlock's OK on the matter was suspect, to say the least.

I am skeptical about Masego's intercession on Fasili's behalf for the exact same reason.

  “After the war, I will petition to be granted governorship of Liesse,” she said. “You will support this petition in court.”
#+end_quote

Heiress is a Name; she is now going to become a governor of a part of Callow. Catherine just finished a ritual where the Angels agreed that she should be the ruler of Callow. Now, who would be a good person to inherit the country if the ruler is, say, removed from power? A governor might be a key choice as an Heiress...

  Apprentice could, say, rot off your eyes. He did it to the Bumbling Conjurer's face in Summerholm. Nasty as all Hells to look at, let me tell you.
#+end_quote

Maybe I am missing something, but why wouldn't Catherine do exactly this to Heiress?? She had no problem methodically breaking many of the bones in her body; why not pursue some eye melting too?

#+begin_quote
  Another round of threats was exchanged, but with Aisha whispering more diplomacy in my ear I eventually got what I wanted. Oaths were given on both sides, the exact wording already prepared by Masego.
#+end_quote

Well, this sparks my curiosity...

#+begin_quote
  I'm not a monster, Akua.
#+end_quote

I'm not so sure that's true any more. Black has no problem accepting that he is a monster. But Catherine seems to deny that she has become one. Despite her talk about refusing to betray her friends and soldiers, I think she still see herself as doing good. That's not the same as being Good, but it feels like a self-deception - one that could be exploited eventually and may prompt her to abandon Evil (and thus her soldiers). A person who methodically tortures someone, rips out souls, and gives control of a city of her countrymen over to an extremely evil creature like Heiress is exactly the kind of person I'd describe as a monster.
