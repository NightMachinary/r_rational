  My thinking is that Catherine did not need to break every bone possible in Akua's body. Akua has been trained to withstand torture; obviously she doesn't enjoy it, but it's not going to make her see the error of her ways or intimidate her into submission. Catherine's goal was not just to sideline Heiress for a matter of weeks while she recovered, but to exact revenge upon her as brutally as possible.

Now, see, I see that, but it also inflicts costs. Both priests, and mages can heal broken bones, and each bone broken is a little more time out of combat functionality, even if Heiress can afford to mend them. If she only broke, say, heiress' limbs, that might be fixable in a minute amount of time.

I didn't see any /unnecessary/ brutality involved in breaking each and every bone in her body, and that felt potentially worth doing. Paranoid precautions that may come off as needlessly cruel, but I can see them as precautions. Each bone broken is a little less likely that a mage can fix her up in advance of the deadline, after all. I know bones can be fixed, but each one broken leaves her a little less able to get back in the fight sooner, and/or leaves her in worse shape when she's able to re-enter the fight.

The cruelty to Heiress' minions... actually was monstrous, I suppose. It's easy to fall into the trap of seeing minions as an extension of that person, and it's a dangerous trap to fall into. I can't begrudge their deaths to Catherine, but it is something I wouldn't be comfortable with from an actual hero.

  How many monstrous acts must be committed before we decide the person is a monster?

For me, the answer to that is "Does it protect anyone?" and "Do they actually deserve that?". So brutally breaking every bone of, say, Juniper in book one would be obviously monstrous, but breaking heiress' minion's hand in book one offended me more than this entire fiasco.

She's always been a monster, and I don't really see her as having gotten much worse, here. It's escalation of scale, not type, and it's not a problematic escalation, even. She's realized Heiress will keep escalating until she wins, and showing mercy just leaves Heiress in better shape for the next battle.

She held back because she didn't get this before, but her options are to lose, or to match, or to die. It's when she's needlessly brutal that'll really scare me.

  If Catherine herself had never remarked on (as she has, several times), I would be inclined to agree.

I only saw the one piece of evidence? Where did you see others, if it's not rude to ask?
