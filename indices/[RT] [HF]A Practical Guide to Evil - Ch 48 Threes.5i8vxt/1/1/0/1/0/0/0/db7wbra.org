My point exactly. For anything else, such weak foreshadowing would be a clue that it's probably not going to bite our protagonists soon, but for an absence demon... no such luck. Perfect paranoia fuel, of course.

On the other hand, it would also be fitting for the demon to have been killed and there just be an absence of information on its demise.

On the bright side, if heiress lets it out, there's a 50-50 chance that'll be the point where she goes the path of the lone swordsman. Three attempted atrocities, and then she dies.
