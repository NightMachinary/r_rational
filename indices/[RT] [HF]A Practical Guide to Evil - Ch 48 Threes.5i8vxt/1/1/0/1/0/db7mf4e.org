The question is whether the pattern has anything to do with it, or if that's something that no longer seriously threatens Catherine. There's so many different routes problems could come from. Apprentice probably wasn't corrupted by the demon, and I suspect that his devil father isn't any more of a problem, but... he still might be tempted to dabble in things he shouldn't- such as attempting to kill it.

I wouldn't be surprised if heiress has the other half of the set of missing demons, too. I really hope she doesn't, and I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out she doesn't, but the fact that the Absence demon was mentioned as missing is worrying, no matter how ironic it was.
