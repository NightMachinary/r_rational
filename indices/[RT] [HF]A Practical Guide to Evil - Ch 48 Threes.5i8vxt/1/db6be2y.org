So the pattern of three must have broken when the name Squire was taken from Catherine- or later, when Squire was led to her death at the hands of an Nameless individual due to Heiress' machinations.

Or something's going to turn up from Akua's plots to ruin Catherine's day as badly as Akua's has been.

Maybe I'm giving too much credibility to the patterns, though. It's easy to believe in rules like that, but the harder you try to abuse something as faint as "victory, draw, defeat", the easier it is to break it.

Actually, can anyone else model their approximation of the pattern's points as of this point?
