location data =/= easy to hit, after all being a tether, it's a thing and long target to hit with good accuracy. Granted either end are perfectly valid targets, but if it can reel in, then it can jink at will and basically without fuel costs, making it hard to hit either end without larger fuel costs to course correct against an evading target, and overall hitting the tether itself would likely be impractically difficult.
