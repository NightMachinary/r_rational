Depends how far back they go. If it's only a few minutes, absolutely. If the fugitive goes back before their own conception to a timeline where they'll never be born, then it's impossible. Timecops can only come from the direct future, so they'll only show up if a crime is going to be committed.

So I suppose that they'd go for preventing crimes before they occur. If you've gotten as far as actually committing a crime, you know you'll almost certainly get away with it.
