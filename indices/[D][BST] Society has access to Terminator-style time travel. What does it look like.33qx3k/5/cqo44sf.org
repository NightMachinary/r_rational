I don't think I'd call the result a "civilisation". The amount of communication between timelines is effectively zero. Time-travellers can only come from the current future, which changes as soon as it arrives. As soon as you arrive somewhere, from your point of view the future that spawns you has ceased to exist. All you have of it - all you'll ever have - is what you're carrying on you.

When you arrive somewhere, the government will have no record of you (though it may know of your past self, who is a different person). Any identity papers you carry are easily-forged, since there's no way to corroborate them. Any debts you owe or crimes you've committed are instantly and completely forgotten. And of course, your friends and family in the future no longer exist.

This is obviously true if only criminals have time machines, but giving them to the police doesn't really help. If a fugitive jumps back in time, he's gone. Even if you follow him, you'll never end up in the same timeline as him. Of course, you can instead go back a few minutes and stop him from entering the time machine, but anyone who makes it to the portal has escaped from everyone forever.

And when he arrives carrying a small fortune in stolen goods, the time traveller is free to tell everyone a lovely story about a utopian future where diamonds are common as muck and the streets are paved with gold. Even if someone thinks he's lying, there's nothing that can be done to find out what his future was really like.
