  I don't think I'd call the result a "civilisation". The amount of communication between timelines is effectively zero. Time-travellers can only come from the current future, which changes as soon as it arrives. As soon as you arrive somewhere, from your point of view the future that spawns you has ceased to exist. All you have of it - all you'll ever have - is what you're carrying on you.

Okay, so let's say that you're the President of the United States. Someone invents time travel and posts the instructions online. The materials are cheap, so you can't constrain the materials, and it doesn't take a huge amount of knowledge to make one - anyone could do it in their garage.

Seconds after you get this urgent briefing, you get the alert that a laptop addressed to you just arrived from out of thin air in a secure location. It takes some investigation, but eventually security declares it safe to open (not by you, obviously) and your team looks inside.

It's from your future self, and details a list of policy proposals which he's enacted, and the rationale for them, along with the suggestion that you do the same. It also gives a comprehensive list of everything that happens in the future, and how to respond to it. It's not just /one/ future though, because your future self continued to get reports from /his/ future selves, and they got reports from /their/ future selves, so the list of what happens is a condensed-down-for-easy-reading map of everything that happened in a billion different futures, through to the next ten years.

What immediate instructions does your successor give you? What is in his report of the futures?

Edit: If you need to, imagine that your future self's very first piece of information is a way for you to identify yourself to yourself, and that you receive a second message from your future self which verifies that the information in the first message is 99.9999% genuine.

Edit 2: And if you're the sort of person who would just throw up their hands and say "lol, society is fucked" or "screw you guys, I'm moving to ancient times" assume for the sake of argument that you're not.
