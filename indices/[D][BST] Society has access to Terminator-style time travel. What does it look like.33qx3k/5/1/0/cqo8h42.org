Well, I'd get a lot of data from testing out different policies in the real world. "We tried raising X tax and spending Y money, but it had the following unforeseen consequences.", that sort of thing. And I'd get some probability distributions on who my likely successor is and what the state of the world is likely to be at the end of my term.

It won't work for specifics. If there's a note saying "The Spider Clan is going to send ninjas to kidnap you at 8 am on 12/07/2045", there's no guarantee that's what will happen. The Spider Clan are probably also using time travel to refine their plans, and be using it to attempt millions of different attacks in millions of different timelines. That's only useful if the Spider Clan are already on their way and it's too late for them to change their plans. Maybe warn about that sort of thing a day ahead of time?

From the perspective of the timeline receiving the future data, what they've got is basically the output of a 100% accurate simulation of a single possible future branching out from the moment they received it. Easy to understand, though there is the question of why people send back data at all when it won't benefit them.
