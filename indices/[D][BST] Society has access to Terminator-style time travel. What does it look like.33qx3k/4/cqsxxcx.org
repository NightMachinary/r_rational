A major economic problem is going to be people taking out loans and/or committing crimes, and then escaping into another timeline to avoid the consequences. If they go back to a relatively recent period, information sharing among the timecops of different eras can shut them down after only getting away with it for one iteration. However, what about escaping deeper into the past? The timecops can't just do a routine infodump to deal with it, because there's no one on the other end to receive the information. However, the future timecops would still like to do whatever they can to hurt the escaping criminal, in order to discourage more people from doing the same thing.

So imagine you know that someone has jumped from your timeline to whatever period in the past. How do you get to them? You'd want to send something back in time to before they were scheduled to arrive, which would not effect history in any way unless it detected the arrival of that time traveler, to ensure they end up existing at all in the new timeline. If the time traveler does show up, whatever you send back needs to deliver whatever punishment is deemed appropriate. Thus, if you try to escape into the past, you can never be sure you're not on a later iteration, and thus there's a terminator or whatever already waiting for you back then.

On a similar note: how about the possibility of building a base in the deep past. Let's say in order to avoid disrupting things on Earth, you build a facility on the far side of the moon 1 billion years ago. By traveling back and forth between your home base and the human era, you can simulate a much more effective variety of time travel. Go through however many versions of human history you want, and then when you're done return to your home in the deep past moments after you left.
