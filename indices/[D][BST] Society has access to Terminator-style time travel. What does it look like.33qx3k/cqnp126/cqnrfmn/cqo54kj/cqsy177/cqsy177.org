Except that there's the potential for a terrifying level of panopticon surveillance in a world like this, since anything that the state ever manages to figure out, it can send back to earlier versions of itself. It will occur to you to build an illegal time machine, and then the police officer who's already waiting outside your door will knock and prevent that chain of events. Some timelines / individuals will get around it, but they'll get most of the versions of you that try something.
