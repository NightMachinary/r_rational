Some griefer destroys humanity. No more society.

Assuming Castle Solutions solves this problem well enough to stay in business and people can't go back personally:

- Someone will kill Hitler within the first day. Locate, send back a time bomb, done. Antisemitism in the 50s and subsequent few decades is heightened compared to today without a giant pogrom.
- Someone will start ferrying technology and geologic resource maps back in time. People develop Windows language packs for Egyptian, Luwian, and Phoenician.
- Since we don't have a written language available for the Americas or Australia in antiquity, they'll get shafted again. Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China will win out technologically. Early Celtic tribes in the British Isles will get peppered with technological artifacts that have operating instructions written only in modern English thanks to stupid people.
- Someone will develop an autonomous recording drone that stores its data durably for future generations. History as a discipline explodes, insofar as it is still possible with what's happening to the timeline.
- People quickly realize that sending objects backwards tends to overwrite history, resulting in a much different set of people existing. At that point, they will lobby for Castle Solutions to restrict its maximum displacement in time to, say, ten years. Possibly with some exceptions for non-intrusive scientific research.
- Even so, you get any technology advances that you can develop within ten years. But you have to retrieve ten years' advances, understand them, and then develop the next advance, all within ten years. (If Castle Solutions is above the law, this restriction doesn't apply.)
- You can use time travel to duplicate items. Need a second Hope Diamond? Have Castle ship it to you yesterday. Unless you've received one from them, in which case you go about your business. This reduces scarcity for physical items -- at least for compact, high-value items. The diamond industry crashes. Peer-to-peer electronics sharing becomes widespread.
- Homework becomes useless. People do it whenever, possibly years after it's due, and send it back in time to themselves. Then they submit the assignment without having done the requisite readings. In-class assignments and tests take over.
- A new intelligence technique emerges: kidnap a suspect (possibly in broad daylight), torture them into confessing, and send the report back in time. It doesn't work terribly well, but the intelligence community is (privately) enthusiastic about the idea.
- Recalls (for drugs, toys, cars, etc) become retroactive; a company gets a message from itself, possibly countersigned by a government authority, saying that it can't release the product.
- When a serious communicable disease first occurs, we trace it to its origin and prevent it from happening.
- Stock markets need to be heavily altered.
- Put your foot in your mouth at the party? Send yourself a reminder to be more careful.

Just to start, imagine how the world would look three thousand years from now. Turn that into today. Double it. That's your background. Ongoing object-only time travel doesn't have a hugely noticeable impact on most people's daily lives. It does have a huge impact, but it's not one that people will think about that often. When they do, it will be somewhere between helpful and burdensome, depending on the situation, but it will be intended to make their life better.

As for your story, that seems about right. But it was kind of stupid of the murderer to send the body to that place and time. Had he sent it to the heart of the Yellowstone supervolcano, or the heart of a wildfire, or a hundred years further back in time, he might have gotten away with it.
