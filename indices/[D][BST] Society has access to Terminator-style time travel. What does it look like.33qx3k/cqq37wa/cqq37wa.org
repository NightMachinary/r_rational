The outcome depends on how the time machine redistributes anthropic weight (how much each resulting timeline is weighted in our utility function).

Option 1: Each timeline is weighted equally (then multiplied by its many-worlds probability). Having a time machine activated effectively doubles the anthropic weight of the timelines that have that machine in its causal past.

The universe falls into a malthusian trap. I would be very surprised if no student on Earth had ever fed 100 MB of random numbers into a file, renamed it dundundun.exe and ran it. (In fact, I'd place more than 5% on one of the readers having done something of the sort.) In 2^{-100000000} of that timeline's future, the resulting program was a UFAI that got its physics model exactly right and its anthropic weighting module as this scenario describes. It then, of course, proceeded to employ the fastest possible way of exponential replication of its timeline and took over pretty much all of the universes weight (as modelled by it, and us) in about 100002000 steps. (If its utility function happens to include something else it wants in its universes besides fastest possible replication, another UFAI overtakes it.)

Option 2: Timelines are weighted according to their many-worlds probability multiplied by 2^{-amount of time machine activations in their causal past}. Having a time machine activated conserves anthropic weight.

Anyone who wants their causal future to be made of 50% modified past + 50% unmodified present more than the 100% modified present it would get without the time machine, will want to increase the modified past's weight further and will thus repeatedly activate it in the same way, resulting in effectively option 3.

Option 3: Activating a time machine deletes the universe and replaces it with the time machine's target universe, save the transported material.

This one is interesting. A culture that finds the universe's laws working as described here and has its ethicists think this scenario to be true (but cannot build a time machine due to missing unobtainium) finally has the one time machine that can possibly be sent to a timeline with any anthropic weight (and surely /theirs/ has some, after all they're there!) appear (and on their planet, no less! Fermi paradox decided, no aliens exist.) with a little unobtainium, and the race to their world's destruction (through sending a time-machine with possibly a few survivors) or saving (through permanent disposal of the unobtanium) begins...

(I'm pretty sure that any utility function that calculates utility from diverging (never-to-communicate) timelines other than through a linear combination (where "weight" plays a role) can be dutch-booked, but not quite sure...)
