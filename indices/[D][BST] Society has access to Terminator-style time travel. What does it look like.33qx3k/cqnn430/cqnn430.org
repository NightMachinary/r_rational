I dispute your interpretation of Terminator canon! (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Societies in this setting(s?) are under /staggering/ evolutionary pressure toward maximizing their timeline's "reproduction". Assuming a fair amount of variation, as random individuals create the first few timelines, the vast majority of creation is in the highest stable state of constant world-creation.

I'm actually not sure what that /is/. Religious/ideological/philosophical fanaticism seems like the obvious answer, but it actually seems quite hard for that sort of thing to create a Singleton. On the other hand, too much "selfish" timetravel to create a private world might not be self-perpetuating enough..

Three scenarios come to mind. One, an ever-expanding Time Empire that "invades" timelines before the invention of timetravel and conquers them with advanced future knowledge to use as a staging-ground for more "invasions". Two, a world rapidly depopulated as the poor flock to a device that can literally promise to make /anyone/ a rich man; the single timetraveller in most worlds doesn't really change the timeline much beyond living in luxury, and they eventually fall victim to the same depopulation. Three, a world where timetravel is tightly regulated/underutilized, and only used in obscure industrial applications - which of course spawn near-identical worlds, and appear to work 50% of the time for the same reason quantum stuff does (it only worked in half the timelines.)
