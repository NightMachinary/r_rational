I guess the question is what the farthest point in the future they are getting information from is. Is the present day time agency part of a universe dominating bureaucracy that extends into the far future? If not, it must have some frontier that it it's not receiving more information past. This could have to do with the organization no longer existing after that point, or something to do with how far in the cycle of iterations we are.

As for technology, what does the iterated fastest possible progression of technological expansion look like? I could imagine a deflationary effect, since if next year's gadgets will be so hugely better, why not save up and buy something then? On the other hand, this could be counteracted by the blazing fast economic expansion that would come from these sorts of productivity gains.

If we're getting 8 years of technological growth per year, productivity growth and thus economic growth will accelerate similarly. The world will be getting very rich very fast. Lots of companies popping up from nothing to gigantic overnight (only most started by time travelers).

Despite the growth it's presumably a very scary and uncertain time. It may be sort of 'so far, so good' in terms of truly scary types coming out of the future, but immigrants from the future are already taking control of more and more of the economy, and everyone has seen people leaving to move into our own past. Plus people probably won't be sure about this whole time travel based police panopticon concept that the government managed to role out a day after the invention of time travel due to aid from the future. If it's been 5 years, the few elections that have been held post-time travel must have been pretty interesting. Can you model how foresight would effect election results?
