Creative IP would move to alternate revenue streams. You don't sell the album, you sell the concert. You make pay-what-you-want downloads. You set up a Patreon. Proving that it's actually original is an issue, especially for something like a book where the author can't really give any proof of skill, but I think you'd see things like painters live-streaming their creation process. Branding would become a lot more important, since your brand would be almost the entirety of how you compete against future products.

Industrial IP would basically be worthless though. There'd be nothing to stop Samsung from reverse-engineering Apple's twentieth generation phone and then claiming the work as their own, aside from maybe some legal protections of some kind paired with proof-of-work embedded into the design (and that wouldn't work very well, since you would retroactively scrub it clean in most universes even if you were caught by your competitors in a first iteration timeline).

Prizes are a great idea to attract future travelers.

And yes, you run headlong into the singularity if you're in one of the timelines where you get lots of distant future information. I think the setting I am most interested in writing about had time travel introduced five years ago and is forty years ahead on tech (and accelerating fast, mostly held back by the complex production lines that need to be set up and the warring incentives).
