Well, irrelevant until it's your little brother, or the guy who owes you a thousand dollars, or a key member of some organization. In some ways it would be worse to know that a friend had decided to leave you forever beforehand. But I take your meaning.

As I had originally conceived the setting, it was an open question how much of history had been influenced by time travel, and this was a topic of rampant in-universe speculation. Anyone who had played the markets a little too well, anyone who won the lottery, prolific authors, recluses, all of them fell under suspicion. And then part of the joke was that the world looked a lot like ours, and while we can be sure that Warren Buffett isn't a time traveler, they would have to have some doubts.
