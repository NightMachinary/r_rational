Colonizing the past is expensive, even if the time travel is free. It means leaving behind anyone that you care about, unless you can convince them to go with them. It means losing contact with the industrial base of your present timeline, even if you think that you can rebuild and get it back. It's dangerous, because your body isn't adapted to life there, and the medicine and expertise necessary to negate those problems is expensive. It's also dangerous because of the people there (unless you're going way, way back) which means that you need defenses, which costs money.

Still, you're right that there are going to be lots of people who will want to go back in time anyway, and that there will be a depopulation effect. This means that there will be a time expedition economy for all those people who want to make a buck off those who want to go back to Edo Japan or Enlightenment-era England - period-appropriate costumes, language training, technology, etc.

While there is a depopulating effect from temporal emigration, there's a good chance that there's also a /populating/ effect from temporal /immigration/. If people want to go back to the past so that they can exploit it, why wouldn't people from the future come back to our present to exploit it?

For a long time I was trying to create a setting that incorporated all of this, and never quite got there when I was writing my NaNo 2010 novel. There were immigrants from the future living side-by-side with people preparing for expeditions to the past, and writers whose best books had already been imported from the future before they were written. But I don't think I got the full way there.
