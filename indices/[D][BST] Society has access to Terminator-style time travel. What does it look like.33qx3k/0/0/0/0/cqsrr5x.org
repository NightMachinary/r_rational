Some people would do that, certainly. It would be a balance between difficulty and rewards - wanting to be able to fit in, having maximal comfort, avoiding local authorities.

But for some other people, it would be a yearning for a bygone era - a belief that colonial America or medieval Ireland is where they belong (with a healthy amount of advantages). I imagine that a fair number of people would jump at the chance to live in some other time and place instead of the present.
