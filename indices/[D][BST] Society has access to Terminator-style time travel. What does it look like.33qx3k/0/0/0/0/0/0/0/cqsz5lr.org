Interesting to think about successful authors, and generally the intellectual property implications of all this. How to deal with intellectual property of all kinds showing up from the future? It seems absurd to have this kind of stuff do anything but go into the public domain, since no currently existing people, even those who would have eventually created it, would have any real claim to it. However, this would make such material very cheap compared to works that had to actually be written, and thus copyrighted. So you'd probably see the collapse of the whole system.

A great replacement would be to give prizes for certain accomplishments. Say you offer $10 million for whoever comes up with a certain desirable technology. If someone invents it, great, they get the money. However, it also creates an incentive for time travelers from the future to bring you the technology you want and take the free money. This would be great for directing temporal visitors to more productive ends, since they'd have an easy way that actually benefits the host society.

Of course once that sort of thing gets started, I'm not sure where it ends. In later iterations you might have crowds of time travelers banging on your door the moment you set up each prize.

Really being able to get information from the future is a kind of singularity. Once that becomes available, it's tough to explain why we wouldn't almost immediately have access to all the secrets of the universe. Maybe we're too early in the universe iteration cycle?
