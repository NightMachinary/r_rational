  Colonizing the past is expensive, even if the time travel is free. It means leaving behind anyone that you care about, unless you can convince them to go with them. It means losing contact with the industrial base of your present timeline, even if you think that you can rebuild and get it back. It's dangerous, because your body isn't adapted to life there, and the medicine and expertise necessary to negate those problems is expensive. It's also dangerous because of the people there (unless you're going way, way back) which means that you need defenses, which costs money.

Why bother doing any colonizing? If you have access to this sort of time travel technology, it seems like it would be the easiest thing in the world to just go back a decade or two, and use whatever knowledge / technology you bring with you to the live the high life. It would be easy to quietly make a lot of money from lotteries, stock predictions etc, or if you're not content to just live a quietly luxurious life, you could get to be the most important person on Earth by revealing the existence of time travel, and sharing (for a fee of course) the future knowledge you brought with you.
