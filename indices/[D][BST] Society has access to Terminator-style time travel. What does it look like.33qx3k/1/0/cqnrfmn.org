It's clear that society would put some regulations on time travel from the future, but not really clear to me what those regulations would be. There are legal problems with a person using time travel to duplicate themselves, and economic problems with duplicating materials (though there are game theory considerations there - you can send the Hope Diamond back to "yourself", but now there's one timeline where you have two Hope Diamonds and one where you have none, and Hope Diamonds have to have decreasing marginal value). There are also societal problems with people abandoning the present for the past - by, say, racking up a bunch of debt first and then leaving their debt behind.

Overwriting history isn't really a problem (for most people) since the timelines coexist (but do not interact) with each other. I'm sure there are some narcissistic people who don't want there to be a universe where they don't exist though.
