  I wouldn't create a new universe full of people just to fix a mistake I've made. I don't see a value in vastly inflating the number of people in order to increase the average living conditions.

Is there some negative value in creating a new universe full of people? I mean, if the expenditure of resources to you is essentially nothing, and you (or a version of you) gets some benefit from it, does the incidental creation of a new universe with effective duplicates of everyone represent a disincentive?

  But in the branching timelines variant, information is really the only valuable thing you can pass back, and even then it's not terribly worthwhile in many regards. You can't improve your past; all you can do is add another copy of the universe with alterations.

You can't improve your past, but you can often improve your present by being the sort of person that routinely gives aid to their past self. If you were the sole holder of the time machine, you could either be the sort of person who sends their past self a lottery ticket, and thus is likely to receive a lottery ticket from the future, /or/ you can be the sort of person who sees no benefit in helping someone who is not you, and thus never receive a lottery ticket from the future. (A world with commonplace time travel probably runs their lottery in a way that precludes this specific example from happening.)
