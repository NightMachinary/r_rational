Okay, I misunderstood. I thought you were contrasting two different styles of time travel, with the Terminator style being only one timeline existing and oddly persistent effects from time traveling entities to prevent actual paradoxes.

But in the branching timelines variant, information is really the only valuable thing you can pass back, and even then it's not terribly worthwhile in many regards. You can't improve your past; all you can do is add another copy of the universe with alterations.

I wouldn't create a new universe full of people just to fix a mistake I've made. I don't see a value in vastly inflating the number of people in order to increase the average living conditions. But I know that if I existed and someone much like me wanted to share information with me, I'd value that. So this scenario confuses me a lot.
