The thing is, that malcontent might be able to destroy the world once, but only by removing herself from a large number of other timelines, which would thus be safe. This scenario would certainly result in a huge number of timelines being created where humanity is destroyed, or never existed at all, but that would be no skin off the noses of the people living in the other huge number of timelines where that stuff didn't happen. You can't do any harm to your original timeline via time travel.
