As noted everywhere else, I'm fairly confident that this mostly ends in some form of Apocalypse. The malcontent with the most initial resources could just keep time-twinning herself and her resources until she could build a large enough nuclear weapon. Repeat.

Have you seen [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/][Transdimensional Brain Chip]]? The MC's ability to view the differing actions of his alternate selves mirrors how I think the average person might abuse such technology.

Larger scale...

There's a lot of people you'll never see again because they time-traveled in a huff over an argument they wanted to win the second time around. Or because they left to find another version of a person who left them.

Frankly, the fact that I find myself in a universe that invented time travel and *wasn't* created by someone else's time traveling is rather odd; I'd expect a lot more universe with some form of temporal meddling.
