I'm not entirely clear on how time travel works. Suppose you send Alice back one second, wait a century, and then send Bob back one second. What happens?

A) A universe is created where Alice and Bob both arrive. Bob is left very confused as to how different the universe is even though he only went back one second.

B) The universe is destroyed the moment Alice goes back. Bob never arrives.

C) Two universes are created. Alice arrives in one and Bob arrives in the other.

I think A is the most similar to the Terminator stuff. Otherwise sending a human back to protect against the Terminator that got sent back wouldn't make any sense. In this case, the second timeline will change immediately because someone decided to send something back to the Big Bang. The Earth never forms, and everyone else just arrives in space and dies.

If they're a little more sensible with the time travel equipment and don't send anything back before life evolves, then humanity doesn't evolve and it only comes to exist due to time travellers. They might still all die out no groups have a large enough gene pool. On the other hand, there's probably a lot of people who will go back to see Jesus or something, so they'll all have each other.

In general, the later time travellers will arrive in a world where their destination is not what it was the first time around.
