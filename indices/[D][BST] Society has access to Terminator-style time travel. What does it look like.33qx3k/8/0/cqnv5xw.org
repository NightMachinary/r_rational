  Otherwise sending a human back to protect against the Terminator that got sent back wouldn't make any sense.

This arguably makes /less/ sense if you model time travel in Terminator any other way, because you're breaking the causal connection between the two events. It's also possible for a person to be mistaken about how time travel works, and for this model to appear as a stable time loop model.

Anyway, if you send Alice and Bob back like that you would end up with three distinct timelines that continue to exist in parallel. Timeline 1.1 and 1.2 branch off at Alice's arrival point, and Timeline 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 branch off at Bob's arrival point.
