The main priority would be defending the timeline against incursions from the future. No need to worry about people leaving to go live in the past, they are effectively disappearing forever and can have no more effect on your timeline. On the other hand, there's always the chance of someone arriving from one of the many possible futures and causing trouble.

Now if they're serious enough of an invader, you're pretty much screwed. No policies you can enact will stop a post-singularity robot army from 1000 years in the future. So let's assume we're dealing with more ordinary future travelers. What do we have to change?

First thing: shut down lotteries and other forms of gambling as much as possible. No reason to give anyone who arrives in our timeline from the future those free resources. It might also be wise to start dismantling the stock market for similar reasons. Now that I think about it, you'd really need to switch to a radically different currency regime as well to prevent counterfeiting - presumably involving some sort of shift to an all electronic currency. No need to worry about duplication of valuable physical items, we can just let the market deal with that.

I like the closed loop policing in what you wrote so far. Clearly you'd want to get such a system up and running ASAP. Being the type of society that would help other timelines catch criminals who fled from your timeline would be helpful, since it's free and makes it more likely that you will get the same help from your own future. Plus, there's the deterrence factor of criminals knowing they can get away with something 'once', and then in subsequent timelines the authorities will know about the whole thing before they do.

It seems the big X-factor is technology. Along with information about likely events in the future, you'll also get access to a technological package that's been honed across the many iterations. Not sure if this will mean a sudden singularity, or some carefully planned rollout of new tech on an optimized schedule. Probably some of each depending on the timeline.

If a government did manage to get things under control post-time travel, there would probably be a move towards a much more planned society and economy. Who needs capitalism when you can just iterate 5 year plans until you're optimizing for whatever it is you want to optimize for? Meanwhile people who would chafe under such a regime are free to bail on the timeline and go into the pre-time travel past where their actions can't be regulated to create their own.
