D) Independent of the time machine, every $TIME_QUANTUM a new universe is created, with identical initial conditions (except for the effects of time travelers). The time machine (which exists in all universes unless there is a reason for not inventing it, ever) can send matter to any universe with a later start time. I think this looks a lot like A, assuming you set the duration to the exact number of time quanta for Bob as for Alice. In this scenario, your target universe is not private, anyone else (including any universe between you and it) can target it. Also, if you send Alice, you're almost certain to receive an Alice as well.

E) Using the time machine creates a duplicate of the universe at time X and moves matter into it. In Universe 0 Alice disappears in a puff of greasy black smoke, never to be seen again. In Universe 1 to (infinity), Alice appears just in time to see herself disappear. Each of the infinite universes becomes universe 0 for Bob, where we do the same thing for over again, ending up with infinity**2 universes.
