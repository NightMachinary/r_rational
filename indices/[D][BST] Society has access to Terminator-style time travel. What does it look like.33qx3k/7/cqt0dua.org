An average timeline: throughout history, time travelers from a variety of possible futures have arrived in what was their past, and is now your past. You are lucky enough to live in a timeline where humanity was not destroyed, and where there hasn't been a serious takeover attempt from the future. People have probably known time travel was a thing for all of history, and been receiving contradictory descriptions of the future for that long. As we get closer to this civilization being able to produce their own time machines, the number of time travelers increases, as visitors come back from what is now the timeline's near future, to visit and/or live in their own recent past. Time machine designs are probably introduced by one of these types well before anyone gets around to actually inventing it.

Time machine production starts. What tech level we're at at this point depends on the minimum possible tech level that you can build time machines at. Hoards of people start enacting time travel plans that they or their ancestors have been scheming for a long time. People exit the timeline, and start creating myriad more timelines with histories roughly like this one, but with one more time traveler in the mix. Others head to the future, and return along with the stream of travelers who originated in the future, coming back to the boom times of the first days of time travel.

On a more mutliversal level, I think you'd end up with some sort of wave front of histories where human development gets started earlier and earlier, as more and more time travelers / information dumps get sent back, accelerating progress more and more. Eventually you'd start reaching the origins of the human species, but you might even be able to push the evolution of intelligence earlier, by future generations interbreeding with past generations, and future genes propagating farther and farther into the past.

On a larger scale there would be a wavefront of human colonization of the universe, going farther and farther back towards the big bang, as travelers colonized earlier periods, and then those colonies grew and began producing colonists to still earlier periods.
