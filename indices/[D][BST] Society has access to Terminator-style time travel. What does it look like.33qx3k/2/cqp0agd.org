I'm not following how Castle Solutions stay in business with just inanimate objects...

Say Alice decides to send back lotto numbers...

1.0: Alice1.0 sends back in time lotto numbers. After fees she loses 100 bucks.

1.1: Alice1.1 gets lotto numbers, much to her surprise, and becomes super rich because of it. Alice1.1 decides to send some of her excess money to the past.

1.11: Alice1.11 gets a huge stack of money, much to her surprise.

What incentive does Alice1.0 have in sending the lotto numbers back in time if she knows it will never directly benefit Alice1.0? Alice1.0 spends money so that Alice1.1 benefits. Alice1.1 sends money back in time at no benefit to herself.

From the perspective of timeline 1.0, all Castle Solutions does is provide a strange way of permanently destroying an object. It stays in business mostly by shunting nuclear waste into transdimensional space. As for society? Timeline 1.0 is not enriched by having time travel be a thing at all. Timeline 1.1 is only enriched by Alice becoming rich.

Additionally, if all instances of time travel creates a new branch on a tree, then every single instance of time travel creates a new branch were ONLY one "receiving object from the future" event can occur.

If Bob is next in line behind Alice in Timeline 1.0 and he sends back lotto numbers, you will have:

Timeline1.1 where Alice receives lotto numbers.

Timeline1.2 where Bob receives lotto numbers.

But could you have Timeline1.3 where Alice and Bob both receive lotto numbers? Because in order for Timeline1.3 to exist then Bob will need to time-travel INTO the branch where Alice receives lotto numbers; instead of making an new branch.
