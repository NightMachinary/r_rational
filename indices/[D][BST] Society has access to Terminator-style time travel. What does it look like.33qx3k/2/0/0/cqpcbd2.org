Hmm, if you put it that way it makes alot more sense. So time essentially branches whenever someone RECEIVES something from the future. Thus Alice1.1.1.1 benefits from three "receiving events". So if Alice1.1.1.1 sends money back in time to before she receives lotto numbers, that creates essentially an Alice1.2.

If Alice1.1.1.1 sends money back from after the lotto numbers but BEFORE the first batch of money she creates Alice1.1.2

And if she sends money back after she receives the 2nd batch of money she makes Alice1.1.1.1.1.

So if Alice and Bob both send money back in time, you could have timeline 1.1.2 where Alice receives money, then Bob receives money. Or 1.2.1 where Bob receives money, then Alice receives money. All on a consistent timeline.

On a wider scale that means in some timeline "time travel" doesn't work and is the really expensive pet project of some eccentric company. In another timeline only a handful of "receiving events" happen, and in other timelines it's just an endless chaotic mess, where fortunes change overnight and every other person has a time traveling terminator out to kill them.

And I agree with your argument about Plurality United benefiting the most. So even if you were being 100% selfish and did not care about alternate reality versions of Plurality United, by upholding a policy of "always send back in time" you raise the possibility that present Plurality United will benefit from being the receiver of future Plurality United information.

In lieu of this new information, Singleton Industries will be adopting a new policy of sending terminators back in time to kill off Plurality United founders.
