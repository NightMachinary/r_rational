By the way, has anyone checked if earlier chapters have changed at all (beyond fixing typos)? It'd make a lot of sense for Schloss to have been retconned into the story. If anyone's got an older backup of the story, I'm sure that'd be helpful in finding it (though I don't feel like putting in the effort right now myself, so it probably wouldn't be by me).
