  I doubt that is the Alexander's style

I kinda figured the same, but I remembered a similar incident with something else I used to be a fan of, so I thought it was worth bringing up the possibility. No harm in checking, after all.

  No clue why you were downvoted except that might not be seen as playing fair with the mystery.

I can't imagine how. If AW had put in changes for us to find, how would it be breaking the unwritten rules of the mystery to, you know, find them? I guess there's an argument against automating it rather than looking for changes by hand, but I'm not too sympathetic to the idea that that amount of tedium is necessary for the challenge to be fair.

My guess as for why I was downvoted was that someone didn't approve of me not feeling like putting in the effort myself.
