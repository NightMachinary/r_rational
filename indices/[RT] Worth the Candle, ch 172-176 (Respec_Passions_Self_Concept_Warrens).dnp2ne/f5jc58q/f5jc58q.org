I know Joon is trying to be anti murder hobo, but by golly Hyacinth really makes me want some good old murder-hoboing. Dragons too, given how utterly ridiculous their complaint is. I will say after all killing a dragon seems easier than one of the thirteen horrors. Also I don't really understand Joon's feeling that he's getting so powerful the "game" is going to be over soon. The only genuinely /powerful/ thing he has going for him is the still magic at 100, but he can hardly use that lest the DM drops an exclusion again. Bethel and valencia, their most powerful members by far, were "coincidentally" removed too. Really seems like the DM is hitting the brakes because he has a pretty specific plan for Joon's power level growth, which implies a longer timeline, especially when you look at the ridiculous power of his enemies. Of course all of that slow growth can be skipped with a broken synergy, but that gets excluded.
