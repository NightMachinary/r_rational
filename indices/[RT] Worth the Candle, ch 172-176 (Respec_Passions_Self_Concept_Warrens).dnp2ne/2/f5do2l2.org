Post-Respec it definitely feels like the social values have gone down and the mental values have gone up, in a more noticeable way than just 'Juniper immediately solves complicated maths problem to indicate he is now smarter,' as some media might do. He thinks his way through his problems more logically (though I guess this could be some kind of placebo effect on my part), or at least seems to - when he raised issues with Amaryllis and Esuen, it seemed like there was less waffling, and more of Juniper zeroing in on a problem, and either finding a solution or asking what solution was preferred.

Also it seems a bit like the enhanced MEN is helping to allay some of the potential fallout from reduced SOC, which... actually makes a lot of sense? Sometimes in the past it felt like all the enhanced SOC did was make Joon aware of a problem, without pointing out any resolutions. If he allocates those points instead to MEN - well, sometimes people really /aren't/ all that complicated, and /can/ just be solved by knowing more things. Or maybe it's that, without Joon trying to be suave and understanding, his bluntness comes off more endearing and honest than his half-hearted attempts at manipulation did?

In any case, great chapters. These felt like downtime chapters, but even so the interaction and subtle complications that arise are keeping me very much invested. Even the introduction of those minor characters, like the captain, or the border guards, feels like the introduction of nuanced characters - enough that, in any other book, I'd mark them down as being plot-relevant later on. Bravo, Mr. Wales.

Highly anticipating next time's (royal) courtroom drama!
