Right, but that's what I meant by MEN compensating somewhat by giving him better analytical ability. He doesn't have to rely on a social sense in all situations, he can sometimes just rely purely on his ability to figure things out and apply it to other people.

To me, he felt a bit less smooth, and a bit more direct when it came to his conversations with, for example, Grak, explicitly telling him what he thought Grak's version of heaven would be instead of going for a more subtle resolution.

I don't know if that makes sense? Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that (at least to me) the drop in SOC made him a bit less socially competent, but the hike in MEN meant that that wasn't as noticeable, because he could see what people wanted and how to give it to them anyway.

There'll probably be consequences for the SOC drop at some point anyway (and like you said, he's grown as a person unrelated to his stats), but for now it feels a bit like Mr. Wales is pointing out that there's a lot of overlap when it comes to social abilities and just pure cognitive ability.
