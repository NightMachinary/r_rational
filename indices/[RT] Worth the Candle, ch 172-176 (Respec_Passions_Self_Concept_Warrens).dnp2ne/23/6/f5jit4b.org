I don't see it as being put on a pedestal? Juniper complained all the time about how useless it was due to the mental-strain cost messing up his ability to function in general---it has effective anti-synergy with /everything/. Aside from that, it was always a powerful direct-damage skill that he /wanted/ to like---it's just that now with whichever virtue it is that makes the cost more bearable, it's actually viable. Even then, it's not like he's focusing on it any more than anything else...
