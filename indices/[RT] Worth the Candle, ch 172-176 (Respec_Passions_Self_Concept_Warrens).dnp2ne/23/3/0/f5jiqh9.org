There's only so many magics available, and a number of them aren't useful for him (wood, steel). There would need to be something he could take that is better than what he has now, and I doubt there are many skills better than the magic ones. Rune, air, and warding are a bit questionable, but the rest are fairly defensible, especially since he's both sharing skills with soon to be two other people, and they're collectively running a country. Synergies are also possible yes, particularly in regards to Fire, Plastic, and Alchemy.
