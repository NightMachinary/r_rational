None of that helps in this situation. Your eye is not a telescope.

To increase magnification, you need a second lens. And even if you did, the size of the lens is important, because that determines the light gathering power.

That's why telescopes are so large, and scientists keep making larger and larger ones. You need to gather more photons from a distant object, because you receive less light from it compared to a nearby object.

Cheap telescopes often advertise high magnification numbers, like 500x, but that is useless because the image is so dim.
