You can remove any irregularities in the lens and adjust the focal point so that the dragon is perfectly in focus. Then your vision should be limited by the resolution of your retina.

My understanding of squinting is that it reduces the angle light is coming in from, which reduces noise and makes the image more coherent. Does squinting help if your lens is already shaped optimally? (Also, I'd think you could magnify at least a little by making the lens really thick, though not close to the level of a telescope.)
