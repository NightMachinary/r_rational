  My understanding of squinting is that it reduces the angle light is coming in from, which reduces noise and makes the image more coherent.

Not exactly.

Squinting is the same as making a pinhole camera. The image is in focus for any distance, for any magnification. This is because only photons from one specific location on the target object may strike one location on the film or retina.

Why don't we use this all the time? The number of photons coming in at a straight line from one point of the target is very low, resulting in a dim image. The smaller the pinhole, the better the focus, but that results in a lesser number of photons.
