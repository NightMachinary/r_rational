I think you're definitely on the mark here. Fel Seed either is, or is (knowingly) the product of Arthur. Juniper's image of Arthur has degraded as the story went on, and the final climax wouldn't make sense as anything else. The DM created events to break Arthur as a person over a lifetime, all for the purpose of replicating Fel Seed as Juniper created it. On a meta-(meta-?)narrative level, defeating Fel Seed is the metaphor for moving past Arthur's death.

Side thought, I think the community is rejecting Arthur as Fel Seed because it feels like the easy answer, and something at the scale of WtC needs some Utilitarian Machiavellian plot with an unthinkable-yet-obvious-after-reveal villain, as most ratfics go.
