I am super excited to see what happens when you put Fire Magic, Air Magic and Alchemy together. Air Magic basically seems to let you separate gas streams with arbitrary compositions apart from one another, Fire lets you suppress or modify reactivity, and Alchemy makes you supernaturally good at chemistry? Once you have those together you can industrially produce fullerene, natural products of arbitrary compositions, encase your opponents in real time in ceramics... The possibilities in this world and with this protagonist could get really interesting. As a chemist, I am weirdly hyped.
