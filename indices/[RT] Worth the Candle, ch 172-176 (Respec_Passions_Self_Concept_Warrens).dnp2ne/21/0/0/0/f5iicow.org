That would be Reimer's approach to it. The counter would be grouping multiple errors into a single categorical 'mistake' by DM Fiat.

Say your diabolical scheme has three layers of defences, with objectives in each layer. The first layer can only be defeated by a Cleric. The second layer can only be defeated by a Warrior. The third layer can only be defeated by a Rogue. Under a 'strong' interpretation of the virtue, your third objective can never be captured, as it would require three failures. A 'weak' reading would be that it has a single point of failure, the "Classic Adventuring Party", and as soon as one arrives, you're doomed.
