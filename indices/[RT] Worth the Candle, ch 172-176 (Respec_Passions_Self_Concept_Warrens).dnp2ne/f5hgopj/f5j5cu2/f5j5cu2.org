I don't think it's been put on a pedestal. Quite the contrary, until recently Juniper constantly complained how it was a pain to use. It was only after he got a Spirit virtue that greatly reduces the downside of Gem Magic that he started considering it worth something. Its main advantage in comparison to Juniper's other magics is that it allows for ranged attacks that track enemies.
