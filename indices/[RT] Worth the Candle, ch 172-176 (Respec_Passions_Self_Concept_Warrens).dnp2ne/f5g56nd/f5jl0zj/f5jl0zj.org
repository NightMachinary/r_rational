So there Geejo's answer, and then there's the RPG term-of-art version, which is what I think is actually being implied.

Suppose you had a system much like the one shown in Worth the Candle. You're making a Logistics check by rolling a 1d100 die and then adding your total bonus of +50, and the Target Number is 75. If you roll a 24 (for a total of 74), that's just barely a failure, which should suggest to the DM that you only just barely failed in character. If you rolled a 15 instead, you'd have failed by a larger margin and this should suggest to the DM that your character failed to a greater degree. Likewise, rolling a total of 139 should imply a more successful result than just scraping by with a 79.

Some TTRPGs formalize this notion as 'degrees of success' and 'degrees of failure, often with 5 or 10 point break points. For example, failing by 1 point is an ordinary failure, but failing by 10 points is 'one degree of failure', a failure which is one step worse than an ordinary failure. If this is what the Worst Case virtue refers to, it means that any failure of the third degree or worse gets treated as a second degree failure - there is a sharp limit on how badly a person with this virtue can screw up their logistics chain, in other words.
