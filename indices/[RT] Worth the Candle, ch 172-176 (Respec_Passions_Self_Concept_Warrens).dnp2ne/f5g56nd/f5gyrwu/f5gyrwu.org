Think of how the Chernobyl disaster happened. There was no singular point of failure that caused the disaster. Instead, it was a compounding series of small mistakes folding into large problems folding into an overall catastrophe.

*/Worst Case/* puts a floor on large-scale plans created by Joon, such that regardless of the number of variables involved, the overall results can be no worse than the worst case of two compounding mistakes. How it accomplishes this (adjusting Joon's planmaking, adjusting reality on the fly, adjusting things posthoc) is unknown.

This sounds, on the face of it, tremendously powerful. Plans of any scale can have no more than two relevant errors when written by Joon. Except...

1. It has no real impact on smaller or on-the-fly plans, where two variables are about as much as you should be dealing with in the first place (see [[https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/24][Malfoy's 'Rule of Three' explanation of plotting]] in HPMOR).
2. Joon currently offloads all large-scale planning to Amaryllis, who doesn't have the virtue.
3. Two compounding mistakes can still be pretty huge. The Death Star was destroyed from the results of a single mistake in placing a thermal exhaust port. When the world runs on narrative, an unbeatable plan with a single tiny flaw is arguably a /bigger/ problem than an overall '90%' plan where all the bases are more-or-less covered.

Which together explains why it's merely a level 10 virtue on par with ambidexterity, and not a capstone.
