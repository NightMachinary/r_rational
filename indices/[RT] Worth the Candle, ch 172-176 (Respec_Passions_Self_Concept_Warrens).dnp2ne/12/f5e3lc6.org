I'm calling it now: the schlossvolk are the final key to Juniper reaching godhood. Purely conceptual beings, with a powerful relationship to narrative, who can insert retroactively true people and places into the world? That's the power of the DM, basically---just slightly lesser, and therefore reachable, as proven by Uther. My guess is that Joon will visit the Outer Reaches and, somehow, take the power of the schlossvolk for his own.

The power to retroactively edit history by inserting â€˜schloss' is so near to the power of a god that it makes little difference what you call it. And considering that the Ice Wizards are the direct result of the schlossvolk's meddling, and also the result of the DM's insistence on Uther following a never-ending narrative path, it seems clear that there's a major connection between the two. Perhaps the Outer Reaches bridge the conceptual space between Aerb and whatever meta-reality the DM exists in?
