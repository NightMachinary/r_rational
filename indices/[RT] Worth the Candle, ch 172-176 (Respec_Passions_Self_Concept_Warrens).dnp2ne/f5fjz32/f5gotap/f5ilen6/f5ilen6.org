Masters hasn't ever come around to Raven being an adult doing adult things, and thoroughly disapproves of her doing them, probably even more so since he hasn't ever been able to have any influence on that. Raven was sick of his meddling five centuries ago and now defaults to "treat with my father the absolute minimum possible".

tl;dr, Masters sees Raven as a little girl to protect, Raven sees Masters as a gigantic pest to be kept as far away as possible. The narrative/confidential stuff she said is true, but it's not why she did it.
