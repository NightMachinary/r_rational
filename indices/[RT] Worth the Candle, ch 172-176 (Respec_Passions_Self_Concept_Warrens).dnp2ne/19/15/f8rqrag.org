I found a typo while I was rereading chapter 9.

#+begin_quote
  tapping it and shaping it for other purpose
#+end_quote

What started me rereading early chapters (again) is that I realized that the slowed descent from the very beginning was skin magic, now excluded.

I also sent myself to the edge but not down something of a rabbithole to determine if

#+begin_quote
  I needed do less thinking aloud
#+end_quote

is grammatical (or intentional)
