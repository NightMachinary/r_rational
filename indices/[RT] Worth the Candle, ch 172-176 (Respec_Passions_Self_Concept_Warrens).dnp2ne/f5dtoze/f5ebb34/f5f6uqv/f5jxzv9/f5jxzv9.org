However genetics works on Aerb, it doesn't seem impossible that use of entads could allow for artificial replication of genetic diversity, maybe by copying the magical gene-equivalents from pre-extinction elk bones. That requires a suitable entad to exist, of course, but so does magically changing some of the elk's sex. This would be easier if soul magic worked on animals.
