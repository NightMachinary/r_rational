The text doesn't specify, and so I really have to ask - does The Jade Elk make live elk, or dead? Because it making live elk makes the statement that elk are extinct so trivially easy to fix that it's impossible to credit, where as an entad that just makes a huge pile of elk carcasses freaks me the hell out.
