I maintain it would be very strange for Uther to /independently/ reinvent the aesthetic and powers of Fel Seed, even given everything else wrong with the world up to that point. It would be hard, but not insurmountable, for the story to shake us from the idea that the DM /made/ Uther do it.

  “There wasn't a source, like the others, some magic gone awry or some entad that came out too powerful. He appeared in 34 FE, but ... we're not sure that there wasn't some kind of incubation period, that he hadn't gained his power, or that he was in hiding, and ... there were rumors.”

  And at the same time, some of the exclusion zones must have logically been instigated by people who weren't, for lack of a better term, player characters. Doris Finch didn't fit into the same mold that Uther and I did, nor did Fel Seed, or Manifest.

  “No,” said Raven, looking back up at us. I kind of hated the way we were sitting above her, in a position of power we didn't really need. “ No, ” she repeated. “It's absurd, there's a four year gap you'd have to account for, and -- and even if he had broken completely, there's no way that he could have become something like that, whatever his sins, he just wasn't --” She stopped and looked at Bethel's empty seat. “If people knew that I'd tracked his last location to the Fel Seed exclusion zone, that rumor wouldn't be so quickly dismissed. He wouldn't be the Lost King, he would be the Fallen King.”

It's hard to get a read on Raven here: can the head of the Infinite Library deny it while recognizing that most people wouldn't? Maybe.

  "The entity we call ‘Fel Seed' is in fact just an avatar of the phenomenon, capable of being ‘regrown' or ‘expressed' from any of the biological lacework that covers and is buried beneath the zone, from spores in the air, from his flesh beasts, or from any of his brides.”

  "Fel Seed the entity is just ... well, someone or something using that magic for effective immortality and to take sadistic pleasure from the world. Even if another person came into the zone later on, once the magic was back, and began to practice it, they might turn into a monster, but they wouldn't be Fel Seed. Only when he returned, that's who he was, the same entity he'd always been, ready to retake the battle zone and rebuild his City.

I was about to suggest there could be some sort of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dread_Pirate_Roberts][Dread Pirate Roberts]] scenario where Uther isn't the original, but ...
