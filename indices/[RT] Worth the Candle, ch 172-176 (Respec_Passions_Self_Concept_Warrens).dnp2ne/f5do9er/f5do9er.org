I assume this is because I've never played D&D, but could someone help explain again the math the Joon and Reimer go through here:

  “Right,” said Reimer. “Right. So, let's compare you against a hypothetical optimized character, even a poorly optimized character. Heck, even one as poorly optimized for social skills as you are optimized for physical skills. An eleven in SOC means they're multiplying their skill by ten, and that skill is going to be thirty or so, which means they get a bonus of three hundred against the TN. That means achievable range in the naive case of three hundred and one to four hundred.” He waited for me to nod. “Right, so you're sitting here with a four in SOC, meaning a multiplier to skill of three, and you cap out at a whopping nine on that skill. That means a bonus of twenty-seven, and an achievable range, again, in the naive case with no adjustments or multipliers, of twenty-eight to one hundred and twenty-seven.”

Is it just in the rules that the multiplier is your skill minus 1? And we are assuming a skill level of 3? And an achievable range automatically adds 100? Also what is an achievable range?
