The Warrens seems strongly similar to how the Ways are used in later Dresden Files books.

That is, a sequence of trips through paths that might actually lead you to various locations all over the world just because it actually works out to be faster that way. Also notable that the Warrens, like the Ways, are subject to change and known paths might become unusable over time.
