No, that's the tetrahedral d4 IMO. Sure, it's platonic, but it doesn't have an up-facing side and so it has to go with a shitto workaround. They also roll terribly and are worse than legos to step on. I've seen videos of d4s based on the truncated tetrahedron, though I don't own any myself. They have a very small chance of landing on the small labelled sides (so small as to be negligible), but in return you get an up-facing side to put the label on (and thus one that's much easier to read), a die that can't double as a caltrop and perhaps most importantly a die that rolls much better (I haven't tried it, but I can tell just watching that it's rolling more instead of landing straight down). Also, I personally find them more visually pleasing with the nice clean hexagons, but that's up to personal preference. Now that I've remembered these, I might actually buy them, though my group hasn't been able to meet lately.

The company that made the truncated tetrahedron d4s also made another die that I like in principle (but have never actually used), the rhombic dodecahedral d12. Sure, it's not platonic, but it tiles space beautifully and is just as fair.

By the way, "shitto" was a typo, but I'm leaving it because I like it.

EDIT: Accidentally called the rhombic dodecahedral d12s d20s, now fixed. Still leaving the shitto.
