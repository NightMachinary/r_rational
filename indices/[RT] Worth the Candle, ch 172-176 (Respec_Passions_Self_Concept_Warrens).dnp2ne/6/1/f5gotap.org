Juniper did trade off his social abilities maybe he is simply misreading the situation as a result? Juniper is interpreting Master's desire to be involved as being protective of Raven which is a reasonable read on things but there are other possibilities. I think you are right that it's more Raven being over protective of her father than the other way around, and from a pragmatic non-meta viewpoint Masters has a lot of life experience that may be useful. From a meta-viewpoint, having a non-companion character around is likely to get them killed, so I think Juniper made the right choice.
