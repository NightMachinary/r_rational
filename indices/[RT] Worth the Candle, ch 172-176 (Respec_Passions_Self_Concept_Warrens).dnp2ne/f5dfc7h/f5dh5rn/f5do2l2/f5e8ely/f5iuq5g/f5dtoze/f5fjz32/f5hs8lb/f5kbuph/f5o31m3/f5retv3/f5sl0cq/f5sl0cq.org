Well, Outer Reaches and DM-like personality suggest that Joon might go for a Conceptual apotheosis instead, but honestly I don't see the reason he has to choose /one/ way to beat an entity with infinite tricks.

They're both kinda bullshit, when really min-maxed. If Fel Seed is the god of biology, then Joon will become the god of everything else.

He did make that his "Narrow Expertise" after all.
