Okay, am I misreading something, not understanding strained parent-child interaction enough, or is there something weird going on with the Raven-Masters interaction and Juniper's reaction to it?

  “No,” said Raven. “Absolutely not. This is dangerous, even more dangerous than just holding that construct in your mind.”

  “I won't be forced out again,” said Masters. “Not this go around.”

Raven forces Masters out of the discussion.

  “Just as a warning, they'll have a memory of this,” said Raven. “If you can find a way to keep the part with my father from spreading, I would appreciate it.”

  “It wasn't that bad,” I replied. “He was being protective, to a level that you really, really don't need.”

  “Still,” replied Raven. “I'd prefer that our colleagues don't see me treated like a child. I'd have preferred /you/ not see it.”

Then /Juniper/ describes that as Masters being protective of Raven. I could understand Raven being stuck looking at things from that point of view, but how could a third party possibly come away from that interaction with Masters having been overprotective of Raven, when it was clearly the opposite. There isn't even any reason given why this information would be dangerous to him. I smell shenanigans.

The first hypothesis that comes to mind is that the Snag is actually an infectious meme that makes people think there is a threat to make them copy it to other people. But that doesn't really explain the discrepancy.
