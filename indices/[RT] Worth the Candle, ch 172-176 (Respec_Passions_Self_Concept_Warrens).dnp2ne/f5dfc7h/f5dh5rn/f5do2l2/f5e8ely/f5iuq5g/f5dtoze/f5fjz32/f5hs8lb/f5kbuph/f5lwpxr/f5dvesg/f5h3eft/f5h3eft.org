  “To give an example, the concept of Uther was made up of other concepts, some of which he had to take from others during the course of our adventure there. King, Poet, Warrior, those helped give him leverage. He picked up conceptual objects, Sword, Axe, Armor, Shield. And then he went after the schlossvolk who had been responsible for the creation and engaged them in conceptual combat. It was about forced adornment of conceptual descriptors, Wounded, Injured, Coward.”

I've recently started playing in a FATE campaign, and this to me looks like a rules-as-written interpretation of FATE. In FATE you spend your turns either creating aspects or caching out aspects for advantages. I figure experience playing in that system would explain some of Uther's competency in p-space.

Sort of like in HPMoR, where Harry has an instant tactical advantage fighting in the lake because he read Ender's Game and cribbed Ender's zero-g combat tactics.
