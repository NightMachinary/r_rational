It's in the worlbuilding doc, not this set of chapters, and I'm not 100% certain if it's a typo or not, but in the "Cosmology" chapter (chapter 4), it says

#+begin_quote
  "Each of the elemental planes consists of roughly 90% of the given *elemental*, with the remaining 10% being divided up into foreign materials that have arrived through planar travel, adjacent elements, and air (breathable or otherwise)."
#+end_quote

(Emphasis mine.)

Was it intended that the elementals (as in native entities later mentioned) make up 90% of the mass of their plane? This seems unusual enough that I came to the conclusion that you probably meant "the given element", which is why I'm posting this, but I'm happy to be corrected if you really did mean for the inhabitants to make up that much of the mass. If that /was/ your intention, then in my opinion the phrasing could still stand to be made more clear.
