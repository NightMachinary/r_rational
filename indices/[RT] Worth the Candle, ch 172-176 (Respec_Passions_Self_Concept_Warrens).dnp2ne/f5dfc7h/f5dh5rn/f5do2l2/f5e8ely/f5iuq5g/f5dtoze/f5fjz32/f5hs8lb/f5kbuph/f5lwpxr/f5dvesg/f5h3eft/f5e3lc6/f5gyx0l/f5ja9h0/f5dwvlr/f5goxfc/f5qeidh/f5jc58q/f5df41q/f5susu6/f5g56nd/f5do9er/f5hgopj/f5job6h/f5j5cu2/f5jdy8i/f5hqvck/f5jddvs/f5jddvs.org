Punch lasers, yes. It's a good way of attacking large groups of people from range, and a cheap way of seeing if you can take out a stronger opponent. Vibration magic can do the same thing, but attacking a large group with enough force to be lethal uses up a substantial amount of breath which could be used on other things. The best example so far was when they were going to Kuum Doona, using gem magic with a sapphire was able to kill a bunch of soldiers that would have been hard to hit with non-homing attacks.
