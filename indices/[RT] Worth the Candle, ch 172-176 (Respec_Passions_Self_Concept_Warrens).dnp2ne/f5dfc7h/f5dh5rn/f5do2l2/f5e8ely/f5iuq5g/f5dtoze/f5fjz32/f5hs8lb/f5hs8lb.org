This is great. A couple things:

The Warrens getting their first mention now makes me really feel like they are schloss. I love the concept, but fear that their existence (which never came up before in WtC via ctrl+F) is enemy action.

The Jade Elk.

Is the author a player or fan of Magic: The Gathering? In that card game, we've just recently been suffering a plague of elk creation, as described by [[https://clips.twitch.tv/LittleTangentialTermiteDxAbomb][e.g. the commentors for a recent tournament]]. The card [[https://scryfall.com/card/eld/197/oko-thief-of-crowns][Oko, Thief of Crowns]] is extremely dominant in standard with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/dnvu7q/mcq_weekend_day_2_stats_and_fun_facts/][~67% of the most recent tournament playing Oko-based decks]]. He's also been showing up a lot in other formats like Modern. Oko's two most signature abilities are to make food tokens, and turn artifacts (including food tokens) and creatures into elks, removing all their other abilities and interactions.
