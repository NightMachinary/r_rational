  Then /Juniper/ describes that as Masters being protective of Raven. I could understand Raven being stuck looking at things from that point of view, but how could a third party possibly come away from that interaction with Masters having been overprotective of Raven, when it was clearly the opposite.

I think they're both being protective of each other, but in Raven's case it's more reasonable as he has less need to know and maybe less experience with this kind of thing, whereas in Masters' case he's just wants to stick around because it's his daughter and he feels he needs to be present for her in general.
