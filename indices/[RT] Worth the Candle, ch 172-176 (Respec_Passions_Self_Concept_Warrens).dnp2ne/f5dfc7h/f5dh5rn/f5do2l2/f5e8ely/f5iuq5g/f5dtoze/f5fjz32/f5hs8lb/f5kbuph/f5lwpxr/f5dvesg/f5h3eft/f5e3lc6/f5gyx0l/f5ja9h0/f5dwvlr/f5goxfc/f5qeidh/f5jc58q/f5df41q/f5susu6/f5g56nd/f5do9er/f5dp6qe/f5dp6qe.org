The add 100 is due to rolling a d100, which can have values between 1 and 100. The achievable range is the range of values that you can get when rolling against a number to see if you fail or not. With a bonus of 27 from skills and stats, the lowest you can roll is 28 (27 plus rolling a 1) through 127 (27 plus rolling a 100).
