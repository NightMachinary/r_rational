It'd defeat the point of Fel Seed for him to be defeatable in a straight up fight. Joon didn't intend him to be beatable AT ALL, it'd make no narrative sense for the resolution to Fel Seed to just be a brawl.

And he can't become a real god before reuniting with Arthur/confronting Fel Seed (which may or may not be the same thing), it'd remove all the narrative stakes. Even ignoring the fact that this is a story in the real world, it's also a story in universe too, and the DM seems to care at least a little about that sort of thing.
