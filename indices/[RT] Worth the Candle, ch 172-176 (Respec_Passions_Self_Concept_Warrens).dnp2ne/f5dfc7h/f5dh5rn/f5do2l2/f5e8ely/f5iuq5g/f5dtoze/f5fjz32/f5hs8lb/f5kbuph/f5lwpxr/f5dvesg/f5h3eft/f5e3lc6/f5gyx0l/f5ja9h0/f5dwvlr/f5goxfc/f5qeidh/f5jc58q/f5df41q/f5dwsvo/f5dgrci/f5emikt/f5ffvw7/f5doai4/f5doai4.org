Ch 175:

#+begin_quote
  I faffed around for a bit, then decided on the more aggressive (but likely safer option), and copied over the entirety of the spirit cluster into my own spirit.
#+end_quote

Closing parenthesis should occur one word sooner; as it is, "more aggressive" doesn't link with "option."
