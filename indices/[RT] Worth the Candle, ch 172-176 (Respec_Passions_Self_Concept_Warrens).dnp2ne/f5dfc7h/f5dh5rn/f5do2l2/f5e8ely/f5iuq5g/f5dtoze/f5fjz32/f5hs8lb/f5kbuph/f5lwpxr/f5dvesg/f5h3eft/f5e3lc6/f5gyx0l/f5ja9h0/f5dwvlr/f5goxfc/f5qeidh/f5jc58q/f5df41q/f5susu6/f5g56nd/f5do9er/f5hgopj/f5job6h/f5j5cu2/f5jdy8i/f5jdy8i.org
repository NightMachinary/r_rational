I may be forgetting a magic or two, but in general it's range and relative usage against most common defenses. It's sort of like how void weapons are better than normal guns, gem magic is sorta better in the same ways, it's the best possible offensive magic. I think it's put on a pedestal because it's a directly offensive magic that can in theory be used to take down an army if one has enough power behind it (which Juniper is finally hitting). That's just not a thing that's theoretically possible with any other single magic (save for example Soul Magic and modifying a commander kind of things) we've seen on screen to memory. It's homing abilities are especially scary. But I think the real issue is: are Gem Magic projectiles physical and hence stoppable by any of the kinetic mages (gold, still, etc.) or are they light and hence pretty unstoppable sans revision mage or warder, not sure if we know that yet.
