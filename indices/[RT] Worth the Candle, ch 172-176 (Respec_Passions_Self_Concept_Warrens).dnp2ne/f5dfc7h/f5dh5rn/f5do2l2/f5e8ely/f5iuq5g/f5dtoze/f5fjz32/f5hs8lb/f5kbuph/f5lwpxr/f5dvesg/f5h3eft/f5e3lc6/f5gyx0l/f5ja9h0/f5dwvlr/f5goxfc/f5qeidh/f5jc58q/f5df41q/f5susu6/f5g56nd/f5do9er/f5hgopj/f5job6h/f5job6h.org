The Spirituality virtue means that Juniper divides the mental strain of Gem Magic by his current skill in Gem Magic, making it considerably cheaper for him to use than for anyone else. Like, roughly twenty times cheaper at his current skill level.

But even if you're not Juniper, being a Gem Mage means having an automatic weapon with a couple magazines worth of target-seeking, IFF-equipped bullets. Or several shots of magical battering ram. Or the ability to cancel enemy use of such weapons on the cheap. Any or all of which can be readily concealed as ordinary jewelry of the sort a non-Gem Mage would be equally likely to wear, and which appears as such even to wards and warders.

Furthermore, these shots can be projected from any part of the body and the activation of the magic is purely mental - making it ideal to use alongside Multithreading (which lets him focus on two things at once, say using Blade-Bound stuff on the defense and Gem Magic on the offense).
