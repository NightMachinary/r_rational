I wonder if there's more to it, because the description of the outer reaches did not seem to explain Raven's behavior here. I also notice that Masters was so driven to know wtf he was spending his life doing that he initially imprisoned the party. I wouldn't be surprised if Raven's flat refusal to tell him anything lead him to do something desperate and dangerous.
