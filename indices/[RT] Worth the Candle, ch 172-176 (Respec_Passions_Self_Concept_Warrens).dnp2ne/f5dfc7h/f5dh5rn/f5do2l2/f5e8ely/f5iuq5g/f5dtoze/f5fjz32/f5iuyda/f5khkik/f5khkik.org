Too many things don't line up for this to be a complete bait-and-switch. The Snag has a complex utility (subverting a specific anti-meme) that is unlikely to have arisen from anyone/thing other than Uther. If it is a trap, it's probably one Uther laid, and I can't immediately see what would motivate him to do that.
