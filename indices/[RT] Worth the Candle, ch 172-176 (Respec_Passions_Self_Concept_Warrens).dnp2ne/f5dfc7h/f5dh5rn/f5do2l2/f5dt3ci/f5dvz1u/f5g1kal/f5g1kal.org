Personally, I thought that in that scene he was incredibly rude. /Telling/ someone what you think their heaven would be? Really?! How about just /asking them/?

...Of course, when I went back and checked, I saw that Grak explicitly asked him to do so. Which put a damper on my outrage and made a real point to me about how easy it is to miss details and how that can shape our understanding. The best fiction makes you think about reality, and this just did. Thank you, [[/u/cthulhuraejepson]]
