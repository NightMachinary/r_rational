I kind of feel the other way? Maybe I need to reread some high SOC and some low SOC chapters, but Joon felt very socially competent here. He talked things out, expressed concern for his companions, listened to Eseun's concerns and worked on a solution, etc.

Obviously, low SOC doesn't mean he reverts to asshole Joon, he's grown as a person unrelated to his stats, but I didn't feel a SOC drop.
