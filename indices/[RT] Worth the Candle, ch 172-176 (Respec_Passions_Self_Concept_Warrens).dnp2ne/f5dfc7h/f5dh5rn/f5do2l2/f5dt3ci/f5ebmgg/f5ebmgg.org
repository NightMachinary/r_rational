I felt the same as well that Juniper was still handling social problems as well as before the Respec, but in a more logical manner. It seemed like that he didn't suffer any drop in ability, because of Symbiosis and the fact that narrative is having an effect on him. It just wouldn't be a good narrative fit if he reverts to prior social incompetence after all of the social problems and challenges he needed to overcome.
