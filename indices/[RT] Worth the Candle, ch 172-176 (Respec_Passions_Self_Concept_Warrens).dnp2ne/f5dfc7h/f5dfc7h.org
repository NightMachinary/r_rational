  “What don't you like about yourself?” I asked.

  “Oh, lots of things,” Amaryllis replied.

The Amaryllis technique of getting a boy to date you: first, magically remove all romantic interest you have in him, keeping him fully aware of this. Second, have a child by someone else (magical deer are preferred but not necessary). Make sure he is present during the conception, although the conception can occur before step 1. Then, have a genuine outpouring of all the things you dislike about yourself, especially if those things are related to feeling guilty about stabbing people. The boy asking for cuddles as an oblique way of asking you out is soon to follow, at which point you have succeeded.

Jokes aside, we're about two significant Mary-Joon interactions away from them being officially a couple (that they admit to themselves. Everyone else on the isle is shipping them hard). It's been a long time coming, and been handled very well, showing that they're genuinely friends and depend on each other.

The interactions with Grak and Raven have been nice in these chapters as well. The bit after the meeting with Esuen shows, rather than tells, how much Grak looks up to Juniper (other than literally). In contrast, Gemma returning is mentioned in one line and then basically forgotten.

Speaking of Grak, loyalty 20 is pretty close, and that will be a big thing. Not only will Joon get ~40 in warding instantly, Grak will get access to all of Joon's magics. For someone who really dislikes himself, I'm wondering how he will handle getting the ability to change himself so freely. Would boosting his values effectively end or lessen his depression? His comments on what Fallatehr did to him seem to indicate that this would work.

The jokes are always good. Uther just using the German word for castle, using the German grammar for naming the people who made the metaphorical castles, the Tuung calling themselves Battletoads, /The Princess Diaries/. Some of the understated things get a laugh out of me as well, like the blunt "yep, this thing just makes elk." I'm sure there's some that went over my head, as a number have in the past.

For the Respec, I'm a little unclear on a few things. Taking Rune magic seems odd given that there will probably be tight restrictions on people entering the runeforge. Air magic is said to have a really good use case, but I'm not seeing it right now. And warding seems redundant given that Grak will be hitting Loyalty 20 soon and give Joon an instant 40 in warding, which would make it on par with his other skills for a number of levels. And speaking of that, not unlocking warding seems a bit odd given that Grak is one of the best warders alive and is right there to train Joon. Just finding out if he can quickly make a wand and monocle seem like they are worth the time it would take to unlock warding.

This comment has gone on long enough, but as a last note I love the idea that Joon got the effective skill of at least 10 years spent as a flower mage, and then gave that skill up, before he ever actually used a flower.
