I agree if there is no depression thread things become far more complicated. Now that you say it, I am not even sure Grak is depressed, more extremely emotionally traumatized due to his past. I always saw depression as a separate thing from trauma. Atleast, I know a few people with depressions who have not suffered any bad trauma (as far as I know). They might very well exacerbate each other, of course. Grak might very well have a depression on top of the rest. If it is "just" emotional trauma, it is probably not the right choice to just handwave it away. That seems extremely shitty to all the people that died and are suffering in the hells. But on the other hand, what does it help them that Grak feels continually shitty about it. Complicated situation, like everything else in this novel I guess.
