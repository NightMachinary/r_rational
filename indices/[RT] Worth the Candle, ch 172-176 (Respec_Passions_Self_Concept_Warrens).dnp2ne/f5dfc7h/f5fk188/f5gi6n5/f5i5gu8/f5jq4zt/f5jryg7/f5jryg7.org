Joon's understanding of spirit is pretty good at this point. He could probably fine tune the feedback mechanisms of the spirit to favor motivation and hope over self-hatred and despair without affecting the individual weighting of specific things relative to each other (except insofar as the changes will affect Grak over time).

If he only had soul magic to work with, you'd have a point given that that's how the values system works, but spirit seems to be ALL ABOUT manipulating feedback loops, and depression (and many other mental illnesses) can be understood by seeing our mind as a vast system of various feedback loops, some of which, particularly in the case of mental illness, are tuned suboptimally and are thus too excitable/susceptible-to-positive-feedback or too unexcitable/susceptible-to-negative-feedback. This is of course a vast oversimplification of the actual processes involved (which probably differ between Aerb's spirit based system and the electrochemical processes we use on earth), but Joon is something of an expert on spirit, and based on what we know of spirit, this seems like exactly what it's good at.
