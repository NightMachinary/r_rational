I dunno, I judge folks on what they do, not what they say about it.

Like, if somebody hits their girl and then talks up a storm about how they are just the worst and should never have done that, you know, ok. Then they do it again and are like, 'yeah, I crossed a line'...ok. And then some dude is like 'hey, can you maybe promise to stop hitting your girlfriend' and bro is like 'hey, I'm not gonna take it off the table.' That dude is an abuser, yeah? You wouldn't call them vehemently against domestic abuse, because of all the abusing that continue to do.

Like, we saw Juniper let Amaryllis self modify, plus or minus some talking. I don't see a reason to think he'd do different for Grak, maybe there's a hypocritical lecture, maybe there isn't, but I think the day Grak gets essentialism is the day he cures his depression.
