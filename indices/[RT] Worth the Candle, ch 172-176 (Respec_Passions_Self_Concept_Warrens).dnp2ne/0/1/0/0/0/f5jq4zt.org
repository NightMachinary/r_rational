I mean I agree in principle but based on Juniper's editing of himself the way he would accomplish this would be to lower the spiritual emotional threads involved. There is no depression thread or value to change. There are just the threads that are reacting to the in Grak's case the tragedy that caused it. Basically if my understanding is correct to accomplish what you're talking about would require Grak to make himself care less about the fate of his home. If Grak was still suicidal I could see Juniper endorsing this but with the situation as is I don't think anyone will see it as necessary.
