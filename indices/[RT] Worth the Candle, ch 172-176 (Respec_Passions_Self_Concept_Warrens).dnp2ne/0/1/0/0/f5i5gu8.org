I don't know, removing romantic feelings and removing a depression does not seem in the same ballpark. A depression is universally seen as a bad thing. We treat it with pills and therapy right now, but if we could make them go away with a snap of the finger I'm pretty sure everybody would do it. It would, of course, not fix the cause of the depression, but diagnosing and fixing that becomes easier when the depression is not in the way, murking the waters.
