He considers it a necessary evil sometimes. When he edited himself, he was guilty about it and considered it giving in. When he soulfucked the cultist he described it as crossing a line. The first time Amaryllis did it he called it a violation of self. I don't think he would endorse Grak editing out his depression as Grak seems to be recovering pretty well as is. I'm not sure he even still is depressed based on how we've seen him acting.
