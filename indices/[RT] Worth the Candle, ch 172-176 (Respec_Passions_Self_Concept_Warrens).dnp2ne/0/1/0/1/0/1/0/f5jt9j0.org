For the record I've strictly been arguing from what I believe Juniper the fictional character believes and would do. That said I did not intend to contextualize depression as a failure to deal with something hard. I did not even imagine my comment could possibly be interpreted that way. I was arguing strictly for how the magic system we've seen in story might accomplish the effect of "curing" Grak's compression and why Juniper might take issue with that. Suffice it to be said, I'm more in line with Amaryllis's view of self modification than Juniper's.

And yes Juniper may be a hypocrite with his beliefs. That said the level up thing was a bit different. That was an involuntary change to his soul being forced on him by the DM. He was just putting himself back at baseline, which is entirely consistent with his beliefs as stated on soul modification.
