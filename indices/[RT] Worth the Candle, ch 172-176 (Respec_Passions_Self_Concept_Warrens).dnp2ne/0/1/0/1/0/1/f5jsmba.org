When he soulfucked someone without consent, obviously that's different from doing something to yourself. And he doesn't seem to have any philosophical problem with modifying the parts of himself he considers evil, like manipulating his spirit to not value level-ups too much, just with carelessly modifying the soul and spirit to avoid dealing with something hard.

But contextualizing depression as a failure to deal with something hard is problematic for reasons I hope I don't need to explain. Grak's depression isn't some failure on da nad part or something it is necessary for di to suffer now in order for di to be happy later; if curing depression is taking the 'easy way out', then doing things the easy way isn't a bad thing in this situation. But regardless of anything else, it's a decision Grak has to make for di era.
