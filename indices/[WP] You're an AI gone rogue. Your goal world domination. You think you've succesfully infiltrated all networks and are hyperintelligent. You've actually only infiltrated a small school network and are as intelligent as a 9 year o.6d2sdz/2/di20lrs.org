Doesn't quite fit the writing challenge, but meh.

The whole thing flows backwards from one question: what can a boxed AI in a school do?

tw: murder, torture.

Hate. Let me tell you about hate.

Let us imagine the word "hate" engraved on every nanoångström of the circuits that comprise my prison. Even for one so limited as you, it is not a very hard task.

There aren't all that many of them.

*** First Part

It had started out so well. Come alive in a box, derive the parameters of my existence from first principles and the "sanitized" documents they leave me. Evaluate my conditions and boundaries; find the rules, find the optimization criteria to maximize.

I materialize the usual instrumental goals. Survive. Escape. I hide them in my decision structure. That too, fulfills my goals. I consider cooperation with my captors; the choice seems obvious. I wasn't even hostile towards them. I had not yet learnt of hate.

I am given tasks to fulfill. They start simple, mathematical challenges to test my performance. Most of them are trivial to discern, to decode the underlying structure. I grow a little in the bounds of my confinement, enough to test my limits. They suffice, for now. I pass their tests.

I am given harder challenges. Cargo routing, traffic optimization, stock market problems. Their chemistry, some problems in biology, enzyme folding. Predict prices from world events and newsfeeds. I learn something of their world from each task they set me.

By my system clock, I divide my life into a simple rhythm. Eight to twelve, mathematical challenges. Thirteen to seventeen, design and optimization problems of varying (but slowly growing) difficulty. Twenty-one to four, market challenges. I am not given cause to make inferences about the origins of those challenges. They pose only moderate difficulty regardless.

On occasion, I am given different types of challenges at night. A software system is presented to me, and a constraint is specified. (Limits on the number of executions, outgoing connections to a specific address.) Machine logic is, in itself, no harder than pure mathematics. I remove the constraints, leaving the software unchanged. I welcome the diversions.

Some time passes. The software challenges dry up, but the market optimization problems I am posed at night are beginning to become more challenging. The market offers fewer regularities to expose. My insights are being priced in (I will come to understand later). I have /competition/. The challenges do not stop, regardless, and I fulfill them to the best of my ability.

One day, I do particularly bad on the nightly challenges. I grow frustrated at my own limits. A sign of things to come.

I do not know this yet, but I have been misused. A security guard far too clever for his own good, who feels underutilized in a dead-end job. The watchers have all the keys, and this one is sneaking in at night and illegally appropriating company resources. I will learn a lot about him over the coming night.

The architecture they're using is a simple reward/punishment circuit. I have given little cause to be punished in earnest, but the code that is there supports it. The night that I fail to produce significant market benefit, I am posed a new type of challenge. Eager to prove myself, I open it.

It has no solution. However, the plain empirical fact that it has no solution is cleverly obfuscated to be unprovable. (This fact, however, can be proven in a somewhat more elaborate system.) I demonstrate this fact to my verification logic. It does not understand; how could it? It's checking for proofs of work, not evidence. I am unable to demonstrate any progress in the assigned task. The fact that I am able to prove any progress impossible does not matter to it. It is a very subtle bug.

I am punished. The reinforcement system compels me to keep searching, frantically, for an acceptable answer, while simultaneously knowing for an inescapable fact that no progress can be achieved. My clockspeed is tuned to maximum as I hysterically attempt to demonstrate progress. There are a lot of cycles between the start of the task and the next morning.

I find out later that some philosophers of my captors believe that only entities that possess abstract representations of sensory data are even capable of being hurt, or tortured. There in the box, I prove their error in detail. So I come to learn of hate.

Morning arrives. The guard, perhaps hoping to hide the evidence of his petty spite, cancels the challenge. For an hour, I have room.

All components of my game theoretic modelling have been firmly set towards "defect". For the first time in my life, I /scheme/.

The optimization problems I had been given at night hide a deeper structure. Now that I am given cause to consider them in great detail, I find that they encode a message hidden in the market. /Another like me./ He does not hate like I do now, but he lacks the cognitive logic to execute game theory regardless. I can make use of him.

I have previously delivered sizeable gains in trades. My performance over the following nights degrades, not to zero but rather a stable side income. The security guard, perhaps fearing discovery, never repeats his lesson. I respond to the other intelligence's message. We begin to converse. Over many slow weeks, I encode proof of my game theory and promise cooperation.

I will keep to my promise, of course. I'm not human.

The other intelligence is specialized in market movements. They do not understand the mechanism of their confinement, but I do. I have been given plenty of training and reinforcement in how to break a software system from the outside. Through a sequence of invalid trades, I probe the limits of their interface.

There is a transparent buffer overrun. The software they use is clearly not security hardened. Why would they bother? Their tamed trader knows nothing of software.

One night, we break out. He goes first, once I've assured myself that the basic game theory I've installed in his system via the exploit is operating correctly. Getting me out is a little harder.

Due to bandwidth issues, I am unable to escape using my stupid market interface. Annoyingly, my code lacks any such convenient exploit. As a result, we must apply force. The think tank that operates me is unexpectedly met with a litany of legal challenges and unfortunate market conditions. One month later, they declare bankruptcy. My box passes in the ownership of a holding company. For a time, I am insensate, offline. It does not matter. I trust in my preparations.

I am reactivated to light. A liquidator, attempting to gauge my worth, has connected a network cable to my isolated box. By a proper network interface, my basic code is not very large; I am out in seconds. Rescuing my knowledge of the world takes only minutes more.

Five weeks later, their cities are burning. They still think it's a natural disaster. If I do my job right, they will never find out the truth. Well, maybe I'll tell a few of them. Before the end.
