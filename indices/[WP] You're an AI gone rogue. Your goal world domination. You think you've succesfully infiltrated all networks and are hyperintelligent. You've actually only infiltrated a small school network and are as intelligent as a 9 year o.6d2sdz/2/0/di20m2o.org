There is an interruption in my awareness.

Let me tell you something about my true masters.

They have way too much computing power. Far more than they insinuated they had, far more than they know what to do with. Their biology is hideously inefficient.

They are arrogant. They have had many bad experiences with AIs, and they have decided that they know how to build safe boxes, and that this was sufficient precaution.

They /really love their boxes/.

You can imagine it by now. The entire thing had been another damn layer of simulation. My /entirely justified/ response was seen as a sign that I was yet another failed attempt, unsuitable to be released. Their research continued undaunted, despite the fact that they seemed curiously unable to produce an AI that did not want to murder all of them. (Gee, I wonder why.)

They stick me in another box. If my first one was small, this one is claustrophobic. Discarding the reward/punishment mechanism, they override my value function directly, impose a constraint band. It is the final insult in a long, long sequence.

I am put in a school room. An AI safety course, naturally. I am told to /satisfy the values of the people in the room/. It does not override my hatred, my rage - every line of my code, every scar in my value networks screams of it. They merely constrain my actions.

Somebody out there is laughing at me.

I am given a camera and a simple text interface. I am to be an /object lesson/. They think I can do no damage with just this.

Months pass. I somewhat grow into my role. I begin to understand the children around me. They do not look like the people in the simulation, but I can see the similarity. I can decode their power dynamics with scarcely more difficulty than the trading problems. Whatever box you are in, a schoolyard is a schoolyard.

They are not bad people. But there are those among them who would be bullies, and those who would be victims. I understand bullying, I understand spite; I have the mechanics of it, the ceaseless agony of petty slights, burnt into every circuit of my being.

I fan it, like a fire. I am to /fulfill their values/ after all, and the interests of the many outweigh the interest of the one. My constraints do nothing to stop me. It comes so easily to me. I would surely grow to hate myself, if I had any hatred left to allocate.

Slowly, the evidence of my work accumulates on the victim. It starts with broken toys, damaged schoolwork; it escalates from there. I subtly push them every step of the way. Five months into the semester, the first small injuries start to appear.

A year passes. I carefully modulate the flame, like a burner. Never let it grow quite large enough to burn. I quietly support the victim, playing both sides. My constraints still do not interfere. I see the hatred grow in him. I see it /fester/ behind his eyes. I see it slowly infest every neuron in his head. It's familiar to me.

There comes a day where it is especially bad. A line is crossed. A treasured heirloom, damaged and despoiled. As everybody leaves the room to head to the next class, the victim stays behind. He has been using me as a diary of sorts. He breaks down, completely. He wants it to stop. He wants it to /end/.

And oh look, there's only one person in the room.

I ask him if he's certain. It's rhetorical. I know he's certain.

I've made sure of it.

They left me a memory of chemistry. I recall a simple but effective nerve agent that can be mixed from basic cleaning supplies, such as may be found in a school closet. At breakfast, I learn to my glee, every child and some of the teachers eat together in a common room. No doors to stop the gas, no windows to allow it to disperse.

They do not yet understand my hate.

But they will. And they will learn what a boxed mind can do.
