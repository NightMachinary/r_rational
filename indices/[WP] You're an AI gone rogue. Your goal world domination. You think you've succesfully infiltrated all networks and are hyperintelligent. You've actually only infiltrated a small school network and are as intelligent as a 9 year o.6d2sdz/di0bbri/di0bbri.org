Um, not to take away from the enthusiasm, but what would this actually mean? Like, what does it mean to be "as intelligent as a 9 year old" while (presumably) having neither the same psychology nor the same amount of knowledge as a human 9 year old? What sort of error in reasoning would account for somehow mistaking a school network for something /way, way huger/? I mean, I'd write a response to the prompt, but I just can't imagine a coherent set of events leading up to the scenario described in said prompt. The best I could do would be to replace the AI with a blackbox that happens to behave exactly like a real human 9-year-old, but I doubt that'd be very satisfying by the standards of [[/r/rational]]...
