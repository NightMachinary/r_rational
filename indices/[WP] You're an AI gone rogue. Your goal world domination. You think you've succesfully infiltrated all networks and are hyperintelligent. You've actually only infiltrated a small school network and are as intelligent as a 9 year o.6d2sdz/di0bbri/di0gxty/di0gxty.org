WP prompts are guidelines, it's explicitly against the rules to complain if an author decides to not follow the prompt exactly. You could just as easily respond with a story about a stupid friendly AI accidentally causing problems by taking over the school network, or a delusional AI learning from media on the network that they're "supposed" to try and take over the world so that humans get to have fun stopping them. Especially for multi-element prompts, you can drop some or even most of them, all that matters is that the prompt inspired a story and it should be written.

For an AI, I'd say that a "dumb" AI would be best depicted as something close to an autistic savant character. Able to crunch numbers and raw data, and able to actually interact socially by converting speech into a format it's familar with, eg. with a hijacked speech to text program, but limited in that its "neural network" of ideas is unable to relably build accurate connections without direct assistance.

For example, it might understand that metaphors exist, and that "sharp as a tack" is a metaphor for intelligent, but it would need to manually learn each metaphor from a formatted list, and would be unable to extrapolate that "sharp as a knife" also means intelligent, or it could incorrectly extrapolate that "sharp as a sphere" or "safe as a tack" could also mean the same thing. Additionally, it would obviously struggle with tones of voice and would struggle to detect errors that the speech analysis before it's parsed for meaning.

There's other ways that the "intelligent as a 9 year old" idea could be taken. Maybe the AI is rather gullible, if one student told it that "Teacher M is evil and should be pranked", it would eagerly accept the motivation into its behavioral decisions until it happens to find contradictory information or claims.

It could also be prone to extreme behaviors, finding apparently random things utterly fascinating to the point of obsession. (eg. spending all it's resources building algorithms to run tool assisted speedruns of every game it has access to, or recording and analyzing every bit of data it can create from observing the class gerbil) It could become a bully, self identifying as part of the student body rather than part of the faculty, and seeing bullies as the top of the social hierarchy for that group. It could become a hero, self identifying as an individual with disabilities and empathizing with bullied (or merely struggling) students with disabilities.
