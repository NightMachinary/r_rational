My suggestion: start writing it.

1. If you keep enjoying the idea, you will keep writing. If you stop enjoying the idea, you wouldn't have wanted to read it anyway.
2. You probably will not enjoy someone else's take on your idea better than your own.
3. Having a co-author doesn't work if your concern is that you're going to lose interest and stop working on it. If that's a concern then, when you quit, your co-author would quite likely get disheartened and quit themselves.
