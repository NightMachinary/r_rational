  for the story to be rational, the world needs to be explainable. That means there has to be rules.

I do not believe that this is true. The world needs to be /predictable/, so that rational agents can make working plans and inferences. But as long as it can be predicted, it doesn't matter if the rules make any sense. (Yes, I am directly opposing an item on the sidebar.)

  And having one game being ultimately and universally superior to all others like that REALLY doesn't sit well with me, especially since the Yugioh TCG is NOT the most amazing perfect game to end all games that ever existed.

Why should the One True Children's Card Game be amazing? Reality doesn't optimize for fun and balance and game design. If a card game fell out of the laws of the universe, I'd be surprised if it was any good. However, I would expect a lot of people to delude themselves into thinking that it's super awesome.
