True, there are 2 different GX timelines. The manga is far, far less high concept (and far more coherent), so you'd probably have an easier time going with that. I'm curious what elements from the anime you plan on incorporating, because if you're skipping over most of its major elements to begin with I don't see why you'd want to bother with it much in the first place.

Secondly, yes, the world does need to be explainable. The whole "everything comes down to card games" thing wasn't really the crux of my argument, but It's still rather key. If you're making a Yugioh story, you pretty much NEED to have things come down to some sort of game-based showdown. Otherwise it's not really Yugioh. Come up with logical reasons for it, sure (the series already tries to do that to some extent), but don't dismiss it.

Third, let's assume that Duel Monsters isn't cosmically important. Alright. In that case I guess you could go with how the original manga did things for a time; with shadow games being applied to ANY game, not just Duel Monsters. Though I should note you've just cut out like 80% of the series' worldbuilding in one stroke. What is so bad about the card game having cosmic significance? You're working with a world where magic definitely exists anyway, and that's contrived all on its own, so I don't see why that magic system can't take things a step further by revolving around one particular thing. I think that makes the setup for the story more distinctive and interesting myself.

Fourth. GX isn't a Duel Monsters theocracy. Duel Monsters seems to be more analagous to a popular sporting event in their world. It's near-ubiquitous, but for the most part I don't think it has much to do with the government or how laws work.
