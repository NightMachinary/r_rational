Yeah you're right. Save that for someone who wants to make a rational Yugioh 5d's fic. Also, the game doesn't have to be universally cosmically significant, just on Earth. If we go with the whole "Universe operating on laws of game theory" idea, as well as the whole "Duel monsters only became cosmically significant on Earth because of Pegasus's experiment gone wrong," then the case could be made that Duel Monsters can still be central to the plot without being the center of the whole universe. Maybe that experiment gone wrong could have happened to any other game, but coincidentally on Earth it happened to Duel Monsters first.

What I'm currently thinking is that regular physics (or something similar to it) would be a neutral baseline configuration of reality, and the rules can be temporarily changed from that baseline to other kinds of games within a limited space. When such a game resolves, the rules return to the baseline rules.
