First of all, there are multiple Yugioh Gx timelines, and I'm not going to necessarily stick to the anime canon as is. My inspiration is partially drawn from the anime, and from the manga. However, I think the biggest inspiration will likely end up being Cypsiman2's almost-semi-rational take on Yugioh Gx:

Second of all, for the story to be rational, the world needs to be explainable. That means there has to be rules. Nothing of the plot demanded this. And having one game being ultimately and universally superior to all others like that REALLY doesn't sit well with me, especially since the Yugioh TCG is NOT the most amazing perfect game to end all games that ever existed. Not only would that be extraordinarily contrived, it reminds me too much of how people perceive and react to their favorite sports and sports teams. To a very large extent it's a form of religion. If the story world is going to be to some extent a Duel Monsters theocracy, I'd rather not pretend that's a good thing.
