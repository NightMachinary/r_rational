Hmm. I'm not so sure about the Heart of the Cards thing. That kind of validates the whole idea that Duel Monsters is somehow supernaturally and inexplicably superior to all other games, the "King of Games", so to speak. And that's just impossible. There are plenty of awesome games in real life that are on par with and IMO are even better than the Yugioh TCG. Duel Monsters is cool, but it's not the best most perfect amazing game ever. And a lot of its ideas were originally from Magic: the Gathering, anyway.

Maybe "Heart of the Cards" is propaganda invented by the upper class in order to justify their power. Basically, it's the idea that good, righteous people care for their cards and because of that their cards will respond to their wishes, while wicked people who mistreat their cards will not get good draws.
