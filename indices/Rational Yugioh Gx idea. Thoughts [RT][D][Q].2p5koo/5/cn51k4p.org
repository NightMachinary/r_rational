I've started writing it, but got stuck before the first duel. Here's a description of the problem I encountered:

- Elemental hero decks pretty much all rely on elemental hero stratos, and elemental hero stratos is WAY overpowered, and was banned.

As such, I'm not even sure it's possible for Jaden to use elemental heroes as his main deck if I want this story to work. I have an idea for a deck that uses “HERO Flash!!”, a spell card that allows normal elemental hero monsters to attack directly. I have no idea whether it's good enough to be competitive or even viable though. I'm going to have to test it a bit before I start writing the first duel. It has no fusion monsters in the extra deck, since fusion monsters are always effect monsters, not normal monsters.

- This deck has Elemental Hero Neos in it, and there is no way to make it work without him, even though I really want to just ignore the Neo-Spacians. As cypsiman2 put it, Jaden

“...will not be travelling to Hippy-Space to meet with the Hippy-Space dolphins to learn about his Hippy-Space Destiny and then use his Hippy-Space powers to summon the Hippy-Space Guyver and his friends the Hippy-Space aliens to defeat the Hippy-Space radiation and save the Hippy-Space universe.”

At least, I hope he won't. I really hope he won't. I'm thinking of replacing Elemental Hero Neos with another fanmade normal elemental hero monster with the same stats and no contact fusion. Contact fusion is a lot more powerful than regular fusion, and the ONE DOWNSIDE that evens things out, the “returns to the extra deck at the end of turn” effect, is NEGATED by the field spell, “Neos Space”! The neo-spacians overshadow elemental heroes with their no-need-for-polymerization “Contact Fusion” which didn't start with them btw, the VWXYZ union machine monsters ALSO fuse without polymerization, although the fusion materials get banished instead of being sent to the graveyard, and the resulting fusion monsters STAY ON THE FIELD without another spell to keep them there.

- I'm starting to wonder if I should just keep the metagame as it is in real life. There's bound to be countless problems like this everywhere I look. I'm just worried that if I use the real life metagame, there might be plot inconsistencies. After all, the rarities of cards in the anime are wildly different to real life. Everyone in real life wants to play the cards that are one-of-a-kind in the anime. I cannot imagine how different the anime metagame would be if it were real, assuming such a metagame actually is possible. I suspect Kazuki Takahashi, the original author of Yugioh, as well as the anime writers, weren't all that familiar with the Yugioh CCG's metagame, or metagames in general.

What do you guys think I should do?
