Well, I haven't fleshed it out much, just a bunch of ideas in my head, some of them more tentative than others. For one thing, any smart character in the story, as soon as they first learn about the shadow games, should consider the implications of a game that resembles a fight but isn't actually a real fight, which their entire school uses as a means of conflict resolution (in fact that's one of the school rules!), and which, in the case of many shadow games, is actually used as a substitute for fighting to the death. So hypotheses where the shadow games were created as a substitute for normal fighting will have an advantage. Not entirely sure where I can or want to go with that. The only consistent and remotely feasible explanation I've been able to come up with so far is that it was a mad god's insane and ridiculous idea for keeping the universe from being destroyed by interstellar wars among sentient species by attempting to entirely replace wars and other violent conflict between large groups of people with something less far-reaching in its consequences. Maybe the shadow games originated because humans exploited a loophole in the rules. Or maybe they were there all along, but are being abused.

Still, this explanation seems kind of clunky and ungraceful. However, I'm not sure i actually have any better options, since the world of yugioh seems to behave with completely normal physics wherever and whenever Duel Monsters is NOT involved.

Of course, now that I think of it, I could also try something like that one Neon Genesis Evangelion fanfic where souls exist and operate on a different set of physical laws, and what happened to Duel Monsters with the shadow games is the result of a soul-mechanics experiment gone wrong. Maybe Pegasus was doing some research on it?

Or with the original idea, it could have the God character be something like Haruhi from EY's Suzumiya Haruhi fanfic.

Or maybe I could combine both ideas! Pegasus does an experiment in soul mechanics and accidentally soul-ifies the Duel Monsters card game, as well as accidentally creating the Gods as well as the God cards!
