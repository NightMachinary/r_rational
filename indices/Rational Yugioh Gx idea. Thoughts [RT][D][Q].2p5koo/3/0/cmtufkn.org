I don't think the monsters should be truly sentient, nor have too much independence from their summoners. Let's not forget that even soul-ified, they're still trading cards. I would imagine that if they have some kind of mind-like capabilities, that wouldn't necessarily change their terminal value as components of a trading card game.

Perhaps the soul-ified cards absorb some sort of soul-energy from their summoners to materialize?

As for the gun scenario, if the game itself is soul-efied, that could perhaps include the rules of the game, which means if someone breaks the rules it's like violating laws of soul-physics. Could cause a paradox between soul-physics and normal physics or something like that.

Yeah. Magic would have to exist. Probably something similar but not quite the same as the magic in Saga of Soul. Or... and this will sound a little weird, maybe this story's universe, on a fundamental level, operates on the laws of game theory, and regular physics is the Minecraft-ish baseline configuration for reality. Or something like that.
