I would love a rational YGO GX fic. Imagine a character that simply plays the meta instead of flavour of the week/asspull monster of the episode.you know, someone who calculates odds ratios and works out combinations in the deck that actually work, and isn't above using cards from other decks.

Or you could have a practical!evil character that uses scramblers to stop the opponent from activating traps at the crucial moment... or pulls a gun on someone who tries to kill him in a shadow game.

We can go even more rational. Creatures with souls you say? Has anyone considered the fact that when you summon a monster....nothing is forcing you to play the game? You can have the monster solve problems for you. A summonable, use-anywhere anyhow sentient computer with absolute loyalty to the summoner. But... Where does the energy come from? Calculating is work, and the summoned monsters run on nothing... Maybe Jaden realises from that that magic actually exists...
