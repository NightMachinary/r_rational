I really like the Yugioh game. I've watched the original anime completely, and have recently begun watching GX from the beginning on Crunchyroll. So I don't know where the GX storyline goes after the first few episodes.

I would not make Jaden lose his love of the game. Instead I would flesh out Bastian as someone who is incredibly intelligent and is planning to use his intellect to become the best duelist for money and for fame. Better, to become a great scientist. And good dueling stkills are important for anyone who wants to become anyone in any field.

In general, things to address:

- Holodeck technology is invented and is only used to make duelling more spectacular-looking
- 'Heart of the cards' is an actual thing. Jaden figured out as a kid that cards he likes are more likely to come up when he needs them. The probabilities don't work out as they should, unless he plays with somebody else's deck. Of course, he figures this out by playing thousands of games and keeping careful track of everything. Since then Jaden has done every psychological trick in the book to feel closer to his cards, like giving them names and acting out conversations.
- Duelists don't show off by explainging their cards to each other. If they say anything, it's that they should have studied harder.
- The side deck should be more important, and powerful duelists should have more than one deck depending on circumstances.
- in the anime rare cards are a really big deal, but the whole world duels, so most people will have the same kind of non-rare cards.
- in general, dueling is a really big deal. Law cases can be fought out with duels, most sports are hobbies compared to dueling, political battles are fought out with duels. It's a cultural thing, but also it's believed that the righteous win more duels than the wicked.
- Jaden is on a quest to document every single card in existence, to share with everyone in an easily searchable online format (Pokedex). It annoys him that most of the information is locked away from non-academy students, and even then from everyone but full graduates. Basically, he wants to make the Yugioh wiki. The school's director on the other hand is a brilliant professor who believes that the information should indeed remain secret, because society structure would collapse if the lower class would so easily learn the strategies to defeat the upper class. Wars would break out. Better to keep the status quo. Except of course lower classes are kinda miserable, with all technology and advances going to duelling and making it look more fun.

Probably the stakes should be a little higher and tie in a bit better with the actual anime, but these are my first thoughts on it.
