What surface rules? You mean the rules that make one particular game significant? What does "game theory," even mean in this context. It's regular definition refers to a category of study.

How does the world being centered around one game make the story less self consistent and explainable? The universe giving some sort of special significance to games is already an extremely bizarre setup. Making it centered around one game doesn't make things more contrived in any significant way. In fact, one could say that it's more bizarre if the universe gave special significance to all sorts of games, rather than just one.

I mean if you want to make Duel Monsters just some game, yes, that does throw out most of what the anime established in any of its series. You'd be sticking largely to the manga doing it your way, which isn't a bad thing, but that once again leaves the question of what you're hoping to accomplish here. As far as coming up with a rational explanation for why everything comes down to a card game, sticking to the manga actually leaves you further away from a cohesive answer.

To the best of my recollection, Pegasus has no good reason why he can't just print an "I win" card to defeat Yugi. Marik never tries to spring his death traps without challenging Yugi to a game first. Tragoedia explicitly says right before the final showdown that he is only dueling because he feels like it.

Conversely, the anime tends to attempt to have a reason for why the villains take the actions they do. Kagemaru needed to harness energy that's released from dueling. Saiou/Sartorious needed to control the wills of others, and his powers required that they first be defeated for his control to take hold. The Duel Monsters Spirit World had the whole "losing in a duel means death" rule built into it from the start, and refusal to play meant your opponent would just physically summon their monsters and attack you with them. Etc.

Is it contrived? Yes. But it's a different kind of contrived than the original often was. In the anime you're left wondering why the universe works the way it does, but the character's reasons for dueling make sense (well, sorta. They could definitely use some added ingenuity, and there's sometimes still the problem of why they don't use more traditional weapons, but you usually get why they're bothering with dueling in the first place because it will solve their problems). In the manga the antagonists make everything come down to duels for little discernible reason.
