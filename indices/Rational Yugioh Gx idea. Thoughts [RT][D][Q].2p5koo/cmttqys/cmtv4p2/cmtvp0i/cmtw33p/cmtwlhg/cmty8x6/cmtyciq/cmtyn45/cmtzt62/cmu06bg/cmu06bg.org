Um, the idea's not that the experiment drastically altered the fundamental laws of reality. It's that the Universe would already fundamentally run on the laws of game theory, and that wouldn't change. But the apparent "surface" rules would always be changeable (maybe modular would be a better word) and no one knew about it before the experiment. And it's not merely a matter of unfairness. It's a matter of wanting the world of the story to be self-consistent and explainable.

And what do you mean, throwing out most of the yugioh's worldbuilding? You mean the speech the eldritch abomination gave at the end of the gx anime series, or the whole Duel spirit realm thing that didn't even exist in the original manga anyways because it actually contradicted the canonical origins of duel monsters in ancient egypt?

And while I liked the original yugioh series, the ridiculously extreme lack of cultural or historical accuracy in regards to ancient egypt is appalling. I'm still thinking I'll still use a lot of the original series' worldbuilding. There will just be some changes and some different explanations for how things happened.
