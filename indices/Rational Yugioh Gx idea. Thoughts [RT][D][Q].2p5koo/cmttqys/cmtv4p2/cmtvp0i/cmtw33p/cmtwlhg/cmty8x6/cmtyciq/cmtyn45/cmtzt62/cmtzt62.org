So one person ran an experiment, and somehow that either drastically altered the laws of reality for an entire planet, or allowed for those laws to be situationally altered at certain times. And this is arbitrarily only for earth. That seems even more contrived than the universe always being centered around one game.

...I don't see the significance of what you're trying to prove. Yes, Yugioh isn't the most well constructed game in existence, but it is probably the best game to ever exist in the context of the Yugioh-verse. It's consistently said to be extremely skillful and enjoyable, a game that incorporates strength of will as well as the player's own emotions. And I must reiterate, you're considering throwing out most of Yugioh's worldbuilding just because you think it's unfair that Duel Monsters in particular was the game that had the world centered around it.
