Heart of the Cards is definitely something that exists in the anime. That's pretty much impossible to deny. Pretty much every duel we see involves some level of statistical improbability that only makes sense if some sort of power is at work apart from mere luck.

And beyond that, there are tons of things that show Duel Monsters has some incredible cosmic significance; people's inner spirits take the form of monsters which tend to have a card that corresponds to them. Most conflicts ultimately come down to the card game,for some reason or another. There's an actual Duel Monsters Spirit World. People dueling each other sometimes give off potent energy that can be harnessed. Powerful ancient beasts take the form of cards even before the game was invented. And according to a certain eldritch abomination that shows up in season 4, the entire multi-verse began from a single spirit that existed within a card.
