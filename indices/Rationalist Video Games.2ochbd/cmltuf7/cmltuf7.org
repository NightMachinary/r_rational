Does anyone think [[http://miegakure.com/][Miegakure]] might qualify? It hasn't been released yet, but its premise is about experiencing a 4D world which can teach us how to understand new systems of logic in an intuitive way, which can be helpful for rational thought in my opinion. Granted, I am biased by the fact I think it's beneficial for anyone to play it.

Of course if I'm going to be recommending great mind-expanding, time-sucking video games, then people have to play:

[[http://www.antichamber-game.com/][Antichamber]]

[[http://braid-game.com/][Braid]]

[[http://fezgame.com/][Fez]]

[[http://playdead.com/limbo/][Limbo]]

[[http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/portal.html][Portal]]

[[http://qube-game.com/][Q.U.B.E.]]

[[http://the-witness.net/][Witness]] -Not out yet.

They are all good puzzle games with interesting twists on the puzzling aspects. But I don't think they are necessarily teaching anything in terms of rationality.
