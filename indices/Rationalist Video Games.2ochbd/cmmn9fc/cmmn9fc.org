In Far Cry 4, hardly a realistic look at anything otherwise, if you simply [[#s][do the logical thing]], you get to immediately complete your stated objective, leave the country peacefully, live what ones imagines is a long life in the developed world without eagles the size of flying pitbulls trying to eat your face, and you (the player) win the game.
