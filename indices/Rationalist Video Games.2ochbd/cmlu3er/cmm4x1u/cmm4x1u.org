The reason that's the case is that most videogames are about the experience of playing the game, rather than a narrative. When the player can only meaningfully interact with the world down the barrel of a gun and can't speak (or at best, only have three or four conversational options), you're not left with much. There are a lot of strategies that game makers employ to get around this inherent separation of narrative and play, but it's /really/ hard to do successfully, and most of the time the game makers don't even try. I really like /Bioshock/ as a narrative and as a game, but there's so much of a disconnect between the narrative elements and the gameplay elements (a disconnect that got a lot worse in /Bioshock Infinite/).

With that said, there are a /lot/ of games that encourage better (and different) thinking merely by virtue of their gameplay elements.
