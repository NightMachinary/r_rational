I wouldn't call it rational or even HSF but Dead Space is like a horror story where the protag is actually trying to stay alive:

-wears high tech hazard suit meant for work on space stations

-uses power tools to cut limbs of undead

-stomps enemy on the ground (game rewards stomping corpses, zombies sometimes get up)

-scavenges materials and supplies to build better weapons and armor

bonus points:

-has limited telekinesis, can't grab enemy but can grab spikes, circular saws and explosives and shot them at enemy at high speeds

-has limited time stop spells, can shot at enemy and stuff but it uses ammo

To be fair though, he is an engineer and superpowers are available for everyone. Also his first contact with the zombie ship was on a routine scavenge mission or something like that. And his armor is standard package for all engineers anyway.
