I don't know of any rationalist games, but there are many that inspire strategic munchkinry and are at least a little bit realistic. In Crusader Kings 2, for example, you control a medieval state and can arrange alliances, swear fealty to an empire, convert pagans, marry into another country's dynasty with the intent of gaining a claim on the throne, kidnap another country's heir and indoctrinate them to follow your religion and culture before releasing them, etc. Of course, in most games fun mechanics are prioritized over realism.

There are also some games where the conflict is because of differing beliefs and values instead of good or evil and the characters are creative in solving their problems. Tales of the Abyss did a pretty good job of this, in my opinion. The villain just had a different opinion on the best course of action to save humanity, and the characters were pretty creative in manipulating the magic system of their world to solve their problems, though the magic system itself was never fully explained. Nier did an excellent job with the characters' and villains' motivations, though the characters never really used creative approaches to solving their problems. Devil Survivor was good on both fronts depending on which choices you made; the differences between the Law and Chaos factions were more about security vs freedom than good vs evil, and the characters, especially Atsuro, were fairly creative in figuring out ways to survive.
