[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/][Antichamber]] felt the most 'exploring the science behind a world you don't understand the rules to' of any puzzle games I've played. It had a number of consistent rules and followed them pretty well, and identical objects encountered more than once behaved similarly, so you could learn the 'rules' of the fictional world. I really liked the game. Functionally no plot, though. Also, depending on player skill and completionism it can take up to ~3 hours to solve the main sequence of puzzles and then another ~2-3 for all optional puzzles - probably best to buy when on sale.

[[http://www.gog.com/game/the_swapper][The Swapper]] is a really fun puzzle game that raised a few interesting questions about identity, duplication, and continuity of consciousness; It didn't, however, really address any of those questions that it raised in any coherent manner, and the puzzles are interesting but not in any really rationalist manner. It also had a really awesome aesthetic. You should expect ~2-3 hours of gameplay.

[[http://www.gog.com/game/planescape_torment][Planescape: Torment]] was one of the more philosopically interesting games I've played. A huge portion of the game is resolved through talking and the like, the combat and so forth is an incredibly minor concern. It's quite well written, and has a bunch of fairly interesting/neat ideas. Not really rationalist in any way, but still interesting in the sort of way that I imagine [[/r/rational]] likes than most games. Playtime correlates well to reading speed, takes perhaps 15-40 hours to clear playing blind (a lot of optional content).
