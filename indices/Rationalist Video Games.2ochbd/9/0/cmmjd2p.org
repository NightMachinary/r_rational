I felt Antichamber was flawed as a game for the same reasons that make it relatively rational; it starts out as a weird stream of 'What the hell is going on?' where you can't rely on anything to stay the same when you look away, but as it goes on the rules stay consistent and it loses the main appeal,which was the incomprehensibility of the early game.
