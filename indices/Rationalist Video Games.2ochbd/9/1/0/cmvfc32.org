I felt that more about things like the cube-moving puzzles which use mechanics you work out for yourself, and the other cube manipulation puzzles. A lot of the scenery also repeats (eye-walls; spheres of birds that eat local scenery; trip lasers; etc). You learn the mechanics and how they work, then apply them to solving various puzzles. Solving the fill in greens puzzles, them moving yellows puzzles, etc. It felt much more like I was learning a weird universe with little connection to our own than many other great puzzle games do.

The fact that everything is connected in a nonstandard way and that there are connections in weird ways is not particularly difficult to deal with, but it is neat aesthetically.
