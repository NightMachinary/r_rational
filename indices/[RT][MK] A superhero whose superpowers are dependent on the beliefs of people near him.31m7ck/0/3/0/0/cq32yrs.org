I don't think it's too big of a leap, though, to metaphysically differentiate between "thoughts that my unconscious mind supplies" and "thoughts that your mind has planted in mine." I feel like creating the kind of feedback loop suggested above would be more akin to using your hands to pull up your feet, then lifting your legs to pull your arms, then continuing this until you're flying in the air.
