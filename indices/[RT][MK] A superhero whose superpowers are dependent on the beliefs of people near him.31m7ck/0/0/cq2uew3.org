I'm assuming there's a limit on how powerful he can be.

This would have been an excellent super-villain character in Worm.

EDIT: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/31ki80/wp_you_are_placebo_man_your_superpowers_are/cq2wi40][Here's]] what the author had to say on the power limitations

  I didn't think of meta-powers like believing in infinite range. Clever, but I'd say no, his power is exploitable enough as it is. Believers have to be within the same room or a bit further - close enough that he can make use of powers near a group of enemies, far enough that he doesn't keep his powers between encounters. Having two conflicting beliefs is an interesting case, I'd say it goes by simple majority. Needing a majority would probably be the main limit on his powers. It would mean that he works best on small groups. Until he's established enough that people know him by reputation, fighting in a crowd will get his power drowned out by people saying "Placebo Man? Never heard of him."
