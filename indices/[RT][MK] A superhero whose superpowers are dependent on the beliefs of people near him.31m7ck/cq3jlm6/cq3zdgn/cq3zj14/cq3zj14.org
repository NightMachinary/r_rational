My take on Jenny's power is that it's more about groupthink than singlethink.

Cults are typically conditioned to a uniformity that a normal group of people wouldn't be.

Let's assume that someone is attracted to Jenny, and her power starts to make her flirt with them. To everyone else, that would be Very Not Awesome, because THEY want to sleep with her instead. Her power would then make her into a flirt, who kept everyone thinking they might get lucky.

If she were around a single person, that might be an issue. She seems to try to stay around groups though, [[#s][except]]
