Poor Jenny. The power makes her miserable because it's always on. It also makes her very vulnerable to people who have been conditioned. Jenny would be the absolute last hero you would send to go deal with a cult, for example, because she would join it instantly if surrounded by enough true believers.

And, inside her own head, as her power made her do whatever cult-y things she was doing, she would be perfectly aware of what is going on.

It's actually a rather frightening power.
