Use the fabricator to create a fabricator that does the same things as the original just without the limitations. If that isn't possible, create a seed that grows into a fabricator. If that isn't possible, create a document that details the steps needed to create a fabricator. If that isn't possible, modify yourself to have a fabricator built into your body. If that isn't possible, modify yourself to have knowledge of the theory behind this technology, and develop fabricators from there. If that isn't possible, just create tools that let you analyse technology and study the workshop. There are probably many more ways, point is to use the technology provided to be able to create more of it. In a location more convenient for you and without the pesky limitations.

Then create versions of the respawn-platform and the telepathy without limitations, and from there move on to more advanced technologies. You'll want to make yourself basically immortal more so than the technology does. See below for some of the things to guard yourself against. You'll also want to make yourself a lot smarter, which is tricky because it can change what you want on a very basic level. You'll need to be careful. Ask the machine for documents with a proper theory of Friendliness (the AI safety version, not human social friendliness) and then make sure you adhere to that while modifying yourself. Also make sure your modified machines adhere to that - it's a much more sensible restriction than the original ones. Heck, it might be a good idea to hack all the workshops and change the restrictions there too. And while you're at it, modify all humans to adhere to basic Friendliness as well (though it is possible that your theory of Friendliness won't let you do that, depending on the details. In that case, you can do this first, before changing yourself. It does modify everybody against their will, but it makes the world safe. And with quite dangerous technology suddenly introduced that is essential).

But first, how can you get something that allows you to harm somebody (such as a fabricator without limitations) without wanting to harm somebody? Simple, you don't think through what you'll want to use that thing for. It's just intent based, not whether the item is dangerous (because everything is technically dangerous with enough creativity).

And finally, what threats are there to you? (aka how to take out somebody protected by the technology mentioned above with the technology mentioned above) The first thing to note is that killing them is counter productive. The machine will just fix that. So you need to stop just short of killing them. As long as they don't die, they won't respawn. You'll need some technology to keep people alive - which the fabricators in the workshops should be happy to provide, since it helps people and you intend to heal people with them. If fact, you don't even need to hurt people - just keep them in stasis or constantly knocked out. Anything where they are still alive but unable to act will do. This would also allow governments or other large organisations to control the workshops. Keep people out, and drag away anybody who just respawned to suspend them like this.

Other than this physical attack, there are mental and social options. If you manage to give somebody trauma, they will respawn with it. Make sure to create a self-sustaining network of mental problems, so that they don't want to fix these problems but rather want to retain or even expand them. How to do this? Well, let the fabricator give you detailed information about your target, detailed papers about trauma and its treatment, how to change somebody's mind, how to influence people... and then change your body to help with all that, emitting pheromones to be more convincing or something. I don't really know what would be useful, none of this is really my area of expertise. Which means that you could probably do a lot more than I've described here. For instance, I don't know how practically useful memetics can be, but in the extreme case you can just show them a specially prepared picture which implants whatever you want in this mind. Getting all of this could be a problem since you do intend to harm somebody - but there are ways around that. From the description, it seems to work on current intent. So just convince yourself to not want to harm them while you get the stuff. If that isn't enough, get the pod to change you into a version of yourself that doesn't want to harm them - having previously left notes to yourself about what you want to do and why. You may need a couple more layers of self-deception, but at some point you should be able to fool the workshop.

Alright, so how to defend against all of this? Well, have a version of yourself as a backup, and let the backup check your state of mind every hour or so. If the backup is okay with your state of mind, keep going. Otherwise reset. This works against somebody changing your mind, through memetics or otherwise. Give your mind an option to transport yourself to a safe location. The extreme version being to kill yourself and respawn, if you can't figure something else out. Then you should have a deadmind switch - if your mind does not respond for a certain period of time, trigger the transport to a safe location. That covers people keeping you unconscious. Oh, and basics like making sure your body is stronger, faster, regenerates, more resilient, and can change at will.

That should cover the basics for how to exploit things, I think?
