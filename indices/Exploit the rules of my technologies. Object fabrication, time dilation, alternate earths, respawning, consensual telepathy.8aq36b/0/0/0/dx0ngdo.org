At first, nobody will know that. And you have to be willing to accept that the copy is you, and not:

1. just a copy who remembers being you.
2. some kind of soulless monstrosity.
3. a malicious agent (demon, alien, robot, whatever) pretending to be you.
4. #3, plus you actually get reborn as a bodiless oracle for the demon, aware all the time and helpless to actually communicate.

And even if you've worked through your own existential dilemma, you have to have the faith and courage to pull the trigger.

Centuries later there will still be people (whole societies of people) who refuse to accept "respawning" as anything but a terrible trick.
