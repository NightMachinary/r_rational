It seems highly unlikely to me that people who are that suspicious of the workshops are going to trust these "alternate earths" that can only be accessed through the workshops. The same people who believe people lose their souls when they respawn will probably believe parallel earths are literal Hell itself just waiting to swallow anyone who can be tempted.
