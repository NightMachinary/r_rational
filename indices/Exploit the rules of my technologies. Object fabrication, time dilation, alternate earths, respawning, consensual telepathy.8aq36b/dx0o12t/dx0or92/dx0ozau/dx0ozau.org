Space science, yes. And you can do things like A/B testing with alternate Marses and not worry about contamination. But that's not going to involve putting people into space (space travel). It's going to involve increasingly perfect robots.

Unless modifying ones biology in the workshops extends to turning oneself into a space probe, actual humans won't be going anywhere but sideways.

If those templates don't extend very far back in time that'll be annoying to no end of scientists.
