Most people who get into the space business don't do it for the mining or colonization itself. They do it for the scientific discoveries that await from finding and observing new things that don't even exist on earth. And those million million new earths are all very similar, duplicates off a few mundane templates. There's nothing to explore, there. No discoveries to be made.
