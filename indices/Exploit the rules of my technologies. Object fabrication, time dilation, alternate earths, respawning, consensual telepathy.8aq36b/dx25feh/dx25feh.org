- Anyone can, with great rapidity, move from anywhere to anywhere else. Countries that are already facing a refugee crisis are going to end up facing a /worse/ one as more and more people pour in.

- Borders no longer meaningfully exist. It may be impossible to travel through the Workshops with intent to harm, but it's not impossible to travel through the Workshops with intent to avoid jail time. (However, it seems like it will be impossible for the police to follow).

- If you want weapons and have intent to harm, you can't make them yourself. However, you can get Idiot Jim (who hit his head as a baby and is thus eternally naive and believes everything he's told) to go and get them for you. All major criminal gangs or terrorist groups suddenly have an Idiot Jim.

- Death is no longer permanent. If you want someone out of the way, you need to put them in a coma; if you want revenge, imprisonment and/or torture. These become things that people who would previously have committed murder do instead.

- People who attempt to commit suicide are (often, not always) less than happy about waking up back in one of the Workshops again.

- Some people see immortality as keeping them away from their well-deserved afterlife. These people are going to get more and more crabby as they get older.

- New Earths may start off empty of humans. This state of affairs will not be maintained for long; with death rates at zero and people still having children, the new Earths will be /very quickly/ colonised.

- Some people will change their appearance to match their favourite film actor or TV character. There will be thousands of clones of Famous Actor walking about; the /real/ Famous Actor will probably take a dim view of this. Especially given that they're all willing to act for a tenth of what he charges. Different Famous Actors will handle this differently.

- Some people will try to use the gene-editing booths to develop superpowers. Full-on Kryptonian powers are no doubt impossible, but super-sensitive hearing, bat-like echolocation or the ability to see ultraviolet will probably work. (Then you have to get used to it.)

- Instead of creating currency, what's stopping me from just creating whatever I would otherwise buy with it?
