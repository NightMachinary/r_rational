It will change your brain only enough to make it play nice with whatever species you decide to be. At the point that you're capable of living in your body, it'll then focus on getting you as close to a healthy human brain as it can. There is no option in the respawn chamber to just give you a giant superfast brain. If that's your goal, the chamber won't even open for you, because that's not what it's designed to do. It's designed to fix people when they break and reshape their body. It will only change the brain towards one of those ends, with preference to the first.
