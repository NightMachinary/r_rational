  Also I find it unlikely very many cult leaders would be able to use any of the workshop amenities for their cult, because they probably know what they're doing is going to harm the cult members in some way or another.

They don't know any such thing. They believe that it's for their own good. Fake cult leaders won't be able to do that, but there's plenty of leaders who genuinely believe in their religion.
