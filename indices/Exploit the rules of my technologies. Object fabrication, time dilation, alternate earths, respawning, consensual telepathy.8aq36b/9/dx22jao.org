If I go into one of those cubes, I can make my own bubble dimension with another progression of time?

Since I'm lazy, I save some money into different banks worldwide. Maybe take some loans I will not repay. I will buy some materials, like gold, or rare earth, platinum.

Then I will create a dimensional pocket with a slower time (As slow as possible/practical) with one portal to enter and one to leave. I will calculate how long I have to be in the pocket dimension, so I will be 20 years gone. (If the factor is 144, 50 days.Factor 3*10^{6} would be 3,5 minutes.)

I will take the stuff I want for that time, go through the portal. And leave than.

After I leave, I will sort the legal stuff out. (Probably many banks will have closed my accounts. I will be declared dead. And I need to declare bankruptcy, so I don't have to pay back the loans) And if my money is still worth something, I will buy new stuff like other rare earth elements, collectibles or I don't know consoles and iPads, designer stuff. And do it again. (Without the loans)

In the end, I will have traveled some hundred years into the future. There the technology will be better and peaceful, and hopefully, I am rich now. And if not I have rare stuff from some century ago and can sell it as retro. I will adapt to the world around me. And visit old friends, who should be immortal?

Honestly, you should probably limit your time dilation and the ability to produce stuff more. How about an energy limit? But since we are here in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] I suppose they all live in a simulation and so energy and materials and space can be simulated.

Alternate Earths: So if I were not so lazy and evil, I would duplicate the houses of rich/famous people in a faster pocket dimension. Search stuff like photos and computers. And blackmail them. I guess spybots would be prohibited.

Also, alternate earths shouldn't have animals on it (and plants). Or I could make a device that makes apes follow my command or make them loyal to me. And then have an instant army. Or I could have a dragon. It would circumvent the no living stuff rule of the replicators.

Also, the possible danger of a killer virus of an alternate earth, that other worlds hadn't been adapted to.

Telepathy: I would try to get to learn stuff matrix style. Just uploading it into the brain. Of course, I wouldn't test it on me. If I were evil, I would try to brainwash people. Or maybe I am a vegan who wants everyone to not be an asshole. Or a christian, who wants everyone to be safe from hell and the devil. So brainwashing would be in those cases morally acceptable for the washer. And yeah, brainwashing is probably to mean of a word. Just think instead "to convince others of my viewpoint". Telepathy is just secret messages, would be nice to have, but nothing world breaking. Maybe sex would be better, but not really world breaking. On the other hand, if Telepathy is undetectable, small soldier troops could use it for missions. Not really usable for secret missions. Also, judges and jury could make sure the right person comes into jail. The problem would be ideologies, brainwashing and making sure, those in a link aren't lying.

Respawning: I would jump from high places. I would try to make duplicates by reanimating bodies after they respawn. (Not mine, someone else's.) Oh and Snuff films.

The no harm another rule will be hard to enforce. Unless it only stops people with intent to harm (in self-defense or otherwise) to make stuff. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to make a car, or a kitchen knife, or tools, or anything solid, or anything that you can't breathe through. Can I trick people into making stuff, that could be used to hurt? Like a device to give people food. And I use it to poison people.
