I think if you asked any astronaut if they'd rather let a robot do their job, they'll probably tell you in polite words to fuck off. There's a reason astronaut is one of those stock dream jobs for little kids. There's an appeal to personally going to space and being there. And if anything the dissolution of the threat of death I would think would make far more people show an interest in boarding a rocket, just for the experience.
