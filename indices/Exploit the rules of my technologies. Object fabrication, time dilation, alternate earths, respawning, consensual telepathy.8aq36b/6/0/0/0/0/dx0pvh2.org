  I think if you asked any astronaut if they'd rather let a robot do their job, they'll probably tell you in polite words to fuck off.

Yeh, but what about the ten thousand people behind them they need to actually get up there? Even with improved technology, humans are horribly inefficient robots. For anything beyond the moon, you can send thousands of robots for the price of one meatbag and the life support needed.

Low Earth orbit, yeh, there will be space tourism there (in an alternate Earth where failed launches won't hurt anyone). MAYBE eventually the moon. I don't see the kind of life support you need to keep a meatbag alive all the way to mars being fundable without the colonization argument driving it.

Again, if you can alter people's biology enough they're not anything we'd really call biological any more, that'd make long distance missions with actual human minds plausible, but otherwise... no.
