I think people usually get involved in space missions, at least in part, because they want to go to space. "Price" and "fundable" cease to be as much of an issue when you can fabricate all the rocket parts and fuel you need. So yes, I think many more people would go to space than before, because the risk is negated and anyone willing to put the time in and follow some blueprints already has the means and opportunity to do so.
