  I think people usually get involved in space missions, at least in part, because they want to go to space.

And getting turned into a machine that can survive in space is the easiest way to do this.

  "Price" and "fundable" cease to be as much of an issue when you can fabricate all the rocket parts and fuel you need.

You're really underestimating the people cost, and since you don't let people replicate themselves, that's no less a cost (and probably more, since you're now competing with all the new frontiers you've opened up).

You still need thousands of people to put them together and support and manage the launch, and that's just for near Earth orbit. Lunar orbit, lunar landing, and going beyond cislunar space are even more expensive.
