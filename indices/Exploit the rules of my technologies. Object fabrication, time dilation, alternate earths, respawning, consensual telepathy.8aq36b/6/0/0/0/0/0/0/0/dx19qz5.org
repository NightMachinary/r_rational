I think that the fact that death and expenses don't matter vastly reduces the personnel cost. If a normal mission fails, you're out several billion dollars and the lives of the crew, and you have to institute cost capturing methods at every single point of the process.

In this world you point a giant bomb upwards and try again if it fails. Autonomous assembly will advance at an incredible rate, and all it takes is a large enough group of rocket geeks to come up with a solution.
