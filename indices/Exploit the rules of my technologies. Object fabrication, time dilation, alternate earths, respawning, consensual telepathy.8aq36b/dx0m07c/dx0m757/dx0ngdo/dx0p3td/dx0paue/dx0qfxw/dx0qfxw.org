History makes it pretty clear that convenience eventually wins. If a rule forces people to act in a way that they can recognize is unnecessarily difficult, most people will either just break the rule, or move to change the rule.

So with that in mind, how long are societies going to last that tell people to forgo the easily accessible thing that can provide them endless food, shelter, video games, heal any sickness, mental illness, or injury instantly, cure body dysphoria, reverse the aging process, travel to see the sights of the world, etc.?

In traditionalist cultures, teenagers rebel by holding seances or having unprotected sex or watching violent movies. They do these things often no matter how much their parents tell them they'll burn in Hell for it. In the culture you're talking about, teenagers rebel by opening personal rooms where they can form telepathy bonds and kill themselves.

You're right that a lot of people would be highly skeptical of one or another of the toys during the early time the story takes place. I'll bring up the idea with the rest of the writers.
