Centuries later, everyone who was around before will have respawned themselves. Even if grandpa raises you telling you how evil respawning is, when grandpa dies and respawns himself, you're probably going to question how evil it is. Especially if you and grandpa have a telepathy link so you can actually directly feel that he's the same ol' grandpa with the same ol' thoughts after. And eventually the skeptics will become so vastly outnumbered that it's just not practical to believe everyone else is evil zombies anymore.
