Well unless every government worldwide manages 100% containment, some dead people are going to leak out and be able to tell the news and internet. So they delay people gaining the information by a matter of days, maybe weeks at most. More propaganda-heavy states that regulate internet access like China maybe a little longer, but people in those places may also be more desperate and less skeptical when they hear the news.
