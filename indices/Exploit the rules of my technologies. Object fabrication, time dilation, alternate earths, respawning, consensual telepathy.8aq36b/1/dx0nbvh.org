So let's say person A really hates personal B. They hire Person C to commission parts fabrication for a taser (or even the taser themselves). Person A then tases the shit out of person B and then abducts them for a week of bonding time (aka torture) before sending them back to the respawn chamber with a fractured psyche.

Also time diliation and viruses make a dozen new super bugs that spread through the population.

New earths are used by cult leaders to brainwash and control their flock in isolation without consequences. As a symbol of their faith they have to go alter their biology to be more trusting.

Also there doesn't seem to be any challenges left in this society, everything is provided for them, and it's rxplicity stated that they will never be able to compete in technology with this othe race. I think people would los anything resembling humanity without significant brain modifications to the motivation centers.
