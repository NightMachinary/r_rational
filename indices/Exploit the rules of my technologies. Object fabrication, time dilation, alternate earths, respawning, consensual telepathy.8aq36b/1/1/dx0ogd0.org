Your first paragraph is possible, if Person B doesn't have any warning that they can use to pop into a workshop that won't let Person A follow. As soon as they're in a workshop, they can escape anywhere in the world, and Person A won't be able to deliberately follow through the workshops. They're also immortal, so they can spend however long it takes to recover from their experience.

Viruses in general stop being a major threat pretty quickly, because after people respawn their next body will have full immunities to anything they were exposed to.

I imagine it would be hard for cult leaders to control their flock when someone can walk a hundred kilometers (or kill themselves) and just gateway back to their own personal room, or regular society. Also I find it unlikely very many cult leaders would be able to use any of the workshop amenities for their cult, because they probably know what they're doing is going to harm the cult members in some way or another.

I don't know of any way to alter biology to make someone more trusting or compliant that wouldn't qualify as brain damage and/or chemical imbalance, and the respawn chambers wouldn't let people harm themselves in that way.

Once everyone acclimates to and accepts the workshops, things might get a little boring. You're right. That's why the story is about the early years, when people are still adjusting and learning. There's a huge amount of chaos in the shifting tides from one world to the next, and that's what the story's about.
