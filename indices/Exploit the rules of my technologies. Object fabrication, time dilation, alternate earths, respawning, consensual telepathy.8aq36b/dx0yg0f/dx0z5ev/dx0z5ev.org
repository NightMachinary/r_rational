The respawn chambers are only maybe double human-size, so you couldn't really make yourself into anything bigger than that. There are also a ton of safeties to ensure you're going to come out a functional creature with mobility, a digestive system, the whole shebang. And the brain can really only be deliberately changed to the extent that it'll let you control whatever body it's giving you. And it's all biological, there's no magic powers or anything.
