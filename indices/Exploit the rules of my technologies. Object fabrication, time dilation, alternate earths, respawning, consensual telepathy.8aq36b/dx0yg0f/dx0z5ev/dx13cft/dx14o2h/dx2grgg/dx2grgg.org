Okay, so the parameters of what it is supposed to do with regards to self modification are.. what? Let's say I wanted another appendage with extremely fine motor control. Or extra sensory organs that could see into other spectrums of light or focus on microscopic structures? There are many types of modifications I can imagine that would also require some commensurate brain modifications to deal with those structures. Presuming that I should be able to at LEAST change my brain to the very upper limits of human cognition, and then I can add additional body structures that will require additional brain power. Such brain structures while intended to help control these new body parts should also theoretically be usable to aid cognition (as being able to process the input from an infrared eye and an ultraviolet eye would aid in all kinds of scientific thinking, just as we engage our visual cortex in order to understand certain phenomenon.)
