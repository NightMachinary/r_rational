  Noon GMT on Christmas Day, a little over twelve thousand objects appear in an isometric grid covering the entire land area of the earth. Each is around 123 kilometers from its six neighbors, at whatever altitude is most easily and publicly accessible. They are hexagonal pillars with each of the six sides measuring 3 meters wide by six meters tall.

So, the first thing I expect to happen is government getting scared by the weird pillars, with militaries setting up curfew cordoning of as many workshop as possible, and a small group of people getting in before that.

In the worst scenario, i can imagine that everybody coming out of a workshop, can be considered aliens/fake humans, and the people inside would have to find an unguarded workshop to come out of not to get shot on sight. Workshops are a lot but are regularly spaced, so idk how hard would it be to set up guards around them, and people inside would have little time to learn the capabilities of the workshop.

  No gateway will let through, however, anyone who currently intends to harm another person or their body in any way.

Would a soldier, that is not currently tasked to kill anybody, be able to pass? What if he spooked of the creepy alien structure, and ready to shoot at any monster jumping to him? Can a murderer stun/drug himself and be carried through? Can a person willing to do anything but not specifically thinking of murder pass with a closed letter with "murder mr.X" written inside? Furthermore, could a tyrant force people to pass through a workshop to avoid assassins?

Now that i think of it, would murder even be a deal with respawns? I'd imagine that both law enforcement and crooks would switch to detainment/painful, non lethal punishment.

  The booths are respawn chambers. Whenever anyone's body dies, A copy of their mind from just before their brain was irrevocably injured is transferred into a fabricated clone body that is in optimal health conditions.

  The interior gateways can also open to personal rooms. These can be up to as big as the workshop interior, and by default have one respawn chamber, one fabricator, and a telepathy array.

Wait, so how many respawn chambers are there in total? and how many personal rooms? Can a tyrant cause a denial of service on the chambers by killing a lot of people continuously? can he reserve all personal rooms to people loyal to him?

Is 3 million times time-dilation the maximum? Quite good to crack current cryptography but still limited in power. Can a personal room owner bind another person, attach him to a life support unit and force him to spend a few million years there?

  The three platforms are telepathy arrays. If a group of people all stand on it and all mentally consent to it, it will form a telepathic link that gives all of them full, unhindered access to all the other's thoughts, opinions, memories, and feelings.

Can a tyrant force a prisoner to link with the city's priest in order to confess all his "sins"? The prisoner knows that if he doesn't, he will die. He already confessed after torture, but the tyrant wants to be sure that he did not omit anything or lied.

  Finally, from their personal room people can open gateways to workshops in new duplicate earths. These earths come in several templates modeled off the state the original earth was in at various times in its history. No new earths contain humans, and the state of things have been modified just enough to ensure no disasters will result from their absence. No reactors will go critical. No driverless moving vehicles.

Welp, this makes tyrants less problematic. If you don't like your government, just take your family in a duplicate earth and live there. Suppose my family/clan controls a duplicate earth, can I bar people from entering through the workshop? Can somebody else occupy my world's gateways?
