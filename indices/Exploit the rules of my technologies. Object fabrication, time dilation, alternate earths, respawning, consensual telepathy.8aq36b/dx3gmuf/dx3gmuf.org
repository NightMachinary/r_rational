What qualifies as "harm"? Just physical damage? What if the other person wants it? What if you THINK the other person wants it, but they don't? What if you think they don't, but they do?

If it filters out desired harm, that's gonna make people avoid a lot of lines of work.

If it filters out harm you think is desired but is actually not, or harm you think is not desired but actually is, then this becomes a way to read others' minds about their priorities/preferences regarding harm vs reward.
