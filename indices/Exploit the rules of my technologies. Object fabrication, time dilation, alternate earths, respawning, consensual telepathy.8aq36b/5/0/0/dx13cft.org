Well, even at 2x human body size there are some serious alterations you can make to improve brain performance and parameters. Obviously mobility isn't too important, so whatever the lower limits the system will allow is what will prevail, and then increasing the density of folds, increasing myelination, increasing overall brain size, etc.

Not sure what you mean about 'brain can only be deliberately changed to the extent that it'll let you control whatever body its giving you' means, but that caveat would definitely be a problem. You would have to experiment, but there must be some wiggle room in there as our current brains do far more than just control our bodies. In whatever case, people will seek to find the limits here so they will have to be specified. Things I would try: Extra brains, larger brain, extra myelination, brains to alternate between in order to allow sleep cycles while still staying awake, brains to control things like bodily functions, walking and eating so I can autopilot completely while doing complex thinking with main brain, etc.

In addition, no reason that the size of the respawn chamber would be the absolute limit of my final biological size. As long as I can grow afterwards, the theoretical limit if I have full access to biological modification is ... very large.
