The problem won't be the chamber, but the fact that people will be able to forcibly discover how to upgrade themselves through destructive testing, and on top of that they'll be able to engineer genetically or otherwise, non human intelligences that Santa now has to deal with. What happens when someone uplifts a blue whale? Those don't fit in the respawn chamber, and they're aquatic.

Edit: Oh yeah, the scenario I originally thought of. What happens when someone finally gets uplifted into a nonhuman intelligence? Are they “dead?” What happens if the nonhuman intelligence dies? What if the substrate of the intelligence doesn't fit in the respawn chamber? (Superficially similar to the whale, but a whale could theoretically get trimmed down without changing what it is, though that would be against it's will. When the brain of something wouldn't fit in the chamber, you're actively crippling the mind of whatever it is)
