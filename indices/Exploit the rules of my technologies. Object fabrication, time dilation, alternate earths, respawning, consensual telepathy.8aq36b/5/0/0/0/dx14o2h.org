Let me be clearer. The brain is always kept as close to optimal-health human standard as possible while still being compatible with the body. The parts that interact heavily with the body are the only parts that will be allowed to significantly change from the norm. If your only purpose is making your brain bigger/more powerful/whatever, the chamber probably wouldn't even open for you, because that's not within the parameters of what it's supposed to do for people.
