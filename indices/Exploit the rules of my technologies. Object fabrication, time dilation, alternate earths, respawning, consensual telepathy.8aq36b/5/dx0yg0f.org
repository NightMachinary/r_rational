Well, obviously there should be some abuse in regards to self-modification. People will explore the limits of modifying their bodies and you will end up with quite a few 48 cubic meter monsters of various types with various abilities.

The amount of shenanigans that can be achieved by a 48 cubic meter sized brain working at 3millionX speed that has total control and access to each and every brain cell is pretty extreme.

There will be no unsolveable scientific problem, and anything that can be invented will be invented. Cabals working with these room sized brains as masterminds can advance technology at a rate completely inconceivable to us, allowing them to create the technology and software to quickly bring us past the singularity and expand the thinking power beyond the capacities of even a bunch of 48 cubic meter brains.

Edit: initial understanding of size of rooms were off. redid math.
