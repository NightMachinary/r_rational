Well while people have mentioned cults on other worlds and viruses, neither of those seems like it would be remotely world breaking. Instead I think the biggest issues probably lie in the accelerated time and crafting powers kicking off a singularity.

First off the respawn booths seem extremely exploitable, since the booth itself presumably protects inhabitants that presumably makes things even easier since experimentation is totally safe. Given you can change species it should be a simple matter to change yourself to a species whose body is mostly brain (but still also necessary for the creature as a whole to survive) while also making the neurons all myelinated and much more densely packed (like birds brains). This alone should be enough to get a superintelligence which will then break your setting by developing self replicating nanotech.

Hell all of that is probably superfluous anyway given the extreme time dilation in the personal rooms. With the extreme available time dilation you should expect a group of people who brought themselves to peak human intelligence (so who didn't spend too much time experimenting with the respawn chamber) to kick off a singularity literally within a day.

Honestly you probably need to massively alter the time dilation because as is there's no way of preventing the inevitability that some groups of people working in these rooms in isolation will be able to develop enough AI/nano technology to rapidly rapidly render their creators the most powerful people in existence. Plus that's assuming the first group of people to develop AGI in these rooms doesn't accidently get UFAI.

Fundamentally when you have some groups spending centuries or even millennia in these time chambers it's going to look from an outside perspective like the pillars arrived and then pretty much immediately they were rendered irrelevant by absurdly advanced tech that just seemed to come out of nowhere.

Sidenote I couldn't figure out where you were using this in your setting (or at least it's not obviously available to the humans) but this is also probably demands explanation since it raises questions of why combined with the other available tech the people developing this tech didn't just make FAI.
