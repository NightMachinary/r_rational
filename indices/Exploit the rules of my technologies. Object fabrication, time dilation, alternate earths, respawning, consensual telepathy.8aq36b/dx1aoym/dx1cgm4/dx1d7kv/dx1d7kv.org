  As far as the AI issue, I tend to write stories under the assumption that true AI is literally impossible. It makes things easier, prevents it from consuming the story. So Santa Claus either didn't build true AI for ethical reasons, or couldn't no matter how many millions of years he put into trying.

It still seems like even ignoring AI doesn't actually solve the issue here. Since people could use the crafting devices to get themselves the equipment they would need to massively alter their biology until they can eventually switch to being entirely composed of self replicating nanobots and can start making even more serious alteration to their mind.\\
Fundamentally it seems like it should be obvious that your setting is going to look incomprehensibly wierd very quickly if groups are able to get millenia of technological advancements done in a day.\\
Hell the problem gets more extreme given that the whole tech this setting is predicated on is presumably possible, and thus people in time chambers can probably do way better than just making the nanobot swarms which would be possible given known physics.

  I already addressed brain alteration elsewhere. The respawn chamber wouldn't let you make alterations for the sole purpose of making you superhumanly smart. It will only modify the brain to the extent of removing imbalances, damage, and disabilities, or making it compatible with whatever body you choose.

This would seem to contradict what you actually said in your main post given it lets you change species. Plus what constitutes a imbalance or disability only makes sense as a standard relative to some extremely specific level of intelligence. After all if the world were composed nearly entirely of geniuses then being merely somewhat clever might make you effectively too mentally disabled to function in normal society.\\
Though of course given the time dilation you don't really need the respawn chamber to do these kinds of things really quickly from the perspective of an outside observer. Of course it would help though, since if you made an alteration to your mind which made you smarter but came with massive side effects you could use the respawn chamber to make alterations to your brain/body which negated those side effects since the change being made is making the person healthier and not itself increasing intelligence.
