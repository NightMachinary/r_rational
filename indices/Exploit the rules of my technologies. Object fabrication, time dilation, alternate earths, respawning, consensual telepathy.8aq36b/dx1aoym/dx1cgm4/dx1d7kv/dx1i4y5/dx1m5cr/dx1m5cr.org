  It will change your brain only enough to make it play nice with whatever species you decide to be.

That doesn't work as a limitation because it would allow any alterations to your biology including your brain, provided you changed your genetics enough that you qualified as a different species from human.\\
After all if the changes to neurology also correspond to the genetics of your new species then giving you the neurological upgrades would be necessary to change you to that species.

Plus of course as I said before even if you can't use the respawn chamber itself to make you smarter, you can still get it to do half of the work by making whatever changes are necessary to counteract the dangerous side effects of your experimental neurological enhancements.

Though really all the above is still mostly pointless since none of that would change the significant problem posed by the massive time dilation people can get access to.
