I already addressed brain alteration elsewhere. The respawn chamber wouldn't let you make alterations for the sole purpose of making you superhumanly smart. It will only modify the brain to the extent of removing imbalances, damage, and disabilities, or making it compatible with whatever body you choose.

As far as the AI issue, I tend to write stories under the assumption that true AI is literally impossible. It makes things easier, prevents it from consuming the story. So Santa Claus either didn't build true AI for ethical reasons, or couldn't no matter how many millions of years he put into trying.
