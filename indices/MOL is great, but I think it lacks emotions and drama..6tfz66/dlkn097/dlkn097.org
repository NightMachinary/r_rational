Emotions and drama are rarely done intensely enough to give a reader sympathetic PTSD. I hypothesize that most people have protective shells around their minds that interfere with a kind of emotional clarity required for an author to create characters who feel that strongly. Ch. 89 hurt me more than it hurt you.
