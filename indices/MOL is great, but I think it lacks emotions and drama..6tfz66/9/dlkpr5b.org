I'm thinking that the feeling of a story not being "emotional" enough could be a side-effect of it being published as online serial fiction. Let's face it - MoL would be an order of magnitude "better" than it is now after it goes through hands of a competent professional editor. For that to happen, however, it needs to be finished. What we're reading is essentially author's first draft - perhaps not in terms of story line, but in terms of prose.

Nonetheless, last two chapters contained a lot of characterisation with respect to Zorian and Damien, and I feel they did communicate their respective feelings very well.
