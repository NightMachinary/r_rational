Some people have low sex drives. This story would be very different from the one the author presumably wanted to write if Zorian had a high sex drive, therefore he was written with a low sex drive.

I admit it would have been nice if the topic were addressed a bit more, though. Zorian thinking about how sex is simply not a priority right now, or something.
