With regards to his apparent asexuality;

I suspect that, much like before the loop itself, he simply prioritizes other things before pursuing females. After the loop started the moral dubiousness of doing so, the ever increasing difference in mental age and the fact that for much of the loop he was hanging on by the skin of his teeth would be very effective at causing him to prioritize other things in favor of chasing women even more.

I find that it is actually apparent that, like every teenager, he /does/ have these feelings present somewhere inside of him but simply chooses to suppress them most of the time. Heck, his crush for Taiven took almost a decade of time /and/ a time loop for him to do anything more than halfheartedly suggest a date.
