The first thing that gets me the most about Zorian's (lack of) emotions is his apparent asexuality. He is a teenager. If he had a sex drive of an average teenager, he would lewd basically /every/ female in the loop once he was out of an immediate mortal danger. Yet, he does not. He spends literal /years/ in the time loop and doesn't even think of sex /once/. For a person with a teenager body full of hormones, this is decidedly unusual.

I like his logical approach otherwise, but his asexuality really strains mys suspension of disbelief.

Also, for such a logical individual, Zorian is surprisingly squeamish. He adamantly refuses violating copyright even when the fate of the world literally depends on him succeeding in his endeavors.

Other than these two things, I don't mind Zorian's level of emotions.
