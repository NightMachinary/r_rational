I agree with your disagreement.

I don't understand why people assume that characters have to have a zero-level intelligence (Hollywood Zombie) to be "relatable" or "emotional".

Many characters in the story actually have a decent level emotional intelligence, which is refreshing, and yet clearly have their own biases thst occasionally push them into illogical or inefficient actions (Damien's assumptions about how he treated his siblings, Zorian's attitude towards Damien, Fortev's... Fortevness, Kirielle acting her age, etc).

MoL can certainly occasionally overpontificate and end up being unnecessarily verbose over concepts or events that could better have been communicated in a single sentence or paragraph, but I'd personally rather the characters over-communicate then under-communicate.
