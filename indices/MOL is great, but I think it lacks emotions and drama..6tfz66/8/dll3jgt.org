I partially agree with the emotions part but disagree on the drama.

I personally don't think it's the characters being too logical that makes it come short on emotion, just the author not being too strong on writing "live" dialogue most of the time, if I can put it that way. But he can still pull it off at times, for example the thing with Taiven at the end of ch 43 - can you really think that that part doesn't successfully impart each characters' rather strong emotions to the reader?

As for drama, like I said, I disagree. Easy example: end of act one. I feel like one of this story's strongest points is how it engineers situations that are good enough to boggle the mind just by thinking about it, and in those kind of cases I find it really hard for the affect of the dialogue to have much say in how enthralled I am (barring, of course, just stupid amounts of shoddy writing).

I'm almost certainly stepping onto nosy territory here, but from my perspective it looks like you're the type of reader who's more into the quality of the prose in contrast to, I guess, the quality of immersibility. Or at the very least, think the former is a necessity for the latter. Any ring of truth to that?
