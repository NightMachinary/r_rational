Pointlessly, no. But unlike Zorian, they can die heroically, or lose friends. In the 3rd arc Zorian is invincible in the time loop and so is everyone else. Well, technically the opposite is true, everyone besides the two loopers dies no matter what again and again, so dying a little earlier in a restart doesn't truly mean anything, besides some emotional discomfort.

The only danger Zorian has is failing to get the keys and to get out, but that's not a possibility because of the narrative rules.
