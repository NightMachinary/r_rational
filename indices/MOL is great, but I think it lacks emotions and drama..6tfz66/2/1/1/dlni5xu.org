Out of immersion, that's true. When the hero storms the castle at the final hour the analytical part of your brain can tell you easily that the heroes are going to win somehow.

But that's the beauty of immersion, when you're actually reading the fight between the hero and the villain and the hero's on the verge of being overwhelmed, your immersed brain willingly forgets the narrative conventions which dictate the hero's inevitable success. The more immersive the conflict is, the greater this effect.

In contrast, here, even an immersed mind can tell that Zorian will be able to collect all the Keys. There are obstacles, like the hydra or getting the crown off of the lich's head, but Zorian has enough resources and time on his side that devising a plan to reliably steal the crown feels like just a matter of time.
