I agree with this. In the first arc, Zorian was still getting his bearings, trying to figure out exactly what was going on, who the players were, what the rules were, etc. And at that point, the invasion seemed insurmountable, even after multiple restarts (the lich especially just dominated all their defenses).

With the second arc, Red Robe was still in the loops, and demonstrated some ability to permanently destroy souls (at that point, we didn't know that those "souls" were just copies in a simulation). So there was that constant danger element, of not knowing who RR was or when they would pop up next.

Now we know we're just in a simulation, it's clear that Zorian will eventually get out, and even acquiring the artifacts doesn't seem too difficult for him. There are no real obstacles left until he emerges into the real world. I wouldn't mind if the author started picking up the pace a bit and not spending as much time on each of the remaining loops, so we could get back to a point where there's some dramatic tension.

Honestly, my biggest contention with the plot is Red Robe leaving the simulation so early. The combination of the ever-present potential danger to Zorian and Zack's souls, and the mystery-thriller element of trying to deduce RR's true identity, both added a lot to each loop, and their absence is very noticeable.
