That's true. Some interesting things MoL could still do: Zorian just hanging out with his class mates without trying to seriously date someone. Zorian having or developing a crush on someone wihtout trying to actually date the person. Zorian having to deal with people that have crushes on him or flirt with him. MoL does those things to various degrees and it would probably get pretty old quickly if done too much.

I think it's fair at this point to say that Zorian isn't massively popular and doesn't develop romantic (or sexual) interests easily.
