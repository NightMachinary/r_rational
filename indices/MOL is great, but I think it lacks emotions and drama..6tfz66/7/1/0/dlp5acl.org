I think it's fine since the topic is lampshaded via the fact that apparently Zach /has/ had sex with almost every woman in town and his incredulousness that Zorian hadn't done anything similar. There's nothing inherently wrong about unusual things happening in stories, because unusual things do happen. It's significantly worse when unusual things happen in stories and noone in the story treats it accordingly, like the unusual thing it is. A good lampshade goes a long way to preserving suspension of disbelief.
