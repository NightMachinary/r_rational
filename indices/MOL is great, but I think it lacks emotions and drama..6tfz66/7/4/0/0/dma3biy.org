I'm not entirely sure Zorian's parents would know or care anyway, and most of the other problems can be solved with condoms and honesty. Which is to say, you have to let people know you're just going to have sex with them and nothing else. Which you should be doing anyway, a time loop is not a place where you can ethically make promises about a future together, really, and Zorian is a very moral kid.

Zorian is /especially/ not going to be assaulting anyone just because they're in a time loop :/ unless you mean something else
