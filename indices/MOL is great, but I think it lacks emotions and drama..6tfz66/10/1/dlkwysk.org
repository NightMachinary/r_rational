No. PTSD is caused by neurological changes in the brain, and Zorian's soul (and memories) are cast backwards every month.

He may have memories of unpleasant moments, but his brain doesn't have the neurological stress connections.

This is leaving aside the absurdity of memories without neural connections, but if we assume memories are stored in the soul and processed by the brain, then there are no defects in the brain caused by stress to trigger PTSD events.

Benefits of a time loop that restores your body to a known-good configuration. Can't get buff with exercise, but can't suffer traumatic brain damage, either.
