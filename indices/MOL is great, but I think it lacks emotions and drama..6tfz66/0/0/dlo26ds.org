Yeah, I went into the story knowing that it was a time loop story, so there is some innate comfort in that.

But the innate comfort of knowing that it is a time loop makes the surprise danger moments all the more tense.

The most horrifying of the story for me was when Zorian first learned about the ability of the 3rd time traveler to wipe people from the time stream.

The story led you into a false sense of security, which made it all the more exhilarating when it tore that away from you. I had to put down the book and come back to it a month later because of that.
