Well, as soon as it becomes clear that he is in a time loop, he has a lot less to fear. I thought it was an understandable reaction.

It's not like he had no emotional responses whatsoever, but based on what we know about his upbringing and early years, I'd say he's just a bit more subdued in his responses on account of that.

I also have to note that there are several very important events that I felt had a lot of impact both on the protagonist, and on the reader.
