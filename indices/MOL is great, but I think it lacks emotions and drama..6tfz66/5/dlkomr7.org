I somewhat agree with you but for slightly different reasons.

I think the story is emotional when it wants to be. When big events happen that upset the status quo they are uniquely felt.

But I think the majority of the story kind of lacks emotion in general. In that many of the chapters are just extended training montages rather than moving the plot forward. So overall you get a lot of interesting details and world building, and then eventually it's topped off with emotional peaks.

But for me personally the training bits kind of got a bit old after a while, so I took a long break from the story. It's the emotional bits that tend to really hook me into stories. This story definitely has those emotional bits, but it doesn't really dole them out in a consistent manner.
