First two arcs were fine from emotional standpoint, I think. However, the third arc started by removing the immediate threat and replacing it with a very vague time constraint. I think this has hurt the story largely. Personally I don't have a strong enough suspension of disbelief to consider a chance Zorian will fail to get out of the loop. So there are no stakes right now. Zorian will get out of the loop, we know that, basically. This kills any tension.

Then the last, real repeat of the month starts. Once outside, he faces active Red Robe, and death for him or any of his friends is real. That's where the fun begins.
