I don't quite agree with the kills-tension part, though I also doubt the author's intending to make a downer ending. For me, it's more like the source of tension moved over from the what to the how - as in a "We're probably already halfway through the last arc and Zorian and Zach only have 1 out of 5 of the key pieces so far how the heck are they gonna get the rest of them in time without the author pulling a Deus Ex Machina oh man I hope it doesn't come to that" sort of thing.

That's a legitimate source of tension too, isn't it? Though maybe not an explicitly directed one.
