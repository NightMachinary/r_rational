  Personally I don't have a strong enough suspension of disbelief to consider a chance Zorian will fail to get out of the loop. So there are no stakes right now. Zorian will get out of the loop, we know that, basically. This kills any tension.

Generally speaking, I never go into a story considering the possibility that the protagonist will fail in his quest and die pointlessly. Yet somehow I still enjoy them and find them engaging.
