I didn't like it when Red Robe was introduced. MoL was fun to me because Zorian had the freedom to explore the timeloop and take his time to improve. The introduction of an actual threat and increasing tension was counterproductive in that regard. (Also, I really liked the arachanea and Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty in particular, so it didn't help that they were removed at the same time. I also want to read about Tinami Aope again).
