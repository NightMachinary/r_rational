It's not so much RR trying to gain an advantage by going out, but him trying to avoid a danger by /not staying in/.

He thought that once he left the loop that it would collapse and those inside would be gone, he might have even thought (correctly or not) that he could just start up the loops again and get the rest of 'his' loops without threat. We don't know from his point of view what he is thinking beyond some basics. We know he has gotten decades from his looping and has probably gotten whatever goal he wanted done. anything else is essentially gravy. Balance that with decades of being worry free vs suddenly having an existential threat of an unknown number, some of whom have demonstrated soul magic /and/ mind magic -two of the few things which could harm him in a significant way- with the mind mage being /far/ more accomplished them himself? Imagine if they figure out the soul exclusion spell he was using? they should have it available to themselves as well. that would be death for him.

No, noping the f-out was an obvious and smart move for Red Robe which out weighted any other action by a huge margin.
