Well, that's the theory. Relative to Zach/Zorian, RR has already exited - but relative to real time, they'll all exit more or less simultaneously (or, if this works like a super-powered version of the training boxes Zach and Zorian have been using, only milliseconds will have passed IRL).

To me, that's what makes RR's "early" departure so frustrating. RR's not getting any sort of advantage by being out, so there's no rush for Zach & Zorian to get out and catch up (other than to get out before the simulation runs out of power). At the same time, because RR's already exited the simulation (relative to our protagonists), we no longer have that mystery/thriller element in the rest of the loops.
