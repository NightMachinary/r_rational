You seem to assume these things make a story better by default. That's not the case, with story tension or internal conflict or any other literary technique. Not every story needs to be an emotional wringer. It's a dial and it's a valid writing choice to purposefully make the story fairly psychologically safe. Most people who like the story as it is right now like it precisely because the author doesn't do what you think he should do.
