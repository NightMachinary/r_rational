You're missing:

- Time loops (as in Groundhog's Day)
- Two or more (fixed) timelines that create each other
- Time travel as universe hopping instead of literal backwards travel in time
- Time travel with the ripple model (changes to the time stream propagate forward at a certain number of seconds per second)
