Pretty similar to BTTF. Time tourism is ok, small changes can fix themselves. The one difference I can think of is that Dr Who has "fixed points in time" which absolutely cannot be changed, even by a Time Lord. There was one case (The Waters of Mars) where the Doctor tried his absolute best to change a fixed point and it...sorta kinda worked? It changed the /way/ the events happened, but the same end point was still achieved. [[#s][Specifically,]]
