The end of the first movie (at least, before Doc shows up again) has always bothered me. Marty steps into a life that's not his own, full of people that aren't the people he knew. Clearly he's still alive ... but he's taking the place of some other Marty. His brother and sister are virtually strangers to him, as are his parents. Even if history is kind to him, and the broad strokes are the same, certain things have to be different simply by virtue of the outcomes we're shown.

So Marty is left with all these unhappy memories of his parents fighting, when that presumably never happened in the new timeline. The film makes a point of things being different, but now Marty has to figure out a way to cope with that - hiding the fact that he's a Marty from another timeline, talking to people who aren't the same people he grew up with.

(My favorite ever fan theory, which doesn't work with the two subsequent sequels, is that there are in fact two of Marty, and each ends up in the other's timeline. Marty-One had a shit life, goes back in time, screws up his parents' meeting, gets them back together, and goes back to the future, having created Timeline-Two. Marty-Two is the one that Marty-One sees running off - he's the other Marty, the one with a good life and great parents, and when he gets to the past, he acts responsibly and doesn't interfere at all. Marty-Two spends an uneventful time in the past until the night of the lightning storm, then goes back to the future, having created Timeline-One. But the future he returns to isn't the one he left, because Marty-One and Marty-Two have effectively swapped places (also, Doc is probably dead in Timeline-One). It's a theory that got thoroughly shot to hell by the sequels.)
