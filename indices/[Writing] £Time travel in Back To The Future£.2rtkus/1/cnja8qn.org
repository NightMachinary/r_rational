It's interesting that /Back to the Future/ has an easy to understand system of time travel that works well with its story, while at the same time employing a lot of things that make close to zero sense. The "fading out of time" thing is the biggest culprit. Marty keeps looking at the photograph, where his siblings are fading out ... but his memories of them don't change, even though he and the photo were taken from the same moment? He sees his hand fading out of existence?

The reason to do it that way is visual impact for the audience, of course - otherwise you need establish the rules in some other way. I think the only reason that Marty has two siblings is so that they could do the picture countdown, which works really well as a "bad things" metaphor for the audience - but again, makes no sense.

It's possible to make "ripple effect" time travel work, though I don't really know of anyone that I would say has done it successfully (and like [[/u/sam512]], I love time travel and have read/watched a ton of it).

Edit: The time travel model becomes truly incoherent in the second and third films, as much as I love them.
