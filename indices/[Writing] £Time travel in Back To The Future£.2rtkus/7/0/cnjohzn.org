You change one molecule, you change everything that interacts with that molecule in any way - not just the molecules that bump into it, but every form of energy as well. You add in a molecule of sand, and that very subtly raises the amount of energy needed to heat the desert back up during the daytime, or cool it down in the night time. That in turn starts to make very small changes in the air currents, which in turn makes changes in the weather.

It's a snowball effect. Maybe nothing perceptible changes in the first month, or even in the first year, but eventually there /are/ changes, and those changes compound into more changes. When those changes hit a person, the snowball gets big, fast. A variation in timing of a half second means that a different sperm gets to the egg, which means that a genetically different person is born - or possibly that no person is born at all.

So if you change a molecule in 1955, you should expect a fair amount of change by 1985 - maybe nothing world-shattering, but certainly a few different teenagers. The effects only grow as time passes. It's possible that you could find a molecule to change that has an effect that's perfectly canceled out, but I wouldn't count on it.
