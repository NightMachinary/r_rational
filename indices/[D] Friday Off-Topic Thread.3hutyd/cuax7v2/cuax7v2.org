Has anyone else been watching the show [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Na6wZ_hjRM][Taskmaster]]? It's basically a game show about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISIsdLS0lzY][unconventional]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKEWWVjyfuw][problem]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb7KKv4-rzk][solving]], starring British comedians. I find it really fun to try to work out how I'd solve the challenge and then see if any of the participants use the same method. The episodes get posted over at [[/r/panelshow]], or you could watch at the tv station's [[http://dave.uktv.co.uk/shows/taskmaster/][site]] if you're in the UK or use a VPN +like Hola+.
