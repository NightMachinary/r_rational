Well that's one way to do it. I've often thought that the Worm CYOA is sort of a magnet for mediocre fanfic, mainly because everything gets overpowered almost instantly and that just basically kills any tension, ingenuity or suspense. The whole things seems to have been designed by someone who has no interest in reading suspenseful stories, but has dreamed about becoming a god.

This setup would be more of a Holy Grail War or Future Diary kind of thing, though you'll need some reason to force them all to fight each other. Otherwise you end up having the 6 of them that aren't insane team up, murder/contain the other three and fix everything forever almost instantly. So maybe a time limit after which they all die if there are more than x people left alive? Or some other thing.
