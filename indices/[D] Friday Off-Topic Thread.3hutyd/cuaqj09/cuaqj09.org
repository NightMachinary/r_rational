So I was reading way too many mediocre [[http://tinyurl.com/qgd54wh][worm CYOA]] fanfics and got inspired to write one of my own (I haven't written much since high school so mine will just be extra mediocre). Only problem is I can't decide what to write! I have the first chapter of like, 5 different stories written.

I'm disabling World Breaker powers by act of ROB no matter what I do, mostly because other CYOAs have thoroughly explored them, and only a madman wouldn't choose kaleidoscope given the option.

My current plan is just to write a universe where nearly everyone has become a CYOA reincarnate. That way I can have all the most munchkiny builds in there without a protagonist instantly steamrolling the universe. Plus then I can explore the implications of a new build whenever I feel like.

Naturally such a world will quickly devolve into a high powered fantasy kitchen sink.
