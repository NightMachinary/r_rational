My plan is to have some of the powers that give you the memories of someone also give you their disposition and personality to an extent. The more ancient or strong willed they are, the more their tendencies dilute yours.

Society is going to collapse one way or another.

Maybe someone thought

Reincarnation: US President\\
Crossover: Darkseid

Was a good idea. (Sure he'd start out nerfed to about Legend power level but still)

Hell even if someone sane and benevolent overwrites someone in power entire countries' natural flow could be disrupted.

Or maybe a doofus munchkin thought they were being smart and chose to incarnate as [[http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Berserker_%28Fate/Extra_Rani_route%29][Fate/Extra Rani Route Berserker]] and lost control...

Oops I accidentally the vampire apocalypse.

Aside from that now anyone can gain mid to high level powers for the right price thanks to there being at least a few people with each variety of apprentice.

That Ability lets you teach other people what you specialize in. Imagine every unnamed mook in the E88 having RWBY aura. Or DnD skills, or well...

Lets just say everything would change if the Nazi benders attacked.

Right now I'm trying to narrow down what I actually want to do, because it could get to be such a ludicrous clusterfuck of superpowers that it becomes unintelligible if I'm not careful.
