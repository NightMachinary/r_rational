Same here actually. Whenever I have free time, I end up reading a lot of fanfiction, webnovels, computer-science, cognitive-science, sci-fi, and fantasy. I'd say that I read anywhere from 50k to 300k daily with a pretty large variation since the amount of free time I have tends to jump up and down like a demented yo-yo.
