  This seems hopelessly optimistic.

On an intuitive level, this feels quite optimistic to me as well -- I just can't think of a valid criticism that would undermine the argument.

  If solar power plants could pay for themselves in three years, I know a lot of people who'd be investing in them.

This particular case (Freitas atomic separator replicator) depends on microgravity and easy access to hard vacuum, etc. otherwise you would need massive support structures, a vacuum chamber, vacuum pumps, etc. which increase the cost (and thus reduce doubling rate) substantially. An externally powered ion printer device that creates things from low-grade ore for 8800 GJ/kg would be conceivable, but I doubt people would be very impressed with it sans an adequate solar array, since that's $130/kg worth of power.

  The rocket equation tells us that the amount of fuel required to move an object around goes up exponentially with the delta-vee you want to achieve; there's no way a tenfold increase in efficiency is worth the cost of shipping materials to Mercury.
#+end_quote

The energy cost of delta-vee is insignificant in this context. Even if you were slinging the materials around at 100 km/s, that would only be 5 GJ/kg. Also, stuff manufactured closer to the sun would probably be made using materials launched from Mercury, which has an EV of 4.2 km/s, meaning the energy cost is only 8.82 MJ/kg. That's peanuts compared to the power collection capacity for a given kilogram. If you collect just 100 W/kg, you can pay for 8 MJ in a little over 2 hours.

  Let alone the logistics of collecting energy inside the orbit of Mercury, collecting minerals out in the asteroid belt, and shipping them back and forth at reasonable rates. 3 years doubling time? I'd give you 3 years just to take a spaceship from an asteroid-belt orbit to a Mercurian one.
#+end_quote

Pretty sure I didn't mention that particular scenario, but again if you were to do the math you'd see it's plenty feasible to use shorter times by spending higher (yet still insignificant) amounts of energy. It's not really necessary to use belt asteroids however, since various asteroids (known as "Near-Earth Asteroids") naturally move closer to the sun anyway during part of their orbit.
