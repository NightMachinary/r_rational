This seems hopelessly optimistic. If solar power plants could pay for themselves in three years, I know a lot of people who'd be investing in them. The rocket equation tells us that the amount of fuel required to move an object around goes up exponentially with the delta-vee you want to achieve; there's no way a tenfold increase in efficiency is worth the cost of shipping materials to Mercury. Let alone the logistics of collecting energy inside the orbit of Mercury, collecting minerals out in the asteroid belt, and shipping them back and forth at reasonable rates. 3 years doubling time? I'd give you 3 years just to take a spaceship from an asteroid-belt orbit to a Mercurian one.
