  Also, "anarchy" or "anarchism" doesn't mean "there's no crime or war ever". It means there's no hegemonic state.

Anarchy means there is no state. That means there is no state military. That means the only anti-piracy forces are personal or informal. That makes anti-piracy work a commons, which, as I discussed previously, leads to government. Not a large and intrusive one, at least not necessarily, but too much to call it anarcho-communism.

  Again, we're basically talking about the Culture
#+end_quote

Then you should have started out by saying that the technologies and living arrangements of the Culture inevitably lead to anarcho-communism. Except the Culture is not anarcho-communist; the lack of scarcity means it's not communist, and politically, it's effectively a human preserve run by an oligarchy of AIs. Unless you're saying that the AIs generated by the Culture, given the technologies of the Culture, will inevitably establish anarcho-communism between themselves -- which says a lot more about their method for generating artificial intelligences than sociology and technology.
