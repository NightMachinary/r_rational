I can't really fathom what your model of these space habitats is. It seems something like:

Trade is rare. This in turn means that each habitat has a source for all or almost all the raw materials it needs, and each habitat makes all or almost all of its own goods. Any trade that happens, happens in small groups or pairs. This requires that, if habitat A produces a good that habitat B wants, habitat B must necessarily produce a good that habitat A wants. It is easy to contact all your potential trade partners securely with no risk of interlopers or MITM attacks. It is impossible to advertise that you have a good for trade, arrange to meet with a trade partner, and point a gun at them rather than exchanging goods.

The only reasonable way to get anything near that model is to make space travel prohibitively expensive for all time. (That doesn't explain how each habitat has access to all the resources it ever needs. That would require sifting the asteroid belt or some such. But we'll set that aside for now.) But that would result in people putting their habitats close together specifically because people like to talk to each other and see each other in person and travel and trade. So you have to induce a diaspora somehow. (Then you have to keep large habitats or large collections of small habitats to maintain healthy breeding populations, but that's only if you want humanity to survive for an extended period of time.)

Of course, if space travel is prohibitively expensive, that /alone/ is sufficient to prevent piracy. And trade.
