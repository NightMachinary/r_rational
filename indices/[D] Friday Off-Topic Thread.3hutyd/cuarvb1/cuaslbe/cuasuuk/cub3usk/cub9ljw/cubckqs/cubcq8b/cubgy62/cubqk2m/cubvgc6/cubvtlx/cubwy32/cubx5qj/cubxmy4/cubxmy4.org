The oceans are also vast, yet pirates made a good living. How did they do it?

People trade. Trading requires rendezvousing with people, which requires being at a known place at a known time. You can engage in trade only with a very limited set of partners, arranging meetings in secrecy, and that limits the set of goods you can trade for and the potential profits. You can trade in the open, and that opens up the risk of piracy.

Producing goods means extracting natural resources at some point. If pirates can identify where those natural resources are being extracted, they can raid in that area.
