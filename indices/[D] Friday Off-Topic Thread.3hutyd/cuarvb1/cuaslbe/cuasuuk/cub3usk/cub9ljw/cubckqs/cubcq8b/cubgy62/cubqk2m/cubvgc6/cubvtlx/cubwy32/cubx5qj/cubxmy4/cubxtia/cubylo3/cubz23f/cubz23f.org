  It is easy to contact all your potential trade partners securely with no risk of interlopers or MITM attacks. It is impossible to advertise that you have a good for trade, arrange to meet with a trade partner, and point a gun at them rather than exchanging goods.

Well no. So some piracy and robbery definitely happens, along with wars. But this just reinforces the general point about self-sufficiency.

(Also, "anarchy" or "anarchism" doesn't mean "there's no crime or war ever". It means there's no hegemonic state.)

  Trade is rare. This in turn means that each habitat has a source for all or almost all the raw materials it needs, and each habitat makes all or almost all of its own goods. Any trade that happens, happens in small groups or pairs. This requires that, if habitat A produces a good that habitat B wants, habitat B must necessarily produce a good that habitat A wants.

Again, we're basically talking about the Culture, in which each habitat has land area in sums ranging between continental and planetary. Once they're constructed, self-sufficiency is, by and large, entirely possible.
