If there's value associated with material goods, people will try to acquire material goods. If there are any limits on the rate of acquisition of goods by peaceful means, and if there's some sort of weapon available, piracy becomes highly likely. This creates defensive military coalitions, which leads to conscription and taxation.

A military force in the face of piracy is something of a commons. As long as it exists and is strong enough, it is to my benefit for it to exist. However, it is more to my benefit if my habitat doesn't have to provide soldiers (because it means there are more people to share work over locally). It's to my benefit if other people pay taxes instead of me. So building on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom][Ostrom's work]], we'll need auditors and an arbitration system and sanctions on people who don't provide taxes or conscripts.

This doesn't make anarchy between habitats impossible, but it doesn't help. We're familiar with hierarchical systems involving governments to solve these problems, so we'll turn to governments first.

Once you've got a post-scarcity economy, /then/ you have much less need for such things. Except there are non-physical things that are still scarce: other people's attention and influence over people, for instance. Violence and the threat of violence can acquire those. To eliminate that problem while maintaining anarchy, you need an outside force to provide peacekeeping and any necessary investigative services (and this isn't anarchy so much as a government without enfranchisement). So from a theoretical standpoint, it doesn't look like living in space stations leads inevitably to anarchy.

The Culture's anarchy, as far as it extends, relies on a servant class of AIs. Almost everyone lives on an orbital or space ship; every orbital and space ship has an AI with a brain the size of planets serving as concierge, arbiter, and panopticon; slapper drones serve as law enforcement and punishment beyond the scope that ship and orbital Minds choose for themselves; and there's no indication that humans have any say in what behaviors merit punishment. So even if we're generalizing from fictional evidence, I don't think we get anywhere near your assertion.
