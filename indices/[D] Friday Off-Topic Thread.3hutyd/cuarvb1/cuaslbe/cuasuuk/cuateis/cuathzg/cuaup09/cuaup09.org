  But let's face it: /space is fucking cool/.

See, but then we're talking about entertainment motive.

The final season of /Friends/ was the most expensive [television show] of all time, costing $10 million per episode. How much does a trip to Mars cost? For a single crewed mission ... Wikipedia says $6 billion as a lower bound estimate. That's just to go there and back again, no colonization on offer, just the Mars equivalent of an Apollo mission. You could get 30 /Star Wars/ movies for that price! And in terms of entertainment, actual space /is/ competing with fake space.

Now, it's possible that you can use entertainment as a single prong of your Swiss Army knife of getting people to care about space. But I sort of doubt it, given the competition in the form of hyper-optimized-for-entertainment media.
