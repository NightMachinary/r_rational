A smattering of unknowns about colonizing Mars:

- Where do we find active volcanism? (Geothermal is the easiest legal type of power to generate there.)
- What nitrates and phosphates are present? (Plants need them.)
- Are there problems with using, say, argon in place of nitrogen in air that humans breathe? (There's insufficient atmospheric nitrogen locally, but argon is non-reactive and moderately plentiful. But maybe the nitrates are edible by some nitrogen-releasing bacteria on Earth, in which case you can use them instead -- but it's something you have to keep track of.)
- What local ores are available? How do we locate them and how do we smelt them?

You're going to need to reproduce any equipment you use, to a first approximation. The basics are pretty straightforward -- grow plants, you can turn them into food and clothing and light building materials, and you've got oxygen production right there; make fertilizer; that sort of thing. But, for instance, how do you ensure you've got a good air mix? Too much carbon dioxide is toxic. Too little kills your plants. Insufficient oxygen will kill you. Excessive means fires are a problem. So you need something to track and adjust the air mix in your facility, and you need to be able to fabricate another copy of that because things break.

You need building materials, and that means quarrying stone and somehow making a construction of stone blocks air-tight. How are you doing that? Carefully shaped blocks plus partial melting with lasers might work. It's even easier if you use ice as a building material or as cement -- that's only an option in polar regions where it's always below freezing. However, ice does sublimate, so maybe it's not a great option. Or once you have smelting down, you can weld metal plates together to form the outer shell of your facility -- and use stone outside as ablative armor.

It would be safest to send robots to set up the facility and send humans once the facility was demonstrably stable, of course.
