  It'd be easier and cheaper to colonize Antarctica or the middle of the ocean than to colonize Mars. It'd be cheaper and easier to grow food in the Sahara than to grow food on Mars. We have no plans to do any of these things.

It's ecologically irresponsible! (that's not why we're only doing this at small scales though)

  t would be easier (again, orders of magnitude) to turn Earth into an Eden - covered once more in the forests of ancient days and with flawless weather - than to make Mars as nice as a place to live as Antarctica is right now.

I agree that this would be financially far cheaper - but it would create winners and (far more) losers, so it's politically almost impossible. And pretty much every project on even an international scale lives and dies by politics, not resources.
