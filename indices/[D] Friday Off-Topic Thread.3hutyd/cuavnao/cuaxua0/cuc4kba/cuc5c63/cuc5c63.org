Hmm. That's neat. I'll have to have a look at it later. Thanks.

What about applications of scientific discoveries in weapons programs as an example of science being bad? For game-theory and common-sense reasons, it's always bad to be without a weapon, even if society would be better off if nobody had weapons, so there's always an incentive for better weapons.
