Pure science, unless it gets unlucky and starts a black-hole chain reaction or something, isn't bad. What's bad is when those results are applied by people with dubious ethics. For example, Monsanto and the Suicide Corn, which sounds like a mariachi/alt rock band, but actually refers to the practice of engineering corn that self-destructs in the second generation, forcing farmers to continue buying from Monsanto. If that wasn't bad enough, they have successfully sued farmers for possessing their intellectual property after their fields were pollinated by illicit gusts of wind and smugglerbees.
