This week's weekly challenge is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hnau9/weekly_challenge_science_is_bad/]["Science is Bad"]] which tends to be one of my least favorite tropes. It was picked because it was on the spreadsheet of user-submitted suggestions, but also because I found it intriguing. I immediately thought about Voldemort's screed against nuclear weapons (and the scientists who let their knowledge seep out into the world) in HPMOR.

But I'm curious (for those of you who don't plan on submitting stories) whether there's any merit in some not-totally-fictional edge case for "Science is Bad" being accurate?
