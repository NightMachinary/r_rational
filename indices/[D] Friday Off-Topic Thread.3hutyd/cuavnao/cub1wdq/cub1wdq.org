Science Is Bad when it involves meddling in complicated systems where unanticipated consequences could be disastrous, and a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. A lot of systems in nature are like that: ecosystems, human bodies, human societies, etc. Almost any non-natural change could be the beginning of a disaster, and even in the aftermath of such a disaster it may not be possible to pinpoint a specific cause.

Ecosystems in particular have so many moving parts that it's almost impossible to trace the cause of any given disaster except in general terms. Local farmers introduce a new type of wheat, and years later they're overrun by frogs. The temperature of the ocean goes up by 0.5Â°C, and a species of jellyfish goes extinct. Was there a correlation? Who knows? You can't rewind the last five years and do a controlled experiment, you can only use the evidence you have. The same goes for economics, sociology, and any other field that studies complex emergent systems.

Pharmaceutical research, at least, can trial the same drug on twenty different people and get representative results of how it'll work on similar people in the future. It still takes them a long time to develop a new treatment, because they go to huge lengths to ensure the safety of their patients. After all, it's quite obvious when a drug has killed a patient, so there's every incentive to avoid that.

If we could trace back a hurricane to the heat wave that formed it, to the greenhouse effect that altered the weather, to the coal-fired power plant that produced the CO2, to the official who decided to build that... but of course that's pure fantasy, a complex system like the weather would be affected by many decisions and pointing fingers is impossible except in an averaged-out statistical manner. Even in retrospect, we can't judge which power stations were good or bad decisions to build.

There's no way to do full-scale experiments on a system like that, and local tests will almost invariably miss some consequences just by virtue of reducing a complex system to a single one of its interacting parts. And you'll end up affixing the "Backed by SCIENCE(tm)" label to results which have little bearing on reality. And then people will make decisions based on those labels, and if their mistake is noticed at all it will only serve to undermine their trust in science.

Don't get me wrong, the naturalistic fallacy is still a thing. +There's no sense in ideas like the paleo diet, whose adherents eat the way their evolutionary ancestors did, since the rest of their lives have changed in every way.+ Keeping a specific tiny part of the old way is like growing a single tree in the middle of a roundabout and calling it conservation. But the other way around? A "natural" system - one that's had millions of years of bug-testing by the blind idiot of random chance - can react in remarkably dangerous ways to a relatively small change that it's never encountered before.

Edit: All these issues can be avoided - it's a matter of doing science /right/. Perhaps the problem is specifically Half-Assed Science, not Science as a whole. Still, reality imposes some constraints - the pressure to publish interesting results, the tendency for non-experts to misinterpret technical data, the pressure to make a profit even on potentially incomplete information, the lack of time and manpower to collect all the knowledge you really need - that can easily make Half-Assed Science the norm.
