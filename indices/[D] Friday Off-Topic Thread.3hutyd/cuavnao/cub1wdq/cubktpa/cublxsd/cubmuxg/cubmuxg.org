That is being utterly pedantic. I'm not sure we even know the exact proportions and quantities of food they ate back then. There is no "true paleo" in regard to quantities and proportions, it's about limiting the /content/ of your meals. I'm not even someone who knows anything about paleo, I just have the general idea and read a few blog posts describing studies and the practice.
