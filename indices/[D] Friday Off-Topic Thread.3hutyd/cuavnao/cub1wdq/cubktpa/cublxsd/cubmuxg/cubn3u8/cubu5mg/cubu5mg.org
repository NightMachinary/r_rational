What's wrong with providing a powerfully contagious meme to center that thinking around? Even if it uses the naturalistic fallacy to spread, it doesn't even count as dark arts because it is a direct health benefit to its subjects.

  Didn't everyone learn to cook for themselves from their parents, and learn the reason why it's important? Surely your secondary school teachers would have mentioned it - in your Home Economics class if you had one, in Biology if you didn't. In this day and age, it would be perfectly possible for everyone in first-world countries to eat only microwave meals and takeaway pizza - and literally the only reason we don't is that people understand there's no faster way to wreck your health.

And seriously, diet is not obvious to people who know nothing about nutrition. I think it's possibly the least covered topic in even physical education classes. For classes claiming to teach healthy life practices, there was quite a dearth of learning. You are falling prey to some strange conjunction of typical mind and hindsight. No, everyone did not learn that from their parents. In my culinary class there was nothing about diet, nor was there anything in biology, because /those classes were busy teaching culinary and biology./ You are at once coming off as condescending, and ignorant for being so.
