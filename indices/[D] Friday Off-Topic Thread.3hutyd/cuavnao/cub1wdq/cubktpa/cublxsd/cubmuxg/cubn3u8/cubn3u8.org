Okay, I've read the blog post you linked, and I /was/ wrong about what the paleo diet is. I was thinking it was something like Atkins - more meat and vegetables, less cereals and carbohydrates. In fact, the motivation seems to be more avoiding ready-made meals and heavily processed food.

Which... I sort of assumed everyone already knew that? I thought that idea wouldn't need a name like "The Paleo Diet" because it was already common sense? Didn't everyone learn to cook for themselves from their parents, and learn the reason why it's important? Surely your secondary school teachers would have mentioned it - in your Home Economics class if you had one, in Biology if you didn't. In this day and age, it would be perfectly possible for everyone in first-world countries to eat only microwave meals and takeaway pizza - and literally the only reason we don't is that people understand there's no faster way to wreck your health.

Thanks for debunking my mistake. And seriously, /what the hell is wrong with people that they couldn't figure that out on their own?/
