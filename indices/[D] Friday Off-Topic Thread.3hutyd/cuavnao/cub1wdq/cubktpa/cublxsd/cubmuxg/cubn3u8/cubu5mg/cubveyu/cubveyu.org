I know! In retrospect, that all makes sense, and I apologise for my condescension. I was just astonished that this fact which I assumed was commonly-known was actually the exact opposite.

We know that common sense is neither common nor sensible. We know that for everything that "everybody knows", [[https://xkcd.com/1053/][10000]] people per day are seeing it for the first time. It's still shocking to be blindsided by these effects.

I'm never making fun of the "raising awareness" people again.
