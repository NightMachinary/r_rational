  What about survival motive?
#+end_quote

What do you mean, survival motive? What disaster could possibly be so terrible that it's easier to survive on Mars (say) than in a hidden base in a mineshaft, in a desert, or under the ocean?

A war? We're assuming a technology level that puts interplanetary travel in reach of private citizens. I'm sure there'll be interplanetary ballistic missiles sitting around.

An asteroid strike like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs? Our mammalian ancestors /survived/ that one, and they didn't have cool toys like electric heating or air filtration. We can weather any natural disaster.

Global warming? It'll be an ecological disaster if our planet's temperature rises by one degree. Mars is eighty degrees colder than Earth. It's far easier to reverse global warming here than it is to terraform a second planet.

And if civilisation does collapse and we're knocked back to the Stone Age? Our species made it out of the Stone Age once before. This is the only planet in the universe where food literally grows on trees.

On the other hand, how many people do you think it takes to maintain a self-reliant civilisation at our current technology level? Ten million? A hundred million? How many specialised areas of expertise do we use to manufacture something as mundane as a box of cereal (let alone a space suit or a mining vehicle)? How many experts in each area does it take to train the next generation without losing any knowledge? And how long will it take to build a colony of that size?
