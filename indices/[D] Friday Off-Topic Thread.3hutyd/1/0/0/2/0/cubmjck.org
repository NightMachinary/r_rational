  It's far easier to reverse global warming here than it is to terraform a second planet.

The only argument I find compelling in this space is basically that it's more responsible to geoengineer Mars than Earth - we don't stand to loose much if it goes wrong, besides all the other ecological problems. Getting to a (very basic) biosphere might not be all that hard, if you're willing to wait centuries.
