  The oceans are also vast

Well no. The oceans are vast in two dimensions, not in three.

  yet pirates made a good living.

Again: real-life oceans do not involve self-sufficient (even weakly) habitats. They involve a distinct need to get to a known port, and quickly. Pirates just have to hang around the waters on paths between known ports, and there are victims.

  People trade. Trading requires rendezvousing with people, which requires being at a known place at a known time. You can engage in trade only with a very limited set of partners, arranging meetings in secrecy, and that limits the set of goods you can trade for and the potential profits. You can trade in the open, and that opens up the risk of piracy.

Even to rendezvous in an astronomically-large three-dimensional space already involves problems. Cryptography also makes it easier to build cooperative-but-secret trade systems once you've got /some/ kind of information broadcast working.

But now we're basically worldbuilding for a space-pirate story.
