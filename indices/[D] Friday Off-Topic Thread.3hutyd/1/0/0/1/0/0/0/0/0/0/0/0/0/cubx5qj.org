  There can be multiple ways of acquiring a good, and people can prefer one but fall back to another when necessary. If it's possible but un-fun for a set of pirates to produce the goods they need, and it is possible and fun for them to raid other habitats to get the same goods, they will prefer to raid other habitats when they can.
