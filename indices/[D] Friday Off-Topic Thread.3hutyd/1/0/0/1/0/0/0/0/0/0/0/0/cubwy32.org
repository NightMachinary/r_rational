You do not need to be self-sufficient for luxury goods. If a set of pirates likes silk but can't produce it, then they will be inclined to raid places where silk is produced, or nexuses of silk trading. When they can't get silk, they make do with the pseudo-polyester blend that the ship's systems can produce.

You do not need to be self-sufficient for things you rarely need as long as it is not catastrophic to lose or expend it or you can have reserves or backups. You need a CO2 -> O2 converter in your ship, and your primary has a 10-year MTBF and you've got a spare. Your primary dies, you can't fix it, so you raid another habitat and take their spare. The people you raided are not pirates, and they can't fabricate a new one, so they trade with another habitat to secure a replacement.

There can be multiple ways of acquiring a good, and people can prefer one but fall back to another when necessary. If it's possible but un-fun for a set of pirates to produce the goods they need, and it is possible and fun for them to raid other habitats to get the same goods, they will prefer to raid other habitats when they can.
