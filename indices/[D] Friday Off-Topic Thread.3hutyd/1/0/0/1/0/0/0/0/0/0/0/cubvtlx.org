  If there's value associated with material goods, people will try to acquire material goods. If there are any limits on the rate of acquisition of goods by peaceful means, and if there's some sort of weapon available, piracy becomes highly likely. This creates defensive military coalitions, which leads to conscription and taxation.

I think the analogy sounds nice at first, but doesn't /quite/ work. Sea-going ships have to make port /eventually/. They're not actually self-sufficient. Space habitats /need/ to be self-sufficient: even if you're the pirate, the rate at which you can raid other habitats /in three-dimensional astronomically-sized space/ for supplies you can't produce yourself is just a losing proposition. You /need/ to be able to supply your own needs, or you will just plain die -- curse of dimensionality.

Which isn't to say that I don't want to read a story about space piracy. Space pirates are basically the coolest thing ever. It's just that I think, if you're talking about a society that lives in space /full-time/ rather than using space as a way to pass between planets, you need to rationalize some interesting way for pirates to both exist and survive.
