Each person on a small space station is highly dependent on the continued operation of that station. Unless each person can independently maintain the station and not interfere with other people trying to do the same, nobody is self-sufficient. Nobody's even slightly self-sufficient. So on the scale of one space station, you need coordination, and humans tend to turn to hierarchies to coordinate. For your argument to work, everyone would need their own space habitat and would need to be competent to maintain every part of it. How this model handles population growth is left as an exercise to the reader.

Your argument here is also diametrically opposed to the one you quoted. Iain Banks was arguing from interdependence, whereas you are arguing from independence. So I'm confused.
