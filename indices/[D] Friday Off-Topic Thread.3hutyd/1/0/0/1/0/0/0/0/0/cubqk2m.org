My "independence" statement is talking about the state of anarchism /between/ space habitats, whereas the "communism within" is, I concede, more arguable.

As in, space habitats might have any number of internal social structures, as long as they allow for a high degree of coordination, but it's very probably very difficult for space habitats to dominate each-other on a consistent basis.
