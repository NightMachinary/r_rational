  Profit motive? What about survival motive?
#+end_quote

Scope insensitivity makes "survival motive" basically non-existent, assuming that by "survival motive" we mean "survival of the human race" and not "survival of the individual".

People have been trying for /decades/ to make the argument that we need a backup planet. They haven't gotten any traction. People don't actually care. The human brain isn't wired for caring about humanity in the general sense. So I suppose you might try to increase rationality in the general public so that even though people remain emotionally scope insensitive, they start to understand and agree with a survival motive as rational. But that seems much harder than just going after the already existent motives (like profit).
