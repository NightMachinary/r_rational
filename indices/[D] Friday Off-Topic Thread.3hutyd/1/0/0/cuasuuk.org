Profit motive? What about survival motive?

  Musk's idea is to aim for smaller profits along the way to bigger ones.

Hill-climbing is a generally more reliable and easier to meta-reason-about algorithm for accomplishing things than just trying to pump a bunch of probability into a discontinuous, walled-off possible-world. Musk has the right idea: pave a continuous path towards space colonization, where each individual forward step will provide society with /some/ (even if small) amount of immediate net reward, and the /path/ builds up to accomplishing the long-term goal of /get us into fucking space so we don't all die pathetically on Earth and can have anarcho-communism like the Culture./
