The difficulty is profit motive. Getting into space is expensive. Figuring out how to get into space less expensively is expensive. The payoff is uncertain for both of those. The government is almost certainly not going to be the organization that revolutionizes space travel, given current funding levels. That might change if there's a resurgence of interest in space travel (and movies like /The Martian/ help with that) but I sort of doubt that it's going to become politically expedient to make a push for space.

Musk's idea is to aim for smaller profits along the way to bigger ones. He knows much more about the subject than I do and seems to think that it will work, so I guess I sort of trust him on that.

But other than that, the state of space technology is abysmal and won't get better until there's an actual economic reason to go into space (satellites aside).
