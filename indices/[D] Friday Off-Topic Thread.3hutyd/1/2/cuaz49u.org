It'd be easier and cheaper to colonize Antarctica or the middle of the ocean than to colonize Mars. It'd be cheaper and easier to grow food in the Sahara than to grow food on Mars. Easier and cheaper by orders of magnitude. We have no plans to do any of these things.

It would be easier, safer, and cheaper to colonize the Moon than to colonize Mars. Food, personnel, and materials would be simpler to ship and to return. It would still be absurdly, painfully, overwhelmingly expensive... impossible to justify financially.

It would be easier (again, orders of magnitude) to turn Earth into an Eden - covered once more in the forests of ancient days and with flawless weather - than to make Mars as nice as a place to live as Antarctica is right now. Protecting us from space rocks with a massive interplanetary network of flying drones: Also pocket change compared to setting up a "spare planet".

Mars may be the second nicest place to live within twenty trillion miles, but it's really hard to justify /doing so/.
