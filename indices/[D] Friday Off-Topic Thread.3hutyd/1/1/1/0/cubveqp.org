Much of the energy would be used in space for space things, but power beaming back to Earth has been well studied since the 1970's (including by me, at Boeing).

The reason we don't do it today is a solar panel in space produces 7 times as much output as a panel on Earth, due to night, weather, and atmospheric absorption down here. If it costs you more than 7x as much to put that panel in space and beam the power down (the situation today), then it makes more sense to put the panel on Earth. If in the future you have robot factories that can /make/ the panels in space, and avoid the cost of launch from Earth, it might make economic sense to beam down power.

  Where do you get the materials for the self-replicating machines, at that orbit?

The Solar System is full of small objects in random orbits. For example, as of two days ago we reached [[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/][13000 Near Earth Objects]], and are finding 1500 new ones a year. The Moon and other medium-sized bodies are small enough to mechanically throw stuff into orbit with a large centrifuge. Once your materials are out of a gravity well, you can move them around using efficient propulsion systems and gravity assist maneuvers, at a small percentage of propellant mass.
