  We can also melt them down and refine them further, producing higher grades of steel for example

The natural composition of metallic asteroids (~95% Iron, Nickel, & Cobalt, in that order) is a good ore for making various steels, but is not a steel itself. Typically you want to add some alloying elements depending on what use you have.

Steel is defined as having 0.2 to 2% carbon. Very low carbon alloys are called "wrought", and are ductile, but not especially strong. As you raise the carbon content, steel gets harder but more brittle. High carbon steel is suitable for edged tools, say, but not hammers. When you get up to 4% carbon it's called cast iron, which is very brittle but easy to cast into shapes. Stainless steel requires at least 10% Chromium, and is present in fractional percent amounts in some asteroids.

  The reason propellant efficiency matters is mainly because gathering a lot of energy is usually easier than gathering matter.

A modern space solar panel has an output of [[http://www.spectrolab.com/DataSheets/Panel/panels.pdf][177 W/kg]]. Over a typical 15 year operating life, it can then produce 177 x 15 x 31,556,925 = 84.1 GJ/kg. This is thousands of times higher than the energy content of chemical rockets (10-15 MJ/kg). Your minimum mass for a given mission is then to use a lot of solar arrays to accelerate a small amount of fuel to high velocity, rather than use a lot of chemical fuel to accelerate itself to a much lower velocity.
