People get dazzled by these fake(ish) news stories about colonizing mars to make it a backup planet, harvesting platinum from the asteroids, and extracting helium 3 from lunar soil. This is [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/near-far-summary.html][Far bias]] -- exotica associated to exotica, with the cleverest sounding ideas being trumpeted loudest based on their suitability for status signaling purposes. The reality is much more interesting (albeit perhaps a lot harder to believe).

About 5% of asteroids are essentially made of steel alloy. Not ore (oxides) like we find here on earth's surface, but a mix of reduced, metallic nickle and iron. This is similar to what exists at the core of the earth and other planets, thanks to the relatively high density of these elements -- implying that the asteroids tend to be fragments of larger planetoids that were big enough to have a molten core. If you want to make iron on earth from surface materials, you have to spend energy removing the oxygen to turn it into metal, but in space it's already metal.

We can machine these metallic asteroids directly into canisters, support beams, mechanical parts etc. We can also melt them down and refine them further, producing higher grades of steel for example. A tiny trace amount of their content is platinum group metals, which are great for various electrochemical applications, so extraction of such materials may be worth doing -- but it's not the most practical near-term use. Making additional machines is. And if you did extract some of it, selling the platinum on earth would be the stupid way to use it -- you'd want to use it to make machines in space more efficiently, until you have so many that shipping things to earth becomes trivial and starts making economic sense.

A fairly high percentage of asteroids are carbonacious, "C-type" asteroids. They contain lots of carbon. They also contain hydrogen and other volatiles. Since they have some rocky parts, their composition is likely similar to asphalt. C-type asteroids can probably be mined for their hydrogen/water content by fairly simple heat treatment. Surround the asteroid with a plastic bag, heat it to a few hundred degrees, then allow the gas in the bag to cool back down, and you end up with volatiles like water.

One possible use for the hydrogen collected this way is as a chemical rocket fuel (reacted with oxygen). But this isn't necessarily as good of an idea as it sounds because it's usually going to be more efficient to use electromagnetic energy (focused solar, microwave, etc.) instead of chemical energy to heat your propellant atoms. Electromagnetic methods allow you to accelerate the atoms a lot faster than chemical rockets, so you use less reaction mass (albeit more energy per unit thereof). You can also use just about any kind of atom this way, whatever is most plentiful that you can afford to waste. (As it happens, oxygen is extremely plentiful in the asteroids, and makes a great propellant.) The reason propellant efficiency matters is mainly because gathering a lot of energy is usually easier than gathering matter.

[[/u/danielravennest]] can fact-check the above, I'm mostly cribbing from his comments in the past and [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods][his book]].

Where it gets really interesting is when you think about what happens when the space based industrial supply chain becomes robust enough that it produces all (or even most) of its own parts. (See also Dani's other book, [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories][Seed Factories]].) My take is that this is likely to be sooner than one would think, because the main reason we have trouble reproducing certain items is the energy cost. That is, we usually don't have any problem whatsoever in creating any given product or substance per se, rather, the tricky bit is always creating it without expending hundreds of dollars worth of energy per gram.

In space, however, energy is ultra-abundant. Not only can you concentrate sunlight easily with mirrors, your entire manufacturing operation can be moved closer to the sun to reduce the mirror area needed per watt of energy. Sunlight weakens [[http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/solar-radiation-in-space][based on a square law]], so to get to where sunlight is ten times as strong, you can go to around a third the distance from the sun. Energy efficiency is quite a bit less of a concern for space based industry than people are used to thinking of it as being.

As a rather extreme example of this, Robert Freitas [[http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.14.htm][proposed]] using a variant of the mass spectrometer to purify materials via tuned lasers and high-powered magnets. The pure materials are converted to jets of ionized matter and printed onto a surface to create specialized components. The mechanism is estimated to consume around 8800 MJ per gram of output (at a speed of 1.25 grams per second). That's hundreds of times the energy cost relative to what materials typically require to refine from raw ore (it would be $130/g or $130000/kg if you were paying 5 cents per kWh). However, by using a 11 MW solar power plant, he estimated that a 120 ton system could replicate itself entirely in about 3 years.

In terms of earth economics, you can think probably of better uses for an 11 MW solar power plant over 3 years than fabricating 120 tons of equipment. (That's 15 billion dollars worth of electricity at 5 cents a kWh.) However, the result includes another 11 MW power plant and omnivorous refinery/factory. This in turn doubles every 3 years, so you get exponential growth, and it keeps going on and on for as long as everything is kept organized and supplied with raw materials. After 30 years, that's 1024 plants, and the number of plants at 60 years is around a million, or a billion at 90 years, etc. A sort of energy based Moore's Law if you will.

However, the 3-year time is based on some assumptions that turn out to be rather absurdly conservative. First, that we would use no other more efficient means for manufacturing or refining than the (super inefficient) ionic separator/printer, despite having the ability to print up essentially any piece of equipment on site. Second, it assumes that we would remain at 1.0 AU for solar power collection purposes. The design only needs to radiate heat from about 1/70th of its total area, so the area needed for cooling is quite a bit less than the power collection area, and not really a bottleneck. Most of the mass is taken up by 77,000 square meters of mirrors. If we were to move the device to 0.3 AU, the mirror space required goes to around a tenth of that area. This implies replication rates of around a tenth the duration (0.3 years), just by moving to an orbit near Mercury. We could probably scale up another ten times by switching to more efficient manufacturing methods for the larger parts, which puts us down to a couple of weeks per replication.

Another thing the design doesn't account for is recent progress in material science. Graphene is now known to be a decent power collector, and can be [[http://phys.org/news/2008-07-graphene-strongest-material.html][absurdly thin]] while maintaining decent strength parameters. Carbon nanofibers can now be [[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/540706/researcher-demonstrates-how-to-suck-carbon-from-the-air-make-stuff-from-it/][electrolysized from lithium carbonate]], which can be created from the CO2 in our atmosphere, or the carbon of an asteroid. Methods to create graphene from carbon nanofibers probably also exist (e.g. chemical vapor deposition). At any rate, the energy investment needed for this is likely to be well under the 8800 GJ/kg of Freitas replicator. (Even 1 GJ/kg would be surprisingly high.) Also, the amount of mass needed drops dramatically if we assume much thinner panels.

What it basically comes down to is that setting up a whole Dyson sphere could only take a matter of weeks, given the capabilities of NASA or a comparable organization today. Well, we probably aren't psychologically capable of R&D cycles fast enough to get it down to literally taking only a few weeks (we'd hit various bottlenecks), but if someone were to allocate a trillion dollar budget to it, or if we were to assume a moderate superintelligence (like say an enhanced human, or a team of unenhanced natural geniuses) with access to NASA or SpaceX capabilities, it would probably get done within a matter of years to decades. A DS would require about 75 doublings if you start with a square meter and assume 0.3 AU is a suitable distance.

Actually, I don't think we really need any tech past 1980 or so to pull it off. If the people who went into the semiconductor industry had instead focused on self-replicating space machines, we'd probably have faster computers by now /and/ a Dyson sphere, not to mention no more global warming (other than what we choose), civilian access to space, power too cheap to meter, etc. This might have been a bit much for the politics of the Cold War era though, given the incredible potential a DS has as a WMD.

(The silicon chip transistor density could have been improved a lot faster with high-scale space based manufacturing / testing facilities, so Moore's Law is a big waste of time if you look at it from that perspective.)
