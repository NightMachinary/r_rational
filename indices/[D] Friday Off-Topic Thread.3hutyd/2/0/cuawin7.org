I'd say that the /institution/ of science has the /potential/ to be bad, if it's hijacked by something that's /not science/. Specifically, I think that the concept of an "expert consensus" could easily be used to convince quite rational people of false facts - and it wouldn't even need to be malicious; it could easily be the result of procedural error.
