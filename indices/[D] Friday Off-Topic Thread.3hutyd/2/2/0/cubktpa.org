  There's no sense in ideas like the paleo diet, whose adherents eat the way their evolutionary ancestors did, since the rest of their lives have changed in every way

I disagree. Eating the way our ancestors did before larger society actually makes a great deal of sense, since it is behavior closer to how our evolved bodies have functioned best. The fact that our other behaviors have changed does not speak to a lack of utility in that regression, particularly considering that a lot of our differently modern behaviors have negative effects to our physical and emotional health.

The "old way" regarding paleo is about nutrition. Human nutrition has not changed, and what we put into it has. One of the major points of the paleo diet is rejecting the temptation of the superstimuli added by sugars, fats, and other flavor additives in processed food. Superstimuli are in fact that "relatively small" change that humanity had never encountered before. What about removing that detrimental change is the naturalistic fallacy?

And in addition to that, it is a diet in the first place: a set of behaviors that make you mindful of what you eat and motivating you to keep your consumption in moderation. Diets are also cultural movements, and the more popular they are, the more goods are produced for them. Why would you not want unprocessed food to be freely available?
