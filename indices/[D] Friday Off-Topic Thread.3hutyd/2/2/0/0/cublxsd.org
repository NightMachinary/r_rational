I admit, I'm not a nutritionist and I haven't followed any specific diets barring some experiments in vegetarianism. So if there's any misconceptions I'm labouring under, I apologise for my ignorance.

This point, I agree with. All diets, and all healthy eating advice, agree that processed food is bad for you. Of course no sane person would claim that the extra sugar and salt in the modern diet is a good thing, but I haven't even seen anybody seriously claim they're neutral. Avoiding those superstimuli is an obvious thing to do.

And any diet - vegan, paleo, calorie-restricted, whatever - forces you to think about the food you're eating and make sensible decisions. In that way, the paleo diet is certainly better than nothing.

  I disagree. Eating the way our ancestors did before larger society actually makes a great deal of sense, since it is behavior closer to how our evolved bodies have functioned best. The fact that our other behaviors have changed does not speak to a lack of utility in that regression.

You don't know that. Your evolutionary ancestors might have spent their days hunting and been more active than the modern lifestyle of working at a computer. If you ate exactly what they did, you'd be eating too much and not burning enough calories. Some adjustment is necessary, not just in how much you eat but in the relative proportions of different nutrients - you presumably use less protein to build muscles than a more active person would. How much adjustment can you afford before your diet is no longer paleo?
