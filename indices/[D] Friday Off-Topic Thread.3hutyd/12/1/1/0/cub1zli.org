Is the manga of Log Horizon any good? The show sort of got... bad in the second season. The first season was amazingly good, but by half way through the second I was shouting at the screen because it was annoying me that much. There was a massive battle with dragons throughout an entire city, and all the main characters decided that clearly that was the time for a vaguely incomprehensible philosophy 101 level debate instead of actually saving the damn city. I don't know if they ran out of money for animating fight scenes or what, but it was bad.
