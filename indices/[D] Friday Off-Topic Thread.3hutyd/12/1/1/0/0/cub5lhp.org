Haven't read the manga, so I can't say.

I agree that the second season of the anime was nowhere near as good as the first season. As for the fight scenes, it had a different production company, but I'm not sure if that's the reason for it.

In terms of saving the city, there was some interesting stuff in there, but they didn't really optimize it or focus on it. Like [[#s][crafting]]

I liked Kanami's episode - I wish there had been more of it. Apparently that's a whole arc in the light novel series. Her adventuring party was super interesting. One of her party members being [[#s][a]] is amazing.
