Modern girl is transported to fantasy world, finds she has evil god powers, comedy hijinks ensue. Vaguely The Gamer-ish or otherwise similar to e.g. Log Horizon / Sword Art Online in that the protagonist has an inventory / stats screen / etc.

Not really to be taken seriously at all, or thought about too much.
