I hope I'm not being off topic by not being off topic enough, but what does [[/r/rational]] think about AARs? If you're not familiar, AARs (After Action Reports) are when people write about what they did in a play through of a game (edit: specifically complex strategy games, primarily ones made by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_Development_Studio][Paradox]]). Sometimes its very dry and technical and only appeals to players of the game. Other times, however, the writer creates a story based on what happened that is appealing even if you haven't played the game.

I recently read a very well written AAR called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/3fz3mi/the_black_france_saga_the_complete_fascist_french/][The Black France Saga]]. What it made me realize is that story-based AARs are essentially rational fiction by default. This is because the plot is tied to a game with set self-consistent mechanics and the characters involved are often the player and the AI who are solving problems "through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources". Basically all the bullet points in the sidebar under "Characteristics of Rational Fiction". Of course, it doesn't necessarily have to work out so nicely. For example, the author can insert non-rational genre type explanations for certain aspects of the world that are abstracted by the game. Nevertheless, I think story based AARs are definitely compatible with the rational genre.
