History is always rational. Rational fiction is an attempt to write a most empirically-sound (consistent) setting, and irrationality is a most extant thing. History is the world canon, and everything that happens in it is consistent. Rationalist fiction is fiction focusing on characters that learn about and use rationalist principles. And in history, there are certainly people who are more rational than others. But most of all, players of strategy games try to be as effective as possible, and that's really what rationality is about: effectiveness.
