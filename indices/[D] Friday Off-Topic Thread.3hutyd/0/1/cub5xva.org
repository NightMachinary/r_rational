A lot of them read like non-fictional history books, in a good way. I'm sort of on the fence on whether I consider history to be rational; it meets the baseline standards, except when people do irrational things. (I've often wondered why counterfactual history wasn't really a genre; there's alt-history, but it's almost always prose instead of written as in-universe reference material.)

Thanks for linking the Black France Saga; it reads very well (though I've always been a CK or EU guy when it comes to Paradox games).
