Yeah I agree, especially about the AARs that have actually been made. Although, I do think there's a lot of room for more personal, less history-ish stories, especially coming from CK.

That's especially true of game play-through stories not considered AARs because of the game genre, like [[https://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/alice-and-kev/][Alice and Kev]] (I forget how rational that story is, I just remember it being personal and touching).

In terms of the rational genre-ness of it, I definitely think the stories hit the four bullet points in the side bar (especially since the characters involved generally act rationally) but what constitutes the rational genre is a bit nebulous in a way that those bullet points don't quite cover.

Related, I'm thinking of posting a few of the quality/rational story AARs to the subreddit, do you think that's a good idea?

You'll have to speak up, its hard to hear what you're saying over the sound of how glorious Victoria II is.
