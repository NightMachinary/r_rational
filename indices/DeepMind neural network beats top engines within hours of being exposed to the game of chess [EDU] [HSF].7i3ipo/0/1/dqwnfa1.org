As you can see, the asymptotes are different. Since the x-axis is a log plot, a constant factor difference in hardware throughput corresponds to a horizontal translation. You can see that you would presumably need a translation of much greater than 100x (about 2/3 the width of the graph) for Stockfish to catch up in this range, and because the asymptotes are different this would not hold for long.

I am not sure how hash tables come into this, but I believe making it larger would only act as a small linear speed improvement, so the above analysis holds.

In other words, AlphaZero is intrinsically stronger in the limit of feasible computation.
