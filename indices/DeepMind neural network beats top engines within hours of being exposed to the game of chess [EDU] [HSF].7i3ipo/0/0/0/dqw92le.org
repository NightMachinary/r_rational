AlphaZero played on 4 TPUs. Stockfish's played on 64CPU cores, they don't say what model processor but I'll assume a modern high end processor.

1TPU can do 180TFLOPs according to Google and a typical high end, 8 core CPU can barely manage 1 usually. If AlphaZero were playing on a 64 core CPU (which it can, because it uses Tensorflow) it would have roughly 1/90th of it's current processing power going off my numbers above. For reference, Stockfish playing against itself with 1/90th of the processing power is a stomp.

Edit: And this doesn't even go into how badly configured Stockfish was. A 1GB hash is nothing for 64 cores of processing power. You're looking at more like 25GB normally. Meanwhile, IIRC AlphaZero had 250GB of memory to use.
