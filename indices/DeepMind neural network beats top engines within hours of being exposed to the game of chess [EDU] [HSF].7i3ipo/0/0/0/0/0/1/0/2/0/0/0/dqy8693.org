  we don't have figures for the energy consumption of TPUs

We know a bunch of this stuff for first-gen TPUs.

#+begin_quote
  The TPU die area is less than half that of the Haswell eighteen core CPU and Nvidia's Tesla K80 GPUs (the preferred solutions at the time), which yields a much lower rating of 75W, compared to 145W and 150W, respectively. Idle power consumption is higher than a GPU, but lower than a CPU.

See also [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04760.pdf]] for a much more in-depth view of that older chip; I haven't read it all. I suspect that, unless they have radically modified their goals with the second generation chip, AlphaZero had a comparable thermal envelope to Stockfish.
