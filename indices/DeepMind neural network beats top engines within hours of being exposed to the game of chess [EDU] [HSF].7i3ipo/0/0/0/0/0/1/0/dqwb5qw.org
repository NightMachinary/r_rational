When you compare a chess engine to /anything/, you have to specify how much processing power you're giving it. Note that processing power /is not/ positions evaluated per second. Your scenario at the end shows that.

I'll give you an example. Say we're comparing two other engines, Komodo and Houdini. When we compare them, we give them the same hardware and say "whoever wins the most games is better". We don't say "whoever processes the fewest positions is better". We also don't give one machine significantly more powerful hardware. This is like having a gladiator fight and giving one side a gun. You clearly can't say it was a fair match when one side is given a huge advantage like that. So, if you want to evaluate Stockfish and AlphaZero, you do the same. You put them on the same hardware and say "whoever wins the most games is best". You don't say "whoever evaluates positions most smartly is best" or "whowever evaluates the least positions is best". The only decider of which is better is which wins the most games.

Note, at the same time, you can't evaluate whether a human or an engine is better. This is because an engine without a computer to run on doesn't even play chess. You need to evaluate whether a human or an engine with a specified amount of hardware is better.
