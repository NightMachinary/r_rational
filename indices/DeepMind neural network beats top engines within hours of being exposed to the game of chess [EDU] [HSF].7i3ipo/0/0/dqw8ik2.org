There were graphs for that in the paper. Yes, at very short turn lengths, Stockfish performed better. However, 1 minute was enough time for AlphaZero to win convincingly, and that's not long for chess.

I also didn't see any indication that Stockfish was particularly underpowered; what's your source for that? Would Stockfish have been capable of properly utilising the type of hardware that powered AlphaZero? Because if not, then that's an important finding in itself, just as GPUs have replaced CPUs for cryptography.
