After AlphaGo came out, there were obvious questions about chess and as a (lower class) chess player I was waiting for something like this to be obviously good. I /was/ however expecting a NN to optimize using the far larger electronic infrastructure of chess in contrast to Go. Surpisingly it seems they have gone for the complete from scratch method which I suppose is the more interesting method. Throwing away years of documented optimization, not even using it as a kickstart, in favor of avoiding local minima is not something I would have chosen with my hardware to say the least.

Looking forward to seeing how this pans out.
