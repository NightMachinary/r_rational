I disagree.

If you train a (forward fed)neural net on trying to predict the outcome of factorial on training data for 1-100; its going to be very wrong about what 1000 is.

Its a naturally recursive problem while the forward fed part of it means it can't use loops.

The minmax algorithm is recursive and a natural part of turn based games
