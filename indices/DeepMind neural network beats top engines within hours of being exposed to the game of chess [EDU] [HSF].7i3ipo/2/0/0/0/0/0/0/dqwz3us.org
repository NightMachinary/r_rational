With exponential games and processing time and size of the net

It could at best make a lookup table of sorts. Much like factorial problem, imagine the neural net that solves factorial for 1-5; designing one by hand to solve 1-5 perfectly? what happens if you put 10 in it?

They used a min max trees for a reason; don't buy the hype, you can't solve all problem by adding numbers together; you need access to loops and real conditionals but you can't give access to those tools to the way we train neural nets.
