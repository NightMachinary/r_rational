  you can't solve all problem by adding numbers together; you need access to loops and real conditionals

First, what is your source for your assertion? AlphaZero has just placed several striking data points; if you discount them, what backs you up?

Second, computers implement loops and conditionals by...adding numbers together.

  what happens if you put 10 in it?

Again, this is a false equivalence. Iiuc you're basically saying that if you play a game that wasn't among the hundreds of thousands used for practice, then AlphaGo will perform poorly. But the point of that practice wasn't to memorise hundreds of thousands of potential playthroughs; it was smarter than that, using those runs to gather more generalisable guidelines for which moves tend to succeed or fail. As evidenced by its performance against new opponents.
