  Alpha go is not a neural net, its a neural net with a minmax tree heart.

None of the Alpha* line use minimax. They use monte-carlo.

This is all a silly argument, though. You can just look at the multiple data points of how strong a player AlphaGo or AlphaZero are when you limit search depth to zero. There's no advantage in trying to guess the data when it's available.
