  /You do exactly what they ended up actually doing/: you give Stockfish strong-enough hardware that its absolute speed advantage--in terms of nodes searched per second--is far greater than AlphaZero's
#+end_quote

Not sure I agree; AlphaZero evaluates fewer moves because it uses a different algorithm, not because of a hardware deficit. They are still expected to use comparable hardware to some degree; clearly Stockfish on a Raspberry Pi is far weaker than on a 64 core monster, but it'll probably still outpace AlphaZero on a moves-evaluated basis.

I agree that the hardware shouldn't be /equal/, though, and that forcing AlphaZero to use a CPU would be silly.
