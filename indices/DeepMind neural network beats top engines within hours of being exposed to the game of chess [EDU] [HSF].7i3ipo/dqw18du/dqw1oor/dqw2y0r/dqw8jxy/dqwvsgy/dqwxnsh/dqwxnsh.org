  it's going to be very wrong about what 1000 is.

I don't see how this analogy applies. Maybe if AlphaZero played only partial games against itself, then that would align with what you're suggesting; however, when you run through hundreds of thousands of complete games looking for winning strategies, then "best move at this point" and "move that will best handle the situation in 5 turns" converge. In fact, it will do even better; it won't just look ahead for 5 turns, but for the entire game.
