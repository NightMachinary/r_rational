Depending on the limitations, this could work, given sufficient resources. For example, no one said they have to be live humans. Can't we set up some sort of corpse freezing and shipping process? Especially if these creatures aren't vulnerable to mundane diseases?

If they, for some reason, need freshly killed humans, then I think we'd have no choice but to exterminate them, assuming their energy costs aren't something really low like one human every year. We can't support their species.

It also makes no sense in a natural environment that they would only be able to eat humans, so there appear to be some supernatural/artificial shenanigans at work here. Perhaps hacking those is an option? If not, then yea. Genocide a go.
