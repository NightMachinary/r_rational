When thinking of morality, I like to divide judgement of the action and judgement of the person. It works wonders for actions with unintended consequences, where you can say that a misguided attempt at good that ends up doing evil makes the action evil but the person still remains good, but I think it can apply here too.

As expressed, it is possible that no one deserves to die, and thus killing anyone is an evil action. With this divide, it would not matter if the person killing wants the killing to happen or not, it is an evil action. But by the same token the action being evil does not make the person evil or good, since judgements on a person can only be based on their intentions.

If we can assume that our vampire does not want to kill people, then you could say that her intentions are not evil, since she does not want anyone to die for the sake of their death. With the divide, you could conclude to say that our vampire is a good person doing evil actions.

This is all snapshot-level judgement, though. It doesn't contain the decision of the most moral action based off of this knowledge. Under that perspective, the question is not 'is the vampire evil?' but 'does the vampire's life cause more evil than good?' Even if you can say that the vampire is not an evil person, the vampire is the cause of evil actions, possibly enough to say that the vampire's continued existence will cause more harm than good. In such a case, it would be regrettable to end the life of a good person like the vampire, but it would be the right thing to do, for the sake of her victims.

Anyways, that's just how I look at it, and there are a good deal of assumptions there, like the assumption that there is absolutely no way, now or ever, for the vampire to be allowed to survive without eating humans, and that the vampire truly does not desire the killing she is responsible for, and so on and so forth.
