Interesting.

I don't think that doing what you must in order to eat can be evil. It seems rather odd that some species must eat humans, with no possible substitute; but given that premise, I don't think it would be evil for them to do so.

That said, I still might try to stop them, not because I think that they're evil, but as a simple matter of self-defence. There would be a clear incompatibility between our species, such that even if we respect each other, we still can't peacefully coexist.
