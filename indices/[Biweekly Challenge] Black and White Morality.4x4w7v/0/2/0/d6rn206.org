Thank you.

I think the same things. The incompatibility interests me most. I think that the creatures are in a precarious position. The death of the entirety of either species spells their ruin.

They aren't evil under my normal definition, but I think a different and reasonable definition could label them as evil. If 'evil' just means 'severely against my goals in a way I cannot compromise with,' the hypothetical creatures are evil. Even then, others may be willing to compromise.

Having to exterminate them would be a tragedy.
