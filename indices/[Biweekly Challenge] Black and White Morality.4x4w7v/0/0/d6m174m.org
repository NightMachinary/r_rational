What does your flair mean? I can't figure it out. Is it something to do with construction? Videogame cheats? Or is it some sort of joke about anagram stoichiometry from "The Study of Anglophysics"? Or is it just a nonsense sentence designed to look like it means something so that people will wonder what it means? Sorry if this is a bit off topic but I really really want to know.
