No problem. It's a metaphor. It's easier to physically use a window like a door than it is to use a wall like a window (see through walls). Similarly, it is easier to go to places you can see than it is to see places invisible to you. Translating the flair would be "Turning the unknown into the known is harder than putting the known to use." Also my name is blasted0glass, feel free to imagine me breaking windows. Explosively.
