I'm glad that you mentioned it. In the inspiration (Touhou) it is supernatural shenanigans--but they don't rule out just eating corpses as far as I can tell, so it would probably be a non-issue there. For the story I wrote, might as well imagine that the humans have to be alive and neurologically intact for it to work. That preserves the difficulty of the problem.

Another possibility: volunteers. Maybe soon-to-die but generous people would donate themselves. The creatures might have something they could bargain with, too, to pay volunteers' next of kin.
