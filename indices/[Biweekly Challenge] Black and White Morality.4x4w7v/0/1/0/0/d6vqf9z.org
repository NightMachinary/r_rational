With Gensokyo, there's tons of possibilities. They could eat fairies, who get better. The same goes for the characters that used the Hourai elixir. There's apparently some lady with a bag of legs that asks you if you want one. Instead of changing the subject and leaving like they're supposed to, people could be encouraged to take the legs, then give them to the youkai to eat. Eirin is a doctor from the moon, and I wouldn't be surprised if she could regrow human flesh. Sanae can perform miracles. Perhaps she could do her own version of Jesus's famous feeding a crowd. And last of all, they can just kill people. This is a world where reincarnation is confirmed. Humans get better too. It just takes longer than with fairies, and they have amnesia afterwards.

But I guess this takes place before they moved to Gensokyo.
