Our sidebar'd characteristics of rational fiction are a /little/ more precise than that!

#+begin_quote
  The general characteristics of a rational fic:

  - The characters are not stupid. No one holds the Idiot Ball (or at least not the main heroes or main villains).

  - The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

  - The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

  - Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

  - The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

  Bonus points:

  - The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena.

  - The story teaches sound lessons about rationalist techniques, which can be applied to readers' lives.

  - The story hints at or embraces transhumanist ideals.

  - The story deals with the dangers and potential of powerful new technology.
