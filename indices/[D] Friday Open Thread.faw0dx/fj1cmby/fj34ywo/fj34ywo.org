As a fan of the Infinity Engine games (BG1&2, PS:T, IWD) and Larian's games, I think this is a good change.

We've got a variety of Real-Time-With-Pause and none of them have great combat. Since Divinity Original Sin 2 (Larian's previous game) came out, we've seen a number of high profile isometric RPGs in the form of Pillars of Eternity 2, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Torment:Tides of Numenara, and Tyranny. None of them have good combat. Pillars2 is probably the best of the bunch, and it's RTWP combat isn't even as good as the turn based mode they slapped onto it after launch.

The original series really doesn't capture D&D and frankly /can't/ capture 5e, where combat is drastically more complex than 2nd edition. Infinity Engine Baldur's Gate games aren't exactly interactive either. They involve right clicking on an enemy and occasionally casting a spell... or pausing at the end of every turn anyways and effectively turning it into a turn based game manually.

5e has a lot more stuff. Every class has multiple special actions to do each round, and you need to control multiple characters. There's no way to do that with RTWP (unless you invest heavily into AI and allow the player to program it, eg Dragon Age Origins). Even simple things like having an archer do a fall back action while shooting the enemy are practically infeasible without turn-based combat.

I copying the tabletop is not important to me. I think turn based is the better solution for the system entirely regardless of it being accurate to the tabletop, and it's just a bonus that it's also accurate to the tabletop.
