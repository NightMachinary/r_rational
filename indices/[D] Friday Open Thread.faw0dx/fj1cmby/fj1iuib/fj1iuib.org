Isn't it relatively easy to add Real Time with Pause to a turn based game? It just needs you to be able to queue multiple orders and have a "turn passes every x seconds" added in?

LitRPG: The Game sounds fantastic, just include a in game copy of Wikipedia(with only medieval pages) and a spreadsheet!
