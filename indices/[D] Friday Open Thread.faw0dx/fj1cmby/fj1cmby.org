[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrIxrFqSbHQ][Baldur's Gate 3 gameplay]] has been revealed yesterday and some part of the fandom is bummed it is Turn Based instead of Real Time with Pause like the original games. What is your preference in this regard with RPGs where each of the party members have dozens of skills and spells? Should a video game try to simulate the tabletop game its system is based on or rather go its own way?

Also, when are we gonna get the LitRPG: The Game where an average nerdy teen, who memorized Wikipedia and also deeply knowledgeable in medieval war strategy and siege engine construction, gets stranded on a gritty fantasy world desperately in need of a saver, filled with extremely beautiful women of every kind, each of whom find him irresistible in their own unique way?
