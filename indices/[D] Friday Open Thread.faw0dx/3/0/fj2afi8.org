CDC says:

#+begin_quote
  It's important to note that current global circumstances suggest *it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic*. /[edited for emphasis]/
#+end_quote

That text is buried partway down their [[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html][situation summary]] page. They also say, "For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low." They don't talk about individual preparation, and to say a pandemic is likely but individual risk is /at this time/ low -- it's a bit of a mixed message(!).
