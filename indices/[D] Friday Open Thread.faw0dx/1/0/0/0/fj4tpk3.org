Larian's own Divinity Original Sin 2 is the gold standard of turn based games. Presumably their success with that game is /why/ they were tapped for Baldur's Gate 3. If we're branching outside of cRPGs, then top current turn based combat games are probably XCOM2/Battletech/SlaytheSpire/IntotheBreach/40k:Mechanicus(sorta), none of which could be even remotely adapted to D&D.

Regarding time, D&D is very decisive. Even BG1&2. A single successful sleep spell will just /end/ a combat. Larian is very well suited to this, because they're one of the few teams that allow you to actually decide combats this way. In D:OS2, you can run into a number of combats that you're allowed to trivialize if you have a particular build that works well. Meanwhile they don't force you into trash encounters; every combat is a lethal one to some kind of build. Contrast to Pillars of Eternity 2 or Pathfinder Kingmaker, where they both toss in a bunch of minor encounters as well as make most nontrivial fights involve golem/elemental-magicimmune-bullshit monsters so that you're forced to slog through. (I would also like to note that all of those successful turn based games are generally also very decisive as well.)

As for dozens of combatants, neither D&D nor turn based isn't particularly well suited for large combats, so the simple answer is that you either don't or you use AOE. Frozen Synapse can pull it off in a turn based system, but that's not a great plan.

--------------

First, it's different than BG2 in that by midgame every character will by using multiple abilities per turn and moving, and they'll all be making meaningful combat decisions. In BG2, each character can basically stand still and cast once a round most of the time.

Second, even BG2 fell apart as a real-time-with-pause game. Its combat is not great. In any sort of non-trivial encounter you /have/ to automatically pause as soon as combat starts. Then you automatically pause every time you finish a spell. Then you automatically pause whenever you're hit with a spell or ability. Then you automatically pause whenever a target dies so you can retarget.

That's just turn based with extra steps.
