I /think/ the intention is to better represent a tabletop experience, but it does remove a lot of the nuance that existed in older crpg dialogue.

My hope is that a lot of that is instead replaced with contextual actions/events based on actions you've taken instead and that this is a compromise to making that work and not just a weird gimmick that gets tiring.
