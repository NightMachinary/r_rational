Some amateur mental exercises I've been working with finally paid off.

Last night, after some miscellaneous odd experiences, I found myself in an office/cubicle setting, starting a few discussions amongst a group of a half-dozen or so about how our various plans should change given that the laws of physics were a bit looser than they used to be, as demonstrated by such details as several of the group being furries, and that I could levitate by standing, and folding my legs crosslegged without my head getting any lower. Some points raised included that trying to base a plan on QALYs had all sorts of problems, and not just because of how hard they were to measure, but they could serve as a placeholder until someone came up with a better approach; which new tricks any of us could now do provided enough value that we should start leveraging them immediately, and which other members of the office we should yoink from their current projects; and whether to spin off a separate group to investigate whether tropes and narrative had any measurable force.

Then things started getting a bit hazy, somebody shouted "Red King! It's a Red King scenario, everyone!", and one of my group (a red-haired, horse-headed woman) ran up to me, grabbed my upper arms and looked into my eyes, and ordered me, "Remember as much as you can."

Afterwards, I found myself pleased that I've finally absorbed the concept of "I notice that I am confused", and making regular checks of reality's reality-ness, sufficiently to start applying them even when I'm asleep. I'm looking forward to tonight with a certain amount of hope that last night wasn't a one-off.
