Ghost In The Shell, Psycho-Pass, and Shinsekai Yori all have cohesive worldbuilding and deal with themes that are popular here. Kino's Journey has an inconsistent (from episode to episode) but thought provoking world. Spice And Wolf is just economics and a slow romance plot. The Devil Is A Part Timer is primarily a comedy but derives a lot of its humor from characters handling its absurd premise like responsible, reasonable people.
