Thanks for linking that video. I had no idea that BG3 was in the works. I have to say, it feels really weird to see a melding of the isometric perspective and art design from the Divinity games with a more over-the-shoulder style gameplay.

In my experience, the downside of 'real time with pause' is that it's more difficult/annoying to precisely time reactions to enemy attacks, maximize buff or CC duration, etc. I'd only prefer that system in cases when combat isn't challenging enough to encourage micromanaging strategy.

I've played isometric RPGs with each type of turn-based combat, and in my opinion either method can be fun as long as the difficulty/complexity is balanced well enough to match.
