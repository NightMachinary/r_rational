The short answer is not without it being janky. Obsidian Entertainment devs talked about how it's not at all a simple change when they added a turn-based option to POE2 from a previous Real-Time-With-Pause system.

Take for example a rogue doing a falling retreat against a number of foes. In turn based, each turn he throw a dagger at an enemy with his right hand (combat action), scatters some caltrops with his left hand (bonus action), and all while falling back from the enemy as far as he can move (move action). In RTWP you'd have to have some kind of parallel queue system where you track each hand independently or have it pause at literally every action meaning it takes even longer than turn based would.

Balance and encounter design gets totally shuffled too. Imagine an enemy mage casting sleep twice, then slitting your party's throats while they can't fight back. That's fine in turn based because you can react, but unplayable in real-time-with-pause because it's an instawipe if you fail to pause within 6 seconds.
