Well, what are some turn-based games with good combat then? My concern with turn based is that combat will take too long when there are a lot of enemies and frankly be immersion-breaking. How would a fight with dozens of enemies work without turning into a slog?

>Every class has multiple special actions to do each round, and you need to control multiple characters. There's no way to do that with RTWP

How is this any different than BG2? Can't Larian take any liberties when adapting 5e? They cut and modified a lot of AD&D stuff when making the original games.
