So your solution is throwing only level appropriate challenges to the players? That is pretty antithetical to the idea of RPGs tabletop or otherwise.

>As for dozens of combatants, neither D&D nor turn based isn't particularly well suited for large combats

See, that's what my gripe is all about. D&D is unsuited but a computer game doesn't have to be. They could have found a way to implement 5e while having a more immersive and realistic gameplay but they chose to implement the tabletop experience. They even have the dice rolling on the screen for gods sake! It's good for the multiplayer option probably though.
