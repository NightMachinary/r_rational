  So your solution is throwing only level appropriate challenges to the players? That is pretty antithetical to the idea of RPGs tabletop or otherwise.

No, actually I said the opposite.

  In D:OS2, you can run into a number of combats that you're allowed to trivialize if you have a particular build that works well. Meanwhile they don't force you into trash encounters; every combat is a lethal one to some kind of build.

Some challenges you can handle well above your level. Some challenges your group cannot handle unless you cheese or overlevel it.

Also, there's nothing realistic about dozens of people attacking a person who can kill all of them. Human(oid) psychology does not work that way. Combat takes place between opponents who are roughly equally matched, because if they aren't then one side either surrenders or runs away. Maybe in open warfare, but if you're complaining that this is a D&D game instead of an RTS, I don't even know what to say to you. Small group combat does exist, and turn-based combat handles that perfectly fine.
