Read Unsong and wanted to discuss it and then realized all my friends were Black, and its use of race is pretty bad. North Africans not having souls is one thing. But then making Obama a demon, the most prominent Black character a demon, and having a very white cast is not a good look. As far as I can tell, the only non-demon African-Black character was literally bred because of her heritage.
