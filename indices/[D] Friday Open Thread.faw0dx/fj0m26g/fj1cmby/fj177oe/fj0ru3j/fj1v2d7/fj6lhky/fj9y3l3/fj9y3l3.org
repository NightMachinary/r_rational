  I'm looking forward to tonight with a certain amount of hope that last night wasn't a one-off.

Welp, the only part of my dream which was coherent enough for a narrative centred around the concept "I only need one more course to graduate", and for which the most exotic detail was "The school now offers a course-stream which is designed to lead toward's a pilot's license"; which, while certainly unexpected enough to be surprising, didn't manage to trigger my "am I in reality?" reflex.

Given how little effort is required for my current version of reality-testing - call it half a minute - then despite its lack of sensitivity, maybe I should work more on remembering to give it a try whenever I'm surprised by even seemingly-mundane new info.
