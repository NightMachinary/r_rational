A partial, but encouraging, success last night. In a dream set in a Groundhog Day time-loop scenario, involving trying to improve physics simulations of the long-term fate of the universe (in which I happened to know of an important theoretical prediction that doesn't shop up in most of the standard, or even well-known non-standard, theories), I was able to come up with the idea "If narrativium has the force of physical law, which tropes are currently in play?", realize, "Oh, I'm the /an/tagonist," adjust my behaviour to take advantage of some of the relevant tropes (without actually crossing the line into villainy), and get much better results.

I didn't figure out that I was dreaming; I was too focused on the time-loop thing. But it's more self-awareness than I generally manage to achieve, so I'm willing to call it progress in the right direction.
