So, I've got a partner coming to visit me in Australia from France for the month of March via Singapore. Currently there are no cases in my entire Texas-sized state except for two people who caught it on a cruise ship and were evacuated back to their home state and have been in isolation the whole time.

Singapore has a lot of cases, 'tis true, but if you can get it in Singapore airport then my city is doomed because we have planefuls of people going back and forth there several times a day.

I'm wondering what chances there will be of, in the next month, travel restrictions preventing him from leaving / preventing him from arriving home (as it is, his business would require him to work from home for 2 weeks as a precaution if he returned today, because of the Singapore transit). I wonder how that will interfere with immigration (if it's Huge Isolation Deal, I'm assuming there'd be some sort of waiver for people forced to overstay their visas, but perhaps I'm giving governments everywhere too much credit).

I'm hoping this will turn out like Swine Flu - a Big Deal, but not changing the fabric of society. It's really surreal, it feels like being part of a movie or TV show at the early part before the plague kills everyone. I'm hopeful, though, because even though it's probably going to spread almost everywhere (my city's relative global isolation, though significantly smaller isolation from China, only gives me hope that we can avoid it until treatment/vaccine comes out), the death rate is low, especially among young healthy people like me.

In terms of prepping we've purchased extra beans, pasta and rice. We have a comically overstocked pantry at the best of times and I think we could probably feed the four of us for a month, maybe two, if it came to that. I'm content with this because at the point where home quarantine for more than two months becomes advisable, or food becomes that scarce, the government is going to need to do something / we're all going to be living Mad Max stylez.

I don't know what else I can really do that isn't completely misguided. I'm not stockpiling water (we need way too much for that to be practical). I don't think medication or medical equipment is going to be much help to me. I don't /want/ weapons in my house and even pepper spray is a mission to acquire here.

So, I'm just sitting here hoping that some extra beans in my pantry will make my apocalypse more pleasant, which also feels misguided.
