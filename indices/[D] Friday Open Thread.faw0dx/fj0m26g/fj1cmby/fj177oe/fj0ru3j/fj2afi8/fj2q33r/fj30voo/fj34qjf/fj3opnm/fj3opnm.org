On the premise that this can't really be avoided, the main thing seems to be to avoid getting sick when everyone else is sick. At peak infection health care systems are likely to be overcrowded even in rich countires, which spikes death rates.

Getting sick early guarantues you hospital care and you roll the die for your age/predisposition class. Older people are more likely to die and any of [around 6.0% for people with cancer, hypertension or chronic respiratory disease, 7.3% for those with diabetes and 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease]. Robin Hanson over on overcomingbias even argues weakly for intentional early infection! Unfortunately early infection does not guarantuee immunity, the data is still out on that. (one patient tested positive weeks after their first bout of the illness).

Early infection is to be evaluated against late infection, on the tail end of distribution. You should be able to get hospital care after peak infection (expanded capabilites as in China) and much more will be known about the disease.

To me it seems like european governments are massively underreacting.
