So I gave this one a go... I see why you recommended it. The way they do battles and combine powers /is/ nicely rational. I turned it off after episode 7 though, because as good as some aspects are, I can't get over how being suddenly trapped in a video game isn't setting off an existential crisis in most players. It's like none of them even care that they're trapped in a video game, they don't even discuss the idea of trying to find a way out! When I turned it off they were only just beginning to think long-term. It's not /completely/ unbelievable, but enough for me.

Still, thanks for the suggestion! LH wasn't even on my radar before now.
