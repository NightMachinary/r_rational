If we consider that the 'source material' is itself so incredibly racist it inspires an Apartheid state to this day, I'd say UNSONG deals with race quite well.

And I'd argue Malia Ngo is a Kabbalistic representation of the American Dream. She was born in the platonic ideal of rough neighborhoods to a mother too tortured to care for her properly and an unknown father. The neighborhood itself was patrolled by untrustworthy, violent 'people' with the backing of a government built to oppress her mother and everyone like her. She had to learn to take care of herself from a young age, because nobody else would. Despite this, she had a lucky break and managed to escape the bad neighborhood, and parleyed this success into more and more power, until she stood at the head of the most powerful organization on the planet. An organization specifically designed to collect weapons to use against the government which had oppressed her.
