Damn, I missed this story on its week off. It isn't written the best, and the prose is a bit boring, but the implications are great and the world is unfolding at a believable pace. I'm starting to actually care about the players too, which is interesting.

A couple chapters ago, I requested the author add character sheets for important players to be updated at the end of chapters so we can keep track of their progress. I don't think it's necessary anymore.
