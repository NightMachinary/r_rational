/Leadership I/ skill is attention-grabbing. I'm guessing that the status effects show as a Buff, but last as long as the player is grouped.

/[Choose one of the following group leader status effects to set as active. The choice may only be changed once every full day and night cycle:]/

- /[8% boost to speed and acceleration.]/

- /[10% boost to reflexes.]/

- /[10% boost to physical defense.]/

- /[5% boost to all five elemental resistances.]/

- /[20% boost to debuff resistance.]/

- /[1.5x boost to natural recovery effects.]/

- /[8% boost to EP regeneration.]/

- /[15% boost to all NP gains.]/

The EP regeneration in particular looks very tempting, but the NP boost is still the clear winner. Note that while these effects can only be changed once per day, group membership looks far more dynamic. You could have leaders specialized by situation. For example, Maya could opt to take the 8% boost to EP recovery and swap players into her group to allow them to recharge more quickly.

This skill's interaction when two or more leaders are grouped together could also be interesting. Maybe only one leader is allowed, but it's also possible - and somewhat in the nature of the game - that everyone brings something to the table. A group could have six of the eight effects listed running simultaneously.

It'd also be interesting to see how this interacts with skills such as /Improved Heart I/. Maya could get her EP recovery up to 140.4% (130% x 108%).
