Thanks for the feedback. I do have a tendency to over explain things.

Getting words on paper has never been an issue for me as I crank out these 9k word chapters every week. My first drafts are usually 11k words or longer so editing mostly consists of figuring out how much of my musings and analysis to delete to make it readable. Then I end up adding a bunch more analysis in its place which I then subsequently go back and chop through again.

If I hire a professional editor at some point to go over my whole story, I imagine pointing out the fluff that still needs to be cut will be the major focus of their efforts.

Ironically, I even probably over explained in this comment. :P
