Stuff that players really need to try:

- Dam up part of the creek and try swimming (attempt to unlock a /Swim I/ skill). Players may not know how to swim; swimming may be required for other parts of the arena. /Language I/ skill implies that the nanites are willing to grant basic skills to allow for shortcomings due to origin or culture. Also, complete immersion in water may unlock a Water Prime skill.

- Climb a tree. As with swimming, above, this is something many players may simply not know how to do very well, and may open options in the Arena. It's also a convenient escape if confronted with a monster too dangerous to defeat.

- Always treat injuries through mundane means if possible. Get everyone /First Aid I/ skill ASAP. Can also earn NPs this way.

- Draw a map of the lands near the encampment. /Maps I/ skill might be unlocked this way.

- Attempt to channel or transfer both EPs and NPs from player to player, following the Generation cycle (i.e. Nathan to Asahi; Asahi to Lilly; Lilly to Ilya; Ilya to Emma; Emma to Nathan).

- Plant a nut. See if Wood allows food to be grown by using EPs.

- Despite how grotesque as it is, cleave a dead Horned Beaver under the effect of /Harvest Monster I/ into several smaller pieces, then separate them. See what vanishes and what remains.

- /Edit: Adjust nicknames to see if they can be used for long range communication! If non-leaders can see their nicknames at ranges greater than 100 feet, this can permit one-way messages to be sent across the arena./

- /Edit: Attempt to Fuse Lilly's headdress with her wristband to give her a Heads-Up Display./
