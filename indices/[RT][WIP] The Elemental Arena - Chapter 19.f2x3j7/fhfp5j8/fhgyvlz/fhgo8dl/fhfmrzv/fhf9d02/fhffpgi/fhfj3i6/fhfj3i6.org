  In other news, Nathan is probably going to feel obligated to grind his Analyze Enemy skill since it provides a boost to crafting.

This skill is starting to look very critical. Nathan has the affinity, but needs NPs and a couple more Mental to upgrade it. He'll have to obtain or upgrade a Mental skill to get there. (/Language II/ would do this at the cost of an additional 40 NPs - ouch.)

Knocking the EP cost down from 8 to 6 or so would be great. It isn't clear if the upgrade would get him more info or simplify skill use. Maybe both?
