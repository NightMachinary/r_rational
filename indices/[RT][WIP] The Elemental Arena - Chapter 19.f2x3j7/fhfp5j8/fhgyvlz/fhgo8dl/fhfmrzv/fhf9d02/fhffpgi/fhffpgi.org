There are some other optimizations you could pursue with Leadership. While I think it would be overly optimistic that players could join multiple groups at the same time, so only one active effect per person, You could get some extra benefit by having multiple leaders running different effects at once. So between battles, everyone groups up to the EP boost leader, then right before combat switches to the NP boost. Or, depending on how quickly everyone can switch between leaders what with the bracelet touching and menu fiddling, have a third leader with some combat boost, then switch to NP before killing the last enemy.

In other news, Nathan is probably going to feel obligated to grind his Analyze Enemy skill since it provides a boost to crafting. He would do well to test if it can be activated remotely via rock-throwing like his other skills. What they really need to do is figure out some kind of rope or vine setup, use the skill on a rock tied to the end, then swing it around until it hits something. No unlucky misses that way.
