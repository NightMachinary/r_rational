For what it's worth, it is possible to have eastward gravity like that. It just can't be sustained. You can cause it by accelerating the Earth west. It's similar to how if you run an increasing electric current clockwise through a wire, it will induce a counterclockwise current around it.

If you sustain it, you get an interesting problem they don't mention. As a photon falls, its energy grows, which means that it's frequency increases. Since it can't change the number of periods the electromagnetic wave goes through, it must change the time. This is gravitational time dilation.

Suppose you have a fiber-optic cable wrapping around the horizon. Let's say it starts at 500 THz. Gravitational time dilation works out so that once it passes around the equator once, its frequency is about 500.000002 THz, which is an extra 2 MHz. It takes about 0.134 seconds for the signal to get around the first time. Let's pretend it's 0.1 seconds, for simplicity. So the sending laser pulses 50 trillion times while you're waiting for the signal. But since the receiving signal gets an extra two million pulses per second, after 25 million seconds it catches up. Any signal you send will be received instantly. Wait longer, and you'll start receiving pulses before you send them. You have created a time machine. If you crated that gravitational gradient by accelerating the spin of the Earth, it's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipler_cylinder][Tipler cylinder]].
