  A *Tipler cylinder*, also called a *Tipler time machine*, is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical][hypothetical]] object [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory][theorized]] to be a potential mode of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel][time travel]]---although results have shown that a Tipler cylinder could only allow time travel if its length were infinite or with the existence of negative energy (see the discussion of Hawking's proof below).

  The Tipler cylinder was discovered as a solution to the equations of general relativity by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Jacob_van_Stockum][Willem Jacob van Stockum]] in 1936 and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kornel_Lanczos][Kornel Lanczos]] in 1924, but not recognized as allowing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curves][closed timelike curves]] until an analysis by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Tipler][Frank Tipler]] in 1974. Tipler showed in his 1974 paper, "Rotating Cylinders and the Possibility of Global Causality Violation" that in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime][spacetime]] containing a massive, infinitely long [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)][cylinder]] which was spinning along its longitudinal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axis][axis]], the cylinder should create a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging][frame-dragging]] effect. This frame-dragging effect warps spacetime in such a way that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone][light cones]] of objects in the cylinder's proximity become tilted, so that part of the light cone then points backwards along the time axis on a space time diagram. Therefore a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft][spacecraft]] accelerating sufficiently in the appropriate direction can travel backwards through time along a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve][closed timelike curve]] or CTC.

  CTCs are associated, in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold][Lorentzian manifolds]] which are interpreted physically as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime][spacetimes]], with the possibility of causal anomalies such as going back in time and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox][potentially shooting your own grandfather]], although paradoxes might be avoided using some constraint such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov self-consistency principle]]. They have an unnerving habit of appearing in some of the most important exact solutions in general relativity, including the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric][Kerr vacuum]] (which models a rotating black hole) and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Stockum_dust][van Stockum dust]] (which models a cylindrically symmetrical configuration of rotating pressureless fluid or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_solution][dust]]).
