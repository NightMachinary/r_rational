  Every world has its rules. Outsiders say the wasteland exists in a state of anarchy, but they are mistaken. Here, the rules are coarser and more fundamental than those of the wider world, but no less strict. Survival means learning to play a game that is unfair and unwinnable.

I don't know how long you've spent on this first paragraph / chapter, but it's really great. The writing flows well, the stakes are clear, and I find myself empathizing with the protagonist. Subscribed.
