/More than a century has passed since the world ended, and now it teeters on the brink once again./

/The emergency administration established in the aftermath is slipping and rebellion spreads as virulently as the hostile new ecology./

/Jan will watch the world burn if it means vengeance against those that abducted his daughter./

/Vash will pay any price to prevent that from happening./

/Thrown together by circumstance, these two men will become trapped in a conspiracy that could bring this dark chapter of history to a close, or finally bring about an apocalypse postponed for 165 years./

A hard sci-fi serial. New chapters released every week. Feedback and comments would be extremely helpful.
