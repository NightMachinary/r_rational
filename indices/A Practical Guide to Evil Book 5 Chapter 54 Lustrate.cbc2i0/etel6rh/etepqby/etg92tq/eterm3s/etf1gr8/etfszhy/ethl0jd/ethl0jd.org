I don't know if the Crows are as much Gods Between, as they are basically Angels for below, their power almost 100% from below, gifted through the sacrifice of their people on the alter that was the Everdark to achieve immortality for the rest, and finally completed with the seed of Godhood that was Cat's mantle. Gods Between isn't a bad name for them, as it's not like they follow Bellow's orders or anything, but they are most certainly not neutral in any way.
