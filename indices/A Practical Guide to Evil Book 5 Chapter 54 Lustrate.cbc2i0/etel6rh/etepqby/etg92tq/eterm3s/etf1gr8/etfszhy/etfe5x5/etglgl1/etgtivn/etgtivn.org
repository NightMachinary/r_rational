Kairos is not an Oracle, he's merely constrained from uttering falsehoods. So this says merely that Kairos believes there's a greater game afoot (for Kairos's personal definition of “Greater”, “game”, and “afoot”). It may be more constrained if he also has to use words unlikely to be misinterpreted by Cat.
