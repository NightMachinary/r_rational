  maybe one of these days I'd have to sit her down along with Archer for a friendly talk about Why Other People, Who Are Not Us, Matter.

If any of you watch the good place this reminds me a lot of a certain scene in the second season.

  “Is that a bedsheet?” 
#+end_quote

This is such a perfect thing for the heirarch. I like to imagine that every time it happens someone in the army tries to take the bedsheet clean it, mend it, embroider it etc. so he just gets another fresh dirty one each time.

Though as a representative of the people he would ensure Fair Compensation rather than engaging in Tyrannical Appropriation of the Property of the Common People.

  Akua said. “Queen of my heart, shall we proceed?”

At this point Cat is just ignoring the blatant flirting which amuses me greatly

#+begin_quote
   So we resumed our advance as if we were untouchable, and so went untouched. 
#+end_quote

The bluffing her way into things (like stopping the cavalry charge) is becoming Cat's signature move.

  “Did one of your most infamous emperors not style himself Traitorous?” Kairos said. She laughed, rather cuttingly. “Traitorous?” she smiled. “Oh, youth. You are barely even a Malignant.”

The most Praesi burn ever.

  “I am more than blood,” Akua Sahelian hissed. “I am more than what I was made from. But you, Kairos Theodosian? You are the apostle of the cage, the congregant of scrapped iron. 
#+end_quote

Another reference to the “we can do better” theme? Akua has realised she can't just lean into the Praesi history of madness, evil and treachery but she has to overcome it and use the good parts of it to become something more. Don't know why I didn't notice the parallel with her and kairos before, they both wanted to be old school villains in rebellion against the new wave of “practical” evil.
