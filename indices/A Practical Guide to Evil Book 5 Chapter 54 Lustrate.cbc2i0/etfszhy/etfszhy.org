So, like, for a while now I've been on the "Kairos' endgame is to put the Gods Above on trial before the Hierarch" train. If so, he needs the Bard/Intercessor, since she is the one who speaks for them.

He may also need Cat, since her Crows (I've been thinking of them as Gods Between) may be able to threaten Above/Below that they will join with the other. He wants them to blackmail the Gods Above into speaking directly through Bard, use other means to get her to cooperate, and then put her on trial before the People.
