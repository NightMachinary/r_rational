B makes the most obviouse sense to me, since there's a history of fungus species taking the brains of their host and making them do things (e.g. that fungus that takes over ant bodies, makes them climb to the top of the canopy, so that way they can be eaten by a bird to complete their lifecycle - at least I'm pretty sure it's a fungus, it's what the pokemon Paras/Parasect is based on.)
