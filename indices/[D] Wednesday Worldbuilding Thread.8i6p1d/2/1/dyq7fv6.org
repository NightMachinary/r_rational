Skerples has a series of blog posts about fungus which followed path A: [[https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.se/2018/01/osr-myconids-part-1.html][Part 1 (mildly nsfw)]], [[https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-myconids-part-2.html][Part 2]], [[https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-myconids-part-3.html][Part 3]]

It's mostly written with tabletop roleplaying in mind, but theres lots of worldbuilding and descriptions of magical mushroom people.

Excerpt:

  Maybe it started like this. Food is scarce. Casting spores into the air and hoping works, but what if there was a better way? The mushroom detaches, rolls, tries to get away from the original fungus before spreading its spores. Better. But then it starts to develop chemoreceptors and tiny grasping tendrils. It can smell other food, rot, other fungi. It can roll in the right direction.

  And sometimes that's enough. The mushmice, fat mushroom caps with tiny legs, only needed to get this far before finding a successful niche. The famous gas spore is another example. But the pressure is still on for other species. They get better and better at sending mobile mushrooms. They discover that a mobile mushroom can not only sabotage other fungi, but that it can actively seek new food sources before sporulating. Competition begets improvement.
