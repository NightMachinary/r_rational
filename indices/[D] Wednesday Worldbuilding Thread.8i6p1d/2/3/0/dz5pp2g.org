That sounds okay. The problem I have with it is that it makes the fungiform/myconid/mushroomman (whatever I'll call them) dependent on human existence (or at least another advanced sentient species). I wanted to hypothesize a world where fungal species could evolve and become an advance race on their own.

Through your proposed method, I would effectively create another form of the modern zombies which is something that I don't want to do.
