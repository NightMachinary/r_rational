mind reading and mind control would be not overpowered. It would be surface thoughts (still passwords would be a problem) and mind control would be like hypnosis (the stage variant, no one can be forced to kill their kids), but still a problem. And mundane defences would be possible. (like singing songs in your mind and some would be immune, cause different wired brain or something)

Yeah didn't mean precognition, or alternate realities or time travel or clones with memories. Maybe his precognition would be more like better senses and unconscious information processing. (But his precognition is with most writers only seconds in the future. I don't know how you could exploit it, except if he is a stockbrokers and lets a gun automatical fire at him, if a condition is met, and he can push a button to sell/buy.)

But more like what his enemies can do. (Well with realistic limits, Shocker could destroy a wall, but his device would need to be recharged at some point. And probably not with devices but a superpower. ) And less stuff what Fantastic Four fight and build.

But still, I think a world with x% of flying people would have other stair cases, maybe doors on roofs. (Or less cables in the air.)

If y% of people could push your locked door open, you would want bigger locks. And if z% of people could just unlock it with their mind, you would want different locks.
