I have a question. In this world, magic used to be known about by humanity. Then, around 6-7oo years ago a spell was cast that separated the realms. This is pretty typical so far, but my question is, if magic used to be common knowledge, what evidence of its existence would still be left in the modern day? In this scenario most magic takes the form of creatures such as vampires and werewolves. Aside from stories, which we have, what signs would be left?
