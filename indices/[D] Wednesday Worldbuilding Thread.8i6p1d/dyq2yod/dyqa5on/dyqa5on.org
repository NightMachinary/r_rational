Werewolves would change historical forestry.

Ancient populations would expand until they hit some natural limit. This means that any land that could get cleared & farmed with time-period's technology did get cleared & farmed. When I looked into it, I was surprised at just how [[https://islesproject.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/12000bce-present-a-brief-history-of-british-woodlands/][early the wild forests got cleared]]:

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the Mesolithic era there is evidence of the beginnings of agriculture. ... In some areas, such as East Anglia, the chalklands and the Somerset Levels, population increased dramatically, and virtually all the wildwood was cleared.

  Clearance increased during the Bronze Age (2400-750BC) to its probable height in the early Iron Age. Oliver Rackham (1990) estimates that about half of England had ceased to be wildwood by 500BC.

Werewolves would change this. They'd be a smart, apex predator with a vested interest in protecting wildwoods from farming and other intrusions.

As a spill-over effect, they would have disrupted the surprisingly good [[http://orbis.stanford.edu/][road network in the ancient world]]. Instead of putting your roads through farmland, or managed forest, you'd pretty much have to have a legion carve routes through Werewolf-infested wildwood.

I expect that a legion could manage this and get the roads in place. But, once they were in place, you have the problem of actually using them. Caravans would be very easy prey for 7' tall regenerating murder-beasts.

One option would be coming to some kind of treaty with the werewolves. You could make offerings to local tribes. Or you could have a formal arrangement with the werewolf leader, should one exist. This shows up in the record as Rome making oddly favorable agreements with a Nomadic Warrior society that lasted up until 1400.

Vampires would change trade-networks.

My thought is that, before we had formal education, everyone was relying on experience and innate skill. One especially competent family member could build up a fortune. But, that competence might not pass down to their kids. So, it would be hard for one person's competence to turn into a huge dynastic merchant-company.

Introduce vampiricism, and that changes. Eventually, a vampire is going to bite one of the cleverer merchants. Time passes. And now you've got a guy who'd be smart and vastly more experienced than all of his human peers. His empire would expand up to the limit of what he could personally manage. Once that happens a few more times, you could easily end up with a network of 20 or so "Great Merchant Houses" that would outlast various kingdoms.

Those houses might not immediately collapse once their leaders died. But, they'd probably diminish to be in line with other organizations of their era.

A final change is that I'd expect to see WAY more [[https://www.britannica.com/topic/mystery-religion][mystery cults]]. You could set up a ceremony where, at the end, your God straight-up turns someone into a wolf. That would be really convincing. And, I think it would lead to a ton of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+18%3A20-40&version=ESV][religious challenges]] that would limit the spread of monotheism.
