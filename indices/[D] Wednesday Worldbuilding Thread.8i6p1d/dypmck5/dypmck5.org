In a world where magic exist, what would the body of a sentient and mobile fungal-form species (mushroom person) look like. I could make them look humanoid and hand wave the reason away but that would leave me unsatisfied and would cause me to constantly question why a fungal species specifically need 2 arms and 2 legs?

My thoughts are going down two paths. Path A is that the species is a literal fungal person (mushroom or not). Path B is that the fungal person is actually a symbiotic relationship between two species, a fungus and it's host.

Path A would be the simplest as long as there was no need to examine specifically why or how the species developed as they did. The fungal people could have eventually gained sentience and then, using magic, gained mobility by modeling other organisms to form limbs. This would eventually lead them to develop civilization and advanced technology.

Path B at its surface appears more complicated (and maybe it is) but it would allow for a way to explain how a fungal species could gain mobility and constrain them to a specific body. The fungal species is essentially the disembodied brain of its host. Through their co-evolution, the host is practically brainless giving full control of it's bodily to the fungus. Being the brain the fungus is responsible for the survival of both species.

Although Path A would make it easier to build a society however I would like, I'm not so fond of it since it doesn't explain how mobility develops naturally and allows too much variance to what a fungal person looks like. I feel like I'm left with using magic as the end-all to all questions.

I'm leaning towards Path B since it put constraints to what a body can look like and explains how it could have developed. It also allows for some interesting speculation on the evolution of the two species and of how civilization would develop through the logical progression of that evolution.
