Artifacts and structures that would be otherwise impossible to build via mundane methods. Like:

- A huge crystal ball that contains no imperfections that could have only been made with carefully controlled magic fire and repair spells

- A smooth stone castle with murals made of gemstones flowing flawlessly into each other.

- Ruins that appear to be an inverted pyramid once held up by levitation

- An abandoned city with infrastructure that hints at distributing resources from an endless cornucopia that once provided food and water for the entire city.

- A (now dead) silver tree that looks like it grew because it is roots cracked nearby rocks and upon splitting it open, there are detailed growth rings.

- landscapes twisted with the mundane effects of magic long after the magic itself disappeared.
