So, how many magic user/superpowered people can I have in a Superhero setting close to our world, without it being unrealistic that the setting is similar to our world? And what changes should be expected and what powers wouldn't let the world be like ours? (Assume details and limitations of powers are so, that the exploits don't work or aren't OP.)

The Powers would be all powered with calories (meaning food) or rarely (1 in 1000 metahumans) with external power sources.

Powers would be superstrength (like max 10t), invulnerability (like artillery shots, not nukes), telekinesis, mind reading (and like one or two mind controller), pyromancers (like a lighter worth of fire, since fueled by eaten food), flying (50km/h limit, and max 200kg), and general spiderman level of stuff.
