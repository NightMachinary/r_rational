None of the examples you mention seem like they would change the fundamentals of society all that much, except:

#+begin_quote
  mind reading (and like one or two mind controller)
#+end_quote

Which utterly tears them apart unless there is some kind of mundane defense against it. Information security, politics, the judicial system and so forth all need to be completely rethought if there are even a handful of people capable of mind reading/mind control.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  general spiderman level of stuff
#+end_quote

Reasonably sure this isn't what you meant, but Spiderman has limited precognition which is another can of worms best left unopened if you don't want to make it the focus of the story.
