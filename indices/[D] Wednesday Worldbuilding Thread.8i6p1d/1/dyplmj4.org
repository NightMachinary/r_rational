[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8eu9f1/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dxyip5g][Two weeks ago]] I posted about how I found the premise of /Out of the Violent Planet/ to be an intriguing idea but I had no idea how to use it to create a story, so you can imagine how impressed I was when I started watching /Full Metal Panic!/ and realized the story would fit surprisingly well into that RPG setting. The Whispered and their ability to intuitively understand and build sci-fi technology make perfect sense in a world where Lovecraftian aliens speak to people randomly born psychic. Skimming the book has actually improved my enjoyment of the show because it provides ways to rationalize nearly everything that hasn't been explained.

Everyone wants to get more contact with the aliens so they can make bank, but need to keep their scheming hidden from everyone else. Suddenly all the terrorist plots, deniable ops, and private military contractors have a completely logical background to support them. Mecha is just what humans decide to build with alien tech and the Lambda Driver is a weapon aliens never thought up themselves. Even the little details like Tessa being in charge of Mythril make more sense, if we make the *very logical* assumption that she is a Whispered, since leading a mercenary company is her way of maintaining autonomy from any nation that would abduct her.

The way the show combines those elements with anime high school hi-jinks also works in light of this, since it turns the weird gimmick into a brilliant way of grounding the story in the lives of humans. That's exactly how I think the premise of the setting should be used, have the plot revolve around the people we can empathize with and get us invested in protecting the world they like living in. It isn't just a joke about fish out of water like in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck][Chuck]], it's also a metaphor for the way the human and alien worlds are colliding to create chaos. This was obviously unintentional on the writer's part, but it's the exact framework for a story I was looking for.
