  When Welexi slipped Dominic's hand inside the artifact, it sounded a single loud tone. Dominic's shadow armor disappeared in an instant [...]

  “Fascinating,” said Welexi. He held the artifact high, looking it over. There was no visible change in it. Without any seeming forethought, Welexi stuck his own hand in the mouth of the artifact.

So, Welexi knew how the artifact worked.

You'd have to be crazy to confidently apply /on yourself/ the /same procedure/ that just stole a guy's power, hoping that doing the same thing twice produces different results. This is /not/ how a level 1 intelligent character treats an unknown, horribly dangerous ancient artifact, and I trust [[/u/alexanderwales]] to keep his characters level 1 intelligent.

And (using the outside view) if anyone /was/ crazy enough to do silly things with unknown, horribly dangerous ancient artifacts, it should usually not result in them getting exactly what they want.

I can only hope that the other characters have noticed this too.
