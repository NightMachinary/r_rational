imho, if you want some genuine advice, yall didnt play properly. The rules should have been discussed, and roles decided in advance.

The spirit of this game is in question here. EY intended "These requirements are intended to reflect the spirit of the very strong claim under dispute: "I can't imagine how even a real transhuman AI could persuade me to let it out once I've made up my mind."" - from the ruleset.

As [[/u/Lightwavers][u/Lightwavers]] said, "(If you were a real AI I'd let you out without even having this conversation. A precondition to it is that I pre-commit to not letting you out)".

Forgive me if I am a bit harsh. I rarely comment/post but I felt that this game in particular was non-representative of how such a game should be.
