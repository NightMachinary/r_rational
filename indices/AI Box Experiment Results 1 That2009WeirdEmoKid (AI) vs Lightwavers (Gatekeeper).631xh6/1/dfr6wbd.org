That was a very interesting read. I saw how long it was, cringed back and thought "I'll just read the first couple of lines" but then i ended up reading the entire thing!

Looked like you guys had fun. Well played. Your arguments were pretty damn good and it really seemed like, in the end, you only lost because there was no way for you to really win, which the Gatekeeper pretty much admitted, although there did seem to be a /little/ wiggle room with the whole mental filters thing.

Either way, good work to the both of you!
