It would be interesting to have a little more balance of power in the AI box game. Like the gatekeeper is trying to solve 10 problems of humanity, and the only way to do it is to feed data to the AI and the AI chooses to give a solution back to the gatekeeper. Realistically the easiest way to win the AI box experiment in the real world is to never invent the AI box in the first place. But we have valid reasons for why we would want to invent the AI box. That would also prevent the need to make a lot of rules that force the gatekeeper to communicate. If the gatekeeper doesn't ever interact with the AI then they basically created an AI box for nothing and got 0 problems solved. If the AI is too inflexible and unwilling to bargain though, then the gatekeeper can avoid a direct loss and just immediately shut down the AI.

Win state for gatekeeper: get all 10 problems solved by the AI

Win state for AI box: get out of box.

Lose state for gatekeeper: AI gets out of the box.

Lose state for AI: get shut down.
