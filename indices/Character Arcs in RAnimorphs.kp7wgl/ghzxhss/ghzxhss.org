Great thread... I love this story. I especially agree with this part, as its one of the things that didn't quite sit right with me:

  . It's still difficult for me to understand Temrash's indulgent cruelty (if I may) towards Tobias. I can see how things that feel like violations to us wouldn't to them, but Temrash has seen this stuff from the inside, and still acted that way.

I did not understand this when it happened at all. We know that Yeerks are at least somewhat affected by their hosts, so maybe his cruelty was some kind of manifestation of Tobais's feelings towards himself? The same reason he would go on what was practically a suicide mission in the first place? I don't know. And it just isn't brought up again.

Tobias accepting a Yeerk afterward made no sense to me either. Sure, the Yeerks claimed that they were representing a new way of cooperation, but Temrash/Ax claimed the same thing. If I had just been brutalized like that by a Yeerk who I risked my life to save and then someone offered for me to take another Yeerk the answer would be hell no, and I'm not half as paranoid as Tobias is. I just didn't understand...hopefully in a future chapter we will get some insight into his mental state when he joined the sharing
