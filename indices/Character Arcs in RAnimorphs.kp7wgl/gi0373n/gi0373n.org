*Notices ur place to talk at length about r!Animorphs* owo whats this?

Another superfan! Someone who might forgive me if I type too much! Excellent! (Edit: I did. Please forgive me.)

I haven't done one big start-to-finish readthrough in a couple million years; I did that when I found the fic and now I dip in and out at luxurious random, going back to reread a passage just because I liked it, or a vast swathe of chapters just because the pages kept turning. In any case I may be rusty about things, so please do correct me if I'm wrong about anything.

  There's a sense that things “had to” play out as they do, as events follow logically as well as challenging characters in core ways or giving expression to some interesting ideal or real-world dynamic.
#+end_quote

Does this mean you liked the end of canon, too? I hear people complain about book 54 all the time - “Butbutbut everyone was so /sad/ at the end! /I/ wanted a /happy/ ending!” - and to me that just... so thoroughly misses the point? I love the broken child soldiers, the Pyrrhic victory over the Yeerks, for... basically the exact reasons you wrote right here.

#+begin_quote
  When morph!Jake recovers from his coma, we see the first clear case in which Jake suppresses his emotional turmoil in order to fulfil his responsibility in managing the group.
#+end_quote

Not /quite/ the first time - he does the same in Chapter 1, when he springs out of panic mode to talk to Elfangor, and I'd argue that's a clear case when you know what to look for.

#+begin_quote
  It is to be expected, if Jake numbs himself in response to pain, that he will be the most numb when thinking of Cassie, after her death. And so, Jake's interactions with his stored copy of Cassie provide another example of the degradation of his access to empathy, and the coincident diminishment in his capacity to take on alternative perspectives. When he talks with her, he is cold and derisive, and can only understand her point of view in terms of what she fails to understand. He can't get out of his own head and actually grasp where she's coming from.
#+end_quote

I used to agree with this interpretation of that scene. (There was just the one scene, right? Beginning of Chapter 31? Say anything for “no.”) My first time or two reading it, I got caught up in the emotions of Cassie's grounded, reasonable, principled perspective, and Jake looked cold and unfeeling and a little morally bankrupt by comparison. (It's possible that I've been conditioned by all the media I've ever consumed to believe that the confident, emotionally resounding, Do-What's-Right-In-Your-Heart speech is definitively correct 100% of the time, and in r!Animorphs, that isn't always the case.) More recently, I've come to see it differently: I think Jake understands /exactly/ where Cassie is coming from, and to him, it's not enough.

Marco's opening narration from Chapter 37 sums up Cassie's failure really well, and there are echoes of it in Jake's conversation with her in 31, too. Cassie's an /amazing/ idealist. She's the kind of person we would do well to have more of in the real world; she has an innate understanding of what's fundamentally good, and she tries - /really tries/ - to use that understanding to make the world better. But she critically fails to carry her idealism through to logical ends. She can't make the tough calls, won't allow herself to boil down complex ethical dilemmas to hard numbers. If Marco was faced with the trolley problem, he'd pull the lever so fast he'd have time to crack six jokes before the person got squashed. If Cassie was faced with the trolley problem... well, she /might/ make the “right” choice, but she'd waste time (an extremely valuable resource, especially in a war) cringing and wringing her hands and /hesitating/, and she'd waste even more time feeling really bad about it after.

In fact, there's one moment in the fic when Cassie /is/ faced with something a lot like the trolley problem. Her powers and intel (and presence in freakin' prophecy!) make her extremely valuable to the war effort, and preserving her own life could calculably save millions or billions of others. But instead, she goes after the kid. Now, this isn't /entirely/ fair to Cassie. She made the “logical” call thousands of times, and it was only because the Ellimist specifically engineered the situation to undercut all her logical calls that she eventually made the illogical one. But she has the capacity to make the wrong choice like that; she's so gravitationally drawn to good that she'll choose “good bad bad” over “bad good good,” and that's what Jake is running up against.

You ever play Pokémon Black and White? #BestGeneration, don't @ me? A theme that runs through those games is the concept of /truth vs ideals/. Jake is an idealist, like Cassie, but he also recognizes hard truths, like Marco. Jake feels like he's splitting in two when he talks to Cassie about potentially betraying Telor and Tyagi and everyone. He wants so badly to live up to a righteous moral code, and he hates himself for seeing so far past immediate, obvious rights. But he's also seen firsthand the dangers of living chained to a stiff sense of morality; he himself /died/ for making that very mistake, and to REALLY drive the point home, he watched the girl he loved burn when /she/ made it (and I'd bet that far-reaching insight is [[https://i.redd.it/wfte93j229n31.jpg][precisely why the Ellimist needed her to die]]). Jake can see where Cassie is coming from, but the truth of the matter is that the time for /only ideals/ is past. There's a war on. Jake is too much Cassie to let his world and his species die, but he's too much Marco to get lost looking for a nonexistent clean path to victory.

So he does see where she's coming from, he understands every bit of her logic, and he's frustrated at how far it falls short. He shares her empathy for the human race, but he's realistic enough to recognize that the best way to help everyone in the long term is to make some moral concessions in the short. Now, I don't want to sound like the hyperlogical sociopath or something. I don't claim for a second that I personally would pull the lever fast because it seems so clear and obvious; I'm not the guy who watches Batman and says, “Just kill the Joker! Duh!” (Even though Batman probably /should/ just kill the Joker.) In fact, I think if it came down to it, I'd probably be more like Cassie here than Jake. But the point is that /Jake is better at war than I am/, he can see a bigger picture than Cassie or I, and that's... that's just more important, overall.

Oh my god this got long. What if you're not even saying the thing I'm responding to? I‘m moving on.

#+begin_quote
  In this arc, we would see Jake grow to be less dissociated from his empathy, with more access to what it feels like on the inside of those he models
#+end_quote

I'd also submit that Jake's “final form” would be more in touch with /his own/ feelings. There are a number of moments sprinkled around where he itemizes all his friends' projected reactions and responses to some big Thing, then reaches for his own and finds he doesn't know what it would be.

#+begin_quote
  (P.S. My reading seems to imply that he has some prior trauma or dissociative cause (since even in the first two chapters he didn't seem especially emotional and already thought of his predictions as black-box-y) but it's probably too late to introduce something like that to the story.)
#+end_quote

Hmm. Interesting take. I ran this one by my brain and it told me it /could/ potentially see this interpretation, but it's also perfectly happy to model Jake as just being... like that. I agree it would feel pretty tacked-on to include now. (Maybe the trauma was when he slammed his hand in that car door as a kid and got a scar? Maybe it was when he met Tobias and found out he had a backstory so eerily identical it was almost as if the author had forgotten he'd used it already? ;) )

#+begin_quote
  In this way, he holds himself back a bit and doesn't fully engage with Jake as an equal, taking a sort of “this is out of my hands; my irrational boss is just going to make whatever crazy choice, I guess” stance, bailing on discourse whenever Jake wants to do something based on intuition.
#+end_quote

Worth noting that Marco has gotten better about this as time has gone on. He's gone from treating Jake's little black box with extreme skepticism to /mostly/ respect and confidence. He still likes to complain about it from time to time of course, but he wouldn't be our Marco if he didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, if there's space we should probably see something about his relationship with his dad, who has been a nonentity in the story.
#+end_quote

Ooh, agreed. I'm sure if I sat here and puzzled and puzzled ‘til my puzzler was sore, I could /probably/ remember the three or four little appearances Peter has made since the Ellimist saw fit to teleport him out of Ventura, but his involvement in the story doesn't even come close to Temrash's and Tom's contributions.

#+begin_quote
  He seems concerned with principles, but I'm not sure to what extent this is just a consequence of having to make things legible in his relationship to Garrett.
#+end_quote

Tobias himself seems unsure on this point. There's a part where he talks about holding himself to the principled standard that Garrett would, and then he reminds himself that that's a standard Garrett simply copied off of the one Tobias invented for Garrett's benefit, and then he questions the validity of this recursive value-copycatting just leaning on itself for support. I love that. It seems so relatable, somehow, and is just a real standout piece of introspection - even in a story where deep philosophical introspection and questioning one's own values happen in, like, every chapter.

#+begin_quote
  and at one point Tobias wonders to what extent his principles are just a happy story he told to Garrett and then had to live up to.
#+end_quote

Yeah, this part!
