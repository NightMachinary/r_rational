  I only bring it up because Ax specifically points out that it isn't suicidality
#+end_quote

But then Temrash says "<You are compromised. Suicidal. I would never have agreed to this if I had fully understood your mental state. I have no intention of letting you throw both of our lives away.>" Maybe this is manipulation, but I don't think that's the best-supported reading.

#+begin_quote
  I think it's mostly just because, to me, Tobias and Garrett both already do feel like they're motivated by a core goodness. The platitudes are a nice garnish, but they're not really the foundation of everything these two characters do.
#+end_quote

I want to believe this, and mostly do. But I think the reading is better supported for Garrett than Tobias.

#+begin_quote
  Overall, I think a lot of the unfulfillment you feel from Tobias is just stuff that hasn't had time to develop yet and likely would have anyway. We've only had one real chapter with him since his awakening, with his absence serving as a little bit of an intentional tease; I trust the author to round out Tobias a bit more when he finally gets the stuff he's been building to.
#+end_quote

Fair enough. I wish there were more time left though. Probably only one more Tobias chapter!

  Cassie
#+end_quote

I think it would be too time consuming to really get into our difference of opinion here. Perhaps one day in the future.

But if the stance of the fic is that what she did was wrong, or deeply ultra wrong, or whatever, I don't think that precludes some sort of emotional resolution. E.g. such a scene could certainly be mostly a reflection on her failures. I don't at all mean to be saying that she should be rewarded or given justification for doing the wrong thing.

  Too many shoulder-Marcos
#+end_quote

Interesting. I can see that, and hadn't really, before

  Garrett
#+end_quote

I like Garrett too :)

  Out of curiosity, what else would you like to see from Yeerk pools that we haven't already? There have been a couple of interludes now that I think captured it pretty handily. The pools are vast and ancient, and they think very broadly. Sounds good to me.
#+end_quote

There's an almost psychedelic experience to reading a detailed first person account of a significantly divergent mind. I want to feel like I have a sense of what it's like to be a yeerk, from the inside. I think I'd have to sit in the perspective for at least a few thousand words before being really able to shift into this slower, more expansive mindset. And I bet there are a bunch of other differences too!

  Helium is sorta this by themselves, no? The first Collaborator, proof that there's another way forward for Andalites?
#+end_quote

Yeah, but that feels like the book is saying that Andalite communities (and the species in its natural form) is fully inferior in the important ways to humans. Sure they can think multiple trains of thought at once, but the can't innovate and they can't change their minds. If the only good andalite is the one you force into social isolation and then infest with a yeerk... that's pretty damning. I want to see the upsides to their alternative, more interconnected mode of being!
