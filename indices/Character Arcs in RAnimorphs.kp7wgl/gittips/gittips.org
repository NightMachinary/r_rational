Revisiting this thread, another loose end I would like to see tied down is learning more about the Andalites. They are so interesting that anything would be welcome, but specifically I want to know why the Andalites are so militaristic in the first place. In the original series the Yeerk-Anadalite war had been going on for 30 years (IIRC) by the time it reaches Earth, so it makes sense that Andalite culture would be the way it is after three decades of total war.

In this story, the war has been going on for a far shorter period. And yet, Alloran made his reputation as a military genius /before/ the war, as his seizure was the opening move. Elfangor was Allorans apprentice and considered a prodigy before the Yeerk war. Who did the Andalites fight before the Yeerks, or who were they preparing to fight? Helium mentions that Alloran is a "decorated veteran"...of what war? Alloran was training for military service as a child, and we aren't led to believe that this is unusual at all. We already know at this point that the Andalites aren't the noble heroes we may have initially thought. In an earlier chapter Marco finds a blocked memory of /something/ that Elfangor found out that made him quit the military. Did he find out something dark about the Andalites war record? Which wars did Alloran fight in, and for what reasons were these wars fought? Granted we basically only get to hear from Ax/Helium who is either a brainwashed teenager or not even an Andalite anymore, but still the knowledge that there were previous wars just seems to be there without any details about what those wars were. Is this the kind of knowledge that has been purged by their powerful group-think?
