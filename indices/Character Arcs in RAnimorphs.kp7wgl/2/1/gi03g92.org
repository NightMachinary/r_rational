  Namely his desire to save Temrash is revealed as a mask on suicidality (tying back to “black desperation”)
#+end_quote

Mmm, suicidality isn't /exactly/ it - it's more like restlessness, or dissatisfaction, or stir-craziness, or just... an urge so overwhelming to /be doing something/ that it trumps even his instinct for self-preservation. Tobias and Ax talk about this in Chapter 35 (and I only bring it up because Ax specifically points out that it isn't suicidality).

#+begin_quote
  There's something beautiful about Tobias and Garrett making each other into better and stronger people, but it's lame and disappointing if they've bootstrapped on the basis of Garrett taking rules seriously and Tobias being too scared of letting him down -- rather than bootstrapping from a core goodness on both of their parts, with the above stuff acting as buttressing.
#+end_quote

I... think I agree with the logic of this, but I'm having trouble thinking about it as deeply “true” or “important” or something. I think it's mostly just because, to me, Tobias and Garrett both already /do/ feel like they're motivated by a core goodness. The platitudes are a nice garnish, but they're not /really/ the foundation of everything these two characters do.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, I'd be interested in looping back to Tobias' and Garrett's discussion of copies and identities. The conversation felt unfinished, and Tobias' thinking may have changed after he died that one time and Garrett brought him back.
#+end_quote

The conversation from two bullet points ago actually does call back to this conversation; Ax is saying something to Tobias that's a lot like what Tobias previously said to Garrett, and Tobias gets thrown off when he realizes that his thinking /has/ changed since Garrett brought him back. If his perspective hasn't /actually/ pivoted, he is at least saying words that are the opposite of what he was really thinking back in Chapter 28.

Also, I've spent some time imagining what it would be like to wake up as a clone. I think the whole “death” thing would be less intimidating after it happens, and you can think back and say, “I've /felt/ alive for my entire life,” - it's not like there's some traumatic break at the point where you died.

Overall, I think a lot of the unfulfillment you feel from Tobias is just stuff that hasn't had time to develop yet and likely would have anyway. We've only had one real chapter with him since his awakening, with his absence serving as a little bit of an intentional tease; I trust the author to round out Tobias a bit more when he finally gets the stuff he's been building to.

#+begin_quote
  Elfangor recently commented that the full consequences of her loss have not yet been observed, so I'm expecting something to come up.
#+end_quote

Honestly? I think Elfangor is just wrong here. He receives a prophecy with four human children's names basically painted in fire across the sky, and then he lives with that knowledge for, what, ten years? Then he wakes up one day to find that, among other things, the kids have been operating in the war against the Yeerks for a couple of months and one of them is already dead, without having struck any major blows or contributed in any decisively meaningful ways.

People in this story draw reasonable but incorrect conclusions all the time. Elfangor is working with the information he has - one of the things he /doesn't/ have is access to that interlude where the Ellimist or Crayak slowly and painstakingly guides Cassie to an extremely deliberate death. Probably the Ellimist, because I don't think he'd go to the trouble of getting her involved if she was just going to accidentally die before she could serve her purpose. Again, it seems possible that dying /was/ her contribution to the war, in the gift of clarity it gave the others.

(Incidentally, the author has been dropping hints for a looong time that Cassie isn't even really all the way “dead” so it looks like Elfangor's assumption is flawed to begin with.)

Cassie is the part of your post I've had the fewest responses to so far, and I think that's because I disagree with your overall assessment of her character, so it's more just one big point to respond to rather than several little ones. My impression of Cassie is going to seem harsh from where you're standing, but I think she's more of a cautionary tale about what not to do in a war. She cracks, she crumbles, and she dies. Through that lens, it is a reasonably complete arc. I don't want to sound unsympathetic to the strain that's placed on her, but the reality is that she has some very serious flaws in her thinking that are ultimately exploited to get her killed. She dies a noble death, a hero's death, and that in and of itself makes our reader hearts try to jump into our throats, our souls want to rally behind her as some sort of martyr. But that /can't/ be the final arbiter of whether a character's choices are portrayed as correct in the end. Cassie's decision was selfish, shortsighted, and, whether it's comfortable to admit or not, it /was/ dumb. She shouldn't get “an emotional scene where she gets to see the benefits of her sacrifice” just because it would /feel good/ for the reader; an easy emotional payoff shouldn't resolve and justify her doing the wrong thing. That flies in the face of everything rational fiction stands for.

  Rachel
#+end_quote

I'm really into the mystery of Rachel's glitchy morphing! Aside from that, we're on pretty much the same page as far as she's concerned. She has a couple destructive freakout chapters right at first (flaming tiger paw) and then she spends the story kinda slowly developing and feeling herself out. That's cool in the long term, but isn't quite as action-packed as being in the other characters' heads. (I think the Ante chapter is my least-read section of the entire fic.) As canon!Ax puts it, how do you weigh the sharp rush of battle against the slower, more contemplative joys of watching your trees flower?

I'm also not quite sure how I feel about the degree to which Rachel leans on her Shoulder Marco for introspection. It seems like every character has a Shoulder Marco making little quips in their heads all the time, with maybe Shoulder Cassies a distant, distant second, and like, maaaybe Shoulder Jakes after that, with everyone else tied for last (aside from Garrett and Tobias who have shoulder versions of each other, even if they don't openly converse with them often). It feels a little bit like the story is just sorta fetishizing Marco, but I've always been able to look past it, since it's never been present enough to be distracting. In some of the more recent Rachel chapters, though, I would say it's graduated to the point of being distracting. IIRC, there were times in the Ante chapter where it felt like Rachel's little mental model of Marco was doing more of her thinking than she was. I just feel like it kinda takes away from her character if she's routing so much of herself through another character, especially this late in the game. Maybe that was the story telegraphing her and Marco's budding romantic relationship, but truth be told, that's another facet that I'm a little “eh” on.

The sculptor section is great, though.

  Garrett
#+end_quote

You didn't do a section on Garrett, but I just wanna fanboy out for a second. He's such a wonderful, fascinating character to read - possibly my favorite in the whole story, which is kinda funny, considering he's an OC pls dont stel. I'm so excited for his chapter coming out next! If you look at the numbers a certain way, you could argue that he's only had one real chapter in the past /three and a half years/! A crime.

I could go on and on but I know this comment is miles too long already.

  Yeerk pools
#+end_quote

Out of curiosity, what else would you like to see from Yeerk pools that we haven't already? There have been a couple of interludes now that I think captured it pretty handily. The pools are vast and ancient, and they think very broadly. Sounds good to me.

#+begin_quote
  If you could show a splinter cell that is able to break away from the crowd and do something useful, that would give me some hope that Andalites don't just suck, and give them a chance to contribute to the happy non-tragic ending.
#+end_quote

Helium is sorta this by themselves, no? The first Collaborator, proof that there's another way forward for Andalites?

#+begin_quote
  I'd like to see more of the Arn, possibly just because I thought their grammar was extremely endearing in the V3 conversation
#+end_quote

Agreed! I mean, obviously not if it came at the expense of the author's plan, or whatever - but if there were /already/ an opportunity for more Arnspeak, I also thought that was a very fun scene.
