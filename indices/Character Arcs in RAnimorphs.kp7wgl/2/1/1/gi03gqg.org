  Anyway, one way for this to me a rationalist masterpiece (relative to me-as-reader), would be to flesh out those gaps and start to present conclusions or meta-conclusions.

My reaction to this is... complicated. I have this kneejerk instinct that the author's vision needs to remain “pure” and I can't help but see reader suggestions as a diluting agent - even when they are very good suggestions, like this. I know I'm being unrealistic here. Obviously the author himself takes reader suggestions into careful consideration, and obviously he wouldn't incorporate anything that doesn't make the story better or that drastically changes its overall trajectory. He sees suggestions as a fertile source of change for good, not as something that seeps in and taints his “original” layout for the story.

[[/u/TK17Studios]], since I know you're reading this.... There's nothing I can say like “don't let your story get tainted” that isn't already profoundly obvious. I guess let my comment serve as a reminder to remain critical of comments. Don't let reader opinions become any sort of gospel, even when they're extremely intelligent and well-reasoned. You're better at this than Applegate or Yudkowsky or any one of us readers. As long as suggestions are being rolled into the story to make it /more itself/ rather than less, that's a good thing - just don't let the story's identity be swayed from the seed it's grown out of, because it is and always has been very, very good already.

Last but not least:

I'm sorry this got so long holy shit
