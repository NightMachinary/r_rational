Rereading some recent chapters:

- Rachel's (coming?) rebirth maybe mirrors V3's

- Rachel and Marco are super cute, and I appreciate what the chapter did to backfill a sense of scale for their romantic interactions. I'm back to thinking their relationship is interesting. It's fun to imagine all of these interactions happening through stored copies in the intimacy of morph, and the surfacing of those memories when the other is re-acquired.

- War Prince Jake is extremely intense; not really getting a Samwise vibe at all.

- I had somehow missed the yeerk pool interlude. Extremely interesting and I hadn't thought about the pace-of-experience-accumulation angle. This is exactly the sort of thing I'm here for but I'm definitely not satisfied yet :)
