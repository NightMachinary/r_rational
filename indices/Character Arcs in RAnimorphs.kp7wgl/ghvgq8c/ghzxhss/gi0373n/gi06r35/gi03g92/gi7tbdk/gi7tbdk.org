  Does this mean you liked the end of canon, too?

I've only read a couple of the books, randomly discovered at elementary school book fairs.

  Not quite the first time - he does the same in Chapter 1, when he springs out of panic mode to talk to Elfangor, and I'd argue that's a clear case when you know what to look for.

Good point!

  Stuff about Cassie's death
#+end_quote

I don't disagree that Jake understands where Cassie is coming from to some extent.

It's hard to really know what to say about Cassie. I think she carries an important banner that she doesn't know how to explicate in Rationalist terms. So I could steelman her and say what that thing might be, but I'd just attributing things to her with very little basis. Certainly at some points she is just making mistakes.

Regarding the analysis about her value (given that she is one of the Chosen Ones, she is more important to save than others), I think it's true that she doesn't weigh things correctly, or even-handedly, or for nearly long enough. On the other hand, I don't think your analysis is right either. For one thing, any action she takes can be said to be the Ellimist's grand plan for putting her there. I don't think it especially preferences her staying alive longer rather than shorter, or saving herself rather than someone else. Further, she can be resurrected whereas Jake's brother and Marco's dad can't be. Finally, a big reason she makes the call to save both of them is because she thinks doing otherwise would make them hate each other (very possibly losing the war, though that isn't her focus; she also considers saving neither, but it feels pointless because there's nobody who is a much higher priority and she thinks they would then resent her forever). She realizes she can save the kid, which she wants to do, and sure it's a risk but I don't think we can confidently say she's wrong in her assessment that she can save him and get out of range of the explosion.

So, that's not SO crazy. As you and Marco note, she has found her solution where she gets to save both of them, and help the boy in front of her, and that's enough for her.

Her biggest mistakes comes after that though, not in drawing the line to the wrong point, but in failing to reevaluate as conditions change. Specifically, she sticks with her decision after Tobias bargains for another person to be saved (saving Erek basically as an afterthought, not reevaluating the chain of emotion and logic that led her to the decision she landed on), and she still goes to save the boy after returning to Time on the outside of the building instead of inside. Both exemplify the same basic error, but I have a hard time faulting her for it too much.

Saving Erek is worse: she's finally reached a feeling of goodness and confidence in her decisions (something she values extremely highly), and she fuses that with the specific choice she's made, so (as mentioned) sticks with it even when the reasons to do so have been decreased (like, maybe she ought to have decided to teleport the kid away, fly away herself, and let Erek die; she wants to save him less than the kid, clearly, and hasn't even considered this option; indeed, she realizes this immediately after finding herself outside). That she still tried to save the kid after being outside... well, in both of these cases she's given very little time to think, or reassess the quality of her plan. Clearly she's a bit stubborn, but we're looking at like a couple minutes of her life. I don't see these decisions as damning, merely as a demonstration that she lacks the important capacity to think clearly in crises and hold beliefs lightly even in charged states and high-stakes situations. Would Jake or Marco have bailed on the attempt, if they found themselves outside and the person they meant to save was a parent?

  stuff about Cassie and Jake
#+end_quote

You might be right that Jake understands Cassie to some degree, and is correctly seeing her errors. He's played the conversation a bunch of times and has direct access to her thoughts and feelings.

However, I can't agree that he fully understands her in the scene we see. I don't have the will to really justify this, but I don't think we would see the coldness or (in his words!) literal hate if he was able to actually deeply grasp her perspective from the inside.

Imo, if he's hating, then 1) we can be pretty confident this is clouding his perception and judgement, hiding and distorting and selectively amplifying and 2) in itself demonstrates he doesn't get something, because Ender says that if you understand someone you love them, and the FFN/Ao3 handle of [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]] is WhatWouldEnderDo (mic drop).
