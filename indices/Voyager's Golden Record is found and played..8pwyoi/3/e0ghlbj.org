The way the icons/pictographs on the golden record (and other objects sent into space) were constructed is pretty fascinating.

Vsauce has a interesting video about the subject called "messages for the future": Since the structure of an atom is likely to be common between alien civilisations, the record has a depiction of a hydrogen atom in order to establish a unit of measurement. Those units are then formulated to show how a record player (also sent with the record) could be set to spin the record at the right speed.
