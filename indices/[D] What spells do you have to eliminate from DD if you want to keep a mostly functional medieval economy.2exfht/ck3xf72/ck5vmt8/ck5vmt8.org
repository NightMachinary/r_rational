  So how does the food created by this spell taste? Does it come cooked? Can it be cooked? How much does salt cost in this world?
#+end_quote

Bland but nourishing, according to the books. So give everyone a level in Sorcerer or Wizard and they can prestidigitate their food. As long as there are at least 1.7 sorcerers per non-arcane, everyone will have tasty food. (5 cantrips per day per sorcerer at level 1, and assuming 3 meals/day.) Most people will do it for themselves and their family.

If someone has unused cantrips, they can spend them on Message, Mending, and Resistance. And they get a familiar out of the deal -- probably a raven, since they can talk -- none of that "Did Timmy fall down the well? Bark once for yes, twice for no."

  So clerics can feed everyone. Why should they want to?
#+end_quote

Of course I'm feeding my family. And that includes my brother and his spouse and their kids. And my mother and father. And my aunt and her kids. And let's bring in the neighbors too, they gave us some wool last week. And...oh look, that's fifteen people, the limit of my ability to feed.

Cleric Yolanda doesn't have a family; she was an orphan raised at the temple. There are only a couple orphans, and she makes food for them; the remaining food she creates, she gives out to those who need it. It's part of her duty of charity as a member of the temple priesthood.

  Who is paying them, and what are they paying them with?
#+end_quote

A skilled laborer's earnings per week add up to half their skill roll in gold. A family including two skilled laborers can easily earn 15-20 gold per week. Cooking food at home costs half of what it would be to purchase it pre-made; that is, a nonzero amount of money. A cleric insisting on earning coin would thus be able to extract that from people as long as they pay less than they would for an equivalent meal at home.

  According to the list of cleric spells, clerics can connect two planes, heal people, speak to gods, command people, raise the dead, repair objects, understand languages...why should they want to make food and water?
#+end_quote

Clerics can connect two planes, heal people, speak to gods, command people, raise the dead, repair objects, understand languages...why should /anybody/ want to make food and water? Maybe because people need to eat much more often than they need two planes connected or dead people raised. If most clerics are roughly the same level, they're going to serve the same purposes for the most part. That means not so many jobs raising the dead and lots of jobs feeding people.

Or to put it another way, people need things accomplished. We're taking the bakers and butchers, putting them through cleric training, and sending them back into the community. They continue their job with a new means of accomplishing it.

  The use of teleportation circles to trade is more problematic. First of all, there is the same problem as the food and water spell, namely, why would the spellcaster want to cast it?
#+end_quote

Because the government of this large city is paying them a buttload of money for thirty teleportation circles with permanency. And that government is stationing guards around who charge a tariff for all goods passing through.

  If gold and silver can be conjured, then they will not function as money. Something immune to such forces would be necessary.
#+end_quote

Depends on the rate at which they can be created. In one world I have heard of, people could dig in the ground to get gold, and yet it was used as the basis for currency for millennia. In D&D, there is a seventh level spell allowing you to create 5 cubic feet of valuable material per caster level at a cost of experience. Not much experience, though, so you can smash some zombies over the head and turn that into 200 platinum coins.
