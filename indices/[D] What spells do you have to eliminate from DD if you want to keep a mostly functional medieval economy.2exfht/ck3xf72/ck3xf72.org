Oh, good, something to do on a lunch break....

What must be acknowledged at the outset is that this is impossible to answer. There are too many spells, and our knowledge of economics is too impoverished, to give a detailed and accurate answer. Still, some individual trends on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus][cet. par. condition]] can be identified, and important questions raised.

Let us look at your example of a cleric creating food. It might seem counter-intuitive, but producing large quantities of food is not the solution to hunger. In our world there is enough food production to ensure that no one goes hungry, yet hunger exists. There are basically two reasons. The first is taste. It is easy enough to demonstrate that no one should go hungry in the United States, for example. A diet of simple grains, cheap proteins will sustain you much better than fast food and is much cheaper. It will, however, taste like poo. I don't have time for links, but it should be easy to confirm that when aid organizations have given money to the extremely poor to buy food, the amount of calories the poor consume not only does not necessarily go up but can even /fall/ as the poor substitute better-tasting foods for cheap muck. So how does the food created by this spell taste? Does it come cooked? Can it be cooked? How much does salt cost in this world?

Second is the distribution problem. So clerics can feed everyone. Why should they want to? Who is paying them, and what are they paying them with? And even should they want to, how will they do so? Do they conjure a bunch of food and leave it in a pile in the middle of a village? Do they conduct a census and bring food to individual households based on their need as determined by clerics? Does a large man who labors all day get the same portion as a thin girl who sews? Are the villagers given tickets of some kind to be traded for a portion of a food and water spell? How do festivals and celebrations work, where one would typically expect more food? Indeed the very poor often spend a lot of their money on splurges of this kind. People like to have fun and eat good things in peace and relaxation. They do not want to bow and scrape before a cleric for a predetermined portion of dry rations. Perhaps the spell would be better for feeding animals.

There is also the cost of the spell to consider. When a cleric is creating food and water, she is not doing some other thing. According to the list of cleric spells, clerics can connect two planes, heal people, speak to gods, command people, raise the dead, repair objects, understand languages...why should they want to make food and water? As more clerics are produced, the marginal rate of substitution of the create food and water spell will rise, which means that the cleric will be willing to give up casting more of other spells to create food and water. Of course, there are many spells a cleric can cast, so this effect might be negligible over a significant amount of cleric production. Is it hard to make a 20th level cleric? What is the supply schedule?

There could also be cultural issues. Clerics might see it as base or vulgar to use their divine powers to make food for the common people. Magical food might have its own stigmas.

Clerics could, however, be used to travel with and feed armies on campaigns if the cultural issues are low enough. Sieges would be impossible if the enemy fortification has enough clerics.

Let us consider the question more generally. Magic is a labor saving device analogous to machines. The introduction of magic into a medieval world might be similar to the Industrial Revolution, and indeed over time the percentage of the labor force employed in agriculture dropped enormously. For decades the economy grew rapidly, becoming much more productive, but these gains flowed to a relative few, the owners of capital (magic), and the workers did not gain much or even fell in their standard of living. Over time, however, laborers began to reap more of the surplus. Probably something similar will occur over the course of the 21st century.

As machines or magic replace labor in one sector, the law of comparative advantage ensures that the division of labor will be expanded to sectors that had not previously existed. Think factory jobs in the 19th century or service jobs today. What does a magical waiter look like? If wizards replace people in one industry, people will go and find some other productive thing to do that was not previously able to be done, limited as the division of labor is by the extent of the market.

The more that can be produced for present consumption without sacrificing some present consumption, the more interest rates will rise. But is present consumption not being sacrificed? This requires some imagination and some knowledge of the spell list. Probably not, is my guess. (Low interest rates do not explain the industrial revolution, but the opposite! The interest rate was five percent in Britain and 30 percent in China!)

Generally reasoning about this is harder than it might initially seem. Let us examine the Tippyverse. First of all, if it is as easy as the author says to attack with no possibility of defense, then we are living in a Hobbesian nightmare. Very little production exists. Interest rates are extremely high. No one is willing to invest in anything if their town might be wiped out tomorrow. What might happen, however, is something like the Cold War, assuming the attacked side can retaliate just as effectively. This would not be so bad, and might be an improvement on the medieval world, leading to improved growth. This depends on communication magic and the ability to protect one's army and transportation circles from sudden attack. In any case small villages and towns, however, would not be raided for their meager surpluses by a large army. It would not be cost-effective. They would be harassed by bandits. If the bandits do not have teleportation circles, then the villagers can be defended.

The use of teleportation circles to trade is more problematic. First of all, there is the same problem as the food and water spell, namely, why would the spellcaster want to cast it? Second, there is the enormous question of who controls access to the teleportation circle. Are there a small number of people who can make these circles? Is it hard and public to learn how? Then they will probably demand a stiff price for the use of the circles and crack down harshly on competitors. If anyone can make them, there is the problem of, say, someone dropping a hundred pounds of cow dung into a city. How are property rights delineated here, and what is the Coasean solution? Actually, considering how significant the problem of animal waste was in the medieval world, teleporting waste to uninhabited regions could potentially have large economic and health benefits. At the same time, teleporting in diseased waste could be a very effective war strategy. But I do not know how these circles work, yet it seems the possibility of violence over them could be very high.

If gold and silver can be conjured, then they will not function as money. Something immune to such forces would be necessary.

But to return to the original question, the answer to your dilemma lies in the opportunity cost of magic. If spellcasters are sufficiently rare, and the rewards for using magic for adventure-related things like monster-slaying and so forth are sufficiently high, then magic will not have very significant economic effects. The economic effects of dragon attacks and so forth will be similar to banditry.

*tl;dr: I don't know, no one knows, but if magic is rare enough and adventure-things as opposed to mundane-things are rewarding enough, magic will not have significant economic effects.*
