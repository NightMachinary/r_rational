I think level progression needs to be made much slower. My D&D group has spent about 3 months in game, and we are up to level 17.

No matter how much you try and nerf spells, if an "average" person can get to epic levels in less than a year things are going to be broken. I'd propose that an average person should be only able get at most a few class levels in a lifetime, such as making each level take exponentially longer to achieve.
