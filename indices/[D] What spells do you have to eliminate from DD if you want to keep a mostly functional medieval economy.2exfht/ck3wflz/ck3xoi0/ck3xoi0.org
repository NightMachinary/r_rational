4 encounters a day, 13.333 encounters a level, means that you get like 2 levels per week - so your group is actually still slightly slower than the core rules of d&d 3e say you 'should' be going. In less than the time it takes to bring a pregnancy to term people can ascend from 1 to 20, becoming overlords of a world, be overthrown by a group of plucky level 1 adventurers who in the process of rebelling eventually rise to level 20, and who then eventually themselves become overthrown by a group of plucky young adventurers... Basically, the setting can be overthrown three times over by a group of young adventurers who rise from 1-20 in the time between sowing crops after winter and harvesting them in the fall, by the core 3/3.5e assumptions.

On the other hand, if you have a lot less encounters than that for example suddenly giving lots of downtime and less encounters/day means Wizards and other similar casters become (even more) powerful compared to fighters and rogues who get nothing out of downtime and have few day-limited abilities.
