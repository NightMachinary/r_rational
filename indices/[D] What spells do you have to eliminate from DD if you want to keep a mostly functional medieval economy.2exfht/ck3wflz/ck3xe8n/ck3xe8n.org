Well, PCs are above-average. That's what the weird stat array and rolls are for. The problem isn't that the level XP thresholds are too low, it's that you're being given XP too quickly; you're probably finding high-level encounters at a terribly implausible rate.

Also, remember that there is a very significant chance of death if you're fighting often enough to powerlevel. Less so in actual campaigns, because dice get fudged.
