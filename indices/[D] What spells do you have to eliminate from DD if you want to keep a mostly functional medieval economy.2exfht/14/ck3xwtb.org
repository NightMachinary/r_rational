Most spells don't break the setting so long as the number of characters who can cast them is low and the really high level characters are hard to motivate.

For example, you mentioned Create Food and Water replacing agriculture if 1/15 people are 5th level clerics, but you also gave demigraphics that 1/64 people are 5th level (1/32 5th level or higher) and presumably less than 1/10 of those are clerics. IIRC, the DMG recommends making such characters even rarer. As for Miracle and Wish, it's probably wise to figure that anyone capable of casting those has their own agenda and can neither be ordered by a king nor bought for money.

There are still a few issues.

Magical traps have to go. Those weren't very well thought out in the first place.

Permanent teleportation circles need to be hard to come by. Having a few cities linked by them won't destroy the game (though it may come to make more sense to think of them as one city with neighborhoods on multiple continents) but if they're easy to come by that will destroy the setting. You can either nerf them directly or rule that every 17th level wizard in history has had better uses for their XP than revolutionizing the economy.

Speaking of XP, anything that gets you around XP costs probably needs a major nerf.

Wall of Iron often gets mentioned as replacing iron mines. So long as getting a 6th level spell cast costs more than 1000gp, though, it should be fine. The entire "cost to have a spell cast" table needs to be rewritten to be exponential instead of quadratic (with the last few entries being "cannot be bought for money").

Fabricate needs some sort of limit on how complex an item can be made with it.

Gating or summoning creatures and having them use SLAs needs to be banned or at least majorly nerfed (perhaps doing so against the creature's nature will offend its patron deity).
