Taking into account, of course, the ratio of high-level spellcasters in the population, the physical distribution of said population, and how feasible it is to train non-adventurers up to high spellcasting levels.

E.g. If there are 1 in 300 people in the population who are 20th-level clerics, great. But what if only 1 in 15,000 people can ever get to that level?

If all the population lives in a big city with many high-level clerics, and can travel to the local cathedral or monastery to eat (or pick up food if it doesn't spoil), great. If they live spread out in the countryside, not so easy. Even if a village of 300 people has one high-level cleric feeding them, what if that cleric is injured or dies?

Even if 1 in 300 people are high-level clerics, what if the fastest way to get to that level is by adventuring? Are the adventurer clerics who hit level 20 going to suddenly call it quits, hang up their weapons, and spend the rest of their lives as food machines?

Not to mention that people generally won't be satisfied forever with bland conjured food.

What you might get is the occasional small town or city with a high-level cleric who creates food for the poor each day, using it to bulk out donations of more varied foodstuffs.

Generally, you're not going to break an economy if one person in a thousand (or less) can, after years or decades of training and experience, produce a limited amount of goods or services - particularly perishables - cheaper than a donkey. If most members of the population, after widely available levels of training, can use magic (either a spell or item) to produce something cheaper than a donkey, then it's not all that different from them using any other tool unless they can reliably produce /significantly/ more than a donkey - in which case the economy might alter a little towards using fewer donkeys in that particular sector.

Now if a chunk of the population can produce something /trivially/ more easily than the cost of using a donkey to do so, that can change an economy to the point where it might be noticeable to a passing band of adventurers. However even significant changes might not be visible on the surface - for example, what if farmers regularly learned enough agricultural magic so they could sow, grow, harvest, raise, and transport a thousand acres of crops and animals without the need for work animals or mechanical assistance? Would player-characters notice the absence of workhorses in a farming community unless the GM pointed it out?
