I was interested to compare /Create Food and Water/ to modern farming techniques. So, using [[http://www.nff.org.au/farm-facts.html][Australian data]] (due to patriotism!) I find that each farmer can produce enough food to feed 600 people. This is somewhere between 13th (546) and 14th (672) level clerics using all their level 3+ spell slots for Create Food and Water.

I just enjoy thinking of Technology as a god granting us boons of food production, instant global communication, etc.
