  A DM intervening in daily life for all NPCs in the world means it's no longer an interesting problem.
#+end_quote

Yes, hence why this thread was created, to minimize the need for intervention by creating.

  I suppose the DM can say that no NPCs will ever consider any rule exploits.
#+end_quote

I get the feeling that you're not really listening to me- as I noted, the purpose of this thread is to minimize the need for NPCs refusing to consider how to break the world. You're talking about an unrelated situation that no one here is supporting. You are arguing against a strawman. Why are you arguing against a strawman? Yes, I agree, if the DM is continually fixing everything it isn't fun to discuss it. Can we move on?

  that a ladder is a couple of ten foot poles with some extra sticks, allowing you to generate 3.5 silver per round for 336 gold per day.
#+end_quote

There's no rule that allows you to convert a ladder to a ten foot pole, if we're going on a strict rules world.

#+begin_quote
  They can't realize that you can pull a zombie-smashing lever to gain levels.
#+end_quote

I see you're ignoring what I said earlier about danger.

If you're going to ignore what I say is there much point in replying?
