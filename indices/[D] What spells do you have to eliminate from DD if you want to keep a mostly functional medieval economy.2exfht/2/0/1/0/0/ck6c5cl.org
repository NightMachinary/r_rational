A DM intervening in daily life for all NPCs in the world means it's no longer an interesting problem. The DM can proclaim by fiat that something wouldn't work, and she doesn't need to provide an explanation. Or she can provide a technobabble explanation. Or she can try to come up with something vaguely reasonable.

But that requires a judge who is reviewing all actions in the world.

I suppose the DM can say that no NPCs will ever consider any rule exploits. This would require NPCs to be stupid -- they can't realize, for instance, that a ladder is a couple of ten foot poles with some extra sticks, allowing you to generate 3.5 silver per round for 336 gold per day. They can't realize that you can pull a zombie-smashing lever to gain levels.

I suppose also that the DM could say that PCs operate under different mechanics than NPCs. They could say that NPCs have a real economy, for instance, and people can't actually buy nine hundred ladders a day from the same shop. They could say that PCs have hidden selection criteria including aptitude for PC classes, and most NPCs don't have that aptitude and therefore can't take any levels in Cleric or Sorcerer, so there will never be enough spellcasters for most spells to have a large impact on society.

Of course, Craft Wondrous Item breaks that entirely. You don't need a huge number of spellcasters; you just need enough to create wondrous items to take their places. A wondrous item that casts Create Food and Drink at caster level 3 costs 108 experience points and 1350 gold. You'll need to prestidigitate it to make it palatable, which means another wondrous item at the same cost. (The item creation guides don't say that you have to determine the spell's specifics when crafting the item, so you can use the same item to prestidigitate the created food into cheeseburgers or pizza or elven ghanoush.) So the DM needs to outlaw or restrict creating magic items.

(Similarly, for a lesser form of immortality, a level 15 wizard can create a Ring of Polymorph Any Object, which will transfigure her or any target she chooses into any form desired; specifically, she can polymorph a person into a younger version of themselves, which is a permanent effect. This takes about three months and a hundred thousand gold. For a greater form of immortality, you need a magic item with True Resurrection, preferably on a command word, and that only takes eight years to create. Once created, you can use it 1440 times per day, and it takes no material components.)
