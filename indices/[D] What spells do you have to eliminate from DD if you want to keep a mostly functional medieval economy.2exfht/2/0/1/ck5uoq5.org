  The only way to level up is to put yourself in legitimate danger for your life

Enemies can deal nonlethal damage. Some attacks are inherently nonlethal, and all melee attacks can be done as nonlethal attacks for a -4 to hit. (Except in 4e, all attacks can be done as nonlethal attacks for free.)

So if you singlehandedly, at level 0, face down and defeat Bahamut, who wished to subdue you rather than kill you, does this mean you don't level up at all?
