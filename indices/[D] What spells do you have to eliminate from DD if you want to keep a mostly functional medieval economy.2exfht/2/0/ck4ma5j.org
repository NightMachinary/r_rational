You wouldn't get that though. This is where D&D rules get in the way. The only way to level up is to put yourself in legitimate danger for your life, and so each encounter is like a roll of the dice. (This wasn't even a pun, I swear.)

The higher the level, the more encounters needed. As you go furthur and furthur up the scale, the classes that are either just flat out more powerful or which are more likely to win fights(or simply escape alive to fight again) are going to be disproportionately represented.

I would expect many more 20th level wizards, clerics, and druids than Bards or Monks.
