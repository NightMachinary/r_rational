I haven't had time to do more than skim all the comments, so pardon me if some of this is redundant. I want to jot some quick thoughts before I have to fold up tents for the night.

Problem with balancing by rarity is that the people who CAN do it will have a disproportionate effect on the world. Their kingdom will have a post-scarcity lifestyle that means everyone will either want to conquer them or move there...which will destroy the labor base of surrounding nations, which will mean the rulers basically have to either impose draconian controls over their populace to prevent emigration, or go to war and conquer the rich country.

Also, unless you are artificially starving the PCs of money / loot / XP, they /will/ level up pretty quickly, so "rarity" is not a viable long term balancing strategy.

Spells that, off the top of my head, you would need to remove in order to maintain a medieval economy:

- Wish, Miracle, Limited Wish
- Teleportation Circle, Greater Teleport (GT + a Portable Hole full of stuff = effectively infinite free cargo transport)
- Create Food and Water
- Wall of: Iron, Salt, Fire (infinite money, infinite money, steam engine)
- Create Undead (free workers that never get tired or need to eat)
- Possibly Plant Growth (the 'increase crop yield' version)
- True Creation
- Polymorph Any Object (mostly just because it's about the most abusable spell in existence)
- Create Food and Water (and possibly Goodberry as well)
- Fabricate
- Elemental Swarm (also Lyres of Building)
- Probably Move Earth
- Planar Binding (actually, pretty much just every form of summoning)
- Scrying and related (allows rapid information exchange leading to mercantile optimization and arbitrage)
- Shapechange
- Portable Holes should probably go too -- they make trade too easy

That's just off the top of my head. There's undoubtedly more.
