My perspective is that the question is not as simple as banning every spell that could be used to create an abundance of some good. There is enough food production in the world to feed everyone, yet many go hungry. The economic problem is not simply the production of stuff, but the /incentive/ to produce, the incentive to produce /well/ (e.g. no one wants to eat the same bland food three meals a day every day) and the /distribution/ of the produced goods. Why would clerics want to make food for everyone, why would anyone want to eat said food, and how would the food get from the clerics to everyone else? How is need determined? A census? Costly and intrusive. Market prices? But with what income do the commoners buy food? Dropping a pile in the middle of every village every day? Costly, a single mistake could mean everyone goes hungry for a day or longer, and who polices that to ensure no one takes more than their "fair share?" Are people happy about being told what their fair share is? The clerics might see themselves as the noble benefactors of the commoners and demand much obsequiousness and material rewards, while the commoners will see the clerics as stuck-up, distant and unfairly dominant. Conflict will occur. (Actually, this could be a good plot for a game.)

In any case it seems to me that there are two ways this question can be handled without dropping any spells. One is to realize that when a spellcaster is engaged in economic production, she is not engaged in adventuring-production; that is, she is not slaying dragons and so forth. Thus it could be that the opportunity cost is too high for magic to have significant economic applications. Another alternative is to posit that there is an attitude among the magically puissant of negativity toward using magic for mundane purposes. In our world the equivalent to magic would be intelligence, the tool that broke us out of the Malthusian trap and into the world of modern economic production, yet it has often been the case that it was considered undesirable for "higher" thought to be concerned with practical matters. (Confronting this stigma could also be a good plot.)
