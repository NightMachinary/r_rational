The Flobovians and Anundjåns have their own rulesbreaks:

- They buy and sell whatever physical goods they want in the market, in any quantity desired, without affecting prices.
- They buy whatever magical spells they want, in arbitrary amounts, without affecting prices of anything (goods or spells). They can even buy more spells at once than there are casters in the city. Well, they could until Arros stepped on that idea.
- The Anundjåns use Polymorph Any Object as a rejuvenation spell. This plus True Resurrection means that no one ever dies unless they want to.
- They use spell engines (resetting magic traps / spell clocks / spell turrets) to manufacture goods, create food, etc. (This is part of the backstory; it's been casually referenced but hasn't really been focused on.)
