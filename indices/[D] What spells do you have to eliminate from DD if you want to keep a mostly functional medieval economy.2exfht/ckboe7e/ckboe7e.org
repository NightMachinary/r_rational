tl;dr? don't. try. to. make. DnD. make. sense. that path leads to insanity.

look at this from the SRD: [[http://www.systemreferencedocuments.org/resources/systems/pennpaper/dnd35/soveliorsage/goodsAndServices.html]]

cost of an untrained hireling per day: 1SP. cost of a poor meal... 1SP!? so the average menial worker is literally just making enough to eat with nothing left over for rent, clothes, savings, etc? baker is specifically mentioned in the notes, and a loaf of bread is listed as 2CP. say half of that goes to operating costs, and that baker's only making 10 loaves a day. what a lazy ass baker!

the entire system makes no sense. anywhere. don't even try to make it make sense, just get a different system.
