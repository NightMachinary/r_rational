  /Aeshkrau/: The illumian can use her Strength score to determine the bonus spells she gains for a high ability score, instead of the normal ability score used by her class to determine this feature. If she has more than one spellcasting class, she may use her Strength score in place of any or all of the ability scores used by those classes for this purpose.

It's stupid good when you combine it with Cancer Mage and Festering Anger. It's one of those tricks that you basically would never get to use because a DM would take you aside and explain that while it's an interesting theoretical exploration of the rules, it would absolutely ruin the game. That, or the DM just kills you.
