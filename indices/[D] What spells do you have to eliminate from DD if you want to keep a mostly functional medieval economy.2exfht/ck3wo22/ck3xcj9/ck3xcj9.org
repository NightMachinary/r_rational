The problem with making higher level people rare is that in D&D, they're incredibly powerful. My experience of D&D is that the party is always about five minutes away from turning into a pack of murder hobos. If you're level five and the guards are level one, you can cut straight through them like butter, and there's no point in following their laws. If a party of fifth level characters go to a very large medieval city (15th century Moscow was a fifth of a million), they can crush their way through all of the guards with relatively little trouble.

And you can run campaigns at a persistently low level, but the expectation set up by the rulebooks is that characters will level up every four or five encounters - the game is built around that, and it's part of what people sign up for when they sign up for D&D. Either the world is ready for the PCs or it's not, and I would prefer that it is.
