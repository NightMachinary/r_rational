The rules make sense (for the most part) as an approximation of a world in which PC class people are extremely rare -- and don't care about other people too much, since we don't see Rings of Polymorph Any Object and Rings of True Resurrection as standard kit at each village apothecary. Or maybe death in D&D is actually pleasant compared to life on the Prime Material (but then everyone would be engaging in risky behavior or outright suicide -- or at least it would be very prevalent compared to our reality). And in that case, Rings of True Resurrection would be rare, but Rings of Polymorph Any Object can heal anyone of anything -- as could Rings of Cure Critical Wounds and Rings of Remove Disease, with less opportunity for mischief.

Okay, so we have a world in which people who can use mid level magic and craft magic items don't care about other sapients, no matter their alignment. And the rules are approximations of the way the world works, so it's an error for you to extrapolate based on them. This pretty much solves all the problems. It brings us to wonder why people turn uncaringly evil, if not actively and aggressively evil, when they can cast a third level spell bard/cleric/paladin/ranger spell and craft a magic item, and that might be an interesting campaign (find the reason people go crazy and eliminate it).

That's all we need. Or we can try to run the whole world on D&D rules, but that produces a world with a very different economy, where at least the rich need never die, and where (absent a deity of the Rules As Intended) a lot of interesting exploits can vault a person to moderate levels very quickly and safely.
