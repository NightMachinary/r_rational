  Awarding EXP is left somewhat up to the DM, and they often refuse to give it for cheap hacks like this since the monsters aren't really a challenge.

If we have a DM, we can posit that very few people have the aptitude to get PC classes, and the item prices in the books are typical prices assuming nobody's buying up millions of ladders, pulling them apart, and selling them as firewood and staves, and anyone trying to game the system will find out that they can't. If we have a DM, the problem goes away.

We're instead assuming we have an in-world patrician whose rule is guaranteed and who is extremely knowledgeable about and adept with manipulating the D&D rules as written.

  You actually have to be in a dangerous situation.
#+end_quote

Where in the rules is this "dangerous situation" criterion written? I've never seen it before.

If it does exist, does it specify "danger of death"? Does it specify a minimum probability of dying? Technically, a level 1 vorpal rat could be able to kill a lesser deity with enough lucky rolls and some stupid behavior. It also means that a player gains no experience from defeating Bahamut and all his spawn if Bahamut wants to capture the player (using nonlethal means of dealing damage, which is only a -4 to hit for melee attacks) and exile her to a place of madness for all eternity rather than killing her outright.

If you need a nonzero probability of death, you can have your participants using lethal damage for some portion of their attacks. A lucky critical hit combined with multiple unlucky heal checks would leave a combatant dying. It's possible that the proctor would fail the perception check to notice. Assuming the proctor notices, she might become distracted while attempting to cast a healing spell, forcing her to make a Concentration check, which she might fail. It takes about ten critical failures for a person to die in that case, assuming everyone has plenty of bonuses in the right areas, with higher probabilities with lower bonuses. 1/20^{10} is small but nonzero.

If you need a nonzero probability of anything unpleasant for the character to receive experience, that fixes the Bahamut problem, but it doesn't change the exploit to any noticeable degree. The losing team for each engagement suffers some mildly humiliating punishment, like jogging naked through the city. Or they

If we have 4e mechanics available, we can use skill challenges as well. No danger required.

  Plus, often, npcs don't get exp, they just get levelled to an appropriate level.
#+end_quote

Even easier. All NPCs get a title: Archpriestess or Grand High Wizard or the like. Whatever corresponds to a high-level spellcaster of the appropriate type. Unless the rules as written explicitly say how rare those titles should be, you can have as many of them as you like. This is an initial large boost to the economy -- you're creating high-level NPCs with level-appropriate wealth and magic items.
