  Since it's an economic incentive, you can get a rich person investing in a bunch of high quality low level armor, strapping it on young commoners, and sending them at easy encounters until they level up.

Awarding EXP is left somewhat up to the DM, and they often refuse to give it for cheap hacks like this since the monsters aren't really a challenge. They can choose the challenge rating somewhat depending on the environment. Plus, often, npcs don't get exp, they just get levelled to an appropriate level. You actually have to be in a dangerous situation.
