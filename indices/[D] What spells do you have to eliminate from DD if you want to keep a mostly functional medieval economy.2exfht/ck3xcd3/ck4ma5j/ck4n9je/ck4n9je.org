I updated the math, and you would need more than 50% of all characters past 5th level to be clerics to make that work.

If the number of other classes at 5th level is 11, and the number of other classes goes down by one each level thereafter, till at 15th level, only clerics are left, you still only feed 208,715,898 people.

The high levels don't matter nearly as much as the low levels, simply because there are so many more of them.
