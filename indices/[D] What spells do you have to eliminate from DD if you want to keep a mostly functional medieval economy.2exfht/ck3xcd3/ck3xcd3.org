What physics do you have to eliminate from the real world if you want to keep a mostly functional medieval economy for a few centuries?

None, because that's how it happened.

Recognize that you (the player or DM) have an outside view of the world and understand what things are possible, while the characters living in that world have to discover them through experimentation. At the time your campaign takes place, they haven't figured it all out yet.

As to the above abuse of the Create Food and Water spell, it is a cleric spell, which means it's basically an answered prayer by an otherworldly being that can choose to intervene or not. Maybe the god doesn't want the world to work that way.

Using your level rules, in a population of 1 billion persons (all races) you have

- 500,000,000 0 level peasants
- 250,000,000 1 level characters split among all classes
- 125,000,000 2 level characters split among all classes
- 62,500,000 3 level characters
- 31,250,000 4 level characters
- 15,625,000 5 level characters
- 7,812,500 6 level characters
- 3,906,250 7 level characters
- 1,953,125 8 level characters
- 976,562 9 level characters
- 488,281 10 level characters
- 244,140 11 level characters
- 122,070 12 level characters
- 61,035 13 level characters
- 30,517 14 level characters
- 15,258 15 level characters
- 7,629 16 level characters
- 3,814 17 level characters
- 1,907 18 level characters
- 953 19 level characters
- 476 20 level characters

There are 11 standard classes, using 3e rules (the last set I am familiar with), so assuming an even distribution of classes, there are 43 20th level clerics globally, and 2,840,858 people capable of casting Create Food and Water, which feeds 42,612,870 people at one cast per cleric per day.

Assuming that after 5th level, a cleric is obligated to use all spell slots he can to cast Create Food and Water, and all clerics always do so, you can feed 150,057,180 people, which leaves 849,942,820 globally starving, or farming.
