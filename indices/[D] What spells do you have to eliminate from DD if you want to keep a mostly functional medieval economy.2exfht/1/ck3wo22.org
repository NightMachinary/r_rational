You don't really need to do this.

A fifth level character is so exceptional that they'd be a one in a million person in our world. They are the sorts of people who can break or make a war or a world. If you have one per fifteen people be at that level the world is generally going to be very broken.

A twentieth level character is closer to a god than a human and, as such, being able to feed 300 people isn't that big. If 1/64 people are level 5 there is very little you can do to make the world not broken.

Edit. For one, a fifth level character has a typical wealth of 9000 gp. They can hire a thousand mules, vastly more effective than donkeys, and feed them for quite a while.
