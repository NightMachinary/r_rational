  but the expectation set up by the rulebooks is that characters will level up every four or five encounters

This is very, very wrong. First, the number is 13, not 4-5. Second, it's only true in the counterfactual world where every encounter is a serious challenge which exhausts significant resources, which is very specifically not what a campaign is supposed to look like. If you look at the same page (or maybe give or take a couple pages), in the same place where it tells you that 13 encounters of EL N for a party of Nth level adventurers is about a level, there is a table which gives the assumed distribution of encounters. IIRC, it is 5% impossible, 10% impossible-except-with-a-catch-that-makes-it-doable, 15% EL = party level, 30% easy, and 20% very easy.

There's another set of essays about this very subject on the Alexandrian, along with how it, as a side effect, makes the Batman wizard totally impractical until about 16th level. With a side helping of minor house rules to put off scry-and-die as a practical tactic until about that same time.
