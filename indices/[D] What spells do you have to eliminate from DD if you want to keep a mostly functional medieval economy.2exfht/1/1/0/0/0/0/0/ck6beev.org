  Once you have a DM interfering with daily life, none of these questions are interesting.

That's kinda the point, the DM wants to make a universe that requires minimal intervention to run. The DM has a limited amount of good faith from the players, interventions often expend some of this good faith.

As such OP wants to set up a fair universe where everyone knows the rules from step one.
