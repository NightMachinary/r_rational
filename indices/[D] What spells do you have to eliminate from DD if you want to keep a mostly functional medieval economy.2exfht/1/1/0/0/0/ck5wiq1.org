  If we have a DM, the problem goes away. We're instead assuming we have an in-world patrician whose rule is guaranteed and who is extremely knowledgeable about and adept with manipulating the D&D rules as written.

  Imagine a D&D world that actually has a DM to prevent the stupidest abuses of the rules. You'd still need to make some rules changes to prevent the world from warping into something completely unlike a default setting. What spells do you need to remove?

Actually no, we're assuming a DM. One who wants to have the nature of the world naturally flow from the rules to make a functional society. Their issue isn't with item buying rules abuse, it's that they believe magic would break the world if the spell casters acted naturally. It's easy to say no to buying items, it's harder to say no to a core class.

  Where in the rules is this "dangerous situation" criterion written? I've never seen it before.
#+end_quote

Dungeon master's guide, page 36. It better covers both the spirit and application of giving experience points, including this quote. "The more dangerous the monsters, compared to the party's level, the more XP the characters earn." And it talks how it's somewhat up to the DM whether they want to award XP for certain victory objectives.

  If it does exist, does it specify "danger of death"?
#+end_quote

It leaves it up to the DM's whims. You can't abuse it with maths, they get to decide whether a non standard combat resolution is actually a resolution within the normal rules. It explicitly says that the DM is never obliged to award XP for a non challenging situation.

  Even easier. All NPCs get a title: Archpriestess or Grand High Wizard or the like. Whatever corresponds to a high-level spellcaster of the appropriate type. Unless the rules as written explicitly say how rare those titles should be, you can have as many of them as you like. This is an initial large boost to the economy -- you're creating high-level NPCs with level-appropriate wealth and magic items.

The DM could do this, but it wouldn't really solve anything. An NPC doing this wouldn't do anything as the DM levels NPCs.
