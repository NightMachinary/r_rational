But there's a strong incentive to become a higher level /something/. Since it's an economic incentive, you can get a rich person investing in a bunch of high quality low level armor, strapping it on young commoners, and sending them at easy encounters until they level up. A rule of thumb is ten standard encounters per level (at least in 4e), but if you want something commoners can survive, it might be fifty or a hundred. Still, that's going to be maybe three encounters per day (with a higher level person supervising ready to jump in if the fight goes south), which means at least a level a month, assuming you have appropriate opponents.

How do you get those opponents? You start out with a pool of candidates of level 0 and have them fight each other as a challenge. As individuals level up, you adjust the teams to keep the challenges even (so you don't get a team with a person who luckily levels up first and then ends up trouncing the other to the end of time). You can do this by shuffling the teams around or having people sit some encounters out.

Within a couple years, you have a steady supply of mid-level adventurers. The starting money is enough to feed a few dozen people for that time, the cost of the land and buildings, money for instructors, and a few sets of armor and weapons. A few thousand gold, all told -- maybe two hundred per trainee. A trainee at fifth level (assuming you're going for all clerics) can get you 12gp/week by feeding people (it's 5-6gp a week for a family of five on not-so-great rations to cook for themselves, and you want to undercut it so they can add seasonings to your "nourishing", "bland" food, so 12-ish gp total earnings). That helps you make back some of the training cost, and then they stay as a part of your organization (hopefully), making easy money with no risk and giving you a cut.

Of course, with Zone of Truth to assist in trials, group-casting Eagle's Splendor on a chosen leader, finding lost people with Helping Hand, defending a town from outsiders with a variety of spells, stopping thieves with Command, and breaking up riots with Enthrall (or making them less damaging with Bane and Obscuring Mist), clerics are in a good position to become local governments. With Shape Stone, clerics are also useful as builders -- after that year of training, each one can create 60 cubic feet of wall per day, plus another 15 for each that specializes in the Earth domain. Convenient, since that means they can build the prisons that your commoners will inevitably require.

Convincing them not to go off adventuring is left as an exercise to the reader.

  For one, a fifth level character has a typical wealth of 9000 gp. They can hire a thousand mules, vastly more effective than donkeys, and feed them for quite a while.

This requires them to have been adventuring in places where they would reasonably have gotten that sort of loot. Raising a cleric army from scratch, you'd expect them each to have much less money.
