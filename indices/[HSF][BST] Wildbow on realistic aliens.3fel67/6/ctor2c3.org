Starting in unnatural universes as a stipulation of writing fanfiction is one thing, but if your object of study is xenobiology, you can't just stipulate an alternate evolutionary pathway without having natural reasons to consider it plausible. It is very difficult to point to a major locus in our evolutionary history and say "This was a fluke, there was a good chance this adaptation would never have been developed, and life could have taken a completely different course". Everything from multicelularity to fur to mathematics has a strong reason rooted in game theory or material science for emerging.

The premise that aliens evolved under the same physical laws as us /could/ be significantly different from us is in and of itself questionable.
