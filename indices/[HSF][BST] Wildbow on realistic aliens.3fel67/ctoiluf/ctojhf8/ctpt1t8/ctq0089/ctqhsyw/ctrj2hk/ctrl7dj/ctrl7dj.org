A non-causal object is, by definition, not influenced by me. The 'alien' would therefore be modelled as a random number generator with unknown probability distribution (which is pinned down through priors and observations).

I'll ask again: What kind of evidence would you expect to see if an alien "can't be modeled" or "is not causal"?

(If you disagree with my definition of 'non-causal', I would expect your answer to this question to be necessary and hopefully sufficient to resolve that problem).
