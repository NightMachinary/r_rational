I spent a lot of today thinking about this, mostly because I realize that I made my criticism in (very nearly) the least helpful way possible. My starting point is that there's nothing inherently wrong with borrowing from whatever your influences are, even if you're not trying a deconstruction or reconstruction. There's nothing wrong with elves that commune with nature and fire their bows with uncanny accuracy, so long as you're telling a good story. I think /Mother of Learning/ is shaping up to be a good story, and so it's not really that the ideas have their genesis in D&D that bothers me. Hell, I have my own D&D inspired novel-that-never-went-anywhere.

Anyway, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it boiled down to two words; Magic Missile. I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons for nearly two decades now, and when I see that on the page I immediately start thinking of the spell as it exists in the game. Worse, it gets introduced as little more than "rod of magic missile", which sort of cements the association for me. So then every time I read "magic missile" for the rest of the story, my brain kicks me out a little bit to say "Hey, like in D&D". But magic missile in the story isn't actually the same as magic missile in D&D, because it follows its own rules under the magic system and shares relatively few properties beyond the base appearance. Magic missile is just an example - there are a number of places where the interesting things done with stock D&D tropes are put later in the fic after my brain has already gotten restless - a quest to kill spiders in the sewers, a vast dungeon beneath the town - some very interesting things are done with these, but you don't get the interesting stuff until you've already stuck it out for tens of thousands of words.

So to suggest a fix (which I've always believed is the polite thing to do when you're making criticism), I would rename magic missile to something less obvious and more original, and I would introduce the lore behind the vast Underdark area much earlier. Those at least would help with my immersion problems. With that said, serial works hardly ever get edited after the fact, and certainly not while they're in active development, so I doubt that this issue is going to be resolved. And despite that, I still liked the story.
