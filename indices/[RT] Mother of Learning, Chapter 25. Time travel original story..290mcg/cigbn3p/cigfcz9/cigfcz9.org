I actually hate having to wait for chapters on things. I was extremely glad that Worm finished up while I was reading it so that I didn't have to wait, especially since I've never read something so... intense.

I almost want to wait until things like Mother of Learning are completed to read it, but you never know when authors are going to stop working on a project.
