I hate waiting for chapters too, and far prefer attacking a completed work. It's even worse when you've been chewing through hundreds of thousands of words and reach the end, since then you have to wait for weekly or even monthly updates (and that's not even counting the ones that never get a proper ending because the author loses interest).

I've been trying to decide whether it's worth reading Mother of Learning given that it's unfinished, but I suppose it depends on how much longer it's going to be before it's officially complete.
