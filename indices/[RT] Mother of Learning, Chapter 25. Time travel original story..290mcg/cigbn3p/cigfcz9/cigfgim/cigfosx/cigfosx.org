Quite a while, unfortunately I can't seem to figure out how find out when each chapter was uploaded, or maybe it's a crappy website and lacks the feature. But I digress, I believe I recall the previous updated status was over a month ago. Also, he has a FAQ on his user page

  Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  Not even close to the end. The story basically has 3 arcs, and we're only getting close to the end of the first one. I'm really going to have to speed up the pace if I want to finish the story in anything resembling a reasonable time-frame.
