Magic Missile isn't the only thing he ganked from D&D. Off the top of my head:

- Tenser's Floating Disk

- Fireball (although that's a freebie; the name is super generic)

- Shield (again, super generic)

- Explosive Runes

- Winter Wolves

- Mind Blank

Probably more. That's all that comes to mind, though.

I like the idea of a city on the entrance of the Underdark, though. Very cool setting.
