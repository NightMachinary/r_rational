I had similar feelings about D&D terminology being used for things that don't actually match up with D&D mechanics. I like how he deviated from standard D&D magical theory - in fact, I think the magic system is great. I just think that the similarities to D&D are /just enough/ to make it awkward when the deviations occur. Using D&D names makes me jump to incorrect conclusions.

A few more:

- "Torch" is the "Light" spell from D&D (he even calls it Light in one instance).
- There's a "Darkness" equivalent, too. (I think he called it de-illuminator?)
- A few variations on Disintegrate are used.
- Feather Fall
- Spider Climb
- Zorian uses cubes that erect Walls of Force, which are basically a variant on Cubes of Force, a standard D&D item.
- Various fae races, elementals, etc.
