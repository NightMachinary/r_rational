TTS systems are very useful and only likely to keep getting better, but they do have flaws. It's impossible (currently) for them to provide inflection and tone that is appropriate to the pacing of the story, and every character voice is the same. For some people, of course, that's a plus. It depends on what you're looking to get from the experience. TTS is also very compatible with increased listening speeds, something that normal audiobooks have issues with for the same reasons described above.

Coincidentally, I happen to do some voice over work on the side for various things. If people are interested, I could start recording some samples of popular fictions that are posted here, and we can see how that goes. I don't know how suited people would find my voice for audiobooks (haven't tried that before), but I'm perfectly willing to give it a shot. For free, of course, and only with the permissions of the authors. If people do end up liking it and it becomes a more time intensive thing then I might set up a Patreon or some such, but I wouldn't worry about it. Happy to serve the community.
