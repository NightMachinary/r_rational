Thanks for a critical response. I have not done much price estimates. I think we would want to stay with somebody freelance though as companies like [[https://www.acx.com/][ACX]] would likely have terms that are not favorable to the community. People who are getting started in narration would also be able to give much more favorable pricing.

Something that could be done is a bounty where a person could get the money after completion of the work (this could be split if there is say person 1 working on Ch1-5 and person 2 working on Ch6-20). There would have to be some rule in place though so somebody couldn't just crap out a Text-to-speech and call it good though. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puxnkz5HZ6Q&list=PL8FUZfnC--scCq2spqHEtF3v56Aq7rdoL][Here]] is an example of something I would consider perfectly acceptable. The narrator makes a few mistakes, but nothing that takes away from the story.

A concern I have, however, with a bounty program (if it is released in the HPMOR Podcast style) is that people might start strong with a story and then the work fizzles out.
