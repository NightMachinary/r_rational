Can someone that listens to more audiobooks than me weigh in on automated TTS systems? Because with the quality that TTS systems are approaching (see [[https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/text_predicting_global_style_tokens/index.html#singlespeaker.unsupervised_prediction.tpcw][2. from here]]) it seems to me that in a few months (or as soon as google publishes their recent work as an API) this will largely be a problem that solves itself.
