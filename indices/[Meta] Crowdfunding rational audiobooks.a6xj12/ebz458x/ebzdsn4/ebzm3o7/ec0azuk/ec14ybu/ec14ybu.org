It would be nice to see the audio of Pokemon: The Origin of Species completed. Thoughts [[/u/DaystarEld]] ?

It would also be nice to have an audiobook for Ra, but in the above estimates that would come out to about $7k. Thoughts [[/u/sam512]] ?

Edit: All that said, if you wanted to start narrating then you can do whatever you very well please.
