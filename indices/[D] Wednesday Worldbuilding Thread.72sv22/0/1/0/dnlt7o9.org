Tying into the empire collapse thing, I was planning on having one nation that began when a city-realm in an empire intentionally collapsed the only gate to the rest of the empire in order to escape some kind of calamity. The city then began reinforcing gates into uninhabited realms and colonizing them, spreading into a new empire.

This might even be how most independent nations form; a kind of civilization mitosis.

As for the fortresses, I agree. War between civilizations will be difficult and probably usually end with one side collapsing a gate and separating from the others.

But with a high-magic setting, even the best fortress might not be impervious if the players are smart about it.
