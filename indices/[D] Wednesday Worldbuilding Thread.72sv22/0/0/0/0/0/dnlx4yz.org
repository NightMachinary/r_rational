They aren't really portals, they're points in space where any object that contacts it is teleported. More like a tiny teleportation circle in DnD or something like that. I set it up that way specifically to prevent weirdness with liquids/gasses, so I think I'll just say that liquids and gasses don't count as "objects" as far as gates are concerned, but if a container containing them is moved through a gate, they'll go along with it.

I might also say that teleportation requires more energy when traveling to a higher altitude in order to make kinetic strikes less viable. I /really/ don't want the players to have easy WMDs.

And as for loops of realms, I don't think I was clear enough. People don't have any way to influence where new gates lead, and there are a tremendous number of realms. The best you can do is set up wards to increase the rate that gates form and hope for the best.

A single loop of gates small enough to fit in a single empire would take decades of waiting and extreme luck. And they would't have much say over which worlds were connected in a loop.

A loop of three realms would be seen by the inhabitants as proof of divine intervention.

Another idea for preventing bombardment: disintigration beam aimed at the projectile. Hit it high enough, and it won't gain enough kinetic energy for the particulate matter to be a problem. Even if it is moving quickly, air resistance is a much bigger deal for small matter, and wind magic may be used to counter it/spread the effect over a much larger area. Or maybe portals to redirect it into the sky before disintegration. Or maybe a cylindrical gravity nullification/reversal effect.

Now, that I think about it, it shouldn't be a problem. If the players try anything funny with kinetic energy I'll just pull out one of these and surprise them.
