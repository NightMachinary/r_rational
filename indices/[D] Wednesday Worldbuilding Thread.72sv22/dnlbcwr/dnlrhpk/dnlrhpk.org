One of the biggest challenges is going to be maintaining the infrastructure that allows an empire to persist. Not only will occurrences similar to the fall of the Roman Empire be more common, but they will in some respects be impossible to recover from (Earth geography is constant, but gateverse geography is not, so if you lose the gate to the fabled world of the Really Useful Stuff, it's probably gone forever).

I've got an idea kicking around for an unstable world where the paths between A and B change over time (meaning that neighboring countries will likewise change) and the only way to keep things nailed down is to connect them with an iron road.

Something more unique to the gateverse would be the practice of constructing immense fortresses in front of or around any important gate. I imagine that it would be very difficult to invade any properly-organized empire, since you can not only set up an indefinite number of walls and other defenses in front of it but reinforce the location from behind the gate. Normally, a fortress under siege is on its own, but a gatefort that is under siege effectively has an entire country within its walls.
