Something like that would probably be used for transporting supplies between realms. I think magic will be common and powerful enough in this setting that "free energy" devices won't be that much of a game changer. (Mostly so that the players don't get caught up in perpetual motion shenanigans.)

Either that or I could say that the power requirement of the devices that keep gates active is rather high, and increases when matter is moved through to account for any changes in potential energy. I'll probably have to go with the "free energy is common" thing if I want to stop players from turning themselves into a power company, though.

I may have to set an upper limit to the size of objects that gates transport to prevent anything too ridiculous. Like a glacier larger than a small realm suddenly being transported into it. Might make the limit inconsistent among gates so people are forced to err on the side of caution.
