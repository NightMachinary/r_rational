  As to the whole gate/weather thing, there is a problem with all of that. Gates are tiny things that only teleport an object that touches them.

Proposal: stupendously large supertankers that aren't really designed for travel, just to survive gate transit, support vast amount of water and rapidly load/unload it.

Depending on how predictable gate behaviour is, you could possibly even automate this, with "landing cradles" on the dry side that automatically empty the vessel and roll it back to touch the gate when it is empty (and vice versa on the wet side). The automated solution could perhaps use smaller vessels but transit more rapidly, and many more in parallell.
