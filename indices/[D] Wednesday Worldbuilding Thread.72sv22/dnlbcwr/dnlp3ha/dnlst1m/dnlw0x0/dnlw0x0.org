  As to the whole gate/weather thing, there is a problem with all of that. Gates are tiny things that only teleport an object that touches them. Even assuming non-solid objects are affected, it would only act as a pinprick sized portal. This poses a problem for most things involving liquids or gasses.

It's not really clear why that would be the case. Like gasses and liquids are made up of many individual particles so unless there's a limit on that it's unclear why they wouldn't pass through. Though since the particles aren't all supporting each other you might have the water appear spread out as a continous blast of mist. Also if only solids are affected you could still set up the portal so that a glacier passes through it or all the ice that fell off the edge of the glacier was funneled into it.\\
As for them being tiny you mentioned flying ships being the main transportation so they really don't seem that small. If it can fit a flying ship then you could have a pretty massive pipe connected to a river blasting water at it.

In regards to stuff involving gates: Even if you only get one gate between two realms you could still create a loop of gates between three or more realms. Of course these plans may require a lot of logistical work but that's probably a good thing since it limits gate based WMD's to major powers. Though if there's practically unlimited uninhabited realms maybe you could set things up there.\\
Importantly it strikes me that the best strategy may be just setting things up so that light passing through the gates gains some gravitational energy with each circuit. So using these portals you would effectively be able to create gamma ray bursts of intense energy then when the circuit is broken it could be set up so the gamma ray burst went through a gate.\\
Even besides being a weapon I imagine people might use this to try to break the firmaments and other similarly insane things provided they were separated by a chain of enough gates that the explosion won't reach them. Of course if somebody left the gate accelerator on too long then it would create a kugelblitz which would be /really/ bad.

As for protecting against kinetic bombardment that seems like it would be rather hard. In that nudging something with that much inertia isn't going to make it not hit your city (plus you need to extend the wards up into space to really affect things too much). Of course when governments are involved there's also the issue that they would likely put their own wards onto the projectile, which only need to last for seconds at most once they get remotely close to the target. As for opening dimensional pockets, that doesn't seem like it would work, after all unless you allow pockets of unlimited size the projectile still hits the inside of it, either collapsing it and releasing all that energy. Or creating another even better type of WMD by using dimensional pockets to catch massive amounts of energy from kinetic strikes and then release it all when you next open it.
