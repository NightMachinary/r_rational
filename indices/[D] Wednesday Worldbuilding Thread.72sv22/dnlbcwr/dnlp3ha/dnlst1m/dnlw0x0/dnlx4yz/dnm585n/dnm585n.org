  They aren't really portals, they're points in space where any object that contacts it is teleported. More like a tiny teleportation circle in DnD or something like that. I set it up that way specifically to prevent weirdness with liquids/gasses, so I think I'll just say that liquids and gasses don't count as "objects" as far as gates are concerned, but if a container containing them is moved through a gate, they'll go along with it.

Yeah I mean I got that it's just that gasses and liquids are made up of lots of little objects ie molecules, there's no fundamental difference between sand (which would presumably be teleported but perhaps be spread out around the exit area) and water except scale. So presumably the gate must set some limit on how small objects can be before it doesn't notice them.

  I might also say that teleportation requires more energy when traveling to a higher altitude in order to make kinetic strikes less viable. I really don't want the players to have easy WMDs.

Yeah for conservation of energies sake the most consistent solution to this problem ought to be to require that they put in as much magic as would be needed to telekinetically move an object so as to add that much gravitational kinetic energy.\\
Of course it needn't be exactly as much energy as would be used for telekinesis because you might say that there is a lot less inefficiency and thus wasted magic. However it ought to be cost as much or more than whatever the /theoretical/ minimum mana cost would be for telekinesis.

With that said of course this wouldn't really affect governments because they can certainly afford to attach each rod to massive hydrogen balloons (getting them as high as possible to reduce the cost slightly) and then just muster enough mages to afford the cost of teleporting the massive +tungsten+ lead encased in steel rod. Of course if the magic can be used to add energy in this sort of straightforward way I can actually think of more destructive WMD's than kinetic bombardment.

For instance why not just add the energy in the form of kinetic energy directly instead of as potential energy? Or instead of adding large scale kinetic energy add it in the form of small scale kinetic energy ie heat, in which case you now have a spell that sets off a bomb at the target location if it's not warded. Of course allowing either of those means mages should easily be able to use gun spells since the kinetic energy requirements would make them way more efficient than something as terribly wasteful as a fireball. However magic focusing on applications which use the least energy is sort of an inevitable consequence of most self consistent magic systems that don't find excuses to avoid it.

Actually now that I think about it kinetic bombardment is probably going to be a thing regardless of teleportation because you have magical flying ships, which presumably don't need to exert an equal and opposite force on the air beneath them. So you could use specially designed airtight ships as "bombers" with less explosive but far deadlier payloads than the real deal.\\
Of course the enemy could try to protect the area above their cities and bases with their own magitech craft, but given tech levels, speed and the amount of space above most cities to protect, there would be a definite advantage on the offensive side in space combat.

In regards to gate loops I suppose they may not be common enough to be too big of a deal. However given you said there are supposed to be nearly endless uninhabited realms, large enough empires seem like they could probably find a loop with a long and dedicated enough program of searching (with dedicated gate wizard explorers to ensure they don't lose their path home). Part of why it seems inevitable is that importantly any size loop will work provided you can get control of all the involved gates and move them, which shouldn't be an issue if most worlds are uninhabited (or if any inhabitants aren't on equal footing with the empire). Still this sort of thing is most definitely in the domain of large governments research projects.\\
It has also occurred to me that black holes are actually not an issue since event horizons can't propagate through the gates. So all that creating a black hole means is that nobody who uses gates connected to one of those worlds is coming back.

  Another idea for preventing bombardment: disintigration beam aimed at the projectile. Hit it high enough, and it won't gain enough kinetic energy for the particulate matter to be a problem. Even if it is moving quickly, air resistance is a much bigger deal for small matter, and wind magic may be used to counter it/spread the effect over a much larger area. Or maybe portals to redirect it into the sky before disintegration. Or maybe a cylindrical gravity nullification/reversal effect.

See the thing is that defending against kinetic bombardment is in many ways comparable to defending against ICBMs, it's /way/ harder than you would expect. For one hitting it is damned near impossible because of the sheer speed and the fact it would probably be enchanted to slightly move around side to side at random similar to what ICBMs do, also good luck even detecting a projectile moving that quickly from so far away. In another sense these rods would actually be harder to beat than ICBMs because they are massive steel rods (perhaps cored with lead for mass or even made entirely of tungsten or uranium if materials allow), the destructive energy required to actually vaporize them would be utterly insane and require introducing these beams as staggeringly powerful weapons in their own right.\\
As for snatching it with portals, that is going to have the same issues as shooting it due to difficulties in predicting its exact path. Of course with sufficiently massive portals that can be created in a split second you can probably beat that but that becomes a massive addition to the setting in its own right. Plus one would also have to consider the ways automatically activated enchantments on the rod will be designed to counter this and other safeguards. Also since portals exist it becomes vastly cheaper or at least easier to use massive numbers of rods dumped from portals so unless the catching portal can cover the whole city you're screwed.\\
In regards to gravity safeguards those are flawed because the rod would just adjust its path to avoid them like with beams. Except with the added downside that you need to keep the rod in the antigrav field for a while to do much to diminish the inertia it built up in space. So the only way either type of field works is if you blanket a truly staggering amount of space (hundreds of cubic miles likely) with it in which case you might as well just cover that area with anti-teleportation wards. Also like most other countermeasure magics you could easily apply gravity magic to the rods themselves to massively increase their destructive yield.

Anyway if you want to keep WMDs away from players probably just make things prohibitively expensive in cost and or magic, doing nerfing the ability to extract free gravitational potential energy from teleport probably does that. With the additional bonus that you haven't /only/ kept your players from obliterating extremely well defended city. After all do you really want to make it so that any powerful wizard can nuke anywhere that isn't incredibly warded? Of course undefended areas could still probably by nuked by using "bombers" like I mentioned earlier so that particular point is probably moot. Spaceboats on the other hand can probably be much more easily countered by well defended areas provided they have better divination than the players anti-divination wards, so they'll never get above a city before being taken out by any of the superweapons I've mentioned.
