I hadn't thought of kinetic bombardment, but since the people being attacked will generally have magic, too, it shouldn't be too hard to solve it in a way that doesn't break the setting.

I'd rather not give players WMDs without making them really work for it.

Maybe wards that detect and redirect large falling objects have become standard practice, or maybe the are shunted into a pocket universe.

As to the whole gate/weather thing, there is a problem with all of that. Gates are tiny things that only teleport an object that touches them. Even assuming non-solid objects are affected, it would only act as a pinprick sized portal. This poses a problem for most things involving liquids or gasses.

Given that this is a high magic setting, people will likely struggle more with harnessing/directing power than generating it, but some of these perpetual motion type generators are interesting enough that I may have some empires that use them.

Actually, another problem with the gate/generator ideas is that people can't arbitrarily create gates between two realms. I may also set a rule that two realms can't be connected by more than one pair of gates at a time. I imagine with the gates randomly appearing and nearly infinite realms to connect, there may never be more than one known route between any two realms. So any generator technique that blocks a gate to other traffic may be infeasible.
