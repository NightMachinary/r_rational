  While magic can be used to teleport, it can't be used to travel to a different realm. You have to use a gate for that.

Just a reminder that teleportation needs to be handled carefully because it's super exploitable. For instance in mid-to large sized realms you should be able to teleport metal rods hundreds of miles above a city (which unless the atmospheres operate via magic and the whole dome is always filled) then let them accelerate through empty space with the result of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment][well...]].\\
Of course you might choose to simply make this sort of kinetic bombardment attack difficult but not impossible and incorporate it into your setting, allowing you to incorporate elements of MAD if you wanted. These sorts of attacks might mean that all extremely valuable targets are kept either hidden or in realms that don't extend high enough to pull off these attacks.\\
Also if you controlled your gates/territory extremely closely then you might be able to stop this sort of attack depending on what you need to pull one off.

Of course if you can open two way portals (within a realm) there are way more exploits, but just using teleportation the biggest issues are pulling massive energy out of it, usually through gravitational kinetic energy.

Also it strikes me that kingdoms are likely to try to majorly influence the climate through the use of gates. For instance a desert realm opening a gate to another one in a ocean realm partially immersed in water (or fully depending on how much water blocks the gate vectors). This would allow them to have one of their gates in be a river (and very difficult to leave through which may even be intentional) so the ships going wouldn't really need to fly either.\\
Similar strategies could also be implemented for affected the temperature (also using submerged gates since water has so much heat capacity), humidity or expanding/creating or shrinking/removing bodies of water.

It strikes me that the main source of mechanical/electric energy is also likely to be gates which open to bodies of water at a higher elevation to drive massive turbines. Hell if they don't need to open to some "equivalent" position in the other realm then you could set up a loop of gates through which molten metal or something similarly dense flows/fall constantly, in order to extract massive amounts of kinetic energy.

Given you didn't say that gates need to be the ground I imagine empires are also going to need to ward all the sky/space up to the firmament above their cities to protect themselves from a gate based type of kinetic bombardment attack.

By setting up the right arrangement of gates above the atmosphere it should be possible to make structures that are continuously falling in order to experience zero G's.\\
Also those object would build speed indefinitely this way which potentially allows for gate based kinetic attacks to cause arbitrary amounts of devastation. Also you could probably make great use of the time dilation in a continuously falling structure that had reached near lightspeed (which would need to be well shielded against radiation).\\
Yeah the whole continuously accelerating gate loop idea is so ripe for potential abuse as well as insane potential. Of course you might well need multiple cooperating governments to manage it which might eliminate the chance of rogue agents using it but would certainly introduce some MAD politics, (after all can you shield every part of every realm in your empire?). Not to mention the devastation could be so bad that you could destroy a realm that wasn't totally shielded just so the explosion would travel through gates there into your enemies realm.
