I've had a setting bouncing around in my head for a while now for a pen and paper RPG that I'm calling "Thousand Gates" (working title).

Instead of a single world, there are effectively infinite mini-worlds called realms. These essentially follow the biblical model of cosmology, with a flat land surrounded by a spherical firmament. They vary in size and composition, with most containing a single biome. Their land area ranges from a few dozen square miles to a few hundred thousand square miles.

These realms are connected by a shifting network of "gates". These are points in space surrounded by an aurora-like aura. When an object touches the point in the middle, it and every object whose weight is supported by it is teleported to the realm it is connected to. They'll appear near the gate on that side, but not within the aura and won't be touching the gate on that side.

This is a high magic setting, and magic can be used to to do many things including influencing gates.

Below are some rules/features of the world I've come up with. I want to make it so people/players can have a real impact without completely breaking the setting. Let me know if you have any suggestions for it.

- While magic can be used to teleport, it can't be used to travel to a different realm. You have to use a gate for that.
- A Realm must have at least one gate at any time, and realms/gates can never form a closed loop. All realms are always connected to all other realms if you use enough gates.
- Gates normally last between a few days and a few weeks before disappearing. Magic can be used to extend this indefinitely as long as the spell is maintained (usually by a magical object kept nearby). Gates can also be forced to disappear with magic, though this can take some time, especially if the gate had previously been reinforced.
- Gates do not appear inside or underground. The firmament must be directly above them, and a certain percentage of vectors leading from a point must contact the firmament without contacting any material for that point to be a valid gate location.
- If conditions change so that a gate is no longer in a valid position (someone builds a roof, for example), the gate will move into a valid position. This is predictable enough that it can be used to move gates to specific locations.
- Magic can prevent gates forming in certain locations (you don't want one directly above your stronghold, for example)
- Since gates teleport the thing they touch and everything whose weight is supported by it, this can lead to some problems. If someone walks up to a gate and touches it, they'll leave their shoes behind. A vehicle with wheels may appear without its axles or wheels. Since this is a setting with a lot of magitech, I planned on having flying ships as the main form of transport between worlds. Just let the prow touch the gate and the ship+cargo is transported as one.

I envision large empires made of connected realms using magic to prevent the formation of new gates across most of their territory and stabilize existing gates, with a few realms on the "edge" acting as the frontier. Some isolationist empires might only allow a single gate into or out of their territory.

What are some of the things you envision happening in a universe like this? Potential challenges?
