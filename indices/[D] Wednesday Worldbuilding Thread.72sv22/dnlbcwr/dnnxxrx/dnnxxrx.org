Hmmm. No closed loops - or no loops at /all/?

If there are no loops permitted at all, then if you and I are in realm A, and I have access to the gate that leads to realm B, then there is /no route/ that you can use to get to realm B except by going via my gate. I can magically reinforce my gate, and put loads of troops and wizards into defending it, and tax any trade that goes through the Gate to my hearts' content.

...wait, come to think of it, there is a way around this. If you can slip from realm A to realm C through a different Gate, and then close the gate between realms A and C, then realm C will be temporarily entirely disconnected from the Realms. It will, of course, immediately reconnect to a random Realm... and if you're lucky, you might be able to get from that random realm to B without going through my heavily taxed Gate.

...this leads to an idea for an NPC. A smuggler, who has his own private mini-realm (one of the really small ones). He buys a bunch of cheap stuff, stuffs it in his mini-realm, then goes in there himself and shuts down the Gate. He then finds himself able to get to a different, randomly chosen Realm, with access to a bunch of stuff that was cheap where he came from and on which he has paid no import duties, and presumably access to a whole new market... so a kind of inter-realm smuggler. (A very useful character for an RPG, because he can easily have just about anything in his private mini-realm, tends to randomly turn up anywhere, and is quite willing to sell it to anyone if the price is right. Pay him a bit more, and you can buy the "no questions asked" special as well; in case of danger, he retreats to his mini-realm and closes the Gate behind him.)
