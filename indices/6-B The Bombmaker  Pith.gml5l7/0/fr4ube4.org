On the one hand, I'm happy that Wes is starting to move on from Samuel.

On the other hand, I'm not sure that Mr "Take lots of drugs all the time to forget how much your life sucks" is a step up. Hira feels like a glimpse as who Wes could be with a few years under his belt: funny, ridiculously good as a black ops unit, and still running away from himself.

(also, I'm kind of shocked that Wes is willing to sleep with Hira so soon after Hir basically blew the whistle on him; I thought he'd be at least a little mad)
