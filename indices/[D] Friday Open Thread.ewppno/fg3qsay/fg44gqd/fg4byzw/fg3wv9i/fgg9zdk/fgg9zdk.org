I don't think the Bad Place still exists, everyone goes through the testing process, even Hitler, it just might take forever for them to clear it. I too think that the celebration of ending oneself is actually kind of myopic - mostly because it relies on such human, material concerns like "getting bored" - why would an eternal disembodied soul get bored? What it'll get, addicted to the dopamine /it doesn't freaking have/? But on the other hand, even eternal bliss would be just a very gilded cage without an option to just /quit/. So I think it was right to provide that. Still the most reasonable approach would have been to also reintroduce small levels of strife in the Good Place and turn down the "happy all the time" dial a few notches.
