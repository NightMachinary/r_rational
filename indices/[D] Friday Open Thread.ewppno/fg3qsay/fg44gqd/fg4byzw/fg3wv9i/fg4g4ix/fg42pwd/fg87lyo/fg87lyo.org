Thanks - I really enjoyed the finale for the reasons you stated and also wanted to add a few other things:

- It was very true to the characters and honoured them, which I really enjoy in finales of long-running shows.

- People are complaining that all the characters go through the door but Tahani becomes an achitect and we never see her Die For Realsies.. I think that shows that For someone like Tahani, who is accomplished and has ambition/etc, Erasure might never actually be on the table.

I like that. I think not everyone is "like us", not everyone wants to have the most optimal life, and we need to be more sympathetic and do less sneering at the "lesser people". I think so many of us grew up as nerds who were ostracised so we start "looking down" on the jocks when we reach adulthood, but we should really all try and get along like the grown ups we are.
