I'm not sure that'd necessarily be any better than personality reprogramming, in terms of feeling like your personality matches your memories of yourself. I mean, if your "cycle" starts in early childhood, then sure (even though that's getting back into "murder" territory), but if it's a reset from a point in adulthood, I think you'd at least want to leave a faint, deja-vu-esque or dreamlike memory of the events which led you to your adopting an "improved" personality. Otherwise, if my behavior and personality suddenly changed for no good reason and I noticed it, I'd be concerned about mental illness, if not outright dementia.
