The concept that Hell is /fundamentally/ unjust is actually what the series slowly drives towards. It just takes its sweet time doing so, all four seasons, probably to ease the viewers into it, even the ones who might be too much in the habit of thinking it a right punishment. It's pretty sneaky, in its own way. But at the end they basically abolish Hell altogether.
