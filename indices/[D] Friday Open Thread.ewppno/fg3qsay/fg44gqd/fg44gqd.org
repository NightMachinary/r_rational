I also haven't watched these last few episodes, so I won't read or respond to your post, but will share my main annoyance about the first season -- not a one of the human characters, upon being confronted by the existence of a bottomless pit of suffering right next door full of all manner hellacious tortures and infinite agonies and whatever tries to question the overall rectitude of the system. At least not until later on when they realize that their own heaven's a sham and "undeserving" people (like themselves) actually end up in hell, and there but for the grace of Michael's experiment they'd have gone too. It just puts me in mind of all those quotes about how "[[https://www.trivia-library.com/c/history-of-afterlife-in-different-religions-islam.htm][true believers, lying on couches in Paradise, will see the damned suffer and laugh at them scornfully]]" or how "[[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5tt2NOwR7kC&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=The+elect+will+behold+the+torture+of+the+impious+and+as+they+see+them+they+will+not+grieve.+Their+minds+will+be+sated+with+joy+as+they+gaze+on+the+unspeakable+anguish+of+the+impious,+returning+thanks+for+their+own+freedom.&source=bl&ots=OiNncLaT6_&sig=ACfU3U1PsrRt7hmC81hiPo8NkD9NinG49Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS_Z_Pu67nAhVzCTQIHU__A68Q6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20elect%20will%20behold%20the%20torture%20of%20the%20impious%20and%20as%20they%20see%20them%20they%20will%20not%20grieve.%20Their%20minds%20will%20be%20sated%20with%20joy%20as%20they%20gaze%20on%20the%20unspeakable%20anguish%20of%20the%20impious%2C%20returning%20thanks%20for%20their%20own%20freedom.&f=false][the elect will behold the torture of the impious and as they see them they will not grieve. Their minds will be sated with joy as they gaze on the unspeakable anguish of the impious, returning thanks for their own freedom]]" or how those in heaven "[[https://books.google.com/books?id=DepiAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA343&lpg=PA343&dq=We+will+see+them+condemned.%22&f=false][will see them condemned. We will see the terror on their faces. We will hear their screams and cries of agony. Yet, we will not shed a tear. Indeed, we will give our vote that you be condemned. And when you are cast into hell, we will shout "Amen! Alleluia!]]"

Like, it just seems like such a disgustingly callous and evil position to take. I can maybe see most of the humans just DGAFing their way through, and maybe Chidi holds some ethics that think infinite torture a commensurate response to whatever earthly crimes, but why doesn't he ever question why no moralists who ascribe undesirability to suffering don't call Janet up and have her teleport some sort of anti-hell omnibomb into its deepest reaches? Or at least clarify more thoroughly how the system works? I recall them playing lots of tortures for laughs in the "those rascally demons!" vein and I guess it just made it harder for me to sympathize with characters so full of apathetic self-centeredness.

(which yes, is a large part of their character arcs, but still)
