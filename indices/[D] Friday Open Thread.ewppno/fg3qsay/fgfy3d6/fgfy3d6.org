I put off watching it until now, because that's exactly the ending I saw coming based on the last episode (and based on this comment - I didn't read the spoiler part but if someone on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] was mad about the ending and highly upvoted that seemed like a solid guess why). I agree with everything you said. I think it was kind of inevitable - any other take on permadeath would have been a huge shock honestly, given our whole culture and everything. Still sad though.
