I've written my highlights from [[https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-agent-that-can.html][Google's new Meena chatbot]]:

[[https://gist.github.com/Veedrac/e8b57bf8d9e42a07cad9a6184b3b20cc]]

Here's a preview of the headline conversation:

#+begin_quote
  *Meena Conversation 4* /from paper/\\
  Human: I like how cute cows are\\
  Meena: Ah, interesting. You like how they are cute, right?\\
  Human: yeah, and they're realy smart\\
  Meena: I heard they go to college\\
  Human: cows go to college?\\
  Meena: I heard that a cow went to Harvard.\\
  Human: what did the cow study?\\
  Meena: Bovine sciences.\\
  Human: do horses go to Harvard?\\
  Meena: Horses go to Hayvard.\\
  Human: that's a pretty good joke, I feel like you led me into it\\
  Meena: You were trying to steer it elsewhere, I can see it

It baffles my mind that the main response to Meena was a bunch of variants of â€˜it doesn't count'.
