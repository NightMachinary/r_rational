Wheee, long feedback! Thanks for spending the effort testing so much and typing everything up. Changes will show up next upload, which is delayed behind a different exciting change.

Alien Artichokes - I think you're right. Not sure how I'll buff it yet. Ideas are having it also provide organics (may be way too strong), expanding the planet list (steps on Hardy Humans's toes a bit), or using humans (also steps on Hardy Humans).

Primitive Tech - Added Terran and Dark planets, made the level 3 requirement tech instead of bots.

Tier 3 - I find myself picking gas > stoicism > meds too. I'm nerfing gas to require laser drills at level 3 (making it the only bootstrap to require a tier 2 resource). Going to try spaceships instead of meds.

Tier 4 - I think Interstellargrams is the weakest, but bumping that range number up makes a huge difference, so I just did some more of that.

Tier 5 - Nerfing Shiny Silicon by adding a third gas requirement.

Tier 6 - Interestingly, I almost always pick space factories. So it sounds like this one is fine. I also need to get around to making the third tech for this tier. The plan is to turn a gas giant into a star that provides a wildcard resource.

Tier 7 - Moved superconducting supermetals to asteroid/volcanic.

  IIRC planets that produce the same type twice don't fill two bars?

That's true, but it's a bug. I'll get to it eventually.
