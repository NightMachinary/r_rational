Glad you're enjoying it! Especially enough to offer to pay.

Undo would require saving the entire game state, which would in turn require me not to do certain gross javascripty things like patching the constants file with research. These are the same cleanups I need to do for saving, replays, and seeds, so they'll happen. But I don't consider these things to be on the critical path to launch.

My monetization plan is to sell it. It'll be $10 on Itch in a couple weeks, then various other platforms as I jump through their hoops.
