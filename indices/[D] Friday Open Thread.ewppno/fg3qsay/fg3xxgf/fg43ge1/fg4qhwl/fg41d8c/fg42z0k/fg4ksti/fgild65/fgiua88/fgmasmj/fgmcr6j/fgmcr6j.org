She does become very powerful (in fact, "meh I can take her", people underestimating her and losing, became a running joke in the fandom), but the threats also escalate a lot, so she continues to "barely come out alive". At some point, you have to accept that that's what will happen because it makes for a more interesting story. If it helps, you can think of it as the AnthropicPrinciple. Out of all the millions of parahumans in the world, the story happens to be about the one that will end up surviving and saving the world.
