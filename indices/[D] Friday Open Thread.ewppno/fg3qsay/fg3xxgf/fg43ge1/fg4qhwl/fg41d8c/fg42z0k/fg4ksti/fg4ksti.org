I'm interested in reading Worth the Candle but I'm wary of starting something that hasn't been completed yet and might not for a long time. Without spoilers, can someone tell me when can we roughly expect the story to end? Any speculation is welcome.

In addition, is the story one continuous one (e.g. HPMOR) or is it divided into individual arcs (e.g. One Piece, Dragonball)?
