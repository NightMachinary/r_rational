To me it seems Taylor's real power is often her Plot Armour. Because in most clashes she manages to barely come out alive, and against Leviathan her powers weren't all that useful either, outside of the scouting aspect. I don't know if she'll take a level in badass at some point in the future, but it's a bit stretching disbelief that she's even still alive.
