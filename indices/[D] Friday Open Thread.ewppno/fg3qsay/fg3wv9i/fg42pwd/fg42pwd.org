I don't have the episode available right now, but I'm fairly certain they say that if someone never gets better, they go to the Bad Place, which is one of the reasons Shawn agrees to the plan in the first place, because he's still getting SOME people.

The deathist part is not just about them dying, but the fact they glorify it by saying life has no meaning without it. Come on, you can disagree with me on the details but it was pretty clear.

I did miss what your final paragraph says, but that is even worse. Why did a show about philosophy rely on erasing knowledge?
