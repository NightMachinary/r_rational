As a long-time fan of the show, the finale left me feeling really deflated, in part because there were so many arguments and statements that seemed so flat to me. In particular, Elanor bemoaning that all her friends have left or gone to do their own thing, as though she's gone for several eternities and never made any new friends, having been sustained only by friendships that she made at the relative beginning of her eternal existence. Similarly, I get why, as a finale, you wouldn't want to introduce many new characters, but everyone is so stuck in their Earth ways, and a lot of the exploration and advancement is left unspoken, making it seem like Earth was basically all there was.
