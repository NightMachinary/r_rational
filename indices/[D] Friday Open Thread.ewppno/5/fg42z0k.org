The 2019 edition of [[https://www.tor.com/2020/01/29/some-of-the-best-from-tor-com-2019-is-out-now/][Best from Tor.com]] is out for free now (the stories themselves are free to read on the site). I've only read Greg Egan's [[https://www.tor.com/2019/09/25/zeitgeber-greg-egan/][Zeitgeber]] which was already [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/e0gqtu/zeitgeber_by_greg_egan/][posted on the sub]].

*Edit*: The [[https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/ew9bso/best_of_tor_2019_free_ebook/][kind folks]] at [[/r/printSF]] notice that the 2016 Edition is also free ([[https://www.amazon.com/Some-Best-Tor-com-2016-Original-ebook/dp/B01MS8EZ9X][amazon link]]).
