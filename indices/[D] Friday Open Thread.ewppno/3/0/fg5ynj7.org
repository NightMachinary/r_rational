Alien artichokes seems questionable. It's a lousy robotic farm, and later techs are better for food supply anyway. I guess you could argue that it reduces the need for massed humans? Except that getting a pair of organics without "hunt" (which reintroduces the mass human problem) requires "breed"--kinda rare, only on swamps I think?

Tier 2... Primitive tech is a neat trick, but the others have significantly more flexibility. More planet types to use on, and more options for those planets. On the other hand, the other two are practically obsoleted if you get terraforming later. I'd still favor buffing PT I think? I haven't played enough games with each to get a a hands on feel though.

Tier 3... So, for second tier /products/, I think the minimum chain goes meds->insight->energy->silicon->spaceships (terran->swamp->mineral->factory->spaaaaaace). Since spaceships are a big deal (can't use cloud/gas/ice planets without them), I favor energy. Space stoicism theoretically lets you put up tier 2 without industry. In practice, maxing human planets requires consumer goods, which means you build an entire industry setup anyway. Was awfully useful for insight/science chakras once. Now that you need tier 3 for chakras (and so have to max your tier 2s), I think I prefer gas mining, if I'm not strapped for minerals. I can certainly see situations where I'd want it though. Alien meds feel like more of a last resort, even with the extra planet type. I can frequently use more insight or energy for producing stuff. Extra meds? Total junk.

Tier 4... Distance stuff. Um, I think this depends heavily on your setup at this point. I'm usually moving lots of industry, soooo. Interstellograms stuff feels less impressive, extra range or not, but I'll see how it works for tier 2/3 before judging.

Tier 5... Again, I go industry most of the time, and I have tons of factories, so planetary supercomputer really doesn't do it for me. Shiny silicon has been my go-to choice. It leaves more mineral planets for energy anyway, making the less energy use look bad, but I haven't tried that one much, so I dunno. Without shiny silicon I tend to have problems getting enough gems.

Tier 6... Terraforming is amazing, no question about it. One type of field to a factory is crud in comparison... Except that if you didn't get wormholes/asteroid farming, asteroid fields are literally useless, and not having a gap is a large boon. I've had it be the better choice more than once, but I think I'd still try to buff space factories a bit somehow.

Fewer opinions about tier 7. I tend to go with fusors so I'm not blowing a second tier good on bootstrapping my third tier. Factories have enough outputs that they tend to not have a ton of spare capacity even with the number I build. Superconducting supermetals is problematic in that mineral planets don't HAVE a different tier three good to produce. IIRC planets that produce the same type twice don't fill two bars? Could be misremembering. Doesn't matter because you don't need that much unobtanium anyway. The remaining one might be okay, especially for chakras. I haven't tried it.

Spaceyards is good for getting that last damn resource wherever it needs to be. Particularly for the AI project, where you'll put together an entire planet cluster for that last good, if you must. Also, if you still don't have use for asteroid fields. Either of those would make it the ideal pick in some games, so it's fine. Extra range on spaceship built goods: It's not bad? Unlike the others, you don't have to build anything to take advantage of it. I dearly love the last one. Whether or not it's a good mechanical choice, the extra long paths are just cool.

Endgame... Totally depends on gas giant placement (and if you remembered to save the well connected gas giant in the middle of your setup for later use). Either can be easier, depending.

I haven't been examining planet type tech pick interactions (particularly volcano/ice/coral) much. I know it's possible to be unable to use some into endgame, with the wrong picks. The interactions probably matter a fair bit, and I'm ignoring them, so.... I will note that the simple heavy industry path synergizes well with itself. It's my favorite path.

Take all my opinions with much salt. I've spent far too much time on this game (love it, btw), but not actually enough to be confident in how my balance assessments work in practice. Would take several games with any given tech. >_<
