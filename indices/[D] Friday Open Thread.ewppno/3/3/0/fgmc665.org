Thanks!

The only symbols that aren't interchangeable are hops, which represent range (in planets), wildcard (circled ?) that represents any consistent resource, and research, which is a normal resource but is also globally counted. Otherwise there's only one reference in the game to what the symbols are "supposed to" be, and I'm considering finding a way to remove it. Largely because I enjoy hearing what people decide to name them.

A quickplay guide would be good, but I consider that sort of thing to be the last thing that should be added to a game. It's more important to improve the visual treatment to explain as much as possible on its own, and a text guide dulls the need for it.
