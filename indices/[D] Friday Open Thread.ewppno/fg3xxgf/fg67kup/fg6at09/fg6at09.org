Although it fairly reliably gets close to a human-like response, there are still issues with keeping track of details, so the indistinguishable conversations are a minority. Probably it's somewhere between 5% and 30%, depending on your standards.

Meena is good at small talk, since there's lots of small talk to train on. So if you're letting her lead the conversation, she'll ask lots of easy questions and give decent follow-up. She's much worse at conversations about niche things, particularly situations invented during the conversation, and she'll forget things like names in fairly short order.
