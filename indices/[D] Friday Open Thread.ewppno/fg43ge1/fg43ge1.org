I'm looking for a (short) story I only vaguely remember. It's basic premise was our reality was a simulation and one day the admins thanked us for our contributions, said they'd naturally keep the simulation running for humane reasons, but shut down / pause various subsystems to conserve calculating power. One of these subsystem was weather, which continued at whichever setting it was currently locally (sunny, stormy, cloudy, ...), another was erosion, which simply stopped. The main characters then started to explore, I think? And the story ended on them discovering a shortcut between two places, like clipping through reality.

An image that stuck in my head with this story was how the shortcut tunnel the MCs walked through had trees growing at all kinds of odd angles, as if someone had disabled collision detection and gravity while placing them.

Also, since I listened to the whole Escape Pod archive at some point (and still listen to it semi-regularly) it might be on there, but I can't find it.
