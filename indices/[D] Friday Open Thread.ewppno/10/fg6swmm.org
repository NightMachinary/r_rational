Considered posting this to the subreddit proper but it's really rational non-fiction, rather than fiction. This is a very interesting look into the fake martial arts - both those who claim to have mystical martial arts powers and more borderline claims concerning comparisons between MMA and traditional Chinese martial arts.

Also, the video narrator is Irish and has a voice like velvet poetry, so there's that too.
