Very fun puzzle!

How feasible would an undo button be? Just one level would be great: every so often I misclick, and mess up a chunk of galaxy, which when you've sunk some while into a run is quite frustrating...

What are your plans for monetization? I've sunk more time into this now than a fair chunk of my steam collection, so feel like I should be chucking some cash your way ;)
