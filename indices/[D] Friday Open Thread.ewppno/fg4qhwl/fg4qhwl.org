Still working on [[http://noisyowl.com/spacetrains/spacetrains.html][Space Trains]]. I've started in on endgame material; you can solve the AI Value Alignment Problem now, though most people choose a substantially sillier victory option.

I could use feedback on how well-balanced the tech tree choices are, especially if you attempt to play without bonuses from special planets.

Brief tutorial: Click a planet to choose a project. It provides one of the thing to the right of the arrow to each planet within range. It needs a group of things to the left of the arrow, each comma-separated group increases the range by one. Range is measured in hops (that n-shaped arrow) - how many planets away the resource travels. That symbol universities use is whatever resource the planet gets the most of.

Is there some sort of iconic design I should use? I'm terrified of getting [[https://twitter.com/BisTheFairy/status/1192557730709622790][mocked by some sort of train nerd]].
