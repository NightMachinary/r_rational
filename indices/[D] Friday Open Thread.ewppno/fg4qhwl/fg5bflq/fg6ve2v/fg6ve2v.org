It's half broken, looks like I broke dragging the slider with mouse when I added support for touch input. Clicking it has worked. That's confusing behavior for a slider, so it'd make sense you saw it one time but not the other. It'll be fixed next time I upload; while I do enjoy the occasional scary fast ninja edit, I'm in the middle of a refactor.

I'd like a way to save too, but it's probably a ways off.

Glad you're enjoying the game!
