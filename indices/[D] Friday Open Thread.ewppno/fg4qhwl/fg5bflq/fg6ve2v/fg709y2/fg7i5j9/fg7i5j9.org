I know how to do it, it's just low on the list compared to a lot of actual gameplay stuff.

And I appreciate the offer, but this is a commercial game that I'll be putting up on various stores in a couple weeks, not an open source project, and I don't want to steal your labor.

Besides, as something I powered through in the course of a month with no precise plan exactly what I was building, the source code is hazardous to the reader's health.
