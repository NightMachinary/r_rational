There were attempts to use conventional military weapons on Endbringers before, but large-scale weapons and cities you still want to live in afterwards don't mix. Russia tried nuking Behemoth before, that didn't do anything except fuck Moscow over even more than a normal EB attack would have.

But yea, with a few capes you have to ask yourself, what were they thinking? It's basically guaranteed that a squishy like Regent wouldn't be able to contribute, seeing how no other Master has been able to directly affect Endbringers.

I'm guessing in part, capes made it into a matter of "face". If you didn't turn up to an Endbringer attacking your city, people would lose respect for you, mercenaries wouldn't work with you, etc.
