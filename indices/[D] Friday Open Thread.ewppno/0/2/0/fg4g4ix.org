I haven't watched the Good Place, but I'd like to dispute this assertion:

  My only real issue with it is that using mind control to change their personality would be more efficient and have the same effect.

This seems like it would have a high risk of "[[https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Project_T.A.H.I.T.I.][Tahiti]] is a magical place" from Agents of SHIELD.

For anyone unfamiliar with the reference but not wanting in-depth spoilers, in the first Avengers movie, a character is seemingly killed off, but that character is alive again for the later SHIELD TV show. When asked about the place where he recovered from his injury (Tahiti), he compulsively replies, "It's a magical place." Of course, the compulsion eventually makes him suspicious and he tracks down the truth of how he survived his injury.

And that's what I'd be worried about with a personality overwrite. If the "good" personality doesn't match the person's memories, it could lead to some serious dysphoria.

On the other hand, if you change the memories /and/ the personality... isn't that just plain murder, by replacing a person with a different person created out of whole cloth to meet the necessary specifications? Inspired, perhaps, by the original, but not really a continuation of that person?

While guided progression towards a certain minimal moral standard certainly has its drawbacks in terms of how time-consuming and repetitive it would necessarily be, I really can't think of a better option that would result in a sane person who is meaningfully the same person you started with.
