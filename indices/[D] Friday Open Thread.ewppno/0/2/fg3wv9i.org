  The Bad Place somehow still existing, but only for "really bad people"

Where are you getting this from? The new system is that people get placed in a morally challenging neighbourhood where they are tested, assessed and lead towards becoming more moral people. At the end if they have earned enough points they go to the good place. If they haven't then they get a lecture on what they did wrong, their conscious knowledge is reset (though the subconscious effects of the lessons learner are retained) and they go through the system again and again untill they are good enough for the Good place.

My only real issue with it is that using mind control to change their personality would be more efficient and have the same effect. Also why you need to make sure everybody in the good afterlife are nice when there is Janet magic and nobody has to interact with anyone they wouldn't want to interact with.

What multiple solutions are you looking at? I think there is really only 2.

1. Allowing people to (eventually) end their story
2. Putting them into a infinite loop by altering them so they enjoy going through the motions

No 2 regardless of the method used (changing to inhuman psychology, memory resets, drugs and so on) is effectively wireheading.

I also don't think people taking many kalpa (or however long a beremy Jeremy is) to exhaust all the meaningful fun in a Janet heaven environment they can possibly have is very deathist. (Aside from an all inclusive paradise afterlife actually being real is a reason to commit suicide).

The reason they don't know what happens is that they deliberately removed that information and related memories from their minds after the thing was built.
