So, The Good Place, the NBC series known as a philosophical Parks & Rec, is finally over.

It's not rare when I feel disappointed with the finale to a long running network show, but it is when they fuck it up so hard that I can call it immoral. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.

The deathism in the previous episode, but jacked up to eleven. Characters choosing to kill themselves and both the narrative and other characters praising them for it. Fucking contemplative music as you watch a very dumb character who's known for making bad decisions through no moral fault of his own willingly obliterating himself, with no one allowed to disagree with him. People being called /selfish/ for trying to stop the process. The Bad Place somehow still existing, but only for "really bad people", which really shouldn't work by the rules of the show unless there is something like evil genes or evil brains, in which case is it even fair to punish them??? Objections to the Death Gate being conveniently ignored even when they were brought up in previous episodes. Pointless mysticism about "becoming one with the world" even though they're in a completely different metaphysical realm, or "not knowing what happens" even though they're the ones who designed the gate

I am angry. Angry about finales. Most of this came from the previous episode, but they just really, really went all in with it, huh.

It would have been really hard to write a satisfying finale with the constraints they have, but people have come up with some ideas I would have found better, like a choose-your-own-finale style final season, with a few possible solutions to the problem based on different philosophies, and the viewers choosing the heaven they agree with the most.

I guess that's too experimental for network television, though. In retrospect, it was probably a mistake to rely on solving a nigh unsolvable real life problem as the main draw of your show's final season.

What do you guys think?
