WtC is divided into individual "books", which try to have strong(ish) conclusions to them that wrap up some major story thread. Each book also generally has two major story threads in it, put back-to-back (the first book only has one). I think the current best stopping point, which /mostly/ ends a major arc without starting anything new, is after chapter 160, "On the Merits of Oblivion", about halfway through Book VII.

In terms of current plans, unless something major changes, it will be done this year, but I might end up writing slower than I thought, or longer, so maybe don't hold me to that. The work has gone longer than initially planned by a significant margin, which is partly planning fallacy, partly just not really being in a rush.

(I made a vow a while back to stop giving updates when I got near enough to the end that it might constitute spoilers, which is, I think, where we're at now.)
