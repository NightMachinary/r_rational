I'd have to second this one, a few of my favorites are works that haven't been updated in years and I don't expect them to be at this point.

If it's good, while I've gotta take the mentality of it's a fun ride. Not to mention, I've left more than a few of my own stories hanging. Sometimes for years, I have ideas, but none seem right so I'm less mad about unfinished stories then I used to be.

Can't really complain about something that most put up for free, and I strive to send a good comment if I can. It might have been years, but a little encouragement works wonders.
