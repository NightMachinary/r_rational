So I'm TAing a lab right now and it's one I'm quite familiar with (having TA'd it 3X and taught the class 3X more). Since very little prepwork is required on my part, I've decided to have some fun by polling students for attendance. So I'll spin a short, 30s story of how they've been accepted to the [PUN] Academy of Spellcraft and Sorcery and need to choose a major via [[https://i.imgur.com/dcC3vdQ.jpg][sorting beret]], or how they've been pressganged into an international dog-fighting ring and have been offered a choice of fire, water, or grass "starter" dogs, etc. (there are generally funny photoshopped pictures of the instructors / TA's, which I'll avoid reposting here for privacy reasons).

Next week I'm planning for the choice to be among [[https://i.imgur.com/9kjrhUR.jpg][Infinity Stone Tools]] (with the premise being how the GREAT LORD [PUN]os is trying to solve the student debt crisis by failing half of all students etc. etc.).

My questions are:

1. Are my stone tool powers balanced? They're all supposed to be college coursework themed.

2. What other quick, classic, pop-culture-y choices would be accessible to today's typical American college student? Some ones I've thought of so far (these in addition to more academic questions):

  Avatar the Last Airbender / Captain Planet Rings / Classical Elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air

  DnD Classes: Wizard, Fighter, Ranger, Rogue

  ASOIAF Houses? Dragon Money Wolf Boat

  Team Edward vs. Team Jacob?

  Pop. debates, e.g. black+blue vs. white+gold, yanny/laurel, etc.
