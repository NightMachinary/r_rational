Worth The Candle is about as divided as Worm. There are distinct multi-chapter arcs, but their consequences bleed into each other heavily.

I couldn't say when WTC will end. There are hints that the end is coming soon, but not really any on how soon, or how long the end itself will take. I'll wildly guess it's 2/3rds finished.
