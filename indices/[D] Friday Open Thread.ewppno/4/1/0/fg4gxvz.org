They're abrakademically enforced ;) for that one I was just thinking it would let you automatically receive an offer to a typical entry-level position in any field you've had some basic training in (but it wouldn't help you advance beyond that point or prevent you from being fired). Peak munchkinry potential should be something like flitting from Bay Area SWE roles to pull a rather unfulfilling 6 figures, so I guess it'd be conditional on a role existing in a field that exists etc. etc. I won't have time to provide any clarification, though, so it'd ultimately be up to the interpretation of each student :)
