And the prevalence of bad people appear to have a lot to do with systemic issues. IE: Lead pollution and the crime spike in the 80's that had everyone convinced society was heading into a criminal dystopia, the historical examples of out right abusive childrearing practices and constant alcohol consumption that led to so much of the past being an annex of hell, "Starvation, endemic corruption, lacking education, ect" and the current third world crime rates..

So one view of Gotham is that it's Johannesburg, only in the US - Police so corrupt and mistrusted that /nobody/ cooperates with it, which leads to enormous crime rates. Or that there is something in the water. In neither case is the batman going to fix things. If the ladder, its better water purification and wait 20 years, if the former, the entire police department needs to be reformed, and reformed in a way that makes the public actually trust it again. Which means it needs to not only be honest, but seen to be honest. Tall order. Life logging uniforms is the most obvious attack angle.
