That does not actually help. If the gpd is to rehabilitate itself association with a masked vigilante is outright hurtful. On the amusing other hand, there are one heck of a lot of people in gotham that all seem to have a very specific set of cognitive distortions - an affinity for violence, a really impressive work ethic, an urge to dress up and organize their lives along a theme, disregard for social norms.. Also high intelligence, but that might actually be a result of the utterly deranged work ethic... Conscientiousness consistently applied over long timescales isn't just a complement to intelligence, I am pretty certain it also increases effective intelligence (because it lets you master more skills)

So this could very plausibly all be a poison or a bug fucking with people's minds. Heck, that could also explain why gotham isnt an abandoned ghost town. - if there is something in the enviorment that acts as an anti-akrasia drug and some people have a more extreme reaction to it and turn into the riddler or batman, then that explains why people and businesses don't all run the fuck away. How much risk of being killed by a super-villain would you tolerate to live in a city where you had greatly elevated reserves of focus and will?
