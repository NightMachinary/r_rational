  crime is caused by systemic disenfranchisement

Stopped listening there. (Not really, but it did strike me the wrong way.) The worst crime is that which has a negative impact on the most people to the highest degree. Some guy robbing a store hurts the store owner's bottom line for that period. Some guy shooting a person hurts one person and their surviving family. (We can say these crimes terrorize all of society, but all crime by definition does that. Criminal courts are built because crime is viewed as a crime against all of society.) Okay, both of those examples might be caused by systemic disenfranchisement, or a terrible education, or poverty. What about Madoff? What about Enron? We have criminals who can rob tens of thousands of people at once--and get away with it. We have people who can wreck an economy and cause millions to lose their jobs, their homes, ruin their marriage and career, jump off a building because their assets turned to junk. We have people whose companies can poison millions of people and ruin the environment of an entire region, to the point of literally poisoning the waterhole by dumping waste in rivers which contaminates the area's water table. Those criminals don't lack education nor wealth, and they aren't oppressed, and they have a well paying job.

Instead of saying, "poor criminals cause crime because they are poor, and rich criminals cause crime because they're bad people," let's just say all criminals are bad people. I mean, I know a lot of poor people who aren't criminals, so if poverty leads to crime, why isn't every poor person robbing a bank? Why do we have to have different excuses for criminals of different income levels? Where is the line of required income between causing crime due to disenfranchisement and causing crime because you're an asshole?

Crime is caused by assholes who think they can get away with it. Those assholes would think twice if some nut in a batsuit was gonna come break their legs for mugging that dude in the alley.

So to answer, a rationalist Bruce Wayne would have the best utility for his education, brilliance, diligence, and cash piles by pursuing white collar megacriminals, the ones whom the law cannot touch. (But beating up people is more fun to read about.)

As it happens, canon Batman beats up thugs because his parents were killed by a thug. (Hired assassin blah blah blah, he didn't know that at the time he donned the batsuit.) Batman was never supposed to be utilitarian.

(An alternative argument is that povertous individual criminals commit crimes BOTH because they are disenfranchised and because they are assholes, and the factors multiply to surpass the threshold of how big a jerk they have to be to cause crime. In this case, we still need to mention that they cause crime, at least in part, because they are assholes, and not solely because they are poor.)
