  Crime is caused by assholes who think they can get away with it. Those assholes would think twice if some nut in a batsuit was gonna come break their legs for mugging that dude in the alley.

I think this is a pretty reductive argument and not really based on any actual study. It's easy to group and dismiss anyone who commits crime as "a criminal" as though either a person is just naturally a criminal due to genetics or upbringing, or that regular people magically become "a criminal" when they first commit a crime.

There is a lot of discussion about why people commit crimes, some theories can be found here: [[https://www.udemy.com/blog/criminology-theories/]]

I will say one thing - for some types of crimes and some classes of criminals, their crime very much has to do with their circumstances - be it education (or lack thereof), upbringing, or environment. Those circumstances are amenable to correction by the infusion of money. These causes are also reinforced by systemic racism or classism.

Obviously you're not going to stop all crimes/criminals, and there are clearly people who are not going to be helped. That doesn't mean you don't give it a try.
