Certainly not in this world. It's a no brainer that he could do more good with investing the money in after school programs or curing cancer or something. For that matter, his scientific/inventing talents might be better served working for the greater good.

What about in the DC universe, though? Is masked vigilantism the only/best solution to super villains operating in a completely corrupted system? Would it be possible/rational to invest in systems or structures designed to improve the lives of the poor if they're going to be killed by some minion over $20 or some hair brained scheme to "take over the world".

I guess most of the Batman themed villains don't have very rational goals. Most are insane. Maybe the best investment would be in a more effective mental health care system. Arkham Asylum doesn't seem to be very effective and mostly seems to be run by the inmates.
