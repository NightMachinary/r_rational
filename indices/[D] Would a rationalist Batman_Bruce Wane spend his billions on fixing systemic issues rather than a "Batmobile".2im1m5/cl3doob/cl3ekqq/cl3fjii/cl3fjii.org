[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g6q4d/rt_inviolate_by_scrivener_a_lex_luthor_story/][This]] one gives a pretty good explanation for Lex Luther, as portrayed in the comics. Obviously not as reasonable as your world though. Earth is a weapon storage facility. You never know when you're going to need a particular power.

I like to think of the heroes/justice-league as the "X risk task force". It makes a bit more sense if you presume that batman is only doing the whole gotham thing to keep his detective skills sharp in his down time. Considering he can be resurrected/healed pretty easily in the justice league canon.

Does cut through his canon motivations.
