  How the police hasn't managed to catch him, however... maybe during the McCarthy era when he was publicly known to hunt Communists? The Batman story is predicated on incompetent law enforcement, which wouldn't really work as a rationalist backdrop I think.

The police normally don't make a concerted effort to catch him. He makes a reasonable effort to comply with the law in public and normally has a good relationship with the police that lets them overlook his illegal actions like taking evidence from scenes, doing some iffy citizen's arrests.
