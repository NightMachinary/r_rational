Firstly, let me apologize for bumping up a thread this old. I've been rattling around the idea of a Batman rational fiction in my head and I've put off posting here because of a lacking of confidence in my thoughts on the matter, but untimely decided to post.

When brought up to my roommates (one of whom introduced me to this subreddit and the fiction y'all have been working on), one of them felt Batman is already a rational character/story and would bring nothing new to the table.

I had my disagreements and reading much of the debate here reinforced them. Granted the Batman story is told and retold in so many ways from multiple angles so finding a unique approach is stretching it.

Who's point of view do you take? Edward Nigma for an equally rational but ultimately flawed protagonist following a similar agenda as the Arkham games, or a new GCPD detective on the Batman case, or just Wayne himself in a more introspective role?

The last one is sort of iffy. On the one hand we've all seen the story told through Wayne's eyes but after reading the points made on here about Wayne NOT being a rational character, I wanted to explore the question of what if he was. Here is my take on a story such as this;

Bruce Wayne is a rational genius with an remarkable amount of money from his family estate (trust funds left behind?), family assets, and of course Wayne Enterprises (which is always successful but in different industries per story). Despite the wealth Bruce is a person motivated by an unsatisfiable urging to protect those close to him personally. This would manifest in his charitable nature to Gotham, especially to people close to him and ask for assistance (maybe Alfred/Fox could help keep him from donating too much?). This obsession would be the catalyst for his need to protect those close to him and Gotham.

So why Batman? It would start with Wayne ski masked sneaking somewhere to stop a crime. A crime directly effecting something Bruce is doing to help the city. Say one of the crime families is really pushing hard in a district which the Wayne foundation is investing in and Bruce himself deducted would help ease poverty and crime in the worst areas of Gotham. The thrill and "ease" of accomplishing these clandestine actions would encourage Bruce to take more actions into his hands to protect the city.

This is also why Bruce would NOT stop at first. His impulse to personally intervene, even if he figures out that his actions are causing more mentally disturbed criminals to pop up, would keeping him in a mental loop thinking 'if I stop him/her/them HERE then I can stop all this'.

Depending on the setting, Batman's resources would be at least measurable. Wayne Enterprise is not a bottomless money pit and no matter how much wealth one has you'll only have access to the most advance technology the era can achieve (so no super 'bat-inventions'). The Batmobile would also have to go, as with the other vehicles. Just to easy to track and recognize.

Lastly, just how 'realistic' would this setting be? To be honest, I'd like the image of Bruce with his hands pulling at his hair trying to figure out just how does a 7' humanoid crocodile stalking Gotham's sewers fit into his model of the world.
