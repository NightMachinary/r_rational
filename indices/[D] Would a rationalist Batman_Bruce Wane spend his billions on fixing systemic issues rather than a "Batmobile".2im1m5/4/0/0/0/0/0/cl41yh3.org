Eh, Gotham, being fictional, has an endless supply of villains so batman has someone to fight. But this is an amusing theory. Amusing enough I might actually commit fiction. I mean, "Massive misgovernment" also works as a cause, but I don't find it fun - because that means all batman is doing is fighting symptoms and letting the real villains of the piece be because they are of the upper classes. ergh. bad taste in my mouth.
