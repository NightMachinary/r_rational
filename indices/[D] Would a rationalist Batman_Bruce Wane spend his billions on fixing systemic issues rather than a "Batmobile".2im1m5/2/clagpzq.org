/Edit: Wow, gold! Thank you, kind stranger!/

OK, so you're Bruce Wayne. Your parents were murdered in front of you, so you taught yourself martial arts until you ran out of masters to beat. You inherited their company, and a few obvious suggestions meant profits are though the roof and new technologies are trickling out of R&D at a steady rate. Life is good. But you /know/ that Gotham, that the /world/ is sick.

The obvious first step is to start funding effective charities. Bruce Wayne already has the Wayne Foundation, which you both own and fund, so it should only take a few changes to improve that. Pretty soon your agents have their fingers in every element of infrastructure around, from schools to subways, and they're all improving ...

... except for the literal gangs roaming the streets with impunity. And wrecking your stuff. And recruiting the kids your shiny new schools are turning out, and bribing the cops, and stealing from the hospitals and businesses.

The next obvious step is to set up a working justice system, right? Thankfully, You already have a like-minded friend whose ambition is to do exactly that: good old Harvey Dent. You fund his political campaign, pretty soon he's making sweeping and effective changes. It's slow going, and the mob is fighting back, but it's /working/.

Then, suddenly, Superman. It's usually assumed that he was he first "out" superhero - a symbol of hope, and all that - and all those rumors are suddenly making a lot more sense. There is a god, and he's American, and he's cleaning up the streets in Metropolis. Turns out, an alien superbeing watching over them is a pretty effective deterrent even though Superman is only physically present at a small fraction of crimes (he's a busy guy.)

So you back to your company, and you tell them two things: first, start working on superweapons, we can't rely on this one guy to defend the planet from aliens. Second, /start working on superweapons/, we can't trust this random guy to be god. Thirdly, I need this list of parts. For ... research purposes.

You take your computers and equipment down to the basement - always hated that place - and you start designing an /optimal/ superhero. One who may not stop the next alien invasion, but by God can he make teenagers think twice about attacking people on the street.

You don't have powers, sure, but special effects don't cost that much. You rew some basic knockout gas, dye your old kevlar body-armour from your ninja days matte black, and patch it up into a kickass-looking outfit. You pick something creepy - bats, who doesn't hate bats? - and come up with a signature so people will know what hit them (tie 'em up with bat-shaped bolas, ruin their stuff with bat-shaped charges and knives.)

You sneak out with your new bat-shaped listening devices - may have gone a little too far there - and start bugging local mob hangouts. Pretty soon you know where some big fish are swimming. You show up at a bank robbery, announce your presence to the world when the cops show up to find it already taken care of.

More superheroes start appearing, following Supes' lead. A couple of people with alien hypertech - one guy has a magic ring, for Chrissakes - and some people who seem to have been mutated or something by chemical compounds. One or two are openly nonhuman.

You push more money into research, quietly reroute some ideas to your lab and then declare them failures. Soon you've found ways to counter the most obvious risks. Things are going well. You even have a sweet bat-car, and pretty soon you'll get around to finish those bat-shaped wing designs. The police are co-operating, the mob is falling apart under your dual assault;soon you'll be able to start duplicating your success in other cities.

And then you catch a small-time crook. He's stealing what you realize, too late, was his competitor's biotech research, and he starts /mocking/ you. He knows just what to say, how to needle you. Bastard. You snap, push him off a girder into a vat of chemicals.

And everything goes to hell.

Turns out that if he wasn't a psychopath before, he is now. And now he's immune to poison, including your gas, and he's got /ideas/ for gadgets of his own. And he's moving into the power vacuum, with startling speed, gathering followers who know the only thing that beats a super/hero/ is a super/villain/.

And he's killing people, of course, whenever it would be amusing.

He's making up his plans on the spot, changing them whenever he gets bored or has a bright idea. You can't track his organization, because even they don't know what he's going to do next. Of course, he's killing them /too/, but since when have humans been rational? He pulls off a few high-profile crimes without a hitch.

He - well, he kidnaps Harvey. Mutilates him. Tortures him. By the time you track him down, your friend has been /broken/. Completely insane. You have to fight him hand-to-hand just to stop him hurting anyone. He goes to that new maximum-security asylum you funded.

More supervillains start moving in, and you're starting to realize that this just /the way things are/ now. "Supervillain" has become a viable job opening, a role ready and waiting for anyone who invents a freeze-ray and doesn't have too many moral qualms. This is rapidly becoming your full-time job, but who else is competent enough to /fight metahumans/ on their own terms, day after day?

Eventually you meet Superman, a few of the others, give them a few suggestions. You meet a teenager who remind you of yourself; give him a bit of a leg up into the vigilante business. He survives. You train a few others, hand-picked, but several of them die.

You start working with metahumans more and more; you make friends, allies. When you propose a "Justice League", a way to give structure and legitimacy to superheroes, you end up running /that/ as well. It works. But you still can't keep up. You can only keep fighting, and planning, and hope to hell that it's enough.

The moment an existential threat is beaten back, the Joker drives his psychiatrist crazy and escapes with her. Just when you track him down, an alien superintelligence tries to assimilate New York for data-collection purposes. Some of your enemies have /died/ and come back, more powerful and angry than before. Worse still, our best fighters are so powerful that they're attracting a new class of enemy to this tiny planet; you set up an /extradimensional prison/ using hypertech you barely understand, and /still they keep coming./

At some point, you stopped calling yourself "Bruce Wayne". You didn't really notice. You're the goddamned Batman, now.

And then Darkseid shows up ...

--------------

TL;DR: rational!Batman is the Worm-like story of continual escalation and seat-of-your-pants munchkinning.

Every time he starts to solve a problem - and he /does/, he's the smartest man alive and also a billionaire with social skills and the body of an athlete - it's only long enough for a momentary lull, before the universe slides another notch toward total annihilation.

[It's a comic, so we only see /possible/ end points - but generally, the whole "Justice League" thing works and super-villainy eventually calms down, I think.]
