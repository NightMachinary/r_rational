Even for the purpose of "Fighting Crime", batman is not very optimal - or, at least, not if any theory we have about the causes of crime is in any way correct.

Being busted by batman isn't going to convince the average criminal of the error of his ways because batman isn't an agent of the social order, he himself is in violation of it. Police, courts, and so on all have the aim of making justice impersonal - a Leviathan that cannot be fought or killed because it is more than the sum of it's parts. Batman is just a scary individual, so the response he produces is "If I had more firepower, he wouldn't be a problem".

This was unintentionally lampshaded by Gotham Sirens recently when Selene Kyle came up with the lie that "Batman" wasn't a person, it was a training regimen, a job and a uniform. Which... He'd be a lot more effective if that was both the case and known to be the case!

Uhm. Actual optimal policies? Well, for starters, find out what the fuck is in the water in gotham. Florid insanity rates that high make it pretty darn likely that there is an environmental toxin at work. Fix police corruption. Better psyc care.
