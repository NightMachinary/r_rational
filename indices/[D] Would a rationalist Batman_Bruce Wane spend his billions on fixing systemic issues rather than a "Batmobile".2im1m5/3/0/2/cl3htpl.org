Short of giving Batman serious psychological flaws (which would totally be in-character, because Batman), one way to make a super-villain-fighting lifestyle worthwhile is to make the villains rational, too. Or rather, effective.

A mere mass murderer who constantly gets caught? Surely a genius super-villain could do better than that. Let's try extinction level threats, like developing nano-technology or unfriendly AI. Or, if the villain as sense of self-preservation, mind-controlling key world leaders. Alternatively, they can just be so plain /good/ that only a genius detective on the level of Batman could have any serious chance of stopping them.
