Well, some of his toys that I think would be notable for being either specialized or expensive:

- Batmobile
- Batwing
- Thermite
- Bat-shaped armor
- Gas-propelled grappling gun (which leaves the hooks and possibly the lines everywhere)
- Magnetic explosives (he keeps sticking them to supervillains like Metallo)

As to a NotRich!Batman...well, sure. If you take away his money it becomes harder for him to be tracked. At the same time, that's not really the Batman of legend -- even Adam West had "stately Wayne Manor."
