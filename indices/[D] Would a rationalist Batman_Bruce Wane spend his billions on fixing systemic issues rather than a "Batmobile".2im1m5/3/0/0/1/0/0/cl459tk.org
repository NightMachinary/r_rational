  I do believe that you could write Batman so that the police are competent and trying to stop him, and he's simply better than them, but I haven't really seen it done.

That would be /really/ hard to believe. The process of busting Batman pretty much goes like this:

"Let's see...he only operates in Gotham, so he probably lives around here. He's male, white (because we can see the lower half of his face), he's about six feet tall, he's in wicked good shape and, oh yes! he must be /STUPIDLY WEALTHY/ or backed by someone who is. Hm. Who in Gotham fits those criteria?...Ooh, ooh, maybe BRUCE FRIGGIN' WAYNE???"

From there it's an exercise in getting a warrant, calling in the feds, or assassination depending on exactly how corrupt / smart / stupid you think the GCPD are.
