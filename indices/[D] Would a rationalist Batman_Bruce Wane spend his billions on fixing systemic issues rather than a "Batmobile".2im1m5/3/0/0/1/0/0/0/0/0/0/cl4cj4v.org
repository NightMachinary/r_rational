You might as well eliminate the Batmobile altogether. +Motorcycles+ Batbike is where it's at. Alot of his tools were only really useful in situations contrived to show them off, and continuing this kind of rationalization just turns him into a more classical ninja.

Edit: In fact he should use his wealth to concoct some sort of flu strain which will incapacitate the mob for a week or two without killing them, for a head start to mop up the city. The vast majority of problems Batman faces have cheap solutions (and as a genius, he can find even cheaper ones) and the insane wealth at his disposal could go a lot farther than a private Skunkworks.
