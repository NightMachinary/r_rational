I'm not saying that you /have/ to take away his money, I'm saying that it's possible for Batman to behave in such a way that he doesn't reveal his money to anyone, and that it's quite probable that a more realistic Batman would make an effort to do so, mostly so that his cover is much harder to pierce. He can have Wayne Manor and fully decked out Batcave, but present himself to the public (on those few occasions when he can be clearly seen) as nothing more than a vigilante with a cape, cowl, bullet-proof vest, and a few pieces of equipment that could have been manufactured on the cheap, in those rare instances where they can actually be recovered.

The /reader/ knows that Batman is absurdly rich, but even if the police are a lot smarter than they are in the comics, Batman could arrange things so that this isn't obvious to them. Hell, Batman could take money from the criminals he beats up to give him a plausible source of funds and further obfuscate his identity.
