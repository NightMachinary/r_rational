The depends on the incarnation of Batman. The only thing that I think really gives away his wealth is the Batmobile or Batwing, neither of which are essential to the character (and indeed, are wholly absent in some depictions of Batman). In fact, there are some incarnations of Batman that don't even have him as rich, and I think you can still have Batman without him having huge amounts of money - he just operates slightly differently. That leaves the police with very little to go on. They'd just be looking for a white male, and there are millions of those in Gotham. (Penniless Batman is basically Rorschach from Watchmen, and I think Rorschach's depiction there was intended as commentary on Batman. A similar Batman-alike without much funding is Big Daddy from Kick-Ass, but I'm not sure how realistic I would call him.)

Imagine a fanfic about the police of Gotham looking for Batman. They start not knowing much about him. He stays in the shadows, and interacts almost entirely with criminals, most of whom exaggerate the stories about him or just plain get things wrong. He doesn't leave evidence behind, aside from perhaps a batarang that lab analysis reveals could have come from any machine shop in the city, which in turn leads them down a half dozen dead ends. They monitor the hospitals looking for someone with injuries to come in, but never see anything. They chase Batman, but he's memorized the shortcuts and can traverse the rooftops faster than them - sometimes he uses the sewers. There's never any reason to think that his net worth is exceptional. They set up traps for him, but he never falls for them, or he manages to escape without leaving evidence behind. There are a huge number of rumors about him around the underworld and in the police station - he's really multiple people working together, he's got supernatural powers, etc.

I definitely think that you could make it work without too much trouble - it's just that most of the time, the writers don't try to hew to a sense of realism.
