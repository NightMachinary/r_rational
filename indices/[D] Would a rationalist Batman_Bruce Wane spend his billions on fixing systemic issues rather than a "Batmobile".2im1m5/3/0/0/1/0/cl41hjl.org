It really depends on which version of Batman we're talking about, but I definitely prefer those incarnations where he's working "with" the police, or at least has their public condemnation and private consent. Sometimes he's being actively pursued by the police, which makes the police appear far more incompetent since it's almost never a focus of the stories. I do believe that you could write Batman so that the police are competent and trying to stop him, and he's simply better than them, but I haven't really seen it done.
