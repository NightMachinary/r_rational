Perhaps if we focus on areas outside of Gotham:

You're Bruce Wayne, and you want to save the world. You're working on deciding which X-risk deserves your attention the most when Alfred tells you the news.

There's a god flying around.

A human with amazing powers. Superstrong, superfast, indestructibe- and therefore unstoppable. You immediatly drop all other research and turn to finding out a way to stop Superman if he turns evil. Or insane.

And then you hear about the godess. A real demigod this time, from Greek origins. Similarly unstoppable by human forces. You redouble your efforts, and start quietly funding some darker weapons projects.

Another appears. Alein life is confirmed. This one can read minds and turn invisible and pass through walls /and/ can shapeshift. Your job just expanded by several orders of magnitude. You erase all your notes and start /thinking/ in code.

More appear. A chemistry accident gives a man supersonic speed. Another is a benefactor of some other alein race, who give away supertechnology to random people who fit their blue-and-orange morality's idea of good.

Two men have just been given incredible power by luck. What happens when the same occurs to some neonazi or mental patient?

Your worst fears become confirmed. Superman was seen battling a upperdimensional being, who only left because Superman beat his childish game. Ares invaded part of Greece before Wonder Woman beat him back. Some monster claiming to be an ancient Wizard appears in Manhatten and levels a city block before being scared into disappearing.

You no longer can hope to kill or control them all by force- the problem is too big, and you don't know who can be trusted to help you, given that no-one else is openly tackling the problem. There could be dozens just like him secretly working on it while politly applauding the heroics in public, and you have no way of finding them. And one wrong word may mean a heat-vision death if any of *them* catch wind.

You devise a new strategy. You build a suit, and grab some of the weapons you funded. Jump on the streets of Gotham and beat up a few muggers. Tie up a mob boss. Eventually, you get a few superviallians of your own. And the others come by. You team up and fight, giving organization and direction to fights that would cream you if you fought alone. Slowly, you become friends with them.

And after a challange large enough, you suggest the idea of a permanent organization. Something official that humanity can look to in times of strife.

A league.

You're elected leader, of course: you've made sure you were both the voice of sanity and the leader in any previous team-up. You now have the control and trust of the most dangerous threats to Earth, and all the time you need to find a way to stop them if they ever stop being friendly.
