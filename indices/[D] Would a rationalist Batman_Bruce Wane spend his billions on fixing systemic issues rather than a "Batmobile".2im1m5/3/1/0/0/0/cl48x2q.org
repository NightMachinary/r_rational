There is a secondary issue of making himself a target. Actively working to reform an entirely corrupt government would be hard, starting from the bottom. He may be smarter or stronger than most, but a bullet will kill him just the same.

Also, it's a pretty herculean effort to replace an entire police force. If you do it gradually, you have a chance for the fresh faces to be corrupted, but if you do it all at once you have chaos during the transition.

Then there are still all of the corrupting outside influences - the mob, etc. willing to bribe the new officers the same as the last . . and kill those who won't . . .
