  Even in DC, how much would it cost to get one city's worth of corrupt cops and politicians replaced with Batman-approved straight shooters? Is there anyone running for any local office who can compete in dollar terms with Bruce Wayne?

It's not clear to me that this would work, though it somewhat depends on what time period we're talking about and how much access to information Batman actually has. "Buying" a seat is notoriously unreliable, and there have been a great many cases where a well-funded outsider has lost horribly to an established local. On top of that, you need to worry about the corrupting influence of the established structure, and whether the people you've identified as straight-shooters are actually straight-shooters. That's aside from the difficulty of protecting your ringers - there's a good chance that they'll wind of dead in a ditch somewhere.

I don't doubt that Bruce Wayne can out-spend any political candidate, or even the entire state legislature and city council of Gotham City. But I'm not entirely sure that this would have the desired result of replacing everyone and fixing the systemic failures.
