Haha exposition fairy. Haha moving up into hospitality. Haha puppy nibbles, the bane of cloth and leather everywhere.

Considering this chapter is almost entirely a lore dump i would probably just call it "the lore dump". But thats boring, so a more interesting title maybe like "astrophysics for dummies" or "plotting the way". That "dealing with devils" from rr was good too, although i feel like this may be a recurring theme from here on out, we've already had 2 chapters like that and im expecting at least five-ty more? Idk, looks like youre setting up for dungeon delving from here.
