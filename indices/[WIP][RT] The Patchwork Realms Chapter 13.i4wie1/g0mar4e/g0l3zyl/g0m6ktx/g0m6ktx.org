something referring to the transition toward a not-just-dungeon delve/adventure tropey story? This seems like a major shift in the plot; I had expected a long story of Athos' adventures in this world, but now it seems like Hellsport will be "home base" for what is effectively a game of Diablo. I'm not creative enough to turn that into a good 1-3 word title, but that's where my mind wants to go.
