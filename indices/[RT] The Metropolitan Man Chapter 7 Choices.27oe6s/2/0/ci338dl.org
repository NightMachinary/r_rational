He doesn't seem about to throw an asteroid at Earth. I see him as someone desperate to do good, to ease suffering where possible, but it's not the suffering that's hurting him. He's basically been witness to every death that's happened his entire life, so it seems to be evil and injustice that pisses him off.

If I were he, I would probably have at least gone through a phase of seeking out evildoers and ripping them apart. Maybe he already did, in his teenage years, or maybe that's what he's on the verge of at the moment.
