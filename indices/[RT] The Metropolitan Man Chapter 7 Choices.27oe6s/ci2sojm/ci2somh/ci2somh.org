  The *incorporation of the Bill of Rights* (or *incorporation* for short) is the process by which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States][American]] courts have applied portions of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights][U.S. Bill of Rights]] to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state][states]]. Prior to 1925, the Bill of Rights was held only to apply to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States][federal government]]. Under the *incorporation doctrine*, most provisions of the Bill of Rights now also apply to the state and local governments.

  Prior to the ratification of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution][Fourteenth Amendment]] and the development of the incorporation doctrine, the Supreme Court in 1833 held in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron_v._Baltimore][Barron v. Baltimore]]/ that the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal, but not any state governments. Even years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Cruikshank][United States v. Cruikshank]]/ (1876) still held that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution][First]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution][Second Amendment]] did not apply to state governments. However, beginning in the 1920s, a series of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States][United States Supreme Court]] decisions interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to "incorporate" most portions of the Bill of Rights, making these portions, for the first time, enforceable against the state governments.
