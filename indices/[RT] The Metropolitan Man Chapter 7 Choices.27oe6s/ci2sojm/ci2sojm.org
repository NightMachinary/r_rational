I'm really enjoying this story so far!

Not sure how much you care about historical accuracy, but there are a couple of anachronisms in this chapter you might want to fix if you do:\\
-The term 'genocide' wasn't coined until ~WWII.\\
-IRL, the 4th Amendment wasn't incorporated until the Warren court in the 60s (see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights][Wikipedia]]--the opening of the article, which refers to incorporation starting in the 20s, is a little misleading, because the 1920s stuff was mostly the 1st amendment).\\
-I'm assuming the use of 'existential risk' was an intentional anachronism... ;)

For the first issue, looks like it's better to use the term 'crimes against humanity,' which was used before WWI. ('Ethnic cleansing', like 'genocide,' dates from the 40s.) The second issue seems more serious, and you might be better off just not mentioning incorporation at all rather than attempting to lampshade.
