It's somewhat influenced by Worm, in that I've read Worm and I don't think you can read through thirty novels worth of material and then write in the same genre a few months later and not be influenced. But there's not a conscious attempt there.

In terms of the biggest influences, [[http://www.amazon.com/Its-Superman-Tom-De-Haven/dp/0811844358][It's Superman!]] is a novel I read nearly a decade ago that really stuck with me - it features a more "real" take on Superman (a realness that kind of falls apart towards the end, in my opinion) and is absolutely soaked in Depression-era atmosphere - a real character study of Superman. As soon as I'm done with this, I'll probably go back and read it again, but I'm trying to keep a purity of vision as much as I can and worry I'd start subconsciously mimicking.

There are also two depictions of Superman and Lex Luthor that I really liked, which are [[http://www.amazon.com/Luthor-Brian-Azzarello/dp/1401229301][Lex Luthor: Man of Steel]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Red-Son-Mark-Millar/dp/1401201911/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402448437&sr=1-3&keywords=lex+luthor+man+of+steel][Superman: Red Son]], both of which I think do a good job of depicting Lex Luthor's mindset and the terrifyingness of Superman (and both of which are standalone). The former does a good job of showing the world through Luthor's eyes, while the later features a Soviet Superman who is in direct values conflict with Lex.

I guess I think of Scion as more enigmatic, and even when you learn more about him, he still remains more or less that way. Whereas with Superman, he's essentially human - you might disagree with him, but you can still understand how a person might make those decisions. So while there's probably some influence, I see them as very different people.

Edit: Also, Scion was at least partly inspired by Superman in the first place, so there's that.
