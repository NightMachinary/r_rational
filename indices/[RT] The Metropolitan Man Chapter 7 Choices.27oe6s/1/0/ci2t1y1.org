I'm doing my best to keep historically accurate, but trying not to sweat it too much - after all, history is divergent before Superman even shows up, because it's Metropolis and Gotham City instead of New York and Chicago. (Most of the time in the DC universe those cities exist alongside New York City and Chicago, which makes even less sense).

"Existential risk" is intentional, and I'm fine with that. "Genocide" I will change over to "crimes against humanity".

Incorporation is a bit trickier. The 4th wasn't incorporated until later, but I guess my idea is that one of those two cases would be the one that incorporates (in part or in whole) the 4th Amendment, which is what is meant by "The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution has been incorporated against the states, which many see as a worrying expansion of federal power." - it's meant to say "this just now happened, and a lot of people are displeased by this because of differing opinions on the nature of the 14th Amendment". But maybe it should just be removed. It might be one of those things that is better in my head than on the page.
