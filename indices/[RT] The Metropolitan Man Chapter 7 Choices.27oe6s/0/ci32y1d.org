This is awesome :) I'm no Superman nerd but, while everyone complains that he's boring because he's invincible, I've always found him intriguing because of the question "what would it be like to be invulnerable, that powerful, and all-seeing, and want to do good?" So the scene with Superman wrestling with that dilemma was super awesome.

You're doing a really good job of realistically portraying a benevolent alien trying to do good, alone, without being a dictator. I can't imagine what it must be like to know, to really /know/, the suffering that goes on day to day.

I bet he'd have the biggest, most brightest, patronus :P
