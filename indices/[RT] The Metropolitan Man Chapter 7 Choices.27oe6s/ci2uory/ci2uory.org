Another good chapter. Superman seems to be becoming unstable pretty quickly and Lex doesn't have enough information to actually hurt him yet. If Superman's rampage is confined to only criminals and people he judges to be bad then Lex might still have some time. But if Superman decides to throw an asteroid at Earth or something then they're all dead.

"early portion of the trail" should be "trial." "attempts by put" should be "attempts to put". "So call if" should be "so call it"
