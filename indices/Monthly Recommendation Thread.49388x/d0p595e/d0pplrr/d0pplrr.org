I was JUST about to post it here! I thoroughly agree in it's recommendation. It has over 1,000 updates so far and I'm currently making an pdf version of the comic. I only finished chapter 1 and 2 so far out of the 14 chapters though.

It starts out as an average woman involved in weird circumstances and she gets smarter about how to deal with things throughout the story. She reminds me a bit of Taylor Hebert, only less cynical and is slowly learning to munchkin time travel instead of bugs. In addition, it's not too much of a spoiler after the second chapter, but [[#s][the time travel is]]
