Ugh so having just read up to the 8th chapter and I finally figured out I'm supposed to already have read the 'retcon'-spoilers from chapter... 3?

Urgh. I guess I should really read authors notes, I completely missed the point of those. And apparently some of them were simple replacements of original pages. G'ah.

(how are you going to handle the retcons in book format? I guess you could put them in after the scene in the past ends..)

Still, the story's really captivating.
