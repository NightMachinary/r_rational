I already did. Here's the [[https://www.mediafire.com/folder/52ysreiddfthx/All_Night_Laundry][MediaFire link]] for the first two chapters.

Don't worry about missing too much from the author's notes. The most important story-relevant information you might have missed were some fanart and when to read the retcons (which is usually whenever Bina returns to the present from her time travels).

I handle the retcon pages by using hyperlinks. They allow me to put links at the end of each post so you can skip over the retcon posts when reading the original timeline posts and vice versa. I even have a link in later posts to bring you to the first retcon post when a retcon occurs and the very last retcon post has a link to bring you right back to the post you were just reading before going to the retcons. Best of all, the hyperlinks works in doc /and/ pdf files.

I'm currently just finished editing the retcon section in the third chapter and it looks really well done. jack-fractal will notify the readers whenever I have a new chapter ready for downloading and the next one should be ready in a few days.

EDIT: MediaFire's not playing nice with me right now in letting me share a folder. Give me a moment.

EDIT 2: Problem solved!
