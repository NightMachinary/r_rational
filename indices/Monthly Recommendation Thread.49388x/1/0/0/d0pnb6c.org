I can't find it, but there's one where Dumbledore tries to... Dumbledore Harry into a time loop for 20 years, but it ends up being Ron instead. The loop resets every time he goes to sleep, so Ron sleeps for 5 more minutes for 20 years.

If you're ever wondering if things could be worse, you could be Ron.
