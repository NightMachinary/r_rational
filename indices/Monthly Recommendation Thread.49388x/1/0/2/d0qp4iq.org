I think you missed the point of the story. The loop isn't 'wasted' on him; the loop is torture that takes away all meaning from his life.

The only way mistake I see Harry making is not seeking novelty once Voldemort is dead. (before Voldemort is dead he did try seeking novelty, but it ends up killing him) Disappear after completing the necessary storyline, move to a different random city every time, and you can possibly have a tolerable life.

I suppose he'd get there eventually, now that he knows the script for the first seven years.
