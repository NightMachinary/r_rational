Things that I enjoyed in February:

- Change Storms: Induction (well known for [[/r/rational]])
- [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704307-saga-volume-1][Saga]], a graphic novel. I read the vols 1 to 5: consistent story and art. Vol 1 won an Hugo award.
- Fate / Stay Night [Unlimited blade works]. Anime incarnation of this visual novel.
