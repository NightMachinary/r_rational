While the setting is not explicitly rational (the magic, in particular is very vague, like Lord of the Rings), the plot and character interactions are smart and consistent. It's an incredibly good anime, with vivid animation and thoughtful writing; I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime, no matter the genre.
