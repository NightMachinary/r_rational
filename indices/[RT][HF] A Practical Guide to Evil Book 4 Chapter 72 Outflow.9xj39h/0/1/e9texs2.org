So I will play Akua's advocate here. Cat interrogates her under a truth compulsion (probably almost) every night about her plans. She doesn't have any non-immediate-survival-schemes running that Cat can find and she seems to be thorough. What if Akua is legitimately becoming a better person by virtue of being in winterland detox for villains who can't evil good and want to do other things good too? What if we're seeing the real Akua?

I think we are and that's going to make the decision at the end all the more heartbreaking. Cat doesn't believe in redemption. Akua can never take back the crimes she's committed. But that doesn't mean she will be the same Villain we knew at Second Liesse.
