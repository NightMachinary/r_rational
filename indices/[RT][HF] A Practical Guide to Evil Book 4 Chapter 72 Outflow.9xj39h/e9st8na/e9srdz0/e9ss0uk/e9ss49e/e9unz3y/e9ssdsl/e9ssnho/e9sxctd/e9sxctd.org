Um, Akua needed the Gestalt and lots of preparation and a special place etc to pull off the Greater Breach, yes.

BUT...she has actually pretty good access to the WINTER MANTLE right now, so she has her energy source covered.

She has had practice to use her diabolism training on fae stuff, both at the battle of the camps where she temporarily wielded it, and as assistant ever since.

She also has been the recipient of the "fae influence" that Cat has shunted off, and so - for all her training in principle alienation to lessen the thought-warping properties of fae power - is fundamentally more "aligned" to the WINTER power...in essence, she isn't quite insane fae royalty, but more insane than Cat is.

This translates to more power/efficiency when wielding the Winter Mantle.

Finally, she has the proper sorcerous skill/background to actually wield it - she has often been compared to Masego in her skill with Magic, and this puts her in a very high weight class.
