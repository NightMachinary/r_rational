I've been watching Akua insinuate herself into the role of Cat's indispensable lieutenant--growing her roots, making herself pleasant and useful, making it harder for Cat to hate her, making it harder for Cat to want her dead. I've been watching that and chewing on my metaphorical lip, worrying about the eventual traitorous consequences. Thinking "Watch out, Cat! You know what she's doing, so don't let her!"

It was while reading this chapter that I realized that Akua has pulled the same trick on /me./ By the time Cat finally defeated her in Liesse, I was utterly sick of Akua's shit and all I wanted was for her to be gone forever. But in her undeath, she just kept being an interesting character and having compelling dialogue and serving a valuable purpose in the narrative. And now, even though I know she's an irredeemable monster, and even though I know that her singular goal right now is to cultivate this exact feeling, I enjoy her screentime and no longer want her to properly die. God damn it.
