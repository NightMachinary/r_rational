Hmmm...

Akua now depends on Cat for survival, and cannot hide her intent. Therefore she has no other venue than actually behaving, and learning actual loyalty and actually aligning her preferences to Cat's. Since she has only worse options she commits herself to it genuinely.

That is why readers start « redeeming » Akua: because that is actually what is happening. Cat is (forced by circumstances into) playing a redemption arc against Akua, and winning. Thus I predict Akua will die to save Cat, and only realise why she's doing it when it's too late or when she's far too committed to it.
