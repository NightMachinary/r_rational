The problem is, so much of Praesi traditions are self defeating and ultimately just smoke in the wind. Remember what Cat thought when she fought Akua the last time,

#+begin_quote
  The urge to tell me what that trap in the stairs had been, to expound on her own cleverness. I'd been struck with it a few times as well, that need to tell your opponent exactly how you'd screwed them over, but it was different in her. More intense, and not just because she ran deeper to the source of villainy than I did. It occurred to me, in that moment, how lonely a person Akua must really be. Unable to trust anyone, to do so much as offer a genuine laugh. It was no way to live. The highborn of the Wasteland were inhuman as much because of their history as because they denied themselves the basic trappings of humanity. If all you were was artifice, what was there left?

I wouldn't be surprised if the whole "Akua and diabolist are two different people" thing fell apart at the mildest prodding by Cat at her soul.
