I think it is more likely to be a trigger word. I hope it just relaxes some limitations ubua has, but I'm worried it gives her control over cat again.

It would make sense in this situation, cat knows exactly how much better ubua was with her mantle, and spent a chunk of this chapter highlighting she wasn't fighting in the right level. But thief isn't here to fix things if ubua doesn't want to give it back.

Cat did say she hasn't been wasting her time though. Since there is no good way to get better at fighting in a few days, maybe that prep was adding backdoors in her soul to regain control?
