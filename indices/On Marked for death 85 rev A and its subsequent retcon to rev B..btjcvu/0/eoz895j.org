It's always interesting hearing readers' reactions to things, especially the more dramatic things.

Here's what this looked like from our perspective; first, the rules that players and QMs had agreed to were that:

1. [EDIT: At the time,] Hazō was a complete avatar of the players' will with no agency of his own. [EDIT: After this incident we and the players agreed that he would become a real character with agency who would usually obey the players.]
2. We were solidly simulationist and willing to let him die if that was the simulationist answer.

We had been very clear that when the quest started we were expecting Hazō to die within a few real-life months. The quest would (we thought) consist of exploring different parts of the world through the eyes of different characters, each instance building the players' knowledgebase about the world and thereby allowing them to make better decisions until eventually they managed a successful playthrough. We were astounded when (albeit with some luck on the dice), the players kept surviving. Still, they were one mistake or bad dice roll away from death, and everyone knew it.

Then we get to the youthsuit. To put things in perspective, imagine a group of known Commie spies who betrayed their own people but have not been accepted by America, and they're being escorted around Washington DC during the height of the Cold War. Suddenly one of them completely breaks character and starts behaving in bizarre ways that align closely with a famous American agent who is well known for being utterly insane and annoying, but is tolerated due to his phenomenal skills.

In the real world, what happens in that scenario? Answer: He and his team are immediately hauled in for interrogation, which is what we did.

Could we have decided that, well, it was completely unrealistic for American agents to ignore bizarre behavior on the part of their traitorous escortees, but we didn't want to ruin everyone's fun so we would be nice and forgiving and have the world run on irrational story logic? Sure, but that wasn't the deal.

With that disposed of, the question becomes: Did the players vote for Hazō to break character and start behaving like Gai? At this point it's down to interpretation. If you think "Buy a YOUTHSUIT!" in bold, radioactive-green letters is not a vote for acting like Gai, then I suppose you are justified in your belief that the players made no mistake.

Personally, I think the players should have just accepted their mistake and gone forward. It would have made for some great role play, and it was hardly a character-lethal event. Later on they insulted their handler, Jiraiya of the Sannin, and threatened a Leaf doctor in front of a bunch of ANBU (special forces soldiers). THAT could have been a character-lethal event. Still, they talked their way out of it and things ended up better than before.
