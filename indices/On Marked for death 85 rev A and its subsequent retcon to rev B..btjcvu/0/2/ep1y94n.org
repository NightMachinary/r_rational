I think you're at a big disadvantage as QMs because you're running something different from literally every forum quest anyone's done before - even quests that are notoriously "brutal" are brutal in a fashion that makes cohesive narrative sense. Whereas that narrative rise & fall doesn't really happen in something as ruthlessly simulationist as what you're going for. This is a common thing throughout the whole quest - not just the YOUTHSUIT incident. Even as early as the first couple of chapters.

In a /normal/ story the Village Hidden in the Swamp would have worked out. Like a TV show. It's inevitable demise and inherent instability would have manifested themselves in a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil][Sorting Algorithm of Evil]] kind of way, where the protagonists were just /barely/ competent enough to survive each time. You see a lot of moments like that, looking back through the story - moments where the team /fails/ a mission and runs, or bails on a location that, in an ordinary story, would have been home-base for the entire time. The YOUTHSUIT is just an extension of this mindset. The naive quest-goer thinks that, /hey/, we just got done with a very tense action-oriented story arc, it's filler time. /We're even in the village from canon, which finally puts us on canon rails./ Filler time means doing silly meme stuff. But in your world, story arcs don't actually exist, there is no such thing as canon or meta-knowledge, and silly meme stuff is as fucking bananas as it would be in real life.

I'm used to [[/r/rational]], so, that's not my biggest gripe with your story. (/My/ biggest issue was worldbuilding: I think Naruto's schizo-tech is cool and don't like the feudal Japan aesthetic as much.) But if I had never read a single rational story, and also happened to be dumb enough to not notice when the QMs were getting annoyed, I totally would have voted for the meme answer, because what else are we going to do? Add to that the times that the meme answer just happened to work out beforehand, and you have a recipe for everyone in the thread simultaneously blundering into an interrogation cell.

The Kabuto incident I don't even want to think about. That one was /more/ frustrating as someone catching up to the story, because I couldn't voice my two cents. Still, it's a casualty of the same mindset. "We're in Konoha, these are the kind people from the anime, they'll understand that we're just asking as concerned citizens." If you're approaching it from that perspective, the hammer of /common sense/ looks a lot like punishment, even if it's the sanest outcome of the literal actions that the voters chose to take. And I feel like you guys understand that on some level - every time Hazou does something sketchy, you have the rest of the party step in and tell him exactly how fucking stupid that idea actually is.
