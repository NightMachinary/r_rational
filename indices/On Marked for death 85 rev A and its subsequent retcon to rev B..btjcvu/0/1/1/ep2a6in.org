You're right, we're not going to prevent it. That's not our job. Our job is to provide the most realistic version of this world that we can, in the process of writing the best story that we can. If people can't understand that, or don't want to play the game we're offering, that's totally fine. They are free to take their marbles and politely go home.

Whose job is it to prevent those votes? The players'. At this point, everyone knows what we're offering. No one can pass joke votes on their own, they need to convince a majority of the voters. All the players need to do is vote for something else while politely explaining to the newbies what to expect.

And, before you ask: If a group of trolls passed a harmful vote, we would ignore it. The youthsuit thing was voted in by regulars.
