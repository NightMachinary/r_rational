As someone who isn't a QM but who did participate in the quest previously (along with occasionally still lurking) - I think you're wildly overstating what a "reasonable" interpretation of the plan was.

Purely from context clues around discussion, one thing to note is that this plan actually represented, among other things, a massive character break, from the perspective of the plans generally put forth by the players. Most of the plans were long, detailed, covering many different conditions and contingencies, and generally being pretty strategic in general. This plan, on the other hand, had exactly no details, was well known in-thread for being a meme-vote, and was actively formatted in a manner that in no way conveyed "calmly go to the market and hand over money for clothing". That is, of course, one interpretation, but it's far from the most likely interpretation, and assuming malice on the part of the QMs violates the entire concept of the quest.
