I fail to see how off topic omake is in any way relevant. Plans follow a specific format and are significantly shorter than a chapter (In fact they're usually sentence fragments for each step).

That's not the vote format. That's not a vote it's discussion. And yes, wearing a youthsuit is awful spandex kid by definition.

Now you're just grasping at straws. It doesn't actually show anything of the sort.

Wow ok, if the previous was grasping at straws, this is an ineffectual pinkie twitch in the presence of a barn. So op didn't expect their proposal to win and therefore the only reasonable expectation is that the QMs will have the character follow a different plan in the first half of the chapter, go completely berserk in the presence of the actual plan objective, and in general just make a nuisance of himself with no actual plan in mind, until he gets arrested. Oh, and it turns out that the punishment for wanting spandex underwear is worse than assaulting a high ranking government official and threatening them and another medic/soldier with bodily harm? Right.
