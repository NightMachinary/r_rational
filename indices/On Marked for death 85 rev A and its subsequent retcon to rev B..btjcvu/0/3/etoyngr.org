"Haz≈ç was a complete avatar of the players'will with no agency of his own."

Wait what? From what I've read, it seems more like Hazo is his own person. With the thread mind controlling him occasionally to carry out their will, except with enough skill that he mistakenly believes his actions are his own. Because Hazo has done a bunch of stuff that I don't think the thread would have wanted him to do.
