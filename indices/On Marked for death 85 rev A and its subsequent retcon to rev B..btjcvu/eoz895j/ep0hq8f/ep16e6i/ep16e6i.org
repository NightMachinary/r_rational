You are not going to prevent someone occasionally putting in a silly vote that violated expectation and rule of the quest no matter how clear you make your expectation known. The only thing you're going to get is a negative reaction. This is like having multiple signs to warn people of the bridge clearance and then wondering why people keep crashing into said bridge. The solution is to raise the bridge or make a modification such that trucks will stop crashing into said bridge, either increasing bridge clearance or force vehicles to not use enter underneath the bridge.

Other QMs would had set aside joke votes and went for the winning serious plan. At least this way, even if this resulted in a negative reaction, it's much more likely not to blow into your face.
