From my understanding the plan wasn't "have Hanzo break character and go crazy" it was "Buy a youthsuit" (in those exact words even). How you got from that plan to what you wrote is where the extreme punitive (I'm not touching you, yes you are / we're not punishing them, yes you are) bit comes in.

Any reasonable interpretation would have Hazo remember that Akane has mentioned Rock Lee and Gai wearing a uniform that represents their style, and asking to go buy a matching set for him and her because it's a very thoughtful (or "youthful") gift that ties into her interests and what she considers important. If it's an obscure suit (rather than being a purchase available on every corner that gets you put on a watchlist,um what?) that plan alone could have taken all day, or at least a chapter.

Story wise it would have been cool to meet some of the things Kagome is so paranoid about. The fact that you guys took a 'hostile misinterpretation' approach to a plan you didn't originally prepare for might have even been ok though that's something better established in chapter 1 if that's what you want to do.

The fact that you blamed (are apparently still blaming) the players for the outcome of your hostile misinterpretation (or malicious compliance if I'm being charitable) is not ok.
