Tell me again how "massive personality break" is not a predictable result from proposed plans?

This explicitly shows that "could the players who voted for this plan have predicted Haz≈ç's behavior?" is clearly not even remotely close to the correct framing, given that it was voted for to intentionally see /what/ would happen. There was no violation of expectations, because there /were/ no expectations.

This is from one of the original "plan" authors, before the update was written. Clearly, expecting the result to be "calmly go shopping" was not what was happening here.

Claiming that they were acting in bad faith is less of a factual claim, and more sounds like you just didn't like the way the story went.
