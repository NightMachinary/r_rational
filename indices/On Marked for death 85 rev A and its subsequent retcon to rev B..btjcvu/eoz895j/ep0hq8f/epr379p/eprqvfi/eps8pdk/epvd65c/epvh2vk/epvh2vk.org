Out of curiosity, did you read the discussion that happened between chapters when that one got written, and the previous?

If not, it's fairly enlightening; I hadn't remembered reading most of it myself until this topic came up, as I mostly remembered there being a large reaction at the time, but none of the details. Upon rereading the discussion immediately before and after the vote, what was most notable to me was, in fact, that a notable portion of the thread regulars (including at least one or two of the people who voted for the plan) expected almost exactly what did happen in the chapter posted to happen.

Regardless, this is a decision that happened over two years ago, so it's long past any reasonable time to actually debate over the details you're talking about, but I did want to respond as someone who isn't one of the QMs with my own perspective. Feel free to continue to disagree if you want, but I wanted to have a second opinion represented in the comments here.
