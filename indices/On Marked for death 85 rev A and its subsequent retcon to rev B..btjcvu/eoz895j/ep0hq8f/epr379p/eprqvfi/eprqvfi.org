The standard I'm using is "could the players who voted have reasonably predicted Hazo's resulting behavior up to the first time an NPC did something surprising?". And the answer in this case is no. There are no assumptions involved here. From the first actions he takes he's going off script and it gets worse from there. Using metanarrative excuses after the fact doesn't change that the QMs acted in bad faith (and based on their comments, did so because they disagreed with the metanarrative aspects of the vote).
