It's not the silly vote, but the hostile misinterpretation of the agreed upon plan.

The plan was "buy a youthsuit." Every vote used those exact 3 words.

The execution was "proceed as though one of the other plans had won, then give the main character a mental breakdown resulting in attempts of violence against much more powerful and hostile antagonists on their home turf."

If the QMs aren't going to act in good faith with how votes are treated, just because they imagined some silliness to the concept, what's even the point?
