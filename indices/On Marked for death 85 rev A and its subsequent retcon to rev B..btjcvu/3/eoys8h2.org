Yeah, I quit reading the series over that honestly. The sheer lack of regard (and outright hostility) it displayed for the players was staggering to the point where I couldn't continue.

My annoyance was compounded by the fact that after they retconned it back they asked for a bloody apology because they felt hurt by the temerity of the players /daring/ to be upset at the poor defensless QM's for deciding to throw away everything the players had done because of a single joke vote.

I do agree however that exploring that path would be super interesting, and it would totally be a great story worth pursuing if they were to get there in a way that wasn't them basically pissing all over the players.
