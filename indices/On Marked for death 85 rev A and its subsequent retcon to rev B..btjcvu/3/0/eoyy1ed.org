  My annoyance was compounded by the fact that after they retconned it back they asked for a bloody apology because they felt hurt by the temerity of the players daring to be upset at the poor defensless QM's for deciding to throw away everything the players had done because of a single joke vote.

I'll bite. First of all, the QMs complaint wasn't ever that people were upset. It was that some decided to channel that in rude and plainly hurtful ways. I think asking for an apology for that makes a lot of sense.

As to the second part - well, they were throwing everything they had done too! The quest is hardly only the players' accomplishment. A joke vote winning could just as well be looked at as the players deciding to throw away everything that the QMs have done. (Or a coordination problem, which is why the chapter was eventually retconned, and QMs and players agreed on a set of new rules that give Hazo-the-character a bit more non-player-driven agency)
