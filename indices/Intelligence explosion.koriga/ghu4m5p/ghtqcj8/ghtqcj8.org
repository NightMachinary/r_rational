This is like the uncanny valley of this argument for me. If this was an ingroup production I'd be more irked by the wrong parts, but as an outgroup production, well, they've got the framing right, and certainly it's better than â€˜the real risk of artificial intelligence is that it's too dumb'.

Purely judging as a skit, it felt a bit awkward, having the AI be an incredibly stereotyped human speaking a bit robotically, and the conversations not really feeling like people talking as much as just signposting what position they represented.
