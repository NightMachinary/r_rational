I'm actually kinda worried about him. I don't know if this is what happened, but given that it was a 'bible camp', the story I'm jumping to in my head is that he (a minor, I'm assuming, given that he was sent to a bible camp) was an atheist, which his parents discovered and sent him to a VERY heavy duty religious camp, where he would be all but brainwashed. Either they succeeded, or (and I hope for his sake that if the version of events I'm imagining is true, that this is what happened) he pretended to have been successfully brainwashed in order to ease the pressure on him and hopeful escape unindoctrinated.

This is just the idea of what happened that's running around in my head, and while it seems plausible, we really don't have enough evidence to conclude any of what I said. It's just a possibility I'm worried about is all.
