Note if [[https://www.reddit.com/u/Gelifyal][/u/Gelifyal]] has any issue with me distributing offline copies, I will immediately delete this comment. Also, [[https://www.reddit.com/u/Gelifyal][/u/Gelifyal]] if you aren't going to be continuing this story anymore, is there any chance of you posting your world-building and plot-line notes? I would love to know what you had planned.

Good luck with whatever you choose to do with your life. I hope your choices turn out well for you.
