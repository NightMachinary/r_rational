Were ownership merely a description of what the law says, and were the law to say that ideas can be owned, I would agree with you. Instead, I disagree on both counts. First, I would argue that ownership is a statement of moral rights that law is instituted to protect. The law follows from the ownership, not the ownership from the law. Second, the law does not give ownership over ideas, merely a temporary monopoly over some expressions of those ideas. Copyrights and patents are there to reward and incentivize creators in exchange for releasing their writing and inventions to the public, not to give perpetual control over an idea to the first person to express it.
