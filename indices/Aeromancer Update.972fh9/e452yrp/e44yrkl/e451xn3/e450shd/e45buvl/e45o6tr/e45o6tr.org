I don't care if he does have a problem with distributing offline copies; if he's just gonna abandon the work, I don't care what he wants. I don't really support intellectual property anyway. If he had a good reason, maybe, but if it's something like believing that his previous work was sinful and would be corrupting minds, then I have no problem with going against the person he was turned into's wishes. It's probably what the pre-brainwashing version of him would have wanted anyway.

So even if you take these down, I'll post them back up. I don't mean that in a rude or hostile way (towards you at least, somewhat hostile towards whoever brainwashed him though), though I understand it sounds like it.
