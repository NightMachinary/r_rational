It doesn't make sense. I'm assuming a hack. I'll concede that I was wrong in a week if it hasn't been changed.

The plausibility of the update is interesting to contemplate, though. Whether true or not, it's true that we don't know much about the author or other people online.

Edit: Looks like it was true, and I was wrong. Didn't even take a week!
