That would be /ad hominem/

This story didn't focus on the rationality of theology/philosophy, it started out with a fantastic premise and tried to have it's characters' interaction with the world be mostly rational.

I don't think it was /rationalist/ by the sidebar definition, but it was more rational than traditional fantasy.
