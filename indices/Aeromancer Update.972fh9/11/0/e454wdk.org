If it is indeed a hack, it appears [[/u/Gelifyal]]'s Royalroad, Patreon and Fictionpress accounts are compromised, but their Reddit account is intact, since this is the only medium in which they didn't actively communicate the serial's end. That's a relatively severe hack, but far from unthinkable if they were sloppy with password reuse.

On the other hand, I would expect at least one of these sites, Patreon in particular, to have slightly better secondary security measures in place. I'm also surprised that a malicious actor would take down the Patreon and post updates everywhere but leave the story itself up. It's a strangely halfway measure.
