It was hinted several times that the story might be dropped.

Author mentioned earlier that

-his weekends are dedicated to other activities (presumably more important then the story)

-story was designed with multiple drop points

-something else I dont remember

Specified reason might be a joke, but the drop is entirely possible.

A pity, since the story was very promising, on par with MoL.
