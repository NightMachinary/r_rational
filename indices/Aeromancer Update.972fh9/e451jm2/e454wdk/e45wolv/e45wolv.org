  It's a strangely halfway measure.

That's true. It's also halfway in the sense that the author didn't post to the reddit about their decision. They were quite active here, so I would have expected something--unless the hacker didn't want to go to the trouble.

Then again, it's plausible the author didn't want to face arguments against the decision from the rational reddit.
