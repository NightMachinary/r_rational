If this turns out to not be a joke, I truly wish the author the best of luck and happiness. Its not that uncommon that one will need to stop something he likes and enjoyes to better the rest of his/her life (think about stopping gaming or other hobbys while studying or starting a new job etc.. or because of getting kids/married). I think Aeromancer had the potential to end up as a mayor success not only as a rational story or online novel but even as a published and finished book. But actually the current plot point is absolutly enough to end it as is, as a short story. Seti succeded in joining the world of mancers and even to attend Prestige so all his dreams and wishes got fullfilled and the rest lies in the future.

All I would then hope for would be for the author to publish his work on worldbuilding etc ... as i would be truly interested in those kind of materials and also to see where the story could have been going.

Also the END Authors Message at the end of chapter 14 on fictionpress got eddited and now includes the same message. So it seems to be real.
