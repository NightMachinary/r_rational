Huh, I think that would work... at destroying 3125... only for major aspects of humanity to be destroyed by the Cicada god in cannibalistic rituals. Or maybe it only adoptees cannibalism as a motif to lash out at Christians and it would develop some other horrible motif in the process of destroying 3125.

I wonder how those-that-must-not-be-spoken-of-with-unique-nouns, (unnumbered between 3998 and 4002) would interact with the 3125. 3125 has used noun and word based memetics, so the fae-forest-path-creatures might have a chance but humanity would be destroyed in the aftermath.

The anafabula has a good chance, 3125 seems to use enough pataphysical logic to be vulnerable to anti-narrative, but the world, or at least all narratives about it, might be destroyed in the process.

Huh you know I think competitive eschatology needs a reboot with the newer SCPs involved.
