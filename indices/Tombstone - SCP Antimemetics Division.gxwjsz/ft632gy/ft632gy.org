The Antimemetics Division tales are great. SCP-3125, the main antagonist, is such a formidable foe. He is a living idea that knows when he is perceived thanks to his infohazardous nature, can completely infiltrate the minds of anyone who slightly perceives him thanks to his memetic nature, and can censor any written information about himself thanks to his antimemetic nature.

Personally, I would have used the Cicada God SCP-3004 to defeat him. Since Fifthists vaguely worship an aspect of 3125 that they refer to as The Cosmic Starfish, this technically makes 3125 a religious idea. 3004 is a Pistiphage, a faith-eating entity that is snacking on Christianity. Theoretically, if a person were to astral project themselves to 3004's astral plane from inside 3125's inverted containment chamber, 3004 would eat 3125 along with the person's other religious ideas.
