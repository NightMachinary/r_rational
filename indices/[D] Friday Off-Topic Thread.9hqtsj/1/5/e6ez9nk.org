The story is very good at springing these 0-100 moments on you, with my personal favourite of course involving a certain cannibal.

One underrated scene that gave me more of a 'creeping' chill was during the Fallatehr arc when Amaryllis is driving Joon on the bike, pulls up in front of Fallatehr out in the open, begins trying to (ostensibly) play peacemaker between the two and you can feel Joon's rising horror as he tries to figure out wtf has happened to Amaryllis since he's been gone
