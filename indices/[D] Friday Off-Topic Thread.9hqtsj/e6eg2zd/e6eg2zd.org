[Warning: shameless self promotion ahead]

I've been wanting to get back into writing for a while, and after hours of playing CK2, reading historical manga, and an abortive attempt to watch the lucario movie, I've started writing a Pokemon feudalism quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/an-age-of-stone-and-clay-pokemon-feudalism.50263/][here]]. It follows PMD rules in that humans aren't around, but otherwise the worldbuilding is entirely my own.

I'd love to see any constructive criticism/new voters, either here or in the thread.
