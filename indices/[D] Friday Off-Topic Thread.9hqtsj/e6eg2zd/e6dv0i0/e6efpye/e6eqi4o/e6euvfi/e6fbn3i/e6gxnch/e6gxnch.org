You're using the spoiler tags that only work on old reddit. The tags as shown in the sidebar work for both. If you go to the [[https://new.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9hqtsj/d_friday_offtopic_thread/][new.reddit]] version of this page, you can see that they're not working.

(Spoiler tags were implemented via CSS hackery, which isn't available on new.reddit, which is why we haven't made the old tags backwards compatible - we can't.)
