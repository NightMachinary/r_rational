The difference for me is that your spoiler tag (in markdown) has the slashes like this: \ instead of this: /

On my screen, everything /else/ that people 'spoilered out is spoilered out.' Your quotation shows up as:

[spoilers for 120](#s " "Can we talk about the market forces thing for a bit?” asked Arthur. “Because I think that bears some digging into, especially if we're digging into moral statements.” “Moral statements!” said Fenn as she slipped into the booth next to me. “My favorite!” ") instead of: /[[#s][spoilers for 120/]]
