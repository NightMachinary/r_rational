This is part of why I love the /Young Wizards/ series - it's full of these, in part because that universe is fundamentally different to our own. (Eg: benevolent Powers and a good afterlife are provably known to exist)

Most wizards are transhuman - unaided interstellar FTL qualifies, without considering other and more impressive tricks - and the Powers that Be are either posthuman or nonhuman, and with a notable exception good (but /not/ safe).
