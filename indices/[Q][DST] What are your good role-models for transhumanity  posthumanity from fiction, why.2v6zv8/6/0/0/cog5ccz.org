I found the series painful to start rather then to finish. That first book sure took its time getting to the interesting parts.

Though its kind of funny, i got the 3rd book when i was 13 or something, and didn't even know there were other books so i read the series in the 3-4-1-2 order. Might cause my impression of it to be non-standard :P
