I kind of liked the approach taken by the non "christian" group of people in Dan Simmons's 'Hyperion Cantos' series.

Though I do think the specific way it was shown was a little too "hippy", and naive. But the general direction of adjusting themselves to best fit the universe as it was, instead of trying to change the universe to fit human limitations..
