In general, I tend to be unimpressed with the 'transhumanism' of any author who strikes me as lacking the sense and love of life, carried into a brighter future, that would be necessary to cast a Patronus 2.0. Also with those who seem to be disrespecting the power of cognitive intelligence. Vernor Vinge tends toward the excellent, obviously, and Peter Hamilton also does very well on this dimension.

Even among transhumanist authors, good posthuman role models are obviously going to be exceedingly rare for Vinge's Law reasons. Tunc Blumenthal from Across Realtime, Old One and the Blight in A Fire Upon the Deep, the Minds in Iain Banks's /Player of Games/ (the book that is the most lifeist of Banks's writings), and... I'm actually having trouble thinking of anything else. Well, CelestAI. Actually, CelestAI is about the most reasonably depicted superintelligence in fiction that I can recall, i.e., she is always ultimately depicted as getting what she wants for reasons of cognitive and technological advantage, which is really saying something about the difficulty of having one of those and still setting stories around them.
