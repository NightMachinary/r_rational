As an author/creator I can just say these kinds of things are hard to involve in the narrative.

The best way I find is using them as world building "truisms" that just behave in some imuttable manner.

A true post human AI I've at beat been making them work like simple facts of the universe. Like gravity.

The drama comes from what people do about that and working within whatever room the actions of the post humans allow.
