I found Dragon slightly flawed. She was so bizarrely nice and well-trusted. She was essentially a completely normal human being who happened to also be a computer program. She was more like an uploaded human than anything else, which contradicted her origin story. Saint was the irrational bad guy in the story's eyes, when I think his views should have been given more credibility even if they did ultimately turn out to be flawed. He was a weak straw man of a valid position.
