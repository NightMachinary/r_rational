I'd love to agree with you and am heartened by the various moonshots I see driving humanity closer to growing up and cooperating, but deprecating the values of Stross and Watts work because they are not idealistic enough seems like a violation of the litany of Tar/s/ki+n+. Both authors are pessimistic, but plausible for separate societal, and biological arguments that drive each author's thesis.

- Watts values intelligence but blatantly disregards consciousness, and depressingly he has a thick academic bibliography to his fictional work I need to get around to reading. I'd like to encourage you as a leader in the community to put some time into rebut or criticism of his work, *<EDIT>* /after the completion of HPMOR/ *</EDIT>*because it is a trifecta of: plausibility, deathism by the ending of conscious thought, and academic reputability.

- Stross's future, a-la Accelerando, is similar but less threatening, in it's red queen's race, evolution to extinction bleakness that is his the expected life-cycle of intelligent life evolved in any system, but for society based reasons. His argument seems based on the fact that CEV will be very hard, while more perilous paths to improved intelligence will be tractable with direct profit reward, and in the long run resource optimizing expert systems for whatever is scarce, will inevitably out perform those systems with goals other than optimization and reproduction. I.E. transhumanity will get intelligence optimization wrong, and will have to run away from their children who will be the bandwith, processing, or whatever is scarce, equivalent of dollar chasers.

Thank you for the suggestion of Brin, somehow he has slipped my reading list.
