  The *Fleetmind*, known to its friends as Petey, is a colossal compound AI currently engaged in a war with the Pa'anuri in Andromeda. The concept of a Fleetmind was first used shortly after the Battle of the Buuthandi in order to coordinate rescue of the gate-clone prisoners. This consisted of Admiral Breya's coalition fleet, and was essentially a hivemind of every AI in the fleet, centered around Petey of the /Post-Dated Check Loan/. This Fleetmind dissolved shortly after the fleet's escape from the system, although the ex-Fleetmind units kept in touch. In an attempt to correct some bugs in his psychology, Petey had been building an HV-1 version of himself. When the /Post-Dated Check Loan/ was destroyed by the Ob'enn, the mini-Petey survived in a minitank and was recovered by the /Scepter of Unrelenting Pain/. Using stolen Project Laz'R'Us technology, Petey grew himself a physical Ob'enn body (making himself technically a cyborg) and used it to take over the /Scepter/. He then dismantled the ship for its fabber, used it to create unfettered AI vessels of his /Devastator/ and /Penetrator/ designs, incorporated them into a new fleetmind, and declared war on the Ob'enn. He grew more bodies, used them to take over and incorporate more Thunderheads, and began systematically squashing the Ob'enn military and de-indoctrinating the survivors, hoping to eventually take the "psycho" out of "psycho-bear".
