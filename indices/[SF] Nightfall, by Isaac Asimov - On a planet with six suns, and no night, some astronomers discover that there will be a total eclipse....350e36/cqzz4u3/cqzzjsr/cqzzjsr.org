  CONCLUSION

  We have explored several aspects of Asimov's novel. We have found that the suns, especially Dovim are bright enough to blot out the stars. Kalgash 2 can eclipse Dovim for a period of 9 hours.

  We also tested one possible star configuration and after running some simulations, we found that the system is possible for short periods of time. Several other configurations might exist and have to be explored more fully.
