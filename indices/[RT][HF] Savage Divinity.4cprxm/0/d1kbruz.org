Here is the authors description (I am not the author):

A modern man finds himself reincarnated in the body of a young slave with no skills and quickly fading memories. Follow his journey to find normalcy while living in a savage world, filled with myth and legends, monsters and Demons. In a land where the strong rule, the weak serve, and bloodshed is a way of life, peace is a luxury few can afford.

Author's note: Expect a chapter every mon/wed/fri, unless I start writing faster.

The story is eastern themed, but not Xianxia, no chasing immortality, MC is not OP. Less action, more character and world driven is my aim. Mature language and themes, but no raunchy sex.

I have read up to chapter 32 (the latest chapter). The writing is solid and and the world seems well built. Highly recommend.
