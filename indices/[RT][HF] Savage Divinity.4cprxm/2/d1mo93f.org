I enjoyed this story. There are some flaws; the protagonist comes from our world, but this has almost 0 impact on the plot. There will be no industrial revolution in this fic, no firearms invented, no real changes. That said, it's fun, and the characters and relationships are realistic, their goals rational, and the world-building competent, if somewhat derivative. Worth a read.
