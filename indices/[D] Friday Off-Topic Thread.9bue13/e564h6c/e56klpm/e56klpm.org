I think 4chan's most important innovations were, and continue to be, structural: the adaptation of Futaba's anonymity and posting style to American norms and interests. Japanese 2chan posters invented the internet meme as a genre, 4chan brought it to an English-speaking audience and set it free to the world.

Enforced anonymity also encourages a particular style of community creativity much of the rest of the internet has lost. When somebody is consistently funny elsewhere, they get a lot of followers and develop a personal style. To be funny on 4chan, robbed of the personal, one must embrace the particular style of each individual subgroup. Humor becomes derivative and in-jokey... reused and remixed and reposted until the cream rises.

That said, the process is no longer unique and no longer alone.
