These are ok jokes, but if this is the stuff you advertise with then 4chan doesn't produce as much good content as I thought. I think the master/slave naming thread was the funniest, and it's about as good as a decent post in [[/r/programmerhumor][r/programmerhumor]].

I don't particularly see why you need to advertise 4chan. If someone has been on Reddit long enough to even find this sub, they've doubtlessly already heard of 4chan and either decided to use it or not. I don't think brushing past the racism is really doing your post any favors either.
