  apart from the obvious [...] "noise cancelling headphones"

Just want to mention that this is the only option that's managed to work for me. My company just got acquired by a larger one which fits ~200 people in a single open office space and has a culture of folks having loud meetings in the middle of the office, often next to un-involved folks' desks.

I grabbed a set of [[https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Acoustic-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B00M1NEUKK][Bose QC 25]]s last time they went on sale and wear them pretty much 8/5 at work. They're fantastic, some days I'm sure they're the only thing keeping me sane.

For $200 (and often on sale for much less) amortized over the number of days you can actually pay attention to what you're doing, I couldn't be happier.

EDIT: worth noting that the sound cancelling can be enabled even when music is not playing, which is how I often find myself using them.
