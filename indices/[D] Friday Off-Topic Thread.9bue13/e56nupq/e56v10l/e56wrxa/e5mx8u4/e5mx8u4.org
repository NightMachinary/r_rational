  Only advice I'd have is try experimenting with different types of noise. (E.g. you can find background noise videos on Youtube with a lot of bass, which I needed at one point when I worked somewhere with a lot of footstep noises.)

I ended up giving white noise a different try using the soundscapes on mynoise, and I found that worked really well after a few days of adjustment. I think the variety in the noises while not being distracting and the gentle oscillation of the sounds into slightly different sounds really helped.
