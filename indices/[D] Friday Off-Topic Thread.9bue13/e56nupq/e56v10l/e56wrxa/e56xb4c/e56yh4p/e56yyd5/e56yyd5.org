Try getting some over ear headphones or earmuffs to go on top of those. Headphones would be more innocuous. I can't say for sure if it would work, but I think it's the best you could do without either soundproofing your office or working from home. Headphones don't have to be particularly expensive to block noise well, like $80 or so for "good but not great" ones.
