Noise /cancelling/ headphones don't work too well for human speech. They're fantastic for very regular sounds like wind or aircraft engines, in which case they work scarily well. From what I've read, for noise as chaotic as speech, it would just distort it and probably make it more noticeable even if it's somewhat quieter.

Noise isolation headphones can vary in effectiveness, but are usually fairly good and not nearly as expensive. You could probably use some good earplugs in addition to noise isolating headphones, which should work better than either alone. I know pro gamers use something similar to focus during tournaments. [[/r/headphones][r/headphones]] would probably know some good brands for noise isolation.
