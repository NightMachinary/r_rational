My partner was given a pair of high-end noise cancelling headphones for his recent birthday; maybe once he's gotten bored of them I'll borrow them for a few days and see how they go.

Funnily enough I tend to use the opposite type of headphones - bone conduction headphones that let me hear absolutely everything that's going on around me (I bought them for cycling for safety reasons). It's meant that being unaware of my environment while I have headphones on makes me uncomfortable.

Cheers for the recommendation but those bad boys are ~300AUD and that's not a gamble I can afford making. Even then, the open office has "quiet rooms" that you can go into when you need to, which are basically tiny offices, so I might try using that.
