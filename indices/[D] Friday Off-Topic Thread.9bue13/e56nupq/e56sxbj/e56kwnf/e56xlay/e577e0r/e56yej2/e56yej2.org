Python is the big language in data science right now. For learning python, Learning Python and Fluent Python, both published by O'Reilley, are good resources. They're both fairly comprehensive, so he probably doesn't need to fully read them, just the parts that are relevant. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is also a good book, although geared more towards beginners. I'm currently learning data science myself, and my course textbook is Python Data Science Handbook, so that's probably a good start. Specific libraries to learn would be Matplotlib for data visualization, Numpy and Pandas because I know they're related but I don't know specifically what they do other than "math stuff", tensorflow and keras for machine learning which is heavily related to data science, and probably some relevant libraries for interfacing with stuff like Excel documents to directly work with the data. Learning databases would also be rather useful, in which case my text is Database System Concepts which teaches database theory along with some chapters on SQL. Would probably be valuable to learn more about specific SQL implementations from a dedicated book, although I don't know which ones are good.

Spyder is a good IDE for data science, and includes most of the above libraries without any additional work.

For more than that, ask me again in a few years. Or, you know, ask someone who works in the field what their University course lists taught. That would be quicker.
