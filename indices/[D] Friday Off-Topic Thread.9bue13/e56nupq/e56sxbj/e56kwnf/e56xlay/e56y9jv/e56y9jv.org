Random thought: You are having a reoccurring dream where every night you are dreaming of being transported to an abandoned city that looks like it just survived a bombing. The dream is incredibly realistic to the point where if you weren't waking up in your bed come sunrise each morning, you would believe that you have been kidnapped to somewhere foreign. Each night, you return to where you last ended the prior night as if your waking life was a dream. You switch 'worlds' whenever you fall asleep in one and wake up in the other world as if you are waking up from a normal sleep that lasted just as long as the amount of time you spent awake in the other world. You feel like you are living two lives split into day and night. What would you do in the dream? When you are awake?

I'm just curious how people here would react to the situation I've been putting my characters through in the story I've been writing recently.
