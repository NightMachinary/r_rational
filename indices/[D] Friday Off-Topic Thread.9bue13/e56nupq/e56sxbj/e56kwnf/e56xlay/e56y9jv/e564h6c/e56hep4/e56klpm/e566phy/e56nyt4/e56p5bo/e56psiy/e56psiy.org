Why not both?

  4chan is funny despite the racism

Even the denizens of 4chan constantly complain about /pol/'s tendency to mess up the other boards whenever it rears its head, and the moderators /do/ actually delete blatantly baiting/derailing threads and comments (even in /pol/ itself, sometimes), so you're in good company if you prefer non-racist discussion (/e. g./, on /tg/ or /d/).

  The racism itself is funny

I've got almost a hundred hilarious anti-Semitic caricatures in their own "Le Happy Merchant" folder.\\
- A Po-Matoran (from Bionicle) rubbing its hands together in imitation of the standard caricature\\
- The standard caricature hiding behind a "Plot Power: 18200.0%" notification (from /Crusader Kings 2/)\\
- A Star of David and a shekel symbol (=✡₪=) arranged to resemble the standard caricature\\
- A floor plan of a narrow bathroom and an adjoining closet, arranged to resemble the standard caricature (with the bathroom's door folded at 45 degrees to form the nose)\\
- A screenshot of a creature's description in /Dwarf Fortress/, starting with "A scheming, gold[-]loving creature with subversive tendencies"

The originality on display in this art is amazing. Even beyond the caricatures, reading trolls and/or idiots argue over global conspiracies and genetic dilution in /pol/ never fails to amuse.
