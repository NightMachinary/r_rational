Seti from [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3323184/1/Aeromancer][Aeromancer]] sort of fits your requirements. He's very good at handling social situations, but is not as good at being analytical when it comes to investigating magic. Although he is getting better at that in later chapters. He is very hard-working, but is also very willing to use any short-cut or his advantages in an unfair manner (a very 'do whatever it takes' mentality). Seti is very arrogant and practical-minded without much philosophizing.
