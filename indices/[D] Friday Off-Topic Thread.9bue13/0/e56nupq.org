So, I've been doing fatal crash investigations for about a month now, and here's my two takeaways:

1) never drive near a tree again because it will kill you (I am now pretty much like Durkon in OOTS as far as trees go)

2) never ride in a motorbike again because it will kill you

with a bonus THIRD OBVIOUS TAKEAWAY:

3) maybe drinking and driving is not a great decision?

Also, it looks like this job is going to be a lot of writing repetitive reports. I'm slowly coming to terms with it, but I kind of hate having to make reports up that are 70-80% virtually identical CTRL+F stuff with 10-20% important content and ~10% vital content.

It doesn't help that I have two types of reports, with Report 2 being done in batches (As of last Friday, I had 6 Report 2s to write; I have now written 3 of them, I think; once they're done I won't have any Report 2s to do for a month or so). So it makes Report 2 particularly bad because I don't do any and then all of a sudden MORE REPORT 2S THAN YOUR BODY HAS ROOM FOR.

Anyone have tips for dealing with this mentally, as I like the job well enough except for that? The reports require a lot of care and attention to detail, so I can't just put podcasts on and go on autopilot, but I might try putting music on next week and see how that goes.

Also, apart from the obvious "white noise"/"earmuffs"/"noise cancelling headphones"/"tell them to shut up", does anyone have recommendations for noisy offices?
