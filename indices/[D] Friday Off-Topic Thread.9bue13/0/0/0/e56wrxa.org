  if you're already playing loud white noise through noise canceling headphones and it isn't enough, you're probably in a bad spot.

It's more that I find I work best with /absolute silence/ (like, the study room in a university library is often too loud for me), so white noise isn't great for me, and noise cancelling headphones are super expensive and I've never tested them out.
