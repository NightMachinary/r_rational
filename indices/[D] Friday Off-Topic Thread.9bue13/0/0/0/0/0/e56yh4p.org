I wear [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X9KV0HU]] at work, and while they definitely don't come anywhere close to totally canceling out speech, they do a good enough job that I can focus even with a conversation happening right behind me. (Honestly, very low noises like footsteps or heavy doors have been more of a problem than human voices for me, although those also have the property you described where they aren't regular.)
