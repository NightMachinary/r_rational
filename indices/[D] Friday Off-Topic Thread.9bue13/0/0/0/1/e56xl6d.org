I'm very picky about my white noise, personally. Rain works really well for me for some reason, maybe because I grew up hearing it so it doesn't sound harsh and artificial.

Noise canceling headphones are definitely expensive, and the cheaper ones don't really work as well, but they're pretty amazing. Also, my experience has been that they last like 2 years of heavy use before something goes wrong with them, even the nice ones, so it's more of a recurring cost. That said, if you amortize a nice $200 set of headphones over 2 years, that's like a 25 cents a day, maybe 50 cents per day you actually need them. I would absolutely pay 50 cents to be able to think straight on any given day, so at least for me it pretty obviously prices out.

I know you said no obvious things, but have you tried those 34db earplugs they use at shooting ranges? Those work pretty spectacularly in my experience, and are pretty cheap.
