I was a grader briefly in college, and it had a similar structure: nothing, then a huge amount of work all at once after a midterm.

I tried a bunch of stuff people suggested (Pomodoros, rewarding yourself after doing one, having a dedicated space where you only do that task), but the only thing that really worked was finding someone else who also had grading to do and agreeing to both meet up and work on it at a specific place and specific time. Turns out social pressure is pretty psychologically powerful.

On noisy offices: if you're already playing loud white noise through noise canceling headphones and it isn't enough, you're probably in a bad spot. Only advice I'd have is try experimenting with different types of noise. (E.g. you can find background noise videos on Youtube with a lot of bass, which I needed at one point when I worked somewhere with a lot of footstep noises.)

Another obvious thing you've probably already thought of is working early or late when nobody's there, depending on how flexible your hours are.
