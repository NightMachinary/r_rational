Find out if both are really persistent. I would injure myself in some small way on both sides, say cut my right or left index finger, and notice if the injuries remain after "waking up" and coming back from either side. If the injuries disappear on one side, then it would be fairly safe to say that that is a weirdly lucid dream, although persistent injuries wouldn't disprove that hypothesis.

To more firmly prove or disprove the lucid dream hypothesis, make a 4x4 or 5x5 grid of numbers on the ground, and write out the sums of each column and row next to it, then memorize the sums and *only* the sums. If the recalculated sums work out to be the same across switches, it's extremely unlikely to be a dream, because I don't think you could work out that grid from the sums without a lot of conscious effort. I'm unsure how long it would take me even right now, if I wasn't allowed a computer.

If it's a dream, go see a therapist. Something is wrong.

If it's not, try looking for landmarks, things that are easily identifiable. Are you stranded across time, space, or both? Do the ruined building have any distinguishing technology? You could get a rough location if you learn how to read the stars in the sky, so try that. Similarly with any local flora or fauna.

If you can get a location, try finding out the nearest human settlement from maps on the "waking" side, and find other humans. That would be the best way to get information. After meeting humans, the decision tree is too big for me to encompass in a post.
