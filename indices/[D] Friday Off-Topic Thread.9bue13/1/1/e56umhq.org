Scifi. The worldbuilding is very rational, but the protagonist isn't at all.

On the topics you mentioned:

- Young western guy: main character is a preteen asian girl.
- Good analytical but piss-poor social skills: she sort of doesn't fit on this axis. Her primary skillset is hurting things, being lucky, and stuff I can't mention because spoilers. Gets along well with basically everybody who knows her.
- Dearly held views on science and rationality: also sort of doesn't fit on this axis. Her thinking is more tactical and political. She has a very clannish right-wing attitude toward life. Likes learning things, but mostly because they help her succeed, rather than for love of learning.
- Meek but hardworking and philosophical: definitely not meek, very hardworking, not terribly philosophical.
