Let's be frank.\\
This little community is swimming in it's own juices, fraught with little and big biases/habits, especially when it comes to writing.\\
Nothing to severe, mind you. Still- small community focused on a specific genre is going to do that to you.

So I want to ask- do you have any examples of writing by people you can consider complete opposite of yourselves?\\
I don't mean vehement climate warming deniers who drink snake oil while reading latest horoscopes.

Common protag is a young western guy with good analytical but piss-poor social skills, dearly held views on science and rationality, meek but hardworking and philosophical.

Can you find me the most perfect opposite of that?
