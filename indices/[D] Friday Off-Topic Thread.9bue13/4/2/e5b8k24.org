When I'm awake I have access to Google and Wikipedia. I can look stuff up.

At first, I look up about persistent dreams and the lucid dreaming. I try lucid dreaming when I'm asleep - at least to the point of attempting to fly in the dream - and when that doesn't work and I experience pain in the dream (possibly a twisted ankle), then I try to fly via lucid dreaming while I'm awake (being careful to start out flying /upwards/ so that I don't fall if it fails to work).

--------------

Presumably I am unable to prove which existence is real and which is not. I then start using my internet access to look up survival guides which I can use in the Bombed City, and trying to use things I find in the Bombed City (newspapers?) to identify where/when it is. (At this point, I'm more than a little worried). If there is a significant time difference between real life and the Bombed City (e.g. the Bombed City is in the future) then I attempt to take advantage of the temporal paradox (i.e. hiding useful supplies in the present so I can find them in the Bombed City - that may well work even if someone in the present removes my supplies, simply because I /expect/ to find them there).

If I meet any other people in the Bombed City I will attempt to ask them about their dreams and, if they admit to also having similar experiences, I will share my email address with them (allowing coordination on both sides of the Dream Barrier).
