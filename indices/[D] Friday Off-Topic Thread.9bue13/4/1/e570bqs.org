Is the dream continuous? That is, do i wake randomly in the city, or where I left off before waking up? How much of the dream do I remember? Presumably I try and test how accurate the "dream" is, to see whether I'm having the mother of all lucid dreams or whether it's all self consistent enough that it could very well be (a) realitity.

I'd try and find out where or what the city is; Is it my current city, a destroyed new york, what?

Do I feel pain in this dream? Hunger? Thirst? Do injuries develop, accumulate, go away? Am I "Awake" and can worry about things or am I drifting around in lala land?

A lot of it I bet would be trying to see how things progress from one dream to another, especially whether it's seamless or whether I have the appearance of 12-18 hours occuring between dreams. I guess I'd also look for mirrors and writing supplies, to see if it's me and to write notes. I'd also explore, I suppose, depending on how scared I was with the environment. if it really felt real enough I'd probably fear or be aggressive to any people I met in the dream. I'd talk to my friends and family about the dream, as well. if it got far enough along I might even ask if they could watch my sleeping...I'm not crazy or anything, but such a realistic dream would make me wonder if I'm being teleported or something.
