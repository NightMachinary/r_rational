This may belong in the Monday thread, but since the question is about settings, may as well ask it now: can anyone recommend any urban fantasy with a well-integrated and justified Masquerade? What I mean is not the standard "people will panic, stocks will plummet" or "oh yeah, and everyone has a cantrip that only works on the unpowered and is only used in that specific situation", but rather something continuously relevant and intrinsic to the power system, such as it is?

Truth be told, a lot of urban fantasy deals with maintaining the secrecy, but it's more often than not an afterthought, something to elevate the exciting from the mundane that was kept by the author in order to leave the readers something immediately relatable. So, more on-topic for the thread, what happens if you build the magic around being unknown, and its interactions with the material world as something to be avoided?
