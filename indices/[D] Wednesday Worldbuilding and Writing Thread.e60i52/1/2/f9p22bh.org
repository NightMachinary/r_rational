the Laundry series by Stross, which is actually eldritch horror meets tech support.

did you notice? oh dear, now we need to use binding magic to keep you quiet. and maybe conscript you to work for us now.

the setting includes a basilisk gun, a higher-dimensional symbol that turns people who see and understand it into parasitic vampires, and all sorts of other horrible ways the world is going to end soon. also, using magic makes extra-dimensional critters eat tiny holes in your brain.

early books of the series are really good, later books feel less good. the series as a whole is moving towards the end of the world, which cannot be stopped.
