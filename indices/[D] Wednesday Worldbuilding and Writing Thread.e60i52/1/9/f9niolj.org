Anonymous Rex and its sequels (by the author of Matchstick Men) are a no-magic urban fantasy with a deadly Masquerade --- any dinosaur who thinks a human knows their secret is authorized to kill the unfortunate ape and quickly dispose of the body. Also, any body or body part of a dino can be quickly disposed of with a special bacterium they carry with them. They're in politics, movies, and business.
