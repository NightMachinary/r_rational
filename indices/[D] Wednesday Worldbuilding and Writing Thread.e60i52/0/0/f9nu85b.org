I've been watching "The Toys that Made Us" documentary series on Netflix, which is OK, and thinking some about the intersection of commercialization and toys, especially from mercenary toy companies (rather than, say, someone toiling away to make the best toy for a child as a gift). The episode on My Little Pony talks a lot about "feeding the beast" and the company's desire to always have a Hot New Thing for each year in order to milk the market as much as possible. Toy Story 1 was /a little bit/ about that, in that Buzz is the Hot New Thing, but it doesn't take a very critical/aware approach to the toy churn, it's just kind of there in passing, or as a joke.

Aside from that, I guess I'd like to see some of the ideological splits among toys, either the ways that the conform to or reject mainstream toy values, or the subcultures that routinely develop in different kinds of households, or the ways that two ideologically aligned toys might be /slightly/ misaligned on minor issues.

(Note: I haven't seen Toy Story 4 yet, which probably raises questions or provides answers in some way.)
