I think it really depends on one basic question: how big is the magic community, and how effective are they at keeping a secret? The two really obvious worldbuilding paths to go down then appear.

1. You have an extremely small secretive inclusive society that might lend itself to a mystery plotline where the main characters find some small discrepancy and end up uncovering this magic circle instead of the crime ring they were expecting.

2. You have a huge, or famous magical society. If magic's interaction with the material plane is to be avoided, but magic can't be kept secret, the next best solution is to make sure EVERYONE knows magic is real, and EVERYONE knows that magic is BAD. This might lead to a well known but extremely exclusive magical circle, where you try to keep the number of people who can do magic as small as possible, but the people who know about magic as large as possible. This setting probably fits the genres you see in urban fantasy a bit better.
