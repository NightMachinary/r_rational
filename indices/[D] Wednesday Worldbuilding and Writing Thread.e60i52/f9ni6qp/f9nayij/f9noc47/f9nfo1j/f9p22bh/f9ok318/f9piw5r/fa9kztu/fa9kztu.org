The whole point of having a Masquerade is that things look basically like they do in real life, so that the author only needs to world-build about the parts that are different from real life. And yet, 40% of Americans believe in UFOs. 20% believe in witches. 33% believe in ghosts. 25% think astrology is real. 40% for ESP, 30% for telepathy, 20% for reincarnation. If the Men in Black managed to keep belief in UFOs down to half as mainstream as it is IRL, I'd call that a wildly (perhaps even implausibly) successful Masquerade, despite the fact that one in five of my co-workers would statistically be an X-Com Truther.

Clearly, the key ingredient of a Masquerade isn't a total lack of public belief, it's the idea that the police will tell you 'go home, you're drunk' if you report a Bigfoot related murder. If you're aware of vampires and want to do something about it, you have to form a militia group that wants to "take back the night" from "violent crime" and only drop the vampire bombshell on your inner circle. Everyone else, you have to keep the secret or else they'll laugh you out of the room and openly question whether you might need to see a psychiatrist.
