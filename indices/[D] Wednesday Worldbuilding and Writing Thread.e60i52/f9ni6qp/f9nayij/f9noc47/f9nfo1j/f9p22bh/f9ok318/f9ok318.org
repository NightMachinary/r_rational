Maybe the Dresden Files? There, the Masquerade works because magical communities are either very small, large but with very little individual or collective power or knowledge, or not on Earth proper. Taken together, this means there are reasonably large "covens" who can only do the supernatural equivalent of bending spoons or giving people nosebleeds, small numbers of powerful supernatural actors who see no reason to upset the status quo, and entire nations which are irrelevant to the masquerade because only other in-the-know persons can ever access them.

Basically, the total amount of obviously supernatural stuff happening where normals could see it is quite small. When things do get out of hand, people rationalize it away. Snow in June caused by a war between Winter and Summer is called el Ni√±o. People getting eaten by supernatural predators are assumed to have vanished for mundane reasons. Murderous rituals to create a new godling (interrupted before the murder part by our hero, of course) are assumed to be college pranks.

When someone sees something they can't explain any other way, they either try to forget it, join one of the mostly-ignorant "covens," or get sucked in with more powerful actors, for better or worse. Basically all of Harry Dresden's friends used to be muggles who thought he was nuts, but harmless, until they saw him do one too many clearly impossible things.

There are no outright prohibitions on outing the Masquerade. It's just not done. The supernatural nations, while quite powerful, would fold before the rage of billions of normals. Individual wizards can live to be hundreds of years old, but they mostly don't interact with the normals. Harry Dresden is seen as eccentric for being in the Yellow Pages under "Wizards," not a dangerous deviant. Because almost no normals have ever interacted with a Wizard of true power, they can't tell Dresden /is/ one, despite telling them to their face that he is. It's only when the fireballs come out that they start believing.
