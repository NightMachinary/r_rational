This is of interest to me too, especially in the social/legal aspects of maintaining a Masquerade, which I don't think I've seen explored in the way or to the extent that I would want it explored. Obviously you can have the Masquerade created through strong incentives and/or ease of enforcement, but it's still a matter of keeping hundreds if not thousands of people from opening their fat mouths to the wrong people. You can magic it all away, but that's not very fun or satisfying.

To your question of the unknown as integral to the supernatural, I think you could pretty easily make a magic system where that magic simply doesn't work around the mundane, in one way or another. A wizard /can't/ go into a lab and replicate his results, and any magic user who goes in front of a non-believer like Randi will find that their magic simply stops working (which is what a lot of people claim in the real world, that e.g. their ability to soothsay is hindered by a skeptic asking questions, or that the spirits are disturbed by the presence of a non-believer). It would also allow for some interesting action/chase scenes, as a high-powered magical battle spills out onto the crowded streets ... and suddenly becomes a fist fight.

(Tangential to the question, but I think one of the interesting things to do with the Masquerade is to have it be out but not "out", in a sense. In other words, treat it like other "conspiracy theories" about things that are, on balance of probability, true, but which no one can prove. The Masquerade is "broken" in the sense that a sizable minority of people are in the know, but it's intact in the sense that the majority will write off the supernatural with mundane explanations, which gets helped along by official government/department policies that deny the existence of the supernatural.

For this to work, you would need the supernatural to be fairly small and quite contained, enough that the group of hangers-on and groupies was larger than the actual group of supernatural, and also small enough that the surface area is minuscule. In this kind of a world, every high school probably had fairy-girl with wings glued to her hoodie, and wolf-boy with his fake fake and long hair, which is generally the image that the public has of such things. You'd get ten news reports about copycat or false supernatural stuff to every one true one, so most people would (correctly) assume that if they heard about a fairy charming someone, it was a lie told by an unfaithful husband rather than the victim of a supernatural crime. Again though, you would probably only do this in a relatively low-powered setting.)
