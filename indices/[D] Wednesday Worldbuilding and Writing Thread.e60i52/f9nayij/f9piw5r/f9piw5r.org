Less a recommendation as a discussion from me but...

The way Magecraft works in the Nasuverse is interesting. It relies of /Mystery/, that which is fundamentally possible but not understood. As things become understood, they move from Magecraft to the realm of science and magecraft loses the ability to do them.
