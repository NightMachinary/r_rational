In the tabletop RPG /Mage: The Awakening/, materialist physics are a lie. Reality actually operates on Neo-Platonist rules. The "real world" that we percieve in our day-to-day lives is just an imperfect projection of ideal forms that exist in the Supernal Realm.

Once upon a time, the phenomenal and ideal worlds were much closer, and many humans achieved a connection to the ideal world through esoteric revelations. This connection granted humans knowledge of the ideal world, and the power to manipulate the Supernal forms to rewrite phenomenal reality. Such humans were known as Mages, and they could wield their powers among ordinary humans freely.

But then a group of Mages built a mystical structure called The Celestial Ladder, that allowed them to transcend their material forms and enter the Supernal Realm. Once there, they overthrew the Old Gods who had thus far held sway, and installed themselves as the new rulers of all reality.

But another group of Mages attempted to stop the usurpers, and uphold the natural order. The resulting war lead to the destruction of The Celestial Ladder, and the formation of the Abyss - a vast void of unreality, seperating the phenomenal and ideal worlds. With this separation, humanity found it harder and harder to tap into the powers of the Supernal Realm. Fewer and fewer Mages awakened to magical knowledge, and the Mages that already existed found their powers stunted and limited.

The phenomenal world became The Fallen World, and only became darker as the Abyss grew.

Fast forward to the modern day, and the universe is ruled by the Exarchs - the ascended Mages who usurped the Old Gods. They seek to maintain their power by keeping humanity blind to Supernal knowledge - the only thing that could threaten them. By the will of the Exarchs, all humans are subject to the Sleeping Curse. So-called "Sleepers" cannot remember Supernal magic if exposed to it. Supernal artifacts wither into mundanity around them. And attempts to cast Supernal magic in front of them cause horrible backlash for the Mage responsible.

But the Sleeping Curse is not perfect. Mages are still awakening, though in very small numbers. So the Exarchs are served by the Seers of the Throne - a hierarchy of mortal Mages, who seek to curry favour with the demiurges in return for wealth and power. The Seers work to make conditions in the Fallen World as hostile to awakenings as possible, generally by making life miserable for Sleepers. War, poverty, hatred, slavery - all are encouraged by the Seers, by the will of the Exarchs.

The player-characters are usually members of the Pentacle - a coalition of Mage orders, focused on resisting the Seers and their Supernal masters. The Pentacle's ultimate goal is to storm the Supernal Realms and overthrow the Exarchs, wipe out the Sleeping Curse, and allow the light of the Supernal to shine on the Fallen World once more.

TL;DR: In /Mage: The Awakening/, you play as Gnostic Neo-Platonist wizards, seeking to destroy the Masquerade by waging a guerilla war against the tyrant god-kings of reality.
