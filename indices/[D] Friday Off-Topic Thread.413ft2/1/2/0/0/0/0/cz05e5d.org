  I'm more inclined to believe that easy marriages cause easy divorces, and not the other way around, particularly as marriage becomes detached from its developmental status as an institution of lineage and property exchange between families.

I guess I don't really see a causal effect at all? Easy marriages and easy divorces could both be symptoms of people not taking marriage seriously, rather than one causing the other. This would also contribute to declining marriage rates.

Edit: Or, there are a few feedback loops involved. People see quick, meaningless marriages and start to take marriage less seriously. They see quick, simple divorces and start to take marriage less seriously. They see people living together without marrying and take marriage less seriously. But all these things that weaken the institution of marriage also contribute to the symptoms of a weak institution, so the effects become the causes, leading to further and further decline of marriage as an institution as time goes on.
