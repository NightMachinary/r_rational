I'm more inclined to believe that easy marriages cause easy divorces, and not the other way around, particularly as marriage becomes detached from its developmental status as an institution of lineage and property exchange between families. I don't see much value in marriage's status as a precommitment, either. When a bad marriage ends, that's a good thing. I'm also more inclined to believe that large rates of divorce are likely to /discourage/ marriage, not encourage it. If they know the commitment is likely to end, and that the end of the commitment is one of the most stressful life events people experience, then people are less willing to commit.

Marriage rates are declining, to the point that it's been called a "problem" by W. Wilcox in The Federalist and a "crisis" by Aja Gabel in UVA. How does this gel with your theory that easy divorce => rushing into marriage?
