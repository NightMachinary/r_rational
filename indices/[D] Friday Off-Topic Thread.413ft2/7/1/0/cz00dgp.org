Basically the leveraging paradigm that we're in. We need a global money supply deleveraging, not a business cycle temporary credit deleveraging.

And the fact that everything is so incredibly levered. Nothing has been fixed since 2008 and there are fewer tools to combat a fast deleveraging now. Commodities were at extremely inflated prices after 2008, and now that they are crashing they are taking entire country's economies with them. Oil is taking down Norway, Venezuela, Canada, Russia, etc. When these economies default it will be much different than a business cycle round of defaults.
