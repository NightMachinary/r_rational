Indeeed. I personally play different games, but the only way I've found to have an enemy that seems like another player playing the same game with the same goals as myself, is to actually have that other player. My particular vices are Dominions 4 and DotA 2 - the former is entirely thinking with zero execution requirements, and can be played solo or with designated allies, and diplomacy/betrayal/cunning/alliance-making etc are important but so are planning and combat tactics, while the latter is a combination of executing well and dexterity tests with some planning/thinking and working well with teammates and allies.

I find games against AI to be less fun, these days. Even if the AI is given a material advantage and the game is not 'even', it is most often very predictable and therefore exploitable.
