[[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Waldo_Wiki][Here's the Waldo Wiki]], which I should have known existed. The details are quite thin, as one might expect, but the world as laid out has a number of features that I think are intriguing:

1. Waldo wanders all through time and space with [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Waldo%27s_walking_stick][a magic walking stick]] given to him by Wizard Whitebeard.
2. Waldo isn't just Waldo, he's /a/ Waldo, one of many. He goes to the [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Land_of_Waldos][Land of Waldos]] and meets exact (?) duplicates of himself.
3. Waldo has a villain, [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Odlaw][Odlaw]], who is after Waldo's magic staff. Canonically, he wants to use this to steal gold from Fort Knox, which is stupid.
4. Odlaw isn't just Odlaw, he's /an/ Odlaw, one of many, from [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Odlaw_Swamp][the Odlaw Swamp]].

I have so many questions that need to be answered here.

Does the land of Waldos imply that there's a land of every other sort of person? Does Waldo not feel any existential dread at meeting people identical to himself? Is there a reason that Waldo and Odlaw exist as opposites to each other? Are Odlaw's plans for the magical staff so simple as he claims? And if Odlaw isn't able to travel through time and space (because he doesn't have the staff) how does he keep ending up where Waldo is? What's Whitebeard's role in all this? Is there some reason behind why Waldo is traveling around beyond just tourism? Is this a Quantum Leap style "he goes where he's needed" thing?
