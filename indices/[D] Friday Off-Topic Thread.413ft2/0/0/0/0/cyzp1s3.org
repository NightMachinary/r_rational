Including information from the TV series (I watched recordings of it when I was kid, and feel I have useful if not perfectly accurate memory of it), I would propose that, as is often the case in these sorts of situations, everything started with the Wizard.

Whitebeard is magical, both in the sense that he can craft magical items of great power (such as the walking cane, and his own staff), but also in a way inherent to his nature. Whitebeard is unique across all of the worlds (which may be why he is so powerful, have the entirety of essence concentrated in a single instance of himself).

Being both a somewhat human being, and in a place of significant personal power, Whitebeard sees that there is a great amount of suffering across reality, desires to replace it with joy.

Waldo, the one who possesses the cane, is special in his own way. Ordinarily, a person's image is scattered across the multitude. Some, however, such as Waldo, are (/part of) a collective. He was taken from that collective (by his own future self, through temporal shenanigans) to the conventional world we see in the earlier books. This disturbs the balance that a collective requires to be stable, and so the World of Waldos was split in two, half being perverted into the Odlaw Swamp. Due to this imbalance, an Odlaw (though not necessarily the same one each time) is forcefully pushed into any world which Waldo w/ Cane enters, and forcefully removed when he leaves.

Whitebeard grants the estranged Waldo the cane for two reasons. The first, is simply that, through happenstance, Waldo came to interact with Wenda, another being akin to Whitebeard (although she was initially split unevenly in two, the other part going by the name Wilma, Whitebeard rectified this through the use of a magical artifact), who he was planning on recruiting as an apprentice of sorts. Waldo shows himself (and thus his collective) to be trustworthy and good-hearted to Wenda, and so to Whitebeard as well. The other reason is that, as a member of a collective who has been removed from them by circumstance, Waldo is in fact distinctly prepared to handle the existence of multiple worlds, and the multitudes of people within and across them, as his history has shown him both of these things.

Whitebeard desires help in his endeavor, as, while he is immensely powerful, he is still ultimately unique, singular, a trait which he cannot rectify without losing the power he possesses.
