I've only funded two projects so far.

One was Sandstorm.io, an open source software project. It was basically a way to help fund their development. I was on the same mailing list as the founder for 10 years, so I knew their reputation.

The other was for [[/u/eaglejarl]] book project, because he's awesome.

I'd never crowdfund hardware... much too likely to be disappointed. I'm unlikely to do it for other media (other than a Firefly reboot) either.
