EDIT: Oh wow, this ended up as a wall'o'text. Well, summary: crowdfunding is useful for market research, and people are allowed to do their own risk/reward calculations.

--------------

Obviously, I can't answer for the entire crowdfunding industry, but I can answer for myself. Having actually done crowdfunding, I can tell you how it looks from my perspective, and what I'm guessing was going on in the heads of the people who donated.

I was considering making a change from programming to writing as a career, and I needed to know if it was even remotely feasible for me to do that. I needed a way to do some basic market research -- were there people who actually liked my writing enough that they would spend money on it? If so, it was at least possible that I could actually sell enough stuff to live.

Under the traditional model I would have written something and then flogged it to publishers. That's measuring the wrong thing, though -- that's measuring "can I convince one person [the purchasing agent for a publisher] to give me money for my writing on one occasion." That doesn't tell me if it's feasible for me to keep doing this. There's also an EXTREMELY long delay on getting that feedback -- weeks or months. Not exactly a great method for making decisions.

I could also have epublished and measured the income directly, but that had high startup costs; I'd need to find out how to do that, I'd need to do a lot of research on marketing a book, I'd need to pay someone to make a cover for me, etc. I wasn't willing to do what is, frankly, a lot of work without a little more assurance that it wouldn't be a waste that left me feeling like a failure.

I could have just run a survey "Would you pay money for my writing, Y/N?" That didn't see like a viable strategy for reasons that should be obvious.

A much better metric would be to run a Kickstarter for a modest amount of money and simply list it in the online fora where I'm already known. The startup costs are extremely low and it would let me see:

- How many people funded? [tells me market size]
- What amount they were willing to fund for on average? [tells me about pricing]
- How many of them were /not/ friends and family members?
- How quickly did they go in? [suggestive of how much first-degree marketing I need]
- What sort of rewards were they most interested in? [ideas for ancillary items]

Now, obviously I don't know what was actually going on in the heads of the people who funded, but I suspect it was some combination of the following:

- This guy has given us a lot of free content, I'll throw a buck in the kitty as a thank you
- This story sounds interesting and I'd like to read it. If it already existed I'd throw $3 at it, so I'll throw that in. [There might have been a "...but there's a chance he'll run off to Aruba with my $3 without delivering; I judge there is a <= 33% of that happening, so I'll only throw in $2."]
- I don't care too much about this guy personally, and I don't care too much about the specific story he's describing, but I do usually like his stuff and want to see more people making the kind of content I want to read, so I'll throw a couple bucks in.
- Ooh, shiny! I get to be the protagonist of / have a cameo in / have a hand in shaping the plot of a rational horror story! Shut up and take my money!

Kickstarter has (or had, when I did it) a required section of their template "what are the risks that might cause your project to fail and how will you manage them?" It's possible that people didn't read that, but it's not like it's hidden. There's also a reasonable amount of media attention to the fact that Kickstarter projects could end up failing or being a gyp. I think it's pretty fair to say that everyone who funded me -- or who funds any Kickstarter -- can reasonably be assumed to have known the risks.

The bottom line is that people gave money for something they wanted with the full understanding that it might not happen. Clearly, the perceived risk / return calculation was worth it to them.
