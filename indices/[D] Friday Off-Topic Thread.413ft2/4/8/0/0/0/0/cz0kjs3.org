  I seem to view any purchase as an investment. Never as a donation.

Ah, I see. I've never actually thought of Kickstarter as a donation; you're purchasing something, with an understanding that there is some risk in the purchase. Maybe you're purchasing the right to read a story, or the right to own an Occulus Rift, or whatever. (You're also purchasing whatever the reward for your level is -- a cameo in the story, or the right to have plot input, or whatever -- but the primary thing is what the Kickstarter is about.)

  I expect my value back in return. And then some.

Do you get more than your value back when you buy groceries, or when you pay for a cleaning service or a plumber? When you pay for a cleaning service there's always a chance that they won't show up and will just keep your money, so it's pretty equivalent. Likewise, when you pay for dry cleaning there's always the chance that they'll lose your clothes.

Maybe Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites would feel better for you if you thought about it more in the "groceries, cleaning services, and dry cleaning" bucket than in the "mutual funds" bucket.
