I emphasise again that I refer only to projects that continue to generate earnings post the initial crowdfund. When I pay the plumber, the cleaner, or the grocer, I'm not directly contributing to setting up a company, hiring employees, building a brand and helping the person generate *future* *money*.

When I mentioned risk in the op, I was referring to risk in [[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp][this]] context. Not the risk that the product promised wouldn't be delivered.
