First of all, the story DID see a modest degree of commercial success, in the sense that it actually sold some copies. Nothing like a wild runaway 50-Shades success, of course. (Also, I'd like to think it's better written.).

Second, my backers DID get rewarded with more than a thank you. They got cameos, plot input, and even to be a protagonist. That was the deal -- they were putting in money so that that they could (a) read a fun story and (b) get some cool benny. There was never any expectation that they would get an ongoing revenue stream. So, no; I have not revenue-shared with my backers.

I'm a little baffled at your take on this, honestly. You're implying that no use of money is worthwhile unless it results in ongoing revenue. Why is it not acceptable, in your mind, to purchase a one-time experience?
