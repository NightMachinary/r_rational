I should have been more specific in my original post. I meant projects that continue to generate earnings after the backer's rewards are fulfilled.

For example, if your book saw commercial success after the kickstarter would you consider it appropriate to reward your backers with more than just a thank you. Apologies if this sounds pretentious.
