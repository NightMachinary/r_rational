To date, the only Kickstarter (or similar thing) I've given money to has been [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playtonic/yooka-laylee-a-3d-platformer-rare-vival/description]["Yooka-Laylee"]], mostly because I REALLY loved the spiritual predecessors as a kid and wanted to express my nostalgia as a cash donation. Additionally, it marginally improved the probability of the thing getting made and achieving its stretch goals, and brought me pleasure in the form of anticipation for the finished product (which is more intense given that I've more concretely committed myself towards receiving it). If you trust the makers decently well (given prior knowledge or decent evidence in the form of a prototype, proof of concept, tech demo, etc.), then it's not terribly risky to give them money, and you usually get the product at a discount relative to whatever it would cost on release.

It's not an "efficient" use of money, certainly, in the sense of being a lucrative financial investment that will provide you with some high ROI. Neither is, say, buying a beer, or a flower, or fancy underwear. It's a luxury purchase made for personal pleasure.
