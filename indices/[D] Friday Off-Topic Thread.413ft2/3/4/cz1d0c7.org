[[http://www.zincland.com/7drl/kobold/][Here]] is an example of a roguelike game with very weak but smart enemies. (They will try to stay out of reach of your melee attacks, deny you the chance to pick up ranged weapons, and retreat to return later as an overwhelming mob.) It also demonstrates how hugely frustrating this can be.
