  The main complaint is that it would be too hard

Too hard, or too frustrating. There's a reason why FPS enemies pop out of cover every now and then: firefights where you spend most of your time missing aren't much fun. This remains true even if the enemies are weak and fragile.

I too would like to see smarter game AI, but it's a difficult AI problem /and/ a difficult game design problem.
