On this regard I DO take effort in all my interactions with clerks to make myself a moment of sunshine in a very dreary, drudging and potentially terrible day. I work to make the exchange of a dining experience with wait staff and cooks enjoyable for both me and them.

I don't add extra burden to myself or them and instead strive to improve the exchange.

I genuinely thank them for service performed well even if it is simple and I meet their eyes and smile with sincerity.

I may never see them again and they may never remember that moment distinctly but I don't see why I should not try and lift the over all mood of their day a bit higher and reduce the total cost to them for being in the position to do service for me.

And like I said, it just seems like it actually costs me MORE to try and act things out as a 'fakery' but I also have very strong aversion and an almost pain to dishonesty.
