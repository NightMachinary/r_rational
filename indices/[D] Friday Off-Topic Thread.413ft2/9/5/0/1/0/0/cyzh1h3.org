I have no reason to care about some random person. What has he ever done for me? What will he ever do for me? He scans/has scanned/will scan my ID card so that I can get lunch. He could be replaced by some other random person, or by an automated card-scanner, and I certainly wouldn't care about his absence.

I might extend some genuine thanks to, say, a writer whose book I've enjoyed multiple times, or a person who gave detailed responses to questions posed by me--but I certainly can't bring myself to care about a random cafeteria worker, or a person who's "being nice" only because he feels it's socially necessary.
