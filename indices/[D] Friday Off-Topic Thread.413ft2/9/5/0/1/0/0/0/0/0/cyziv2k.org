  I don't expect a random person to care about me. Why should he? I'm just another customer out of the dozens or hundreds who will offer their ID cards to him during his time at the register. He has no reason to care about me.

Well, perhaps they care about all hundreds of those people, then? How are we defining "care" here? They won't take a bullet for you, but they'd probably do good by you if it's at sufficiently low cost to themselves. You could easily spin some evolutionary story as to why social animals will generally care for conspecifics, too, but it wouldn't be terribly robust on its own. Ultimately, I think this is an empirical question -- what proportion of humans care for strangers ("genuinely" or otherwise), and I'm sure someone's tried to collect some data on it before.
