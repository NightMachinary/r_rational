I don't think this perspective is terribly common here, though, at least insofar as there's heavy overlap with "effective altruism" and "improving the world" and such. Many people here bring themselves to care about people they've never met, who are thousands of miles away, look rather different from themselves, and speak an unfamiliar language. Some even care so much that they'll donate substantial amounts of money to various causes devoted to improving those strangers' lives, which is a lot more care than is needed to (effortlessly, imo) state "Have a good day!". And it's a lot harder to care about foreigners than it is to care about people right in front of you, too.

On a related note, are you actually, truly grateful when you say "thank you" in response to "Have a good day!"? And how do you know the person wishing you well is merely "pretending to care about you", and doesn't actually care about you, at least a little bit?
