Because we live in a society where people deny, ignore, and rationalize away any negative emotions in an attempt to pretend they don't exist. To remain sane, to not be reminded that they are inexorably being devoured by the cold void, that their skin is not rotting off their bones, that they aren't withering away with every passing day, that they will soon be confronted with the death of another life they cared for, that soon it will be their turn to face the abyss...

Or, y'know, it's polite. Take your pick.
