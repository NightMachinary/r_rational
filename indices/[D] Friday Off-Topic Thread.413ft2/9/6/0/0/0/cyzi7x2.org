Not magic, magical thinking. I mean as in thinking that the consequences of systems governed by physics can be influenced by thought. It's a form of confusing the map with the territory -- mistaking your internal model of reality for the real thing. It only takes a fraction of a second to make such a mistake, is obscenely easy to do, can be difficult to catch, and may subtly corrupt your ability to reason effectively.
