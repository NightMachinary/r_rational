  People just aren't as careful with their words as you seem to think; the literal words of the platitude are completely meaningless and without thought.

Valid. I may be committing typical mind fallacy here. I am probably more intentional than the average person I meet.

I suppose if the thought and intention is completely divorced from the literal or historical meaning, mine is mostly an aesthetic objection. I'm not completely convinced that is the case, but I am updating more in that direction.

Thanks.
