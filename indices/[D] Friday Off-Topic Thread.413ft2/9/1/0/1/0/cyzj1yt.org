  or is it that you think there's a measurable effect on our ability to speak accurately about the world in other instances when we refer to things like luck in everyday conversation?

Not only speak, but think. Think of this as training. If I can notice when I refer to a relatively harmless absurdity such as luck, and prevent myself from accepting that thought, allowing it to affect my reasoning, then I may be more able to do the same thing when it matters.
