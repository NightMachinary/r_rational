  Isn't "shut up and do the impossible" the most ridiculous of all the ones mentioned here?

Not suggesting to use it. It is misunderstood even by members of the community, as you are keen to demonstrate.

  Haphazardly continuing under slim chances just seems like a failure to perform basic risk--benefit analysis.

Sure, and wantonly dressing your argument with adverbs to skew perspective does not strengthen your argument. I was speaking of justified belief; i.e. - "I have reasoned logically and incorporated all evidence available to me to the best of my ability, and have come to this conclusion." That is not haphazard.

I'd like to make a deal with you. Can we try to understand each other, rather than trying to misunderstand and misrepresent? Seems more likely to be productive.
