  But you're telling someone else to persevere, not yourself. How do you know they've reasoned logically and incorporate all available evidence?

Ah. I wasn't so much imagining telling another person to perservere. Rather, using that, e.g., in place of "have a good day" with someone who shares my goal of defeating Death. I think that is very powerful, and can much more effectively fill the phatic purpose than the standard stuff.
