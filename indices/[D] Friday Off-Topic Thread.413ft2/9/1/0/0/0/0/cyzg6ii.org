Isn't "shut up and do the impossible" the most ridiculous of all the ones mentioned here? It's the only one that entails a contradiction, whereas "you can do it", interpreted as "it is possible that you will succeed" seems necessarily true, and stuff like "good day!" can vary depending upon common interpretations (and as a command, something like "have a good day" seems like a more cheerful "persevere", and if you squint can even approach something like "Amor fati!", as in "regard your day as good even if things don't go your way"). Haphazardly continuing under slim chances just seems like a failure to perform basic risk--benefit analysis.
