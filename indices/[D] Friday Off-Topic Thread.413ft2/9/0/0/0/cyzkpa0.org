It's not just the signaling, it's the lack of signaling.

If someone refuses to say good morning, even though they normally do, they are likely in a bad mood, and are signaling that they don't want to talk about it.

If they say it to everyone but you, they are likely mad /at you/, and are choosing the less rude route of not saying "good morning" (compared to the more direct "I have a problem with you"), while still getting the message across.
