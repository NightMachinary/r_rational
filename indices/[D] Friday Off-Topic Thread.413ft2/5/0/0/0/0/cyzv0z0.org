  That's what I was trying to convey in my first paragraph, sorry if I didn't do that well.

No, I got it. I was just responding to your question about self-training.

  Although with happiness in general, I feel like it's a commonly bandied-about fact that people tend to have a happiness "norm" that they always return to eventually, so ultimately it may not make that much of a difference.

That's true, but it's happiness per se is caused by a deviation from the norm, and whatever circumstances we are in eventually become the norm. There's no reason not to enjoy the happiness-boost while it's still available.
