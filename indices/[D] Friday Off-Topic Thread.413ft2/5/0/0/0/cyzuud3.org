That's what I was trying to convey in my first paragraph, sorry if I didn't do that well. My concern is it might be a short term gain for a long-term loss... Giving up small irrational happiness for a better position in life that ultimately is more satisfying.

Although with happiness in general, I feel like it's a commonly bandied-about fact that people tend to have a happiness "norm" that they always return to eventually, so ultimately it may not make that much of a difference.
