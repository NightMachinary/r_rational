  Is systematically trying to apply rationality down to the lowest level of your life necessary to help train good patterns into your System 1 reactions?

My response to this would be that rationality is the science of winning -- i.e., of achieving whatever your goals are, and determining what to do when goals conflict. Most of us have "be happy" as one of our goals; in this case, leaving the plastic on makes [[/u/Rhamni]] happy and almost certainly does not conflict with any other of his/her goals. To my mind, it would be irrational to /remove/ the plastic.
