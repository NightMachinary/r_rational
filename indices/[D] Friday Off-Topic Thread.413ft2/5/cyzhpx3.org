I bought a new laptop two weeks ago. I find myself unwilling to remove the see through plastic that covers the screen. Why? It /feels/ like it will keep the laptop new and sparkly longer. Here's the thing, though. It doesn't even cover the screen. Just the frame around it. So it does nothing at all. But I'm not taking it off.
