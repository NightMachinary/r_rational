  I'd like to make a deal with you. Can we try to understand each other, rather than trying to misunderstand and misrepresent? Seems more likely to be productive.
#+end_quote

Uh, sure!

#+begin_quote
  Not suggesting to use it. It is misunderstood even by members of the community, as you are keen to demonstrate.
#+end_quote

What does it mean, then?

#+begin_quote
  *im·pos·si·ble*

  /adjective/

  not able to occur, exist, or be done.
#+end_quote

"Do the impossible" seems pretty, well, impossible. At least magical psychic forces are, in principle, possible, if not terribly likely.

#+begin_quote
  "I have reasoned logically and incorporated all evidence available to me to the best of my ability, and have come to this conclusion."
#+end_quote

But you're telling someone else to persevere, not yourself. How do you know they've reasoned logically and incorporated all available evidence?

Sorry if my tone is off! I wasn't certain of my use of "haphazard" (it was nicer than my first inclination, "blindly" ;p).
