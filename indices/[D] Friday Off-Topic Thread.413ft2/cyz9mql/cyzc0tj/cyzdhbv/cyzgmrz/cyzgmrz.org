  We cannot influence reality with positive thoughts.

Well, of course we can. Not as in "The Secret", but rather as you say through the "mediating force" of behavioral modification. I can think a positive thought, which brightens my demeanor and makes others happier when I interact with them throughout the day. It might also improve my own productivity and, well, makes me happier. Those all seem like reality's being (indirectly, sure) influenced, insofar as a person shooting a gun can kill another person, rather than the bullet puncturing them or a lack of brain oxygenation or whatever. I don't think very many people are "invoking... psychic powers over reality" when they say "good luck"... or is it that you think there's a measurable effect on our ability to speak accurately about the world in other instances when we refer to things like luck in everyday conversation? Are you also opposed to using any and all figurative language, then, since it doesn't refer to things properly? What are the benefits of "epistemic hygiene"?
