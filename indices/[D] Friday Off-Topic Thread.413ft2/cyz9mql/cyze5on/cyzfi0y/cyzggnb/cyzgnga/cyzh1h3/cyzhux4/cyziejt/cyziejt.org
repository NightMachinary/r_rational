  Are you actually, truly grateful when you say "Thank you" in response to "Have a good day"?
#+end_quote

No--but, as I said previously, expressing fake appreciation for /another act of fake appreciation/ feels like a less-debasing lie than expressing fake appreciation for the person /himself./ (It's almost like applauding an actor for a performance, maybe...)

  How do you know the person wishing you well is merely "pretending to care about you", and doesn't actually care about you, at least a little bit?
#+end_quote

I don't expect a random person to care about me. Why should he? I'm just another customer out of the dozens or hundreds who will offer their ID cards to him during his time at the register. He has no reason to care about me.
