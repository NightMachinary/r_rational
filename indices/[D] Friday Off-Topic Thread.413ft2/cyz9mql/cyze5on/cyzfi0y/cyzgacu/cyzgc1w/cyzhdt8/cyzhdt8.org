Ah. Apologies. I would prefer that, actually. Most of my friends I've met in chance encounters. My girlfriend I actually met because in college our instructor randomly assigned us to a pair project. I think I could be friends with, and really truly care about most others I interact with (not just in the abstract), if only things turned out different, and perhaps they saw me in the library checking out their favorite book or something and we struck up conversation on the right day.

In practice it's kinda hard to maintain that perspective though, at least for me. If you have any ideas...
