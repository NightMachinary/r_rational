I understand you're a devout believer of a missionary faith, and you saw the opportunity to help someone with a problem, to which you have a solution that helps you. That's a wonderful sentiment, and should be rewarded, if only so that the behavior continues.

However, there are two points I'd like to raise that may prevent your help from being received with an open mind.

First, this

#+end_quote

says to the reader, "I follow /x/ religion, and this is how my religion handles your probelm." Most readers will keep reading with an open mind if they find your religion agreeable; if they don't, they will close off, and your help will be ignored. You introduce the entire body of your religion's ideology to the discussion, and will turn some readers away from your advice regardless of its merit.

Second, your closing statement, "It's not easy, but no one said living virtuously was easy," assumes common ground of wanting to live virtuously. The above context expands upon what you mean by virtue, e.g. that to live virtuously is to wish for others to become better, more virtuous people, and that becoming a more virtuous person may involve feeling emotional pain over committing wrongful acts.

That advice is wholly founded upon judgemental thinking, the basis of which comes from your belief system and its associated ethics. For someone with a different belief system or a different code of ethics, that advice falls on deaf ears.

To remedy those two issues, and increase the chances of you helping someone with their specific problem*, just give your advice without introducing the topics of religion or ethics. Following that guideline, your advice would look something like this:

  The trick is to be aware of what you're saying. When you say "Have a good day," think about their happiness from having a good day. If I'm having a hard time remaining compassionate and wanting them to have a good day, I remind myself that having a good day doesn't mean they get what they want, but what they need.
#+end_quote

I hope this advice was both helpful and respectfully presented.

*Granted, your main goal may have been to convert, which isn't a very nice thing to do if you're against unsolicited attempts at conversion yourself. If you're all for unsolicited attempts at converting you to religion or belief system /x/, I withdraw this objection.
