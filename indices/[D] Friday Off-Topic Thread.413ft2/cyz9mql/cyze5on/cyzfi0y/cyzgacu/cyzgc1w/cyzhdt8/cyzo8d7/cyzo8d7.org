I'm not who you're responding to, but I cultivate compassion through meditation and living according to the Buddhist Eightfold Path. The trick is to /be aware/ of what you're saying. When you say "Have a good day," think about their happiness from having a good day. If I'm having a hard time remaining compassionate and wanting them to have a good day, I remind myself that having a good day doesn't mean they get what they want, but what they need. A good day might be them feeling pain from a previous wrongful act they committed, leading them to reconsider their decisions.

It's not easy, but no one said living virtuously was easy.
