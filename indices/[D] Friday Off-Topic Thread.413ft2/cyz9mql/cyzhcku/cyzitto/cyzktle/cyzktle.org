I dunno... When someone sneezes, I say "Bleshu." This is a brand new word, divorced from its etymological ancestry "Bless you". It means nothing more than "I acknowledge that you have sneezed." I was saying "Bleshu" long before I ever heard of blessings or God, and I honestly think the structures in my brain encoding those concepts don't trigger each other at all.

I suspect that the vast majority of people use polite words like "Havagudday" the same way, which is why there are so many anecdotes of inappropriate "You too"s. People just aren't as careful with their words as you seem to think; the literal words of the platitude are completely meaningless and without thought. The only concept in their head is "(polite) Our interaction has concluded." Which may be a part of your point, actually...
