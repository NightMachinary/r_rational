When I say "Have a good day," that's short for "I hope that you have a good day," which is a simple statement of fact. I may or may not care enough to put forth much effort to make it happen, but I would in fact be (slightly) happier to learn that you had had a good day, than to learn that you had not. Isn't that all hope is? I don't understand your objection.
