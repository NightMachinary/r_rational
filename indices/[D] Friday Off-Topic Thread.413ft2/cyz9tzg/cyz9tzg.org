I got married recently! It was great! (and apologies if you've no idea who I am or care little enough for this news -- I'm still in the state of /tell everyone about it now!/ I will note, though, that I've been participating on-and-off in this forum for many years now under just as many SNs). Those curious about the relationship can read about it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/3na082/a_couple_years_ago_i_went_on_my_first_ever_okc/][here]] and about the wedding itself [[https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/3znag2/got_married_recently_had_a_small_ceremony_and/][here]].

I also got a [[https://i.imgur.com/xiRi6D4.png][DXA scan]] a couple weeks ago, too. If you're interested in having a somewhat more reliable and accurate measure of body composition or like lifelogging/quantified self type stuff I'd recommend it. I got mine done at a California facility for about $40 and it took <10 minutes for the scan itself. I made a slightly more in depth post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3ystjn/got_a_dxa_scan_23m_61_191_lbs_15_body_fat_some/][about it here]].
