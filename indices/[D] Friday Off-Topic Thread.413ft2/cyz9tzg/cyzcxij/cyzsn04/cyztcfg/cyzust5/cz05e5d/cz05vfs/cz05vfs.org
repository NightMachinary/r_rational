The link I posted on the divorce rate makes me think all our models are built under the assumption of high+rising divorce and a unipolar distribution. I don't even want to talk about trends anymore unless they're backed up by data and analysis, because 'marriage' and 'divorce' can already be broken up into more informative distributions and correlations. Too many confounders, not enough evidence, too much conjecture.
