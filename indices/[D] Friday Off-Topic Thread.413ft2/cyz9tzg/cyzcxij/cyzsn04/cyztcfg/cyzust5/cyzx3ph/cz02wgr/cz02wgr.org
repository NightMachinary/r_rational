You have not reconciled declining marriages with your hypothesis of easy divorces acting as a lower barrier of entry. With a lower barrier of entry, you would expect more marriages, not less. If marriage as a precommitment is supposed to act to prevent bad marriages, then how is a declining marriage rate /at all/ indicative of worse marriages? A /much simpler explanation/ is that people /are/ taking marriage more seriously because of the experiences and knowledge they have of the effects and apparent likelihood of divorce. The causal speed of divorce statistics on marriage is fairly immediate, while the causal speed of marriage on divorce statistics is after years of lag. You're contorting your assertions to avoid the evidence and you haven't given any evidence of your own.

The more I look at your justification of marriage as an ethical injunction, the more circular it seems to me.

- "Why is marriage valuable as a precommitment? Because the higher cost prevents divorces. Why are divorces undesirable? Because it damages marriage's value as a precommitment."
- "Why is easy divorce undesirable? Because it causes people to marry hastily. Why is the marriage hasty? Because the consequence of a hard divorce hasn't been properly considered. Why is the divorce hard? Because easy divorces are undesirable."

It's fine to admit you hold marriage as a terminal value. That's the simplest explanation I'm seeing for this disagreement.
