The value of marriage for society exists primarily in its status as a precommitment. The apparent benefits of dissolving any given marriage are outweighed by the damage done to the precommitment. Hasty marriages are a much more serious individual-level problem where hasty divorces are a much more serious society-level problem, and both feed each other. A society where divorce is easy (and common) will not take marriage seriously, and people will make the ill-advised decision to rush into marriage. People who rush into marriage are more likely to have a bad marriage that begs for an easy divorce, damaging society's views of marriage.
