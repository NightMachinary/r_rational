I have developed an aesthetic love for gabe the dog remixes. Where by clips of this one dog barking, snorting, howling and otherwise producing noise is adjusted in pitch and tempo to act as the instruments in musical covers.

I kind of want the same idea but with better range of original samples to help reduce the auto tune twaing.
