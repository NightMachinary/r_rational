What can I personally be doing to help the people of Flint right now? Lead exposure is an issue I care about a lot, but I'm unsure how to help most effectively. [[http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/13/us/iyw-flint-michigan-water-crisis-how-to-help/][CNN lists]] a couple of charities; but I've spend enough time adjacent to the EA community that I want to be sure I'm helping in the best way, even while I acknowledge that helping Flint is probably not the overall most effective possible use of my charity budget. Has anyone done enough research to advise?
