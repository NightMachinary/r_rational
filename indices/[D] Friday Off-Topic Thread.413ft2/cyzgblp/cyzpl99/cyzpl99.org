Crowdfunding is /not (primarily) a transaction/. It's a donation, or at most a grey area between a donation and a transaction if there are any "donor benefits" provided. If you choose to believe that the "donation" concept is just a pretense for what's actually a transaction, then sure, it's irrational, but at that point, you are bending over so far backwards to ignore the straightforward that Occam's Razor is angling to slit your throat.

And of fucking course smart people are going to seek out donations rather than investors if possible, because you don't need to pay anything back on donations.
