Crowdfunding makes the least amount of sense when you're thinking about return on investment.

It makes the /most/ sense when you think of it like a donation.

In the middle ground are those times when this logic:

#+begin_quote
  But why crowdfund them, just buy them on release.
#+end_quote

Fails completely because without crowdfunding they'll never secure the capital necessary to make it to release. So if you wait to buy them on release, you end up not buying them because the product never gets made.
