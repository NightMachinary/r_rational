Crowdfunding is a way to pool risk. Instead of a few people spending a lot of money, a lot of people spend very little money. Because of the way people treat risk and return, this allows riskier ventures to gain capital they need to succeed.

Crowdfunding is not 'lazy.' If you do not have a dedicated campaign, you will not succeed.
