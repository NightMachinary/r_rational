Well, you're initial comment did start off with 'Crowdfunding is stupid,' which certainly sounds like you're saying there's something explicitly stupid about it, but all of your points so far have shown is that you don't think that crowdfunding is worth your time and money.

So, I suppose a better way for me to have phrased my question is, what is it that makes crowdfunding /stupid/, rather than just something you're not personally interested in?
