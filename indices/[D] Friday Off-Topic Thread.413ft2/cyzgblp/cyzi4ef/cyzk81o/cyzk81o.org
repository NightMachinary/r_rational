This is exactly the problem. Financing isn't impossible. Loans, mortgages, savings. All of these modes involve risk and actual cost. If a person was really super interested in making and selling something, capital isn't impossible to find.

Crowd funding is just the lazy approach. With the added benefit of it being perceived as a donation. And the presentation in a way that convinces the viewer that, yes, I'm making this for you.
