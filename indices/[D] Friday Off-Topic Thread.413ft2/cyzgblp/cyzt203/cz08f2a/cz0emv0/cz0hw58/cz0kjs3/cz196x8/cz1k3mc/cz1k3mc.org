  When I mentioned risk in the op, I was referring to risk in this context. Not the risk that the product promised wouldn't be delivered.

That's pretty much what risk capital /is/ -- the possibility that you will pay money to obtain something (i.e. investment returns) and that thing will not be delivered.

Anyway, pedantry aside -- has this helped you be more comfortable with Kickstarter? Or, at least, to object less to the idea of other people using it?
