The point I viewed is that it's essentially a pre-purchase with a risk. The point is not to invest, the point is to get the thing made.

The return is not the funds, the return is the product/service you want to exist in the first place.

It's not really the same model.

Crowdfunding has more in common with building a cathedral or a community work then with investment in a company for a return on investment.
