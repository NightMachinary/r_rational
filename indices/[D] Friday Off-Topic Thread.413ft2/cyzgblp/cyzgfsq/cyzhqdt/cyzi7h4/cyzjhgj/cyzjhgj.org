It doesn't stop with delivering that one watch or headset. It generates revenues for several years on. Just because guaranteeing a portion of the proceeds is complicated does not mean it can't or shouldn't be done. In essence as another commenter mentioned it's perceived as a donation when it should be perceived as capital. I don't think it's long before a kickstarter that capitalizes (heh) on this launches and that will change crowdfunding forever.
