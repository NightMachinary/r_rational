Some kickstarters have returned on my initial investment beyond the promised rewards. the game Planetary Annihilation got funds from me for exploring a game concept space I'd wanted as a child.

Years later they have not only given me that game but given me ANOTHER game that they produced in that series.

It's not like their paying me actual funding dividends but there are continual returns that can happen.

This does not always happen of course.
