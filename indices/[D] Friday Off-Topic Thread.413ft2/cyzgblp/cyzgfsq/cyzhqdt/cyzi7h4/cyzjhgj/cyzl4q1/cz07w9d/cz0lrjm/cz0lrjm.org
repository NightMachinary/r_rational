For me the view of your basis for how it should be is actually quite admirable. But it suggests to me there are worse things in the world by far that are failing their ethical obligations.

For example I'd suggest looking hard at uber and other app driven "employment by another name" systems.

Also do you have an upper limit on your view of the connection of money to the nature of its acquisition? Your suggestion sounds to me like you might have a higher number of steps of transaction regarding money then most people think about.
