On crowdfunding, or any question where things in the economy are proceding in a non-intuitive manner, I tend to look for what restrictions are in place that prevent more intuitive behavior.

In the case of crowdfunding, what prevents a person from raising capital through traditional stock offers with returns, rather than the crowdfunding method.

The short answer is government regulations. SEC filings for a public stock offering requires significant capital outlays for lawyers and regulatory compliance paperwork. Crowdfunding requires an idea, an internet connection, and a little bit of marketing savvy.

While SEC regulations on IPO's purportedly exist to prevent fraud, they have the unintended side effect of restricting legitimate, if under-capitalized, entrepreneurs from entering the space.
