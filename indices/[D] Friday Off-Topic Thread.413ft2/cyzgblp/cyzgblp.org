CMV: Crowdfunding is stupid.

Why do people crowdfund things? It is the most inefficient use of your money. You're handing over risk-free, costless capital to someone else over nothing more than a flashy video.

Look at the Oculus Rift backers, they essentially purchased shares in the company which would have been quite the amount after the Facebook acquisition. Instead all they got was a 600$ headset. Look at Pebble, they now have a product line and probably turn a good profit too. Only because a few people were dumb enough to give them free money at a return of 0%. The failure that Ouya was would not have been tolerated if again it wasn't disposable capital.

There are successes too like Pillars of Eternity, or Star Citizen. But why crowdfund them, just buy them on release. Invest your money in places that actually give you good return.
