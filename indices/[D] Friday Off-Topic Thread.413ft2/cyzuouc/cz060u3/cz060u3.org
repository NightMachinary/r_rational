I'll continue to gradually invest money in the market as I always do. If things are bad, that means my money buys more stocks per dollar. If things are going permanently bad in some kind of "revolution" style way, things will be chaotic enough it's not like I'll be able to outmaneuver the market. I have valuable skills so no matter what I'll make it. In a situation where computer programming is no longer useful, things are bad enough there's no real way to prepare. I'm certainly not digging a bomb shelter and buying canned food.

If we have another Great Depression or something like the subprime mortgage crisis, I think gradually investing money into the market will continue to be the right strategy.
