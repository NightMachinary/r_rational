Anyone want to talk about this market action? Traditional markets or bitcoin?

Worst start to a year for US indices ever. China's growth is slowing. Recession looms in many countries. Oil is below $30 now. Bond rates are negative for many places. Interest rates are negative in some places.

To me it seems like the economic game is breaking.
