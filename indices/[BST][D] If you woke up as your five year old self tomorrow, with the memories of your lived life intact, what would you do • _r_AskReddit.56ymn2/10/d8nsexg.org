I would first be very weirded out and it would take me a few days to adjust and to really accept that it was happening to me.

The first and biggest change I would make is to slowly ramp up my general competence and ability. I had mental issues as a child and was almost classified as mentally retarded (then in high school was classified as 'genius' go figure!). So my education and life would improve if I could make myself appear as a very smart child early on. Then I would study and review everything I need to know to pass high school courses.

I would insist on certain surgeries for a medical condition I have. First time around I got it in late teens and I believe it would be so much better to get it as early as possible and it would be relatively easy to convince my family.

Convince my mother to not date that guy. He's a jerk and it'd be easy to prove it with foreknowledge.

Start participation in some sports like running, swimming, or martial arts so I can develop good exercise habits early on. Probably learn a foreign language and music. Get myself classified as a prodigy and attending college level courses at a very young age. Where I live is well placed for me to attend courses at a nearby university.

With some academic credentials under my belt, it'll be much easier for me to publish about future research. During the years it would take for me to get through college, I'd be working on code for Facebook and attempt to use it for my university like Zuckberg did for Harvard. Since I was sent back in time to 2000, I'd have 4 years to do it. I'd invest into stock markets concerning companies I know will do well.

Once I have a hefty chunk of money and used some of it to help out my family, I'd go into space research and fund organizations like MIRI and Khan Academy.
