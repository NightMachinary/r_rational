Step 1 -- grow up, while vastly improving my parents life because I know how certain things will turn out for them.

Step 2 -- corner the stock market. I remember fairly closely how it's gone over the last fifteen to twenty years. Buying massively into the tech bubble with heavy use of margin and loans, then remembering when exactly Greenspan crushed the market and going way, way past fully invested in short positions in all those stocks that went from two or three hundred down to one or two dollars a share. I figure I could easily a couple hundred million dollars, and might even make it into the billions.

Step 3 -- corner the housing bubble (which happened when Greenspan got everyone to stop investing in the tech bubble which was producing some actual value by providing money for pie in the sky research and increased productivity and instead made all that money go into homebuilding which did no good for anyone except speculators). Then short the subprime mortgage market using derivatives. If I haven't made it into the billions yet, I will here.

Step 4 -- I know magic exists. Research it using my now vast resources. Figure out how it works enough to use it for immortality research.

Step 5 -- live forever.

Step 6 -- increase my own intelligence.

Step 7 -- go foom.

Why would anyone want to play the Loto with all its attendant problems and likely butterfly effects when they can use future knowledge to basically print unlimited money from the financial markets? I may be wrong, but I can easily imagine one Loto win changing the numbers of all future Loto winners after that, while my feeling is that the financial markets are far more robust and likely to follow one's future memories even after one has made substantial changes to one's personal timeline.
