Hm. I'm pretty boring, to be honest. I know apple jumps something like 1000% from shortly before I get out of high school to around now. So I can use that if I decide to.

I'd be interested to see if I get the benefits of young brain meats. If so, languages and instruments would be fun to pick up.

Other than that, I'd be pretty content to just use my natural mental advantage over my peers to do well in school. Probably make some show of getting really into books and old text books we had in the garage when I was a kid.

What's the IQ of a near 30 year old college educated individual in a 5 year old? Without going out of your way to show off, what kind of placement do they do with you just by acing everything they put in front of you?

I dunno, but I'd find out.
