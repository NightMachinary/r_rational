If tomorrow's date is 2016, another possibility is just to go public, especially if you have a way to prove your identity (fingerprints, retinal scans, signatures, maybe genetic tests). (And if your job depends on being physically adult, try to force your insurance to treat you as having a disabling condition that takes 10 or so years to heal.)

Also, if you do change your identity, do you want to claim to be the child of your old identity? (DNA tests would certainly show a similarity, but some tests may show you as too similar.)
