Become an art savant, convince parents to purchase me a computer and tbalet as early as possible. Draw in class by day, learn programming/accumulate funds through comissions. Learn my favorite language. I don't want everything to be the same as last time, so tip off the US government about 9/11.

Make art tutorials on youtube since day one, wait for my channel to become huge, spend proceeds on securing a lifestyle, funding projects, and try to make it in with those that i look up to now.
