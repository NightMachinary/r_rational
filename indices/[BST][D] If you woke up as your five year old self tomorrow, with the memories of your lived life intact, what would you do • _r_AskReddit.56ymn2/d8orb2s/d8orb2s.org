I am actually doing this as my nanowrimo this year, so I have thought about it :-)

I am 50 years old, so I would first of all throw a huge temper tantrum about not having the internet or a mobile phone or even more than three TV channels for aaaages.

Then I would settle down and try to enjoy my childhood until I had more clue what was going on. You can get away with a lot as a kid so I'd ask everyone I met if they would remember being older. I'd try to act like a child, more or less, but I would let myself be good at school so I got a chance of a better school. I'd save most of my pocket money, clean my teeth religiously and eat as healthily as I could. I would try to be better at making friends and keeping fit (maybe if I could hate PE less I'd make more friends). Try to persuade my granddad to bet on Red Rum in the Grand National. He'd probably do it, even though he'd put the money in a crappy savings account for me.

I would assume the lottery numbers would be different, and couldn't invest in shares till later, but I'd invest some of that pocket money in things like comic books which I would store very carefully.

I'd have really difficulty deciding whether to tip the police off about murderers, or Jimmy Saville, or major bombings. I'd be very wary of being implicated or investigated myself, but I would probably try.
