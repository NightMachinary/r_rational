Gotcha, sounds like you likely have a better understanding of some older languages than me - I primarily do Web development, and with every new framework I end up learning, I shudder in horror to imagine going back to not having it. Going without Spring in Java, Ruby on Rails, Node, Jquery and Angular in js (or the heavy js dependence before Google's chrome engine is released) all sound incredibly frustrating to me, as would the speed and memory limitations that modern computers have afforded me the ability to ignore.

I imagine the real benefit I'd be able to retain is the semi- standardization of database design as it currently exists and the familiarity with highly efficient querying that I've done learned to do.
