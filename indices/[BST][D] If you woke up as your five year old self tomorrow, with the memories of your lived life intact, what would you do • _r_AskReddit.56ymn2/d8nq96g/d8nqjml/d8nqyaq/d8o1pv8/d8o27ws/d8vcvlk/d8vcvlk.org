Out of curiosity (and you are free to not answer this if it's too personal): how would you feel if your partner was in an accident that made her forget a year's worth of memories? Say this past year, for example? Would she still be close enough to the woman you love to want to stay, as there'd only be a single missing year?

I ask because I feel your issue with the scenario is a matter of degree more than anything else, and am curious as if that's the case. Again, I stress that you don't need to answer if you feel like I'm prying.
