I'd launch into wholesale laundering of ideas. There are so many academic and business ideas that would be easy to turn into massive success. Off the top of my head:

- PageRank
- Social networking websites
- distributed version control
- cloud computing
- Airbnb
- Uber
- Adwords
- high frequency trading
- Wikipedia
- Bayesian spam filtering

While the specifics of world politics and the economy would be inevitably contaminated by the butterfly effect, foreknowledge of some of the broad economic shifts that have taken place would almost certainly make you tremendously rich and allow you to accelerate the world's technological progress by a couple years. I think the hardest part would be the early years of trying to be taken seriously and accumulate capital when you're only five years old, and just waiting for Moore's Law to make certain technologies possible.
