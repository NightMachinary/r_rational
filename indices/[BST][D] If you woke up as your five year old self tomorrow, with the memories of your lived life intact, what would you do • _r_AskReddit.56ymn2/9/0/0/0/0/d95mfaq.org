It'd definitely be tough, especially as a five year old! I think your best luck might be using an x86 port of something like Common Lisp or Smalltalk that was a higher-level language at the time, even if it had quirks that led to issues down the line. My dad was an electrical engineer at Symbolics in the 80s, so I would have had a personal connection to the Lisp community in 1990.
