How difficult do you think it would be for you to write software that far back in what is most likely (based on what you've described) a much more primitive language than the higher order languages you're currently used to?

Even just thinking about developing a modern website without bootstrap and jquery (or angular or whatever framework of choice you use today) or any existing MVC frameworks in whatever languages you do know sounds extremely frustrating to me, and while I could likely implement rudimentary versions of each of those libraries/frameworks just from the sheer hours and years I've spent working with them, I'd be significantly less confident in the final outcome than anything I use today.
