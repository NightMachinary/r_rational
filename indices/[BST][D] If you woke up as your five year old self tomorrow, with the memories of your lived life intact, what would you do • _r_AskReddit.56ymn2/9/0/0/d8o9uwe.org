I've spent several hundred hours of software engineering time on unsuccessful side projects that were intended to become startups, so I'm aware that there's an enormous chasm between a "good idea" and an actual thriving company. But I've also had a lot of professional experience in software engineering and finance, have read a lot of academic CS papers, and am reasonably persistent. My parents even knew several active angel investors quite well when I was 5. Beyond just having certain knowledge that an idea could work, I'd be the beneficiary of knowing exactly how certain product decisions should be made. Lots of iteration and testing and market selection went into the final design of any of these sites. There's also 25 years of improvement in software engineering knowledge to draw from -- stuff like A/B testing, MapReduce, eventually consistent databases, etc.

Could a random member of the public turn a "good idea" into a successful business? Probably not. Can a smart specialist make a large impact in their specialty? Absolutely.
