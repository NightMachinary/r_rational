"What a wonderful home you have, Sharon!"

"Thank you, Mary. We just remodeled, actually."

"It's fabulous. Oh, and is that young Eohail playing in the corner? Why does she seem to have an IV cart next to her. Surely she's not...?"

"Oh, no, nothing like that!" Sharon laughs and swats Mary's shoulder. "She's just been possessed by a demon from Wall Street. Refuses to have single bite off her plate unless we make fool investments."

"Hmph! I swear, you tell them no, they'll just die and come back to solicit you some more!"

"Worst thing about it is a boy from my high school died recently. I think he was an investment broker. Always had a huge crush on me. Sweet, really, when he's not possessing my baby girl and making eyes at me. I'd feel awful if we just exorcised him."

"And because of Eohail you can't just..."

"Mary! How dare you, you naughty girl! Eric would have an episode if he ever found out!"

Mary raises an eyebrow at Sharon.

"... But, yes, also... Eohail might remember."
