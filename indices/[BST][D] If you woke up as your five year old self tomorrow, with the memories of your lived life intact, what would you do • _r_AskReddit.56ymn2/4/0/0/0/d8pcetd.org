Probably just the suggestion that time travel isn't an automatic "I win", but there isn't really a fleshed out conflict yet. A struggling time traveller without too much useful foreknowledge sounds like a good hook.

I think what I liked the most about it is the lack of explicit backstory despite the /in media res/ beginning. Being trusted to work it out without being beaten over the head with explainers felt nice.
