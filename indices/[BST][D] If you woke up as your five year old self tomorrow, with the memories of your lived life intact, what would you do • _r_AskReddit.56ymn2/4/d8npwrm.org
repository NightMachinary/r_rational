Werter knocks on his brother's door.

"Wilhelm?" he asks, opening the door.

"What is it?"

"I need to talk to you about something serious."

Wilhelm glances at Werter standing in the door frame. "I need to finish my homework," he says, and turns back to his books and papers sprawled across his bed.

"Are you almost done?"

"Come back in an hour or so."

"But we have dinner shortly thereafter, and this is not a conversation I should like to be disturbed."

Wilhelm pauses in his notetaking and considers his little brother, standing with a smirk in his room's doorway.

"Did Wulfric tell you to say that?"

"違うよ。ただ真面目な話がしたいんだけだ。/I wonder if you understood that./"

Wilhelm gapes at his little brother, who enters the room and closes the door behind him.

"How much of that did you pick up?"

"It takes a moment to switch. Just the end."

"You'd agree though that I'm fluent in both this and Japanese, which should be impossible for your five year old little brother?"

"Unless Wulfric has spent the past few weeks teaching you this to prank me."

"/Wulfric can speak/日常/conversation, but/彼の/ability/が/this level/とは懸け離れているんだ。お前/also that, right?/ How much of that did you pick up, Wilhelm?"

"Wulfric can speak conversationally but his level is something?"

"His level doesn't compare to mine, and neither does yours."

Wilhelm stares at Werter, eyes unfocused.

"/Brother/, it's impossible for me, a five-year-old, to suddenly become this proficient in two languages. Something strange that you can't explain is going on. Do you agree with that much?"

Wilhelm thinks it over, then nods.

"And you're right, it is impossible. Because I'm not your five year old brother Werter. I'm your thirty five year old brother Werter.

"Have you ever told me how you met your best friend, Erik?"

"I don't know. No."

"You bonded over sharing darknet URLs while riding the bus. You taught him the URL for a site about video game easter eggs. Also, you already have a car parked down the road but haven't told anyone in the family about it as you bought it with funds earned illicitly on the web."

Werter climbs into the chair by the computer desk while Wilhelm processes.

"Do you believe me?"

"I don't disbelieve you."

"That's good enough for now, because Father is cheating on Mother right now, and if he doesn't stop Mother will find out a year from now. The resulting divorce will render our family poor and ruin Wulfric's life. Once you believe me we can bring him and Wulfric in. In the meantime, you need to figure out how to convince Father to invest in some stocks I know are going to boom shortly."

"What about lottery numbers and sports outcomes?"

"Never paid attention much to either, so I don't remember with enough reliability to place bets. Pete Sampras will do something unprecedented in Tennis. Most Championships, I think. Don't know if you can bet on that. I don't know if he's active, yet."

"What did you do with your life? Can you do something with that?"

"Oh! I was a liberal arts professor. Maybe I can write a bestselling novel series I remember. But I don't remember the writing style, and that's what made it sell so well."

"Sure. I still am confused about what I should believe, Werter, but at this moment I'm certain that you're useless as a time traveler if somehow you are telling the truth."

"I know when wars start and stock bubbles end!"

"How do they start and when do they end?"

"Not sure and at least a decade from now."

"/Useless./"

"/I know. That's why I need help from my brother./"
