The first thing I'd do is convince my parents that I had knowledge of the future. It wouldn't be that hard to do, and I'm pretty sure I could convince them to more or less keep this information to themselves.

From there I'd look out for any publicly traded companies that I know are going to become huge. This would be right around the time of the Internet boom, so we'd have some choices of where to invest.

I don't think I'd do anything like trying to prevent 9/11 or any other major tragedies, since I don't like the spotlight and I don't think such knowledge of the future would be that big of an advantage.

I mean I can prevent a few deaths, assuming anyone takes me seriously, but the more you directly change things, the less accurate your future knowledge is going to be. And in the grand scheme of things, even preventing something as big as 9/11 probably won't have long lasting positive impact on the world. Though maybe that's just the pessimist in me speaking.

So after making a boatload of cash with my family, I think I'd probably change the direction I took in life a bit. Focus more on different areas of education and try to pick up different skills.

For the vast majority of the world, me being sent back in time would have pretty much no effect on their lives. For me personally, I'd be richer... and have an awkward relationship with my family since I know some things about how their futures turned out that they themselves wouldn't know.

Edit: I have a feeling that my future knowledge would probably lead to some of my younger family members not being born. That would be kinda sad...
