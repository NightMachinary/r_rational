(I have a very hard time not allowing myself to bring a laptop whenever I think about this scenario, just because I don't want to lose all of the data I've accumulated over the past 20 years.)

In no particular order, I'd probably:

- Cry, because friends are hard enough already.
- Try to come to a decision whether or not to intervene in my parents' failed business attempt. Sure, it was a financial setback and my dad had to file bankrupsy, but they've rebounded just fine and honestly I wouldn't mind getting to hang out at the store(s) again. Assuming I didn't butterfly this out of happening by accident.
- I kinda see anxiety issues being the primary source of conflict. Sure, I could walk into the kitchen at breakfast and start speaking prophecies in French, but I'd probably chicken out when it comes to anything important... and if I wouldn't, my parents would probably take considerable convincing to let me try anything "dangerous", such as tinkering with electronics or exploring the neighborhood or ... exploring the front yard. I have no idea how to work these out (whether for myself or others) other than exposure therapy, which I'm not sure how I'd implement (I don't think my parents waking up to find me making pancakes blindfolded would help, in spite of being exposure to something scary). Advantage, though... being five would make just /asking/ to do these things less awkward. Having the asking turn into opportunity, on the other hand...
- I can't get very far in this sort of scenario without thinking I'd eventually walk into the school counselor's office and start rambling about the situation. But I dunno.
- I'd like to start working on lower-level programming ASAP. This would be difficult because I have no idea how I'd manage to read anything on computer screens before 1995.
- Also, I'd try to find some way to work on my print reading speed. I am apparently /extremely/ lucky to have been taught braille starting in kindergarten, and it'd be woefully impractical for me to use large print for much of anything even with the vision I had at 5, but I'm pretty sure I should be able to read sufficiently large print faster than I could the last time I had sufficient vision. I don't know if this would really be that useful, but it'd let me watch subtitled anime, if nothing else. (Also, prevent the loss of my remaining vision. This seems trivial, given how it happened and what I've learned about the condition, but I suppose I'll have to mentally timetravel to find out.)
- All the things I still keep wanting to do but never get around to. I would desperately hope that being back in elementary school would help more than hurt most of these. EX, I can use Science Fair as an excuse to build cool things, I'd have easier opportunities for getting in contact with useful people (to an extent), I wouldn't have to worry about whether or not DHS would pay for assistive technology, obtaining useful books would ... you know, never mind about the books; I tried that one in the original timeline and failed.
- The easiest stock hints I know of come around the .com bubble, which is also around the time my parents filed bankrupsy. Does this pose as big an obstacle as I'm afraid it does?
- Speaking of money, I need to start earning it PDQ. I want to do things whose costs (even the cheap ones) would have nasty down-the-road consequences if I just rely on family for it all. I am not entirely sure how I'd go about doing this at 5, as I suspect wandering down the streets with a harmonica to be an inefficient use of my street-wandering opportunities. The easiest way would just be doing more work around the house, but that would be paid by my parents, vacating the point. Naturally, I'd invest whenever possible, according to future knowledge.
- I suspect that, given the rare opportunity to experience both pubescent and prepubescent form and make an informed choice between the two, I'd be strongly tempted to find a way to dodge puberty II. (Especially if I get to bring a laptop back with all of my voice recordings from this timeline.) This would be difficult to accomplish and more difficult to do right. (Note to self: add "do lots and lots of endocrinology research" to the list.)
- I have no idea what to do about tragic things that will happen without my interference but I don't like the idea of not preventing deaths I could have prevented. I mean, there was a school shooting in my town and I know the names dates ages and plenty of people who were there and could act as my proxy if I couldn't intervene personally or convince the police I'm not pulling a very bad-tasting prank. I don't have the details of 9/11 memorized and preventing it would be such a huge divergence that my future knowledge would become useless on 9/12/2001, and I have no idea whether a post-9/11 world is worse than a no-9/11 world.
