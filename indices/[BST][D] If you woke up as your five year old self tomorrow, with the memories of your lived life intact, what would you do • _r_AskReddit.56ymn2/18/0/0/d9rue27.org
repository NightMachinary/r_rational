I tried something like that at one point, and didn't feel like it worked very well. No better than my glasses, anyway, which didn't work well with the sorts of fonts I'd be working with.

I think there were hardware speech synthesizers for MSDOS at the time, but I don't know anything about them and wouldn't know how to go about researching them were I in the past having not already done so.

(And they were probably expensive, because everything like that is expensive.)
