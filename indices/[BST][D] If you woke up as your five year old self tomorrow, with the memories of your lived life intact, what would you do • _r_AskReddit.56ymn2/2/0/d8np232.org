I wonder about the ethical implications of creating Minecraft or a clone of any other video game/work of art that you know will be popular.

It's plagiarism of a sort, but only you will know that it's plagiarism. And it's even possible that the person you're stealing the idea from will not have even thought of it at the time that you begin to make the game.

There's also the possibility that your version of the game/book/movie or whatever is either worse quality than the original, or perhaps you're just not in the right position to promote it well enough to make money off of it.

Then at that point you've effectively exposed the idea to the world that would have been profitable for someone else and maybe influential to future works. And it's possible that the person who would have originally had the idea will be discouraged by your failure or even success.

Though I don't think this would be the end of the world, I think it's possible you can have a negative impact doing things like that.
