I don't think you can make that assumption.

Brains are complex, but that doesn't mean they are that volatile. It is possible that the changes you have on reality are small enough that they never significantly affect Notch to the point where the idea doesn't occur to him.

Especially if neither you or anyone you know comes into direct contact with him.

I think it's impossible to know how likely the changes you make will affect any particular outcome unless you deliberately set out to change those outcomes.

I'm not saying that the butterfly effect isn't a serious concern. I'm just saying that it's unpredictable. You can't say "This is more likely to happen" or this "Isn't likely to happen" when you have no idea what caused those things to happen in the first place. You don't have enough information to make those predictions accurately.
