1) I agree that his success may in part be contributed to luck, but it's a hard argument to make that he doesn't lose a lot. Yes there is a vast difference between making someone homeless and not giving them millions of dollars. But I don't think this point really adds anything to the discussion. The fact of the matter is that you know that so long as you don't change reality significantly Notch is going to gain millions. And you're making a deliberate effort to gain those millions for yourself, utilizing his ideas/methods.

2) It's possible that you could make a little money and still leave room for Notch to make his money... but I think it would be incredibly hard to actually plan to do that. Especially since seeing your game come to market might discourage Notch from creating his game in the first place. And if your game comes out first the brand recognition you gain may be more important in the long run than the quality of the game itself. Things might work out the way you described, but I don't see any way for you to be reasonably sure that they actually will turn out that way.

3) This point is your strongest point. If you actually believe the good you can do with the money is significantly greater than the good Notch has demonstratedly done with his money, then maybe you do have a point.

Though I would argue that all your other methods of gaining money in your original post are probably sufficient that you don't NEED to go through with this plan in the first place. But if for some reason whatever altruistic plan you have cooking requires more capital than the other ideas/investments can provide, then I say you're justified in going through with this, knowing that there's at least a chance that you're significantly altering someone else's life for the worse, for the sake of potentially improving many other people's lives.

As for your attempt to reconcile: that's better than nothing I suppose. But I'm sure if you gave the people at Majong the choice between already having created a widely successful game and an investment towards making a potentially successful game, they would choose the former.

So I say, sure you're justified in doing this if you intend to use the money for The Greater Goodâ„¢ and you have no other less morally ambiguous way to gain the money. But if those conditions don't apply I don't think this is a particularly moral plan.
