OK, I'm going to try to cut in here because you both are making good points, but I just don't think you're managing to understand each other properly and that hurts my soul.

I think what Fresh is trying to say is that, in one time line, Notch had an idea. That idea went big, and made him millions. You had the luxury of watching Notch do this, and realising that 'hey, that's a good idea! I should do that.'

Then you go back in time, to before Notch had the idea, and do it yourself. That, however, does not change the fact that you got the idea from Notch. Notch is still the originator of the idea, as far as your personal timeline is concerned. Fresh considers going back in time and using the idea in this way stealing, as the idea is not yours, and you are essentially preventing the originator of the idea (Notch), from coming up with it themselves in this new time line you've created.

To give a different example, I could go back in time and, with my current understanding of physics, biology, and chemistry, replace every major scientific figure in history with myself. Would that be right? From Fresh's point of view, the answer is no. Because I did not come up with any of those theories or machines myself. I did not put in any creative work to generating the concepts. Instead I looked at the finished work, the 'ideas' we are taught in school, and then put them forward as my own creative/analytical products in a time line to young to know any different. Even if I brought back an equation, I would still have to do the work of deriving and proving it (similar to how you would have to do the work of actually building Minecraft). But at the same time, the original idea, the first insight, did not belong to me, and now I am preventing the originator from having those ideas and insights themselves; mental events that may have been integral to their appreciation of their lives and sense of self worth. I am 'stealing' their place in history.

In your new timeline, Notch fades into the background, and never gets known as the guy who made Minecraft. My example is more extreme, as it is doing the same thing to the likes of Einstein, Marie Curie, and Tesla, but still the same concept, and it is the concept that is bothering Fresh.

Of course, you may have understood this perfectly and this post might be useless, but I actually saw a discussion like this explode into a shouting match today and just had to write this post.
