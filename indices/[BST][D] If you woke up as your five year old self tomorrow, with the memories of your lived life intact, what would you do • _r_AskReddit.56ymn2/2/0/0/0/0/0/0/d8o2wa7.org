  you have no other less morally ambiguous way to gain the money.

I find it difficult to conceive of my plan as morally wrong or even ambiguous. I'm not stealing any code they wrote from the future, merely the idea. Secondly, they haven't thought of the idea or even considered it yet in the time frame I'm planning on making the game.

I just don't think that 1) my plan deprives Notch of potential success, or 2) that even if it did, depriving someone of an opportunity they never knew they had (or even planned on) is wrong/morally ambiguous. My goal in this case is not to have minimal impact on others, but rather have maximal impact.

Is betting on the stock market less ambiguous than this? How?
