Assuming going back in time.

I wouldn't want to overwhelm myself with too many things to focus on in case I forget, so I would probably have a minor plan in a notebook somewhere that I could review every once in a while. As a kid I kept a couple of journals that are still around today.

Throughout grade school and Highschool, I would do my best to act my age, and try /not/ to excel. I don't want more attention than I already received. If my parents thought I was brilliant, I would have had much less autonomy. My goal would be to go at this from the down low until I could build up a sizeable amount of cash (500 million dollars, no less)

Some things would change by virtue of past experience. I would stop watching tv long before I did as a kid. I would probably get into drawing a lot more to make up for the (lack of) tv time. I don't want to be a perfect kid in school- my older sibling made all A's and had all the parental attention whereas I had Bs and Cs and didn't get half as much focus about grades, so I would get all A's in math and purposefully not do well in English classes.

I would find more creative ways to get away from the house until 14 or so. Around that time I bought my first PC which is where things would be getting a little different. In order not to attract attention, I would still do mostly the same stuff I did as an x-year old until I was 17 and Bitcoin came around. I sell out on my first million from BTC and look to reinvest elsewhere.

While I am 14, I would start programming for real, dropping World of Warcraft, etc. Eventually, I would make my own version of Minecraft for the PC. The game wasn't getting worked on until Zachtronics released Infiniminer in 2009 or so- I would have approximately 3 years as a highschool student to get it working... Of course, I would probably do .75 meters per block instead of 1 meter per block.

I believe at 16 brokers will let you open a stock account and actually invest (with parental permission of course) in companies. When it comes to stocks, my idea is to purchase and short only a couple of times, as I want minimal influence on the market. This was a major conversation in my family as the housing bubble was about to burst and many stocks were sky high. By this time Apple had already boomed, so I would purchase Facebook, Tesla, and Netflix stocks until Oculus is formed. My big play would be to (at 21 or so) invest a million or so into it and let Facebook buy me out. By this point, I have several hundred million, if not a billion dollars by selling Oculus and Minecraft. With that money, I would set aside approximately 5 million dollars as liquid every 4 years or so for living and pet projects. That's my exit point.

From there (my current age or so) I would be putting one million dollars every year towards eczema and arthritis research- two diseases which I think are currently under-researched for effective cures. An additional million would be set aside for pet projects. Having sold the game studio I created around Minecraft, and becoming a rather big name in gaming I would hire a bunch of game devs and fund pet projects that interest me.

I have no desire to influence national politics in any way, there's just too much money too high up for me to care, although I may get involved in local politics to help my town not be a craphole.
