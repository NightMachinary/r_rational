There is an actual story with that kind of premise. Main character goes to an alternate earth, but the earth has slightly different culture, missing alot of our world's shows, books and poems. Main character has the dream of becoming famous, so in this new world, uses our worlds literature and shows in a bid to fame. It's not by any means rational, and ethnical implications are never mentioned, but i enjoy it alot as it's a fun read.

It has 342 chapters or so out so far, with each chapter about 2k words and at least one new chapter every day.

Sypnopsis: Zhang Ye, whose only goal was to become a celebrity, had tunneled to a brand new Earth that was different.

At the radio station, during the host hiring interview:

A loud voice narrated, “Up above the sea's grey flatland, wind is gathering the clouds. In between the sea and clouds proudly soars the Petrel, reminiscent of black lightning. Glancing a wave with his wingtip, like an arrow dashing cloudward, he cries out and the clouds hear his joy in the bird's cry of courage. In this cry--thirst for the tempest!”

However, the interviewers of this world that had never heard of Gorky's “The Song of the Stormy Petrel” and were so shocked that they stared with their mouths agape!

The story begins from here.
