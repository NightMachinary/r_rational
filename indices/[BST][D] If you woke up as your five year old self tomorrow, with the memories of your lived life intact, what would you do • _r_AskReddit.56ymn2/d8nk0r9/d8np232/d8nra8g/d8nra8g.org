  I wonder about the ethical implications of creating Minecraft or a clone of any other video game/work of art that you know will be popular.

In my understanding, until someone actually creates the idea, all bets are off. It's not plagiarism in the same way that the clones of Minecraft are not considered plagiarism. My ethical wall in that situation would be if I were to go back with my own (pirated) copy of Minecraft and claim it as my own.

That would be unethical. So long as I would be able to make my own from scratch, I don't see anything unethical about it.

It is a good thing to discuss though.
