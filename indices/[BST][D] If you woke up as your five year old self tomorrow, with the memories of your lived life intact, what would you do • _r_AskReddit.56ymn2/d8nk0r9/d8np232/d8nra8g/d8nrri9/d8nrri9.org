I somewhat agree with you. But I think in a practical sense, you really are screwing over the person who had the original idea.

It's worse than copying concepts from a successful person, because you're effectively taking away from their potential for success.

If you make it big by making a Minecraft clone, it's very unlikely that Notch (the main inventor of Minecraft) is going to make it big by making the original Minecraft in the same timeline.

So you've more or less traded their success for your own. Which to me feels shady, though not necessarily criminal.

Edit: You make a good point about clones not being illegal, but this is basically the difference between building on someone's success and taking their success for your own.
