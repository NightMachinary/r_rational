The difference is that to me it's very similar to stealing someone's intelectual property.

No one owns the correct lottery number, or the knowledge that a certain stock is going to do well. Yes you winning the lottery and playing the stock market does take away from someone's potential to gain money, but it doesn't take away value from anything that they personally created.

In contrast, someone had to create the concepts behind Minecraft. And even if you do create a clone of the game instead of trying to make the game exactly as it was, you've still devalued the original creation by exposing their concepts to the world and displaying them as your own.

You're taking more than simply an opportunity to make money from them. You're taking their place in history as the creator of something noteworthy.
