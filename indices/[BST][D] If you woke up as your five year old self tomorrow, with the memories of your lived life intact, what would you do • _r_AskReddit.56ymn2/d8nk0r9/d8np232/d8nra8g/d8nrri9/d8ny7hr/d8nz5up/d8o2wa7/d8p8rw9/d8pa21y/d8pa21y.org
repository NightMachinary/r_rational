I mostly agree with your assessment of my point.

But I would argue that it's less morally ambiguous to "Steal" scientific ideas, since they're not so much bursts of creativity as they are attempts to understand reality itself.

Also the potential good that can be gained by allowing humanity to have access to certain scientific concepts faster probably outweighs the negatives of individual scientists not gaining notoriety for those discoveries.

In contrast, something like like Minecraft is a luxury item. So it's harder to argue that the game itself being made available sooner will be helpful to mankind as a whole. You could say that the profit gained could be better used by someone with altruistic goals, than by the employees of Majong. But that's about the only justification you can make to justify taking their place in history (In my opinion).

And for the record there are absolutely zero hard feelings about this on my end. At the end of the day, morality is formed by opinions. And it'd be foolish to expect everyone's opinion to line up perfectly.

I image there's more things Dwood15 and I agree on concerning morality than there are things we disagree on. And this is just a hypothetical edge case that is extremely unlikely to occur in real life based on the information we have available to us now.
