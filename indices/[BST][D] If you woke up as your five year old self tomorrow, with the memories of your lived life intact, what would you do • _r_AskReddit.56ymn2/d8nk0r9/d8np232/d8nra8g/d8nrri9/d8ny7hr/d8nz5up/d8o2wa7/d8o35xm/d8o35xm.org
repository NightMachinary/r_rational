I suppose we just have different opinions on this, which is fine.

I think it's morally ambiguous because it is similar to other situations of intellectual property theft.

Mainly because you didn't have the original idea and your actions are likely to deprive the person who did have the original idea of the profit they would have made.

I believe that them not knowing that they've lost the opportunity doesn't negate the fact that they've lost the opportunity and it was a result of your deliberate actions.

It's still "ambiguous" because as you've said it's not a case of directly stealing someone's intellectual property. But if you are successful the results of your actions will be exactly the same as if you HAD stolen their intellectual property, used it as your own, and got away with it.

I'm judging the morality based on how it effects the person who originally had the idea. Not based upon the person's knowledge of how it effects them.
