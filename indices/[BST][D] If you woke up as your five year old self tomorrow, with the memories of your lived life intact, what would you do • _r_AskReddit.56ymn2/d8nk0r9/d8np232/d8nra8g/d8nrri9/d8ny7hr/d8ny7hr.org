  it's very unlikely that Notch (the main inventor of Minecraft) is going to make it big by making the original Minecraft in the same timeline.

  this is basically the difference between building on someone's success and taking their success for your own.
#+end_quote

I approach the situation with three arguments, and if irreconcilable, an idea for reducing the net bad. From your quote it sounds like you're assuming this is zero-sum- because I have success means another person can't have success either.

1) (The game is not zero-sum)- While not sharing in my success, Notch would not be left homeless if I succeeded with the idea. He made no big bets on the game, and the fact that it got as big as it did was as much chance as anything else. Someone else would have come up with something similar that would have caught on if MC didn't catch on.

2) This is assuming my implementation is successful. Let's say I deliberately do a C++ version (which can't support mods) that allthough has good FPS and basic gameplay, never ends up getting bukkit or pistons, etc due to the work required to reverse machine code. I make a couple million off the game, not a couple billion. Minecraft comes out for Java and is moddable. Notch loses little (if any) money between timelines. 2a) I can still make a TON of money if I only make a little amount of cash, because some companies are still getting big around this time, like Nflx and TSLA, as well as a couple of medical companies

3) I believe the net harm to the disadvantaged party in this case is less than the net good from utilizing my knowledge to gain wealth in this manner. As a selfish individual (and perhaps conceitful) I think that I could make better use of millions and millions towards public good during the time I have foresight than Notch would during the same amount of time with the same amount of cash (Not saying Notch is using his money unwisely).

Attempt to reconcile: If none of the above points reconcile the issue, One could attempt to 'invest' some portion of the earned money into Mojang during this time period, giving them a chance to create a separate/decent product with the proper funding.
