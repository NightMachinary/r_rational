She would never become the woman I love, because we have been married almost 10 years. I have shaped her life, as she has shaped mine. With me changing, I couldn't provide the same influences to her, even if I wanted.

There would be a woman out there with her face, but not her.

I honestly don't understand why, but the thought is legitimately upsetting to me, even though I know it's just a thought experiment.
