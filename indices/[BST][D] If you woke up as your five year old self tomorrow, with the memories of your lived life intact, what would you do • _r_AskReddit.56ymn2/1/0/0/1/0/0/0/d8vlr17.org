I am not sure. In that case, my feelings would likely not be much changed, just tinted with more sadness. There haven't been any major life-changing events in the past 12months, though, so simply losing some memories would not change her much. I agree it is more degree, but in your example there are other significant differences (such as: she would likely be aware that she was missing memories, our kids would exist, and there would be physical evidence of what I said was happening).
