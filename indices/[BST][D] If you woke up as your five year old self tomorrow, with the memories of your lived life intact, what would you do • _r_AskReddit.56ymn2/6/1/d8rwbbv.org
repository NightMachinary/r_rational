Also, in this context, if tomorrow's date is 2016, watch the Detective Conan anime. He's only aged down to around 6-7, but that's close enough for this purpose. He's basically in hiding from criminals. His parents become aware fairly early on but they are not present, and he's staying with his childhood friend and her father, who is a detective. He does try to pretend to be his physical age. Through impossible TV tech, he solves mysteries and pretends that it is her father who is really solving them. Every so often he solves one himself (usually when alone with the perpetrator, but he has plot armor), which never causes any problems.

Another character is also deaged to that age and doesn't normally bother to hide it. Nobody notices, except the kids "her age" occasionally think she's mature. It helps that she is living with someone who knows the circumstances.
