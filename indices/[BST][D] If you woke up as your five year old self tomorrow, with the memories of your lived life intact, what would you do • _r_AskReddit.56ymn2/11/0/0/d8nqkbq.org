I actually considered the patriot act thing, but I imagine that it would only be a matter of time before terrorists successfully completed an attack that would allow the government to use similar legislation.

Though I admit it's definitely possible that they won't be able to pull something off that has the level of public outcry that 9/11 had, so maybe you're right.
