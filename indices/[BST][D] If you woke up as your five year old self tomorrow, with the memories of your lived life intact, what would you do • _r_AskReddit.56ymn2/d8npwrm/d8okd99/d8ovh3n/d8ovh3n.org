Thanks. What plot points excite you? I might write it, but need to know what you consider the story's main driver of conflict.

--------------

- Edited update: I wrote it, but not for a public audience. Editing this in case someone is really curious and has been checking for an update. I'll anonymize it and post if requested, but again, the story's audience isn't the public at large so I don't know how much you'd get out of it. To change the focus would change the story's theme; I'm happy with what I wrote, so I don't want to do that.
