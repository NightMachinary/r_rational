I'm not OP, but I'm going to call this cheating.

You should only be able to use knowledge you currently have right now. If you're able to plan for your trip to the past the whole thing becomes a lot easier.

You've obeyed the letter of the law, but not the spirit. (Though I upvoted you anyways, since you get points for being a smartass).
