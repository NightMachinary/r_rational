You're underestimating just how much you will be affecting the world around you regardless of how much you try not to. The lottery is by design a extremely delicate system, any change whatsoever in the initial conditions is going to change the outcome. For reference this video might be useful: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8wGQW-Y48]]

The system is delicate enough that a few atoms being out of place will vastly alter it. Just your body moving in a way differently than it otherwise would have is likely going to be enough to shift a few atoms around. The scales we're talking about here are nearly incomprehensible here's an article about how you share molecules with basically any historical figure to /maybe/ instill the proper sense of scale.
