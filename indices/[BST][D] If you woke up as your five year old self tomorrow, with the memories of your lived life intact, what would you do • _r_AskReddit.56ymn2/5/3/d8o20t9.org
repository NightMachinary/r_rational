I actually think you wouldn't be able to win /even a single lottery/.

I think you're vastly underestimating the butterfly effect, you can't buy tickets the same day they do the draw so that's at least a day for things to change. The lottery is an extremely delicate system, given it's designed to be unpredictable. If you traveled back even 30 seconds in time betting on roulette and changed your bet to the number that just came up, you wouldn't expect it to come up the same this iteration, the lottery is the same way it's just not as intuitively obvious how delicate of a system it is.\\
The same thing goes for reproduction, which sperm meets the egg is a delicate system. Expect everyone born in this new iteration to be half twins (same egg) of who would have otherwise been born starting out.\\
After a while things will diverge even further, don't count on anything happening unless it was basically inevitable, even then you might be wrong about how guaranteed that outcome actually was.
