Assuming no preparation:

Step 1: Take immediate measures to record and preserve the knowledge of my former life, so that those memories aren't forgotten (as many early memories are) during the process of childhood brain development. I would surreptitiously obtain a notebook and pencil, and start writing everything down, and try to hide this from my parents.

Step 2: Slowly give indications of being a child prodigy.

Step 3: Get my parents to let me take a fast track through the school system. Attempt to invest in certain companies, or get my parents to, as soon as anyone takes me seriously. Become an entrepreneur in my teens, maybe after getting a PhD. Establish contact with lots of people who will be important in the future. Maybe aim to become an influential world leader.

Also, have lots of fun messing with the other kids my age.
