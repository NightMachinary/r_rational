I will in good faith allow op the benefit of doubt and believe that we have no knowledge that this is going to happen and thus no way to prepare.

Well due to many circumstances I will not be actively trying to change anything on my formative years, I will let things play out as they did before until I am living in the USA. Then things get interesting. Accumulation of wealth is nearly impossible until bitcoins come around. If i remember correctly, I should sell them around 2012 November. And start acquiring them much, much sooner. As soon as they appear.

If possible invest in tesla cars and apple as well as google. Now assuming I can get a few hundred thousand or something north of a million out of bitcoins, my investments on tesla would pay out quite nicely. I would then invest into getting a good amount of minecraft stock.

Keeping all of this and my finances secret ofcourse, I want to keep things as close to this timeline as possible. I will work as a wage slave for about 4 years but then I get the opportunity to meet the one person that means everything to me. From then on, I'd start using my riches to their full advantage. Including trying to work with the gates foundation on eradicating Malaria.
