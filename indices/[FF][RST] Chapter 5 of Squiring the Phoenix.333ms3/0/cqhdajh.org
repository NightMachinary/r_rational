It seems strange 9/11 still happened, on the same day even, considering how much the world should be different because of eight years of magical cooperation with scientists, military and intelligence agencies.

It also seems strange that Bush would publicly announce a method which can be used to assassinate pretty much anyone. Hell, you might even be able to assassinate the president unless they kill all animals (damn animagi) that come too close to the white house.
