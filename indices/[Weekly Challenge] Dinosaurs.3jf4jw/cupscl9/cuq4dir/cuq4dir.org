  I know this isn't standard faire but....can i request a re-roll of this week's challenge? Asking an honest question, as it seems there's little to no interest on this prompt.

  P.S Feel free to delete this comment after you've read it, mod-sama.

Eh, if there's no interest, we might just go a week without a winner. I don't want to reroll now when someone might be working on something. (I do have a theory that the small incentives provided by winning might spur someone to write /something/ in order to claim the prize, but we'll see.) This one /was/ taken from the prompt list.

I'll nuke these comments if/when there's an entrant.
