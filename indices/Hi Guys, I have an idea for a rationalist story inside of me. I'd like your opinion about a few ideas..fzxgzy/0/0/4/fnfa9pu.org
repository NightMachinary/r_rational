That kinda reminds me of two books:

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IGR19Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ by Philip Pullman]]

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OVLK2W/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal]]

They aren't rational, but excellently written books about a made up brother of Jesus where you have, in the first book, Christ as a scoundrel who only sees Jesus' growing religion as a way to amass power. The other one is where there's Biff who is realistically helping his brother, a man with common failings, become a messiah and develop his legend in the missing years from the Bible between Jesus' childhood and up to before the crucifixion. Both books are excellent character studies of Jesus and comedies to boot.
