Well sure.

My idea is a retelling of the story of Jesus from both his perspective and the perspective of his twin brother, Judas. Jesus is a moral philosopher that wants to lead the world to be good, and Judas is a bit of a ends-justify-the-means con artist who also believes in Jesus' plan to improve the world through new moral rules. Judas invents miracles to get people to listen to Jesus, and the resurrection would be their final heist with all sorts of twists and surprises. In between chapters I might use quotes from the bible to show the "public" view of what is happening. Jesus would espouse meditation but explain it as prayer, treating each other as equals, etc.

I would want it to be interesting to read, while also allowing people of faith to realize that a miraculous resurrection is the least likely thing to happen.
