Hmm yeah, I hate to break it to you buuuutt most people of faith wouldn't bother reading a story like that. Saying this as a Christian. It's not just that you're trying to deny the resurrection, you're adding a twin brother. Wars have been fought over less. XD

If this is your first serious attempt at writing a story, I'd recommend staying away from a hot button topic like the Bible. Just my two cents.
