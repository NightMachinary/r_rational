It's not that he (will assume pronoun for sheer linguistic simplicity) was trying to be insulting. It's that his whole attitude and approach is condescending:

3. Simultaneously showing that what Jesus actually wanted is something as anodyne as meditation, which had to be rephrased as prayer to appeal to our credulous natures. Which is to say, not very subtly reshaping the Christian message into something much more palatable to modern seculars.
