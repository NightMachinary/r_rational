Thanks for the feedback. I really appreciate it. I guess I wouldn't expect full on believers to read it, more like people that are a little skeptical already. The goal wouldn't primarily be to persuade, it would be to tell a fun story, and justify why even if the Bible was wrong on a few details, the major actors might still have good intentions.
