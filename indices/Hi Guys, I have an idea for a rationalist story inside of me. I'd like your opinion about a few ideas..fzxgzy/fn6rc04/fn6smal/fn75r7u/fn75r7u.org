That's the entire point of it. We don't need to be persuaded of this. The Gospels themselves explicitly say that the Jews of the time claimed that your heist happened. Much like they say that Joseph assumed Mary had been sleeping around. Tell the story if you like--similar stories have been told before--but you'll be effectively telling it for other skeptics who want their own narrative reinforced, not for us.
