Here's another datapoint from my experience:

I've two chapters so far, and I don't feel like reading more. I really like the general concept ("protagonist is mentored by a supervillain" is always a cool concept), but I found it awkwardly executed.

I don't really have words to describe it. It's fanfiction-ish; it reads like the most awkward parts of HP:MoR; I think I would boil it down to "This is not how Wildbow would write this story".

I don't know if that makes sense? Point is, if you were put off my the most cringy parts of HP:MoR, this will put you off even more. If you saw nothing wrong with HP:MoR, you will probably love this story.

--------------

That's the general critique; now, to the fic's credit, the plot does seem interesting; but I don't really like the direction it seems to go into; (MILD SPOILERS AHEAD)

The whole "Celestia neglects Twilight" plot feels very forced, in a bad way. This isn't a minor detail, this is the story's entire premise. I feel like there's a thousand things Celestia could, and would have tried, before giving up on Twilight. Even if she didn't have time to mentor Twilight full-time, she could arrange to give her private lessons on week-ends. She could have Cadence teach her part-time. This is especially important since we're told that Celestia is desperately looking for a Chosen One against Luna; she should probably spend at least a few days/weeks tutoring Twilight, getting a sense of her potential before discarding her a dead-end.

And I know the story is trying to justify why Twilight would develop resentment for Celestia and gratitude for Luna, but this is way too sudden. I feel like the story would work better if the first few chapters were about Celestia trying to teach Twilight, then growing more distant as it becomes apparent Twilight won't be able to get her powers under control in time to fight Nightmare Moon, with Twilight feeling cheated as Celestia starts neglecting her and looking for other Chosen Ones.

It would also be an occasion to have "two sides to every story" conflicts where Twilight has to ponder how much she trusts what Luna tells her vs what Celestia tells her, keeping in mind that she has reasons to distrust both.
