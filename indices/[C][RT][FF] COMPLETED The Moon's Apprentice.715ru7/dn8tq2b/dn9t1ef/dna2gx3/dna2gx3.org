Well, not everyone is a (practice) dummy, I'll give you that.

But the thing is- rational fiction often boasts about having... not even smart, but thinking characters.

So, Shining Armor: he's a high ranking officer, a natural spellcaster, and a guard. He isn't smart, but he's no idiot. When this guy decides that learning more /defensive/ spells to do his job does not have a point, then I call bull. I mean, his /special talent/ is magical defense!

Point is- he didn't have a reason to be this dumb, not outside of showing off the lesson our amazing heroine thought of.
