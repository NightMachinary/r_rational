At first I wondered how exactly is that premise in any way rational.

After a couple chapters, it's pretty damn fitting in this sub. It feels almost /uncannily/ like HPMoR.

- We have openly Machiavellian yet emotionally close mentor who's not /quite/ a villain.

- There's our young heroine, rational, intelligent and wise in matters both magical and mundane.

- Of course there are... best metaphor I have is practice strawman, so the author can show you how to shoot down their ignorance. (Shining...)

- And there's the indignation and fury on stupidities of the current society and establishment.

- Ah also anger is something of a significant emotion for her, just to add to the comparison pile.
