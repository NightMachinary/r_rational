Funny thing is that I liked all of Worm (except for the time skips) and that the Azkaban arc may have been my favorite part of the story (just like it was for Eniasz Brodski who made the audiobook version) /and/ that the motorbike epilogue from Pact didn't really do anything for me.

I'm still not sure if I'm going to read this but your ostensibly negative review definitely didn't lower the chance that I will.
