Oh yeah. The story definitely makes sense, and I see how the dynamics it depicts are realistic, but I still don't like it. It's a story about broken characters suffering because of their own flaws, and... well, that's not really my thing? That's why I'm making the Worm comparisons.

Although I could see ways in which the events could unfold more positively. If Celestia had been more convincing, if Twilight's friends had confronted her about her flaws more often, if Shining Armor or Cadence had argued better why following Luna might be a bad idea, etc...

The story is pretty open-ended. I could see any of these things happen over the years, as Twilight opens up to her friends and gets more perspective on both her actions and Celestia's motives, etc. Like Twilight said, they have eternal life; they'll move on sooner or later.
