  Twilight Sparkle has too much magic, and it will take her decades to learn to control it. Her spectacular loss of control during her entrance exam only proves that fact. She is a danger to herself and others.

  After Sunset Shimmer’s disappearance, Princess Celestia needs a new student to bear The Element of Magic to defeat Nightmare Moon. With all of Equestria at stake, Twilight Sparkle…is not the pony she needs.

  Princess Celestia seals Twilight Sparkle’s magic with the distant promise of one day teaching her.

  But there are two diarchs of Equestria. Amidst a lucid dream, an offer is made.

  “Hello, Twilight. Would you like to be my student?”

Twilight (for plot reasons) fails to qualify for her apprenticeship with Celestia, and instead is taken in by Luna, who she meets in her dreams. Luna is somewhat bitter about being locked in the moon by her sister, and spreads her animosity toward Celestia to Twilight.

It's a pretty good story. I'm glad it has finally finished, it seemed abandoned for the past year.

Here's a teaser - somewhat of a minor running joke, that Twilight doesn't understand how Pinkie Pie manages to do what she does:

“How about this?” I brought a forehoof up and went through the usual motions. “I promise not to strand you away from Canterlot. Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.”

Shining raised an eyebrow and flatly asked, “What was that?” He was clearly unimpressed with my attempt to reassure him.

“A Pinkie Promise,” I answered. Seeing as that wasn't actually an answer, I added, “Pinkie Pie is a time mage. I think. She takes promises very seriously, so it's best not to break ones made in her name.”

Shining just looked at me like I was crazy, which I could hardly blame him for.

“Here, watch this.” I cleared my throat, just because it seemed appropriate for the demonstration. “I promised I wouldn't abduct you. I think, deep down, you still trust me. If I broke my promise, I'd lose that trust. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.”

It didn't even take a second before Pinkie Pie popped out of nowhere from behind the front counter. Joe behind it looked as though he'd wet himself from the surprise.

“Forever!” Pinkie Pie said.

Shining started and whipped his head about to face her. He watched her slowly disappear behind the counter again in her own overly dramatic way.

After several seconds worth of silence in the entire restaurant, Shining turned back to face Twinkleshine and me.

“Ha ha. You got me. I didn't--”

“No,” I interrupted. “It's not a trick. Scry the area, if you must. She's gone.”

“Wha...”

Horn alight, Shining took my advice and searched the store for Pinkie Pie, but obviously didn't find her. There hadn't been any obvious magic use, either, so unless he concluded this was a very elaborate hoax, he'd have to believe.

Shining hesitated, but he asked, “Is that replicable?”
