I find this response interesting.

I've not gone back and reread it but everyone involved seemed within range of human norm or better.

That crossed with the story of whose perspective this story is from gave me the view that given this particular batch of characters I'm hard pressed to see the whole thing unfolding much better.

I suppose you could want it to be better but that would involve changing a lot of personalities.
