Okay, I pulled an all-nighter and read the whole story. Ugh. I do not recommend it. I feel like I've just lost 2d6 sanity points; I feel as shitty as the time I read the second half of Worm in four days.

--------------

All right, so mostly spoiler-free review: this is the most HP:MoR story I've ever read. Like, this is ten times more HP:MoR than HP:MoR.

My summary would be "Imagine if someone took the Azkaban arc from MoR, made an entire decade-spanning story around it, and added some slice-of-life and more Harry-Quirrell interaction".

Overall, I don't know quite what to think; the first few chapters are pretty rough, but then it becomes... well, not "better", but more focused. The whole thing is extremely bitter and depressing; it's basically the story of a broken extremely talented girl with toxic influences destroying herself and lashing at the people around her, keeping herself miserable and acquiring unfathomable amounts of power... yeah, this is exactly like Worm's second half. And just like Worm, I felt like I was hurting myself reading this, but I still couldn't stop.

Ultimately, the ending felt pretty disappointing. Twilight never finishes reading Celestia's letter, which was the main thing I wanted resolved (what was Celestia thinking?). Without spoiling too much, the final status-quo is surprisingly non-bleak, and Equestria isn't reduced to a giant crater; but the psychological part feels like a tragedy. Twilight has learned a lot, become a better friend, and reached immense power... but it all feels empty. She's still as bitter as ever, she still hasn't seriously confronted Luna about all the horrible things she did to her for ultimately selfish reasons, she still hasn't realized how unhealthy their relationship is, she obviously hasn't found satisfaction, and still hasn't let go of her resentment towards Celestia. She has some growing positive relationships, but it's still depressing.

This feels like Worm if Worm had ended without the Taylor chapter, or Pact if Pact had ended without the motorcycle epilogue. Something's missing. I would really, really have liked a "10 years later" epilogue where Twilight finished reading Celestia's letter, and just... showed some signs that she was ready to move past her issues. As it stands, I can imagine it happening... but it's ambiguous. The author saying that an epilogue would be "fluff, randomly depressing, mindless violence" doesn't help.

So yeah. I am sadness.

Anyway, I am super tired. All nighters aren't my thing. Ugghghgghgh.

(also the parts that talked about relationship and sex felt very awkward; and I /do not/ approve of the Twilight-Luna pairing, but that's minor)
