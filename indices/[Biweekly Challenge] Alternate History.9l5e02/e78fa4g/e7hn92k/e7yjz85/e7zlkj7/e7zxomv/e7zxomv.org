Nice! Particularly fun was the contrast of the tone of the words and of the events described.

​

If there was any mental stumbling, it was at things fully addressed, but later than they seemed important at the time; a minor case was that the Watsonian writer did not indicate awareness of the 'never interact' part until the end (incidentally of course terrible if you were in the same group with someone you cared about!). A more major case was the sentence 'Thus when you walk into[...], you are guaranteed to not experience[...]where[...]': the 'Thus' especially suggested that previous information was sufficient to give that guarantee, and that the Watsonian writer had an alarming (and confusing) misunderstanding about what was going to happen. (Happily, the guarantee was from other information later indicated!)

​

Incidentally, given that the procedure of drawing blood me consistently has been (and predictably will continue to be) severely traumatic no matter what, I would absolutely love a (temporary) TNC so that I didn't have to expend extra mental effort on holding still and not have to fear thrashing! Assuming that there weren't any lasting side-effects. 'as I did in a shameful moment of terror' indeed... I've actually succeeded in never thrashing during the thing itself (or vaccinations likewise, eagerly awaiting widespread adoption of needleless injectors so that there's no chance of a needle snapping off or tearing a big hole sideways), but I imagine it would be a lot more relaxing for my heart to be able to try to thrash, secure in the knowledge that I couldn't accidentally interfere.

​

That said, maybe that would be worse mental training for me, but how much positive effect would an event of such low frequency have in practice..? Much less considering the people who don't react the same way and so would never benefit from it, if there were any benefit. And moreover, the benefits-of-being-hit-by-a-rock-every-day perspective of that, if not already doing it, one wouldn't willingly expose oneself to a situation of having to repress panic into stillness (say, every day) even if there were some mental benefit. Probably. Hm, thinking about the gom jabbar humanity test now... definitely a once-in-a-lifetime thing... though it's hard to imagine or predict one's perspective when dealing with pure pain, where there's no intrusion or injury or (hopefully) permanent effects. Maybe a good--ah, that's it. Not just the instance of putting a spoonful of spicy chili into one's mouth, but the familiar experience of putting medication on a mouth ulcer. It feels like liquid pain, and one's body jerks and one's eyes tear, but it's refreshing and peaceful as one believes that the medication is doing no harm, and feels that the pain is an indication that the exposed inflamed flesh is in need of the medication and will benefit from it.

​

...I actually want to have a gom jabbar box (without the gom jabbar itself--I almost forgot that 'gom jabbar' wasn't the box, since the needle is far more easily replaceable than the box) now, so that I could observe whether my own predicted behaviour changes as I try using it, and how long I can withstand it as the intensity increases. It seems unlikely that I would be able to endure indefinitely, and yet it fascinates me that I cannot make even an extreme prediction of when I would be unable to.
