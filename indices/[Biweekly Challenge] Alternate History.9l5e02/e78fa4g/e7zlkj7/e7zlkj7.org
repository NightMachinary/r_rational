Just a small thing, could you use anything other than Medium for hosting? Medium has a cap on monthly views, so it's possible to be unable to read it there because of it. Places like Archive of our Own or FictionPress allow for hosting original stories, and then of course there's blogging sites like WordPress or Blogger, or just sharing docs through Dropbox or Google Docs.
