This is sounding like an alien, because water makes up a significant portion of our bodies.

​

~60% of of our body is actually water, the H2O molecule is omnipresent in all cells and the space between our cells. This includes blood, sweat, spinal fluids. The antibodies you speak of would be going haywire constantly. H2O is a major component of cell processes and the environment our cells live in.

Also note: there is water present in the air (there's always a little bit of H2O vapor in the air) and in milk (it's actually a solution that has both fats and water, mixed together uniformly).

​

If the character has a problem with a little bit of water, then there's no way they can 1. Be human, 2. Live normally on Earth.
