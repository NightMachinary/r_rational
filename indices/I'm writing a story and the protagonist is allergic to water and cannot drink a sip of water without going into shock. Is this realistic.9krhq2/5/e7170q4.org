I'd say this is not realistic on a couple of different levels. How/why is she allergic? Tap water, pure water, saline all cause a potentially fatal reaction? There's humidity in the air. If she's that sensitive to water how can she breathe? Has she managed to avoid ever getting rained on or getting hit with a sprinkler or mister? Has she never taken a bath or a shower?

I guess if you're saying it's some kind of immune system thing, that would allow for incidental contact with water. I'm not sure "antibodies against water" actually makes any sense, but if it did then why can't she swallow water? Something going through your digestive system isn't going to immediately cause an antibody reaction. Blood is largely composed of water, so why is she immune to blood?

From a story standpoint, if "a sip of water can instantly kill her" then how did she survive a saline drip?
