Is this a shitpost? Even if there was a community that'd be interested in this idea, and maybe there is, [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is not it. This is the least rational and logically consistent idea I've heard in a while. The human body is composed of up to 60% water, so good luck surviving if your body is actively trying to tear itself apart. Even if there was some milk based diet (ignoring that milk is also mostly water) that they could live on, how did they survive through infancy? Did their parents know instinctively that they were fatally hydrophobic? The only way I could see this being rational is if this character is from a universe with completely different physics and chemistry, maybe a magical hell analog. While we don't know for sure that water is necessary for life, it's pretty hard to avoid. We used to think that earth is the only planet in the solar system with water, or at least liquid water, but we now know that water, or water ice at least, is pretty much everywhere. Point is, this is not a story that's easy to write rationally, not unless you're okay with spending tons of time on worldbuilding.
