A lot of replies to your other (similar) posts are saying you keep getting banned for reposting the same question and switching usernames. Your post history also includes [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/9ihajd/i_think_i_may_have_rabies_help/][these]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/9ihd88/i_think_i_may_have_rabies_help/][two]] posts where you claimed a suspected case of rabies (incubated for 7 years) and pretended you never drink water and don't know what saliva was. And you're asking these probing questions about where saliva comes from in your body...

What's your angle? Are you really writing a story or is this just an icebreaker so you can argue with people about Heidi Falconer? Cos this is a weird way to go about researching your short story.

EDIT: Holy shit your history just gets weirder. Apart from asking people to /explain saliva/ and where it comes from, theres this comment:
