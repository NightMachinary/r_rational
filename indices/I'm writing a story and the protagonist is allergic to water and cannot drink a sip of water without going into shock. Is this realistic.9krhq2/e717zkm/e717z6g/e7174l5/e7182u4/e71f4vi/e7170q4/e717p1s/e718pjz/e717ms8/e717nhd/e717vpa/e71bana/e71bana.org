So a lot of people are responding to you, so maybe I'll be touching similar points. I will treat you like someone who wants to write a story.

​

Evaluating Heidi (the allergic girl) ***[You can skip this, the story suggestions are below this wall of text]*\**

1.) People will claim all sorts of allergies to things that don't make conventional sense, examples being [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity][Wi-Fi]] and other EM spectra. The medical community has largely debunked these claims with actual experiments. The thing is, people will lie (to get attention) or misunderstand phenomenon (notice a change and find correlations that are not true).

2.) People are unreliable, Heidi is the only person to have this condition to this extreme, this makes the story unlikely. Most people with similar conditions only experience discomfort. If there is a condition, it's very likely that Heidi herself doesn't understand her condition, and is just running on what her parents have told her (it's not hard to find the news story, the one from 1996). The fact of the matter, is that Heidi likely does have a small allergic reaction, but overall her body chemistry is "normal". The lack of scientific research and the abundance of click-bait news stories make this ultimately a hoax to attract attention and little else.

3.) The little medical evidence I can find of disorders such as the one above, only show hives on the surface. It should also be noted, that Body sensors cannot tell the difference between purified water and water in milk. Yet she admits to drinking water based products.

If you want to write a story, You have a choices:

***Realistic***

/\/(I would advise you to either learn about allergies and this specific condition well if you are to embark on this path, the pedantry corner of the internet will never let you rest otherwise)**

/\/(If you don't want to deal with constant skeptics, I would advise against trying to rationalize the phenomenon in question from the beginning. Unless you have an ironclad understanding of what is going on and are able to make each skeptic with access to the internet happy.)**

​

- a sane person who is misunderstood (don't be angered if the readers call shenanigans, its on you the writer to make them believe)

- a questionably sane person with an actual condition but who takes it to extremes (my bias is showing here)

- an alien who is adapting badly to earth's environment

​

** *Fantasy***

- a fire elemental who just cannot fathom why living beings would drink water

- a witch or mage who by in world magic rules cannot drink or interact with "pure water".

- a cursed individual who was cursed with forever denied "pure water".

- a normal person who is allergic to water, and everyone is trying to rationalize it in ways that won't work (would a arch-wizard know what the hell histamine is?)
