I was going to suggest you post this in a biology subreddit, checked your post history to see if you had and... wow, you are determined to get this question answered.

As people have pointed out to you, it's possible for her to be allergic to minerals commonly found in water but not the H2O molecule itself. You don't seem satisfied with this.

The case of Heidi Falconer is interesting, but doesn't fit the parameters of your story:

#+begin_quote
  This condition is called aquagenic pruritus, and it is a very rare skin condition characterized by severe intense itching when the skin is exposed to water for more than a very short period of time. *Water consumed internally is not an issue.* A presumably related disorder is aquagenic urticaria where skin contact with water produces raised welts or hives. In both cases, individual reactions can vary from the mild to the severe. Ms. Falconer appears to fall into the latter category.

  Neither of these disorders is believed to be a true allergy (not that that provides sufferers with any ease) as there is no evidence of the histamine reaction that characterizes allergies, but in neither case is the mechanism well-understood.

Honestly, the fact that this allergy is an interesting concept that /sounds/ somewhat plausible and is only one step removed from a real condition is enough to justify it in a story. I wouldn't worry so much about justifying it as 100% true to medical science.

It's an interesting idea, now just go and write it.
