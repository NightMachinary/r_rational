  Ever so occasionally, stuff happens. Someone is totally physically and mentally a boy, but they're magically considered a girl. Or vice versa.

  We just checked to see if you're being possessed by any Dark Lords. Rest assured, you're not.

  [Parseltongue]'s a Prewett [Molly Weasley's maiden name] family secret. Some of us can do that.

Oh /hell/ no. You did /not/ just pull the biggest red herring in the history of fanfiction. How would they even check for possession? The only way I know is the Marauders' Map (that's what that was, right? Although it would have to have been modified by Voldemort), and HPMOR never states that it was recovered from Quirrell's body.

I think that Pomfrey (Moody?) was lying because Harry suspects (or knows, having retrieved the map off-screen) that Ginny /is/ a Riddle and has judged that there's only harm to be had by her knowing (since there isn't anything she could /do/ about it except adapt, like he has), and Molly made up the whole family secret thing because she's terrified that Ginny would feel unbearably distanced from her own family otherwise (isn't it convenient that the only person Molly named who could do it is already dead?).
