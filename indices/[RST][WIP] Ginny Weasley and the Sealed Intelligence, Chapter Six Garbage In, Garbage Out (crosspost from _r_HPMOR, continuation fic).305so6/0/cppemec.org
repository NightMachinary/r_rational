Flitwick seemed remarkably un-Flitwick-like here, in his speech patterns and personality - just felt like someone else who happened to be named Flitwick. Still, nice to finally get some explanation concerning wizards' definitions of the different spell classes.

Also, I don't know if I'm the only one, but I would definitely be in favor of a less frequent update schedule if it meant longer chapters. These are more like single scenes, which would benefit from being strung together into a /sequence/ of scenes, which would in turn make up a chapter. I have a hard time getting invested when the story is released in periodic-but-small snippets, rather than less-periodic-but-larger chunks. A personal preference perhaps.
