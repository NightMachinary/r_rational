All joking aside, the time that "Pomfrey" used leglimency on Ginny was 100% Mad Eye Moody. These other mentions, yes, have been jokes, but there's nothing more serious than the threat of a Dark Wizard. We should note, also, that Moody completely called the entire thing (Quirrell being the source of the problems, etc) during Multiple Hypothesis Testing. It's hard to even call the man Mad when he's so 100% right.
