That's some interesting speculation.

This would necessitate Ai communicating with the asteroid quite some time before the protagonist reaches it, as it is silent when they arrive. Of course, transmitting at light speed would enable that...

Whoopsie. Originally, I intended for [[#s][]] to be quite separate ([[#s][]]). I mean, given your theory as stated above, it would make sense for both to be related, and I generally think it elegant if all themes of a story spring from a single idea, especially in the case of short stories...

... I'm never quite sure whether to be happy or sad when a reader's headcanon is better than canon.

Not sure about that one. The prediction Dave makes is rather small in scale, and "profit" from a single prediction would therefore often be something far, far smaller than [[#s][]]

Thank you for sharing your thoughts! That gave me some much-needed motivation to go back to writing /Worm/ fanfics for the next challenge...
