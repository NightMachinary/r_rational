Yep, what the hell is going on with that river and the mountains around Foramen? It looks like the river is starting practically on the southern sea coast, then passing through the mountains to the north, then crossing the continent before ending at a delta in the northern sea coast.

It's as though the entire continent is on a steady inclined slope, and the southern seacoast is a magically erosion-proof cliff face kilometers high. ;)
