Ao3 provides them, you can click the "Download" button which should be in the upper-right corner, and then select EPUB. Or [[http://archiveofourown.org/downloads/ct/cthulhuraejepsen/11478249/Worth%20the%20Candle.epub?updated_at=1516953979][clicking this link should do it too]].

There's a slight problem in that the epub doesn't properly format the character sheets that show up about five times in the text, but I think those can safely be skipped, since most of the information they provide is redundant.
