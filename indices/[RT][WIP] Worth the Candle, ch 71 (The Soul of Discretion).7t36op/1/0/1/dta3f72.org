The term "SI" has slightly different connotations in fanfic communities like Ao3. When a story explicitly sells itself as being an SI, readers take that to mean "portal fantasy, with someone from our timeline in [fantasy world] who may or may not have read the book that contains [fantasy world.]" WtC follows that conciet-- a portal fantasy where the main character knows about the world he's going into. The fact that the MC is based off of the author is almost incidental-- SI OCs (an original character following the conventions of a self insert) are almost as, if not more, common that straight SIs.
