I think [[https://youtu.be/gJj4Y2EkJmg?t=151][this video]] sums up a lot of my thoughts on self-inserts pretty well. Self-inserts get a bad rap, mostly because a lot of people do them poorly. Same goes for portal fantasy, and to some extent, litRPGs, and a few other ideas or genres that /Worth the Candle/ uses.

Part of the problem with trying to do these things well is that a lot of people will just see the tag or description and then move on, but the other end of that problem is that if you try to hide any of it, you might lose people when they figure things out. It's also kind of annoying when people will try to move the goalposts for what a thing /is/ because of their preconceived notions and the way we like to place labels on categories. (The definition of "science fiction" and "fantasy" vary a lot based on who you ask, but it's pretty common for the definition to be crafted such that a select few high-quality, socially acceptable books or movies will fall outside it.)

So part of the reason that the original description was like that is that I wanted to be unapologetic about what kind of story this was. I do still want to be unapologetic (and think I still am) but the problem was that the original description didn't actually give you any idea of what the story was, beyond the collection of tropes and genres it contained. Part of not trying to hide the nature of the work is also because I hate the signaling game of "I'm going to distance myself from these other works because I think I'm better than them", and partly it's because I think it's useful to select against people who are inclined to dismiss the things that are in your story -- if I were writing a superhero story, I wouldn't want to waste anyone's time by disguising that fact until the third chapter, where they would promptly put it down.

As for happiness ... I would say that I'm generally happy /now/, but I wasn't a happy person from about as early as I can remember until an age older than Juniper is.
