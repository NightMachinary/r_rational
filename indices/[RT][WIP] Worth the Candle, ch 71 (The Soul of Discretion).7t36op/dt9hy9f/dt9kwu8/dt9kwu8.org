Well then, if you're not gonna, then let me say something as an ardent fan.

A good while back, you were using the term 'self-insert' to describe your work... which I'm sure, turned off a lot of potential readers (including me). At least until the constant threads in this subreddit tipped us off that there might be something worthwhile here.

So I'd like to ask... why'd you use to call it a "self-insert"? I think the common understanding of an SI is some sort of Mary-sue-ish Original Character^{TM} thrust into an existing canon, often with god-like powers and suddenly the whole world revolves around... okay, I might be answering my own question.

In that case, I ask this because, imho, Juniper is not... a happy person. The little vignettes back to Bumblefuck are my favourite part of the story; funny and depressing and poignant. And I hope your life has been happier than Juniper's.
