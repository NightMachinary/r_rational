Joon's spontaneous lie was interesting. I imagine that it could even be a complex reflex: resenting Amaryllis' oversight over his abilities, feeling guilty and wanting to ease Amaryllis' certain discomfort over having her soul and privacy bared at Joon's whim, the DM giving a subconscious nudge to spice the narrative up (that's terrifying) or, assuming Grak is compromised, dispensing the Luck-y slip as a result of Joon's "augmented mind" rolling high. There are a few worrying signs in Joon's mental dialogue lately.
