i think mary's had her soul messed with. i think the comment about how her distrust of faletehr was even higher than he'd expect is because faletehr fucked with it to avoid suspicion to cover up for something else faletehr did. im worried that juniper not telling her that he had evidence for grak being compromised resulted in her letting her guard down and grak set her up.

but that's all just from a weird sense of foreboding i get from the way the characters are interacting
