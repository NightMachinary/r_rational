Is Fenn evil? That assumption is shaky if we're going with a D&D alignment system. Joon sees her as chaotic neutral, not evil, and that does seem a better fit. He also speculated that the tower's disproportionately strong effect on her was due to her lack of exposure to internal moral monologue.

Someone said you're the average of who you spend time with, so I'm most excited to see any shifts in behavior and thinking. Wonder whether being soul-bonded in a party exacerbates that kind of homogenizing effect.
