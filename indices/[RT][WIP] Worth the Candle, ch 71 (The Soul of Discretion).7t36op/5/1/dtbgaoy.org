I could understand responding the same way Juniper did after Fenn explained her feelings about the tower. Her commitment couldn't preserve itself because it wasn't self-generated, but the lingering bad feeling wasn't doing her any favors.

I wouldn't say he's blind to her backstory. And as Fenn said, there was limited time to continue the discussion.

I agree that her list of misdeeds is as bad as you say. (Maybe not for /wanting/ to murder Fallatehr, but there's still time for that to /happen/...) Plenty of games are centered around doing those sorts of things, but this exercise is to take in-universe morality at face value.

Knowing what we do about Aerb's elves and their emphasis on perfection, I doubt they spent time debating moral philosophy. "Playing devil's advocate" is an alarming turn of phrase on Aerb; its /meaning/ would also be alarming to a (conventional) elf.

This is not to say that they were always morally perfect agents*. Fenn probably wasn't exposed to that sort of discussion from the elves, and even if she was I imagine they seemed hypocritical, considering her own experiences.

In this context, Juniper's explanation seems accurate, not rationalized. Unlike a lot of similar advice in fiction, it's also actionable. Maybe this isn't where the story is going, but Fenn could have those discussions too. Maybe this is part of how her arc proceeds. (And perhaps Valencia's also?)

What's the alternative? She doesn't change, and Juniper does/doesn't realize efforts in that direction are futile? The story gives her a pass to go back to being a career criminal? I don't think so.

Moral self-improvement seems like something Fenn wants, if the conversation is any indication. She's far from irredeemable, and now she's had something of a wake-up call.

*by our standards or otherwise, so throw some in the tower and see what happens
