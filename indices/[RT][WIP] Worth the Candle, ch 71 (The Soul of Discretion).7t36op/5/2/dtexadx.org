Your points notwithstanding in an "if this were the real world" sense, I'm pretty sure the narrative intends Jun as neutral good, and Fenn as chaotic neutral, Amaryllis as lawful good, Grak as lawful neutral, and fallhater as chaotic evil.

In the real world, humans don't often get much more evil than "purely self interested". Even your average congenitally amoral sociopath combined with poor upbringing /usually/ doesn't cause pain for fun - merely lacks an aversion to causing pain. So our standards for what is "evil" are rather different.

In this world and I think often in DnD fantasy in general, a person who is largely operating on self-interest is neutral. You aren't actually "evil" until you're willing to commit horrible atrocities in the name of that self interest, or worse if you take active pleasure in being malicious. Murdering someone who stands in the way of your objective isn't considered a huge deal to a DnD neutral. This is because DnD is descended from hack and slash medieval fighting games. Real life good people do not frequently engage in combat, and that's /because/ most real life people are good and combat is, as a whole, bad and only acceptable in the name of stopping a greater evil.

Fenn isn't even a sociopath - she doesn't want to hurt people, and will only do so when self interest overrides empathy. In our world, where practically everyone is good at their core, that's as close to evil as most people ever encounter in everyday life. In this world, that's neutral. June, meanwhile, is concerned about random mooks who die. In the real world that's just fucking basic, /of course/ you care about every person that dies. In this world, that makes him an idealistic bleeding heart saint.
