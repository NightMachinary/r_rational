It's interesting that Juniper is able to rationalize away the implications of Goodly so easily.

Juniper seems cognizant that he's neutral. 300k+ words in, 71 chapters, and he's never helped a single person other than his party, except the one time he tried to save a woman so he could clear his cowardice debuff, but he's also done nothing evil. Pretty textbook RPG neutral.

Meanwhile Fenn is a literal career criminal, murderer, and a kleptomaniac. She was in jail and got released from jail to go on a suicide mission. She steals from stores for fun and wants to murder the person they rescued from prison, not because he's dangerous (which would be understandable), but because she just really hates him.

Jun goes into the tower of good and feels influenced and diminished; that's a far cry from being unaffected or even enhanced like a truly good person would, but it's not too shabby. Meanwhile, Fenn goes into the tower and feels terrified, practically locked down with disgust and horror. Fenn was impacted way more than what happened to Jun (as he said, he wouldn't have even noticed it without the HUD), but Jun just ignores it.

I guess it's because he's in love. That's probably what anyone would do when faced with a reality that contains demonstrable and objective proof that the person they love is evil.
