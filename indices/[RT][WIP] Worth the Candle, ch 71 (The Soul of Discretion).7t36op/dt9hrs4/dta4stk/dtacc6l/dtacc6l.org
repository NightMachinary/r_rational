  "All of them," I confirmed with a nod.

  Fallatehr seemed to ponder that for a moment. "Your chest will be more difficult, as it forms the link for your internal organs and there is nothing to take from, but from the pace you've been keeping, it should only be a matter of days, at which point our primary business will be concluded.”
