The [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/108797/][Interdict of Merlin]] comes to mind.

If teaching is the process of turning verbal descriptions and firsthand demonstrations into the corresponding procedural ability, then resetting the skill revokes that ability but also poisons the insight.

Juniper was able to convey the knowledge of soul magic, even while his skill was compromised, through uncompromised Fenn.

Perhaps other imprisoned soul mages were well aware of how a single soul mage could run amok, especially someplace like a prison, and were therefore unable to cooperate in a variant of prisoner's dilemma? A defection is catastrophic, as we have seen.

Or maybe the teaching needs to come from someone whose skill is not removed. Subclaim: 'removed' is more severe than 'nonexistent' or 'locked'. Other prisoners could not help each other. Subclaim: ex-soul mages were only imprisoned together.

There could be a more local explanation for the observations in this chapter. Suppose Fallatehr compromised Juniper's memory of his own training, but Fenn's retelling managed to be different enough to work. Then the analogy between Juniper's reset and the other skill removals is no longer so applicable.

Or perhaps the original training was self-defeating in some way, like trying to learn the [[#s][HPMOR again]] (or more generally having learned a more precise abstraction).
