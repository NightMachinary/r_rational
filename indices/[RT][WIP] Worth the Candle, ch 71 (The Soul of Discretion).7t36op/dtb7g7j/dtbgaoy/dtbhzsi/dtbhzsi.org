I'm not quite sure I understand your meaning here. Understanding Juniper's actions is simple enough; I also sympathize with him and would be tempted to act the same way. But I guess after that you're saying that Fenn being evil isn't her fault, and so Juniper should keep acting the same as he was before? If so, I disagree strongly.

- Try to turn her to good? Absolutely.\\
- Keep her in the party? For sure.\\
- Keep sleeping with her? Well, don't blame him if he does.\\
- But just shrug your shoulders and dismiss it? That's crazy.

Knowing someone's alignment is very valuable information in a world with objective morality. Good is better than evil on both a moral level and a practical one, if you've got narrative powers like Jun does. Learning that a party member is evil is quite possibly the most important thing you could ever learn about them.

And what's more, the power of good isn't just an attribute tag or the balance of karma you've done in your life. It demonstrated itself in a /pattern of thinking/, meaning that Fenn's pattern of thinking is flawed such a way to produce evil into the world. This means that Jun can't have Fenn go donate to charity and kill zombies until she balances out. If good/evil is a way of thinking, then an alignment change means you need to fundamentally rewire who a person is and how they think in order to change them into 'good'.

Although, if you had to change someone into 'good', Juniper does have the tools to fix that... (Would that actually be good? Probably a decision you should only make when under the effect of goodly, just in case.)
