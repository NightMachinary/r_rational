My point is that I think he knows and isn't ignoring it. I think he already formed the relevant thoughts in Ch 61, near the quotes I pasted. In that sense, there wasn't a big revelation /for Juniper/ in the aftermath of the tower. He already knew who he was +dealing+ with.

You could argue that the narration's focus hasn't been here, or at least not yet. Maybe this is where it starts. Juniper gave her something of a purpose with the adventure. It hasn't kept her hands clean. (But Amaryllis has some enemies. Maybe it's a bad time to start that discussion.)

There is an objective morality defined by the mechanics of the world, and that's /weird/. We had a chapter about that.

I take this as a sign that Fenn isn't one /Detect Evil/ from an NPC riot. (Captain Not-a-Soul-Mage has the greater risk.) The objective morality does not seem well-known. And since the game chose (supplied?) companions, I doubt it will fault Juniper for any of this.

I think the difference between our views is not so great. I wouldn't even deny her fault in this. I think the difference is that you're buying more into the mechanical-morality than I am and you think the game layer will also do so. (This from the game layer that called Goodly an affliction.)

I'm not endorsing the attribute/karma/balance approach either. (Do you think Juniper would?) The important thing is, as you say, improving patterns. I think the pattern of Fenn's life was looting exclusion zones, but not that she felt a strong commitment to it. Compared to antagonists with evil goals and motivations, she has plenty of room for chaotic neutral. That seems easier to change.
