The fact that the tower has a moral philosophy which it calls good, and the power to enforce that moral philosophy, doesn't mean that its moral beliefs are objectively correct. I think it's fairly clear that the DM is not "good" in any standard sense -- why should we take the game's claims about good at face value? This is a version of the Euthyphro dilemma.
