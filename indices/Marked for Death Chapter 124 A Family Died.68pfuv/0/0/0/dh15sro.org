Alright, so I'd say mostly that I couldn't connect to the characters. It started In Media Res with the characters knowing each other, but without a build-up I just kept getting confused on who was who and their ranks and powers, because they felt like NPCs rather than people. Sure, they had characteristics unique to them, but they felt shallow and with one main character trait defining them.
