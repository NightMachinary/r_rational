Not vanished, I promise.

I'm 1700 words into Chapter 12. Chapter 15 is what should be publishing tomorrow, so I'm three and a half chapters behind.

And, yes, that's a real "behind," because I have four Patreon patrons and I promised them a chapter a week. As long as at least one person is sending me money, this is a real obligation.

I'd feel worse about it, though, if I had more patrons. To be explicit, the guilt formula is:

G = c*[ln(n) - 1]

For c the number of chapters behind, and n the number of patrons. If I don't complete and publish Chapter 12 in the next two hours, my guilt will jump from 1.16 to 1.55. But a single additional patron being added would further increase the guilt to 2.44.
