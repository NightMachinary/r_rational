(Resubmitted because I linked mobile and auto moderator removed.). I've been on a MCU fanfic binge lately after watching Infinity War and this fanfic stuck out to me as suited for this subreddit. T'Challa directs the scientific resources of Wakanda towards curing Bucky. Interesting world building and also a bit of character exploration.
