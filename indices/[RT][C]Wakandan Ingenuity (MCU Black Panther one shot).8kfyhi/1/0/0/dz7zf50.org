That would be fantastic!

Things would be a bit confusing between SG Thor and MCU Thor before the two groups of Asgardians were sorted out. "Oh your hammer is a filter-transporter thing? Mine was an actual hammer. I could swing it around and fly and smite stuff with it. It was a good hammer--not that yours is bad or anything--I just miss mine."

Bast/Bastet turns out to have been a much more interesting System Lord than first thought, and Vibranium turns out to be yet another form of Naquadah.
