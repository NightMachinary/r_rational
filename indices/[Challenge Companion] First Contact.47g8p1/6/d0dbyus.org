The problem with having a fair (for a non-professional) grasp of both physics and economics is the realization that contact between two species originating in different star systems is very unlikely.

With the hard limit of lightspeed, and the vast energy requirements of reaching that, commerce with even our closest stellar neighbors would take at least 4.37 years, and consume energy on a scale that would dwarf the value of any goods we could trade for. At slower speeds, the energy needs become more manageable, but the time horizons become sufficiently long that no trader would find such a transaction profitable over the alternative of virtually any other investment in their local system.

As a consequence of this probable near total lack of interstellar trade, both for us as humans, and for any other species with goals, that we might consider a real "First Contact" opportunity, there is almost no chance of such contact occurring in a time frame it makes sense to predict.

As I see things going, the most likely "First Contact" in the forseable future involve two branches of the same spacefaring species encountering each other after having branched from the same origin planet.

For example

Group A goes to colonize planet A. Some time later, group B goes to colonize planet B. After A has reached maximum population density, it sends group A' to planet C, and some time after that group B sends group B' to planet C as well, and then the contact occurs between groups A' and B', both of whom were unaware of the existence of each other.

And that only really happens if groups A and B fail to maintain any sort of contact with both their origin planet and each other. Which seems unlikely in a universe with radio waves.
