I think a very scary one, is where you make first contact without knowing it.

Turns out the plants on this world are sentient, and they, through on fault of their own, communicate very, very slowly. So, even if you do figure out that the spores they are releasing are for communication, you dont think its intelligent communication because it only is revealed as such over the course of a decade.

Unfortunately, you've already cooked many, many millions of these plants.
