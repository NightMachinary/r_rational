Over the course of my life, I've changed from being scared of the potential absence of aliens to being scared of the potential presence of aliens. First contact with a random alien race is roughly equivalent to an AI FOOMing with a random utility function. Pray for the best. You can't even prepare for the worst. And there's barely anything in-between the best and the worst.
