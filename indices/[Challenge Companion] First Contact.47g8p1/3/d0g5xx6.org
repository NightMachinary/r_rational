Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang is a pretty interesting First Contact novella, centering on a linguist's efforts to communicate.

spoilers:

However, I did find it dubious that a species could have a sort of 'integrative subjective experience' and still be able to intelligently plan and decide, and the extension of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_principle][Fermat's principle]] to mean that somehow certain thinking is 'already done' seems quite strange. I mean, I could imagine that within this story's universe, the Heptapods are able to think/plan/decide basically automatically, and perhaps they're not even all that self-aware... but that's me reading too much into it, probably. I don't know... that seemed like a big limitation; if an intelligent process doesn't have the ability to think about causal relationships at all, how can they possibly solve even rudimentary problems that require abstract understanding of relationships?
