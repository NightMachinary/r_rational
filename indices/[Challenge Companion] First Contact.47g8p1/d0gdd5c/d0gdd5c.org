Oh, we should also keep in mind Blindsight, which has (SPOILERS!!!) some of the more alien aliens that I've read, at least.

Also, Echopraxia, though it's quite different and doesn't have the thematic coherence that Blindsight does. There is this gut-punching aspect of Blindsight that's really distinctive... and also somewhat disturbing in some respects.
