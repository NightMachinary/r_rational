I have lately been kicking around /War of the Many-Worlds/, which posits that the Martians from /War of the Worlds/ were actually from a parallel Earth instead of from Mars. The story takes place in the 1970s of a world where Earth fought an ineffectual, losing war against aliens until death by exotic microbes, following which they began gearing up for a second invasion that never came. It opens on a British super-science program that's managed to stitch the bones of a secret "Martian" world-hopping engine back together as part of their Cold War analog.

All that's well and good, but that leaves me with the rest of the plot, which is somewhat of a mystery. A few days ago I decided that it would be cool for it to be an Outside Context Problem story, and yesterday I decided that making it a first contact story would be sort of cool, since the original /War of the Worlds/ was a first contact story.

And that leaves me with two problems, one world-building related and the other plot related. The world-building question is what an inter-universal alliance looks like (or better, what multiple competing inter-universal alliances look like), but that's not really related to the prompt and I don't want to waste space here with my thoughts on that. The question I'd like help with here is what first contact between parallel worlds looks like, especially one in which one side has massive information or technology advantages over the other.

(The other problem is that I probably need some additional plot element to serve as the main conflict, but I haven't found anything as fun as explaining how /War of the Worlds/ was /really/ about world-hopping Earthlings from a place where evolution beat humans to the punch.)
