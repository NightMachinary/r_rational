I think you are underestimating the damage schisms like these can do to communities, as well as making a dangerous assumption that it's the /nazis/ that would get pushed out in the event of one.

In some other rationalist communities there are explicit spaces for 'culture war' topics and that separation helps keep everyone sane and prevents people who get turned off by political arguments from being scared away. Maybe you could keep a 'politics' or 'drama' list so that people who are particularly concerned about reading something with objectionable views could check? (Something like [[https://www.doesthedogdie.com/][does the dog die]]?)

Most of the people arguing against the tag are trying to avoid conflict from seeping into every activity in the community, maybe respect those wishes?
