...Huh. You know, I thought this subreddit would have more accepting views. Trans people hurt no one, misgendering actually does hurt them, and transitioning is the scientifically accepted cure for gender dysphoria. From a rational utilitarian perspective, the best thing to do when confronted with the existence of trans people is accept their new name/gender and remember to refer to them the correct way, as doing otherwise can cause actual, physical pain.
