The opinions of all the authors on the linked list made their way, in one form or another, into their work. That's going to affect many readers' enjoyment of the works one way or another, and is useful to know before getting invested in the stories. I can't separate an author's, e.g., transphobia from their work if the transphobia is /in/ the work.
