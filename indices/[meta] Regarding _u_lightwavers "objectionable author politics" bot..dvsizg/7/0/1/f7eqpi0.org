Ok, and personally I don't disagree with either. But if I complained that a story contained tankie apologia, would you add a tag for that, too? Even if it was not in the story, but from comments the author made on twitter? If a Chinese reader complained about a story with an "Everyone is trans" theme, would that get a tag? Because if not, then we're back to you openly defecting from community norms. I'd rather we have comments noting TWs for those few stories where it might be an issue, than some random bot giving authoritative-seeming political denunciations.
