I think the change to [Controversial Author Politics] is a step in the right direction, but I'd still rather we just /not/. I doubt anyone here is going to defend Nazis, but the instance I saw in the wild was about attitudes towards transgenders in a Chinese work. If you can't tilt your head and see that calling that inherently objectionable (or even controversial) is itself objectionable from a Chinese cultural standard, then I don't think you meet the standards of this community to be making those calls. Similarly, it took me half a shower to think of "objectionable politics" in virtually every seminal work in this genre. If it's just going to be lightwavers personal beliefs, then I second [[/u/erwgv3g34]] that this is a defection from community norms. I suppose [[/u/lightwavers]] could just flag everything that anyone asks to be flagged for any reason, but that will obviously be gamed immediately. Frankly, this community is not big enough to handle a damn political schism, so can we please just /not/?
