Personally, I always want to know if the work I'm being linked to was written by a white supremacist before I waste any of my finite lifespan on it. And the tags on this list that aren't about the white supremacist author are about works with transphobic content, which, yeah, I'd also like to know about before I get invested in a story. I find that kind of thing meanspirited and unpleasant, and it ruins my enjoyment of the work. So these tags are genuinely helpful to me and I wouldn't want to see them removed.

Proposed compromise: The tags already link to context, so maybe they could just be changed to say "Author Politics," or "Controversial Author Politics." That would leave it to the reader to decide whether they care about author politics enough to click the link, and then, if they do, whether they think the described politics are objectionable.
