Except that that contradicts that the poster above me said, if you read the story and disagree with the politics, then you don't have to enjoy or upvote the story. If you read a story, enjoy it fully, then find out you don't like the authors politics, then you have successfully found an author who has separated politics from their story and you should be able to enjoy it. I still like R Kelly's music, despite him being a despicable person. His character hasn't somehow detracted from the art he already created.
