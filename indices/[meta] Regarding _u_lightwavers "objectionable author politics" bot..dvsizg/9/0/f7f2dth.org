It's about perception. Having a bot that automatically links works with an ad hominem disclaimer is different and influences first impressions differently than a personally expressed opinion. Breadth of coverage (a real person can't respond to every mention of a work) or associations of automated bots to objectivity (giving some the idea that it's the sub's official stance).
