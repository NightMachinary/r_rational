On the one hand, it might be good information to know. On the other hand, it's the perfect example of the "commit one sin and you're damned forever" mindset that people /rightfully/ disdain. I don't think giving authors a badge of shame for being idiots is necessary, on-topic, or compliant with subreddit policy.

A linking bot in a story subreddit should link stories, not controversies. If you want to critique the author's politics, you can do it by hand.
