I think I'd rather have a short list of warnings, or hell, even one general warning, about the content of the work rather than anything about the author themselves. I was under the impression that this sub is mature enough to separate art from the artist, and even if it's somehow not, having a person who used an "attack helicopter" meme on the same list as a quote-unquote "white supremacist neo-Nazi" is a tad ridiculous.
