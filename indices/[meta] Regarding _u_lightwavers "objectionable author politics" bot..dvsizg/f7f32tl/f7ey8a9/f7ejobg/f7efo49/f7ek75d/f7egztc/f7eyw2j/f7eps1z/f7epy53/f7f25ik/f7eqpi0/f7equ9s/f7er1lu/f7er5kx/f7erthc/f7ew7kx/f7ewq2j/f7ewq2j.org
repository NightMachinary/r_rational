  the existence of the tags kills all nuance.

Promoting discussion kills nuance? Do be aware that I don't say or even suggest “X is a Nazi.” I link to a discussion about X and X's work, where concrete evidence is provided that X is a Nazi.

  just because there's trans-insensitive elements in the story.
#+end_quote

The evidence points to an authorial bias against trans people. Trans people might like to know this before they read the work. Reading something that triggers dysphoria causes actual harm, and from a consequentialist perspective the tags are therefore a good idea.

#+end_quote

I was linked directly to the author spouting actual Nazi propaganda. How much more evidence should it take to determine someone is a Nazi when their own words are /actual Nazi propaganda/?
