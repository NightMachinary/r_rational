No one is evil. Some people are more flawed than others. The facts are that I offended some white supremacists, they followed me to Reddit, and I get downvotes whenever I mention Nazis. Could this be a coincidence? Sure. Is it really? I doubt it. I like to follow the evidence, and the evidence I have points to a particular conclusion.
