Extreme stretch here, there is absolutely no consensus on this. You don't let an anorexic person starve themselves to death, I don't know why society has deemed this form of delusion worthy of a different treatment than others. I have no problem with trans people existing, but I wish we could hop off this extremely damaging train of thought and get them real therapeutic help that they need.
