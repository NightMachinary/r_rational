My point is more about perspectives. From a mainstream Chinese cultural standard, "Everyone is trans" or "Everyone is gay" are obviously objectionable and extremely controversial statements. If we go down this road of tagging stories like you have been, we have to choose between taking a universalist approach (which would eventually render the idea pointless as /everything/ gets tagged), or choose a particular perspective (e.g. /yours/), which will be alienating to some portion of our community. And while /you/ might be fine offending everyone who doesn't share your political beliefs, /I/ don't want this community to turn into a vessel for your activism, and would ask the mods to enforce the rules against politics against you.

"Not doing this crap at all" seems like a simpler, fairer Schelling point than any particular implementation.
