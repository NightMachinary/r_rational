  Ah, I see. You're from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/duwi0x/c_th_god_shaped_hole_by_zero_hp_lovecraft/][this thread]]. At the very top of the thread, we have someone who says that the author is "an alt-right white supremacist." Right below we have multiple links pointing directly at the author's own words which back up this assertion. Then you say that "I'm not seeing anything that screams "white supremacist" skimming through their work, just right-wing and anti-capitalism/immigration. But I'm also not digging into it in depth." This immediately rings my own bells. Looking at this, I think I'm justified in assuming bad faith on your part.
