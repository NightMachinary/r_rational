My politics are essentially ‘bigotry is bad' and ‘Nazis should not be promoted.' Therefore I will not see politics from the perspective of a bigoted Christian. If the mods actually stop the tagging of Nazis and stories which convey transphobic messages ... well, I don't think the mods are bigots, so I doubt they'll take action against my tags. They don't even say the politics are objectionable anymore, simply that they exist. It leaves room for commenters to point out nuance.
