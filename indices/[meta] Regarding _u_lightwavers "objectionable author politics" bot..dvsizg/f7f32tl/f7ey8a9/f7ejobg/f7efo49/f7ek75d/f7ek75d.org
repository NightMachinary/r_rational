I think this bot is pretty stupid. The person judging whether a story contains politics is a biased human themselves, and so the entire premise is flawed. Such a bot just a way to shame and lower an author and his work.

If a story contains the author's political views, and this disturbs the reader, they are free to complain about it and stop reading. But creating a systematic and automatic way to say "AVOID THESE WORKS BECAUSE I SAID SO" to any who might see the work is just harmful, invites controversy, and is effectively drawing more attention to such works, whilst simultaneously attempting to place a censor on which works are "not objectionable"
