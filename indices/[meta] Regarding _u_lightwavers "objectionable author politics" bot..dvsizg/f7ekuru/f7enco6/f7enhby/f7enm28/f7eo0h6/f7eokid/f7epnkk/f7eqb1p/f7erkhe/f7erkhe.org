Do you not agree that parroting actual Nazi propaganda makes someone a Nazi? Does someone have to be actually putting Jews in concentration camps before you can say they're a Nazi? And when someone actively supports someone is a Nazi, what what you call them? I have /never/ called you a Nazi sympathizer. All I said is that I believe you're acting in bad faith.
