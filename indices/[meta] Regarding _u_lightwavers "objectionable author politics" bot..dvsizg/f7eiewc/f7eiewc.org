  Any system that tags "actual nazis" and people who hold any right-wing opinion with the same brush is going to be uncomfortable

That's a weird way of putting it. There's one person who's tagged with that flag for political leanings, and I'd be comfortable calling him a Nazi just based on the fact that he tweets a substance indistinguishable from Nazi propaganda.

The other two people are tagged for problematic treatment of trans issues in their works, which again is reasonable (though it's also a super common attitude in China, so most Chinese web novels that cover trans issues will get tagged like that)

I haven't seen any indication that [[/u/lightwavers]] is tagging people with that flag for just "any right-wing opinion".
