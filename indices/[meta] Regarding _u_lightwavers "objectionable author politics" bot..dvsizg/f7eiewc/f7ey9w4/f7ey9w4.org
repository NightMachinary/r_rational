I had a discussion with lightwavers regarding Lord of Mysteries when they initially tagged it. You can see the discussion in the link (be sure to look at posting times). It's worth pointing out that they added the Objectionable Author Politics tag based solely on one reader mentioning that some of the characters exhibited an attitude that might imply transphobia, without any quotes or evidence. Lightwavers hadn't read it or obtained any evidence other than that hearsay (and initially pretended there were quotes provided). This is an incredibly low standard for putting a bot accusing someone of transphobia everytime their story is mentioned. I actually reread the chapters in question after someone else went to the effort of finding them, and found them pretty mundane, with only a couple of instances that could be uncharitably interpreted as implying a character was against trans people (specifically referring to magical sequences that secretly turn you into a man or a woman as a "trap." Maybe that refers to the derogatory english slang for a man that looks like a pretty woman, but it really takes a stretch considering the author is chinese, the work is translated, and the word is referring to the magical potions, not the person).

Moreover you shouldn't mistake the opinions of a character for the opinion of the author.

I will say that I also don't like the idea of policing author politics, even if they actually are evil. We shouldn't avoid a work just because we don't agree with the author, that way leads to small minded conformatism.

Lightwavers responded to this by saying that they are just providing a tag so if the reader doesn't want to support authors with "objectionable politics" they can read the linked post themselves. Certainly readers can choose which works to read however they want, but I find encouraging this very fraught.

Regardless there is still a big difference between mentioning this in a comment, and having a bot post said "objectionable author politics" tag on any mention of the work.

I'm not excited about it, but perhaps if lightwavers just puts a (?) link on all their posts (not just the ones that they think are objectionable), where prospective readers can check out author politics should that be important to them. Or they can just maintain a objectionable author list that people can check if they desire.
