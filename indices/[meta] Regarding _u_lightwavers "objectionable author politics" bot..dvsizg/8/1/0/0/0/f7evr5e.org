To me it's clear that “objectionable” does not mean the person who wrote that thinks everyone is going to find it objectionable, which is why I said it's relatively neutral because it's a pretty weak word. It's also clearly a word that requires a personal opinion so it's not like it's masquerading as being a fact and not an opinion.
