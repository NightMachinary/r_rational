Oh boy. Didn't expect all this Discourse.

I'm a fairly big believer in death of the author, but still think it's worth being informed of an author's biases when reading something and know that other people here probably /aren't/ believers in death of the author. If I were to recommend The Fountainhead to someone, I'd mention the author is a hardcore libertarian, or if I recommended something by a tankie I'd mention that too. But I'd still recommend and read the work.

Having a wrongthink bot, especially by someone who isn't a moderator of the subreddit, makes me a bit uncomfortable. Things like With This Ring being on it also feel over the top, where the objectionable topic was something like a single throwaway sentence 1million+ words into a great piece of fiction that is now being blacklisted due to Forum Drama. And I think Lightwaver is arguing in exceedingly bad faith in all of their comments about the topic of the bot.
