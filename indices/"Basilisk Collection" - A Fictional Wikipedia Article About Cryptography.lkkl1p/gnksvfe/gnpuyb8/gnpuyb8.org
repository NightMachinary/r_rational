  Hash functions in general are usually not based on hard computational assumptions in the way RSA depends on factoring.

On the contrary. Hash function are entirely based on reversing them (pre-image) and colliding them being a hard problem. Even "breaking" them usually means moving some operation from "not in this universe" to "it can be computed using all the resources of the world".

If someone was able to generate long partial inversions easily on a modern hash function it would mean that the whole premise behind how those functions are designed is broken and the way how they're evaluated it broken. It would be a huge discovery.
