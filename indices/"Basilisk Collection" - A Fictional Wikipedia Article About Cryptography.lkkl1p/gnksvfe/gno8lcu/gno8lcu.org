I think you're skipping over the interesting parts of the story. Someone found a vulnerability in SHA-256: sure, but that's just the setup. They announced this with a huge data dump of reversals for /double-/SHA-256, which were all of a particular string format with no explanation why. It was distributed via torrent and 75% went missing, and no one is sure why. The unknown method is mildly interesting; the unknown /motive/ is fascinating.
