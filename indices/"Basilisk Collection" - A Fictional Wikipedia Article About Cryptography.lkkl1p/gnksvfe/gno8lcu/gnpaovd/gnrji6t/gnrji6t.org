There are a bunch of heuristics used when creating hash functions, most of which boil down to “we're pretty sure this defeats a known method of attacking hash functions.” In today's commonly-used hashes (the ones that are practical to use), they're also accepted as probably secure because a lot of skilled cryptanalysts have failed to show weaknesses, rather than because of formal proofs.
