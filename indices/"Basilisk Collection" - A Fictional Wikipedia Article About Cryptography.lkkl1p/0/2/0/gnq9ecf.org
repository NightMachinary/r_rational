Author here. A collection of partial hash inversions described in the story would only prove that doubled SHA-256 is broken, it wouldn't really say much about other hash functions. JohnKeel is right to say that hash functions aren't based on mathematically hard problems like RSA is, and there have been countless hash functions that have been broken from careful mathematical analysis. I won't to go into detail of why I wrote it this way; I want to preserve the "mystery box" of this situation.
