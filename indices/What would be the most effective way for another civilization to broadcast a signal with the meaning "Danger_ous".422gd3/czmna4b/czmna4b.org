O, that's easy. As soon as you have noticed that some new civilisation is sending directed signals into space with the intent to find other civilisations, incinerate a large enough chunk(something the size of France, for example) of their planet. Make sure that the attack appears to come from the direction they have recently sent a signal to. Now they know that there is something out there that wants them dead and they should keep silent lest that something kill them off for good. Signaling 1/0 or something similar carries a danger of being misunderstood and/or ignored, while a giant laser from space is very clear in what it means and is very hard to miss. Coincidentally, it can be as short of an impulse as you prefer, as long as the total energy is appropriate.
