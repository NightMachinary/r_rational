As it was explained to me, dividing by zero isn't possible so if you found it in this sort of context then the first reaction (of a mathematician, I suppose) would be worry rather than "I wonder if this is a math test."

I'm not that deep into mathematics, though, so I can only relay what was said to me by somebody else (which is why this thread exists in the first place). That was in a horror/anti-SOS signal context rather than this one, though, so it might not be applicable (and doesn't seem to be, based on other comments).
