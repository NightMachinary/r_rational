... but why? This seems to be literally the most on-topic of all types of discussion; the upvotes mean the community is okay with it. One of the main reasons I subscribe to this sub is seeing rational/ist slants on familiar tropes without having to read a full story. Plus, judging by its current score, the community is clearly okay with it. Punishing that seems ... weird, Mister Mod.
