Because before we had the rule, there was a definite trend towards low effort 'what if...' posts, and we want to keep a focus on actual finished fiction, not just ideas about it.

Ideas are cheap, and as a sub grows anything without pretty strict moderation tends to revert to the mean... and we would rather stay small and high-quality than become yet another clone of a default sub.

All that said, note that I'm just commenting here instead of removing an off topic post :)
