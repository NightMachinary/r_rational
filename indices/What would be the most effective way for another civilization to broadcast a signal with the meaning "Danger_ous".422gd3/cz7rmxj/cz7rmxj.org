I started thinking about this for quite a while, and I found that the best solutions come from a cost-benefit analysis.

Three assumptions:

-Interstellar travel is expensive compared to staying put.

-They want to destroy us, reasoning that nothing worthwhile can be extracted or negociated for us, and another intelligent species in the neighborhood is bad.

-Interstellar species can always detect another civilization over time.

In that scenario, the best method of survival is to demonstrate your lack of worthwhileness. A multiterrawatt xray beam emitted over a decade to various sectors of the sky tells them you have the capacity to shoot down incoming ships.

This also distinguishes us from other non-emitting and assumed dumb unless proven otherwise species.
