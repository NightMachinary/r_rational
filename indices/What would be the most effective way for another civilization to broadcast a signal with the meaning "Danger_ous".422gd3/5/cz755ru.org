If there's even evidence of the Bad Thing, it's not as apocalyptically bad as it could be. Since your premise suggests every one of the advanced civilizations just want to hide (and hence implying that's a valid survival response - Big Bad can't find them by chance or effort, but can trace broadcasts?), they'd just stay silent.

If they have a reason to risk detection at all (eg coalition for a solution), there'd be no Fermi paradox and any altruists would probably be sharing everything in a last ditch effort.
