Yea, I can't really see a scenario where the Nice Aliens are able to send an untraceable message to us in a form we'd understand. At least, enough to actually understand it as a society. We've all heard of people that wear tin foil hats and spout nonsense. So the message would have to be fairly convincing. It would probably take an annoyingly large amount of back and forth, to really sell any government worth its salt. And I can't see the Nice Aliens being able to transmit such a message to us, in a world where Something Bad exists. It would be too risky. Unless Something Bad wasn't in the form of an intelligent society of some sort (which I believe is the implication based on this post)
