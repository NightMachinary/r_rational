The most concise way of communicating "SHUT UP, IT'S DANGEROUS TO TALK" is /silence./ Which is what we're experiencing right now.

I know it's a chestnut, but here's the obligatory quote from The Killing Star:

1) Their survival will be more important than our survival. If an alien species has to choose between them and us, they won't choose us. It's difficult to imagine a contrary case; species don't survive by being self-sacrificing.

2) Wimps don't become top dogs. No species makes it to the top by being passive. The species in charge of any given planet will be highly intelligent, alert, aggressive and ruthless when necessary.

3) They will assume that the first two laws apply to us.

Imagine yourself taking a stroll through Manhattan, somewhere north of 68th street, deep inside Central Park, late at night. It would be nice to meet someone friendly, but you know that the park is dangerous at night. That's when the monsters come out. There's always a strong undercurrent of drug dealings, muggings and occasional homicides. It is not easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. They dress alike, and their weapons are concealed. The only difference is intent, and you can't read minds. Stay in the dark long enough and you may hear the occasional distant shriek or blunder across a body. How do you survive the night? The last thing you want to do is shout, "I'm here!" The next to last thing you want to do is reply to someone who shouts, "I'm a friend!" What you would like to do is find a policeman, or get out of the park. But you don't want to make noise or move towards a light where you might be spotted, and it is difficult to find either a policeman or your way out without making yourself known. Your safest option is to hunker down and wait for daylight, then safely walk out.

There are, of course a few obvious differences between Central Park and the universe:

There is no policeman

There is no way out

And the night never ends
