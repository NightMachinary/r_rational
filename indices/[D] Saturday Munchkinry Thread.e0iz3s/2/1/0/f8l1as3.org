Nice. Noise cancelling headphones are slightly more effective than earplugs, but still don't fully protect anyone.

I was thinking about how to protect herself from her power, and couldn't come up with any way to conduct the bone vibration away. There's probably a way though.

Her power doesn't work through recordings, though a tinker could make a special speaker that does something similar.

Paying attention to the sounds makes it affect you more.
