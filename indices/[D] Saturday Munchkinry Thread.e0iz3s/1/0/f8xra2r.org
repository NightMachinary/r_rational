Wouldn't that be 511 clones and 1 original?

Presumably food wouldn't be an issue in those first few hours as I could very likely survive 12 hours on my own with minimal discomfort. So that's one less thing to worry about.

If my phone and other effects duplicate with us, we would have to remove the sims fairly quickly to avoid a tower getting pinged and some alarm being set off. Well the premise that we wouldn't be discovered for 12 hours, which suggests that we are either in a heavily secluded area or it at least would take some time for it to be acted on even if discovered quickly. It would also mean that some small amount of cash money is duplicated, which could help in the short term.

Leveraging the added brainpower would result in better planning. I would group off. Have groups of twenty or so discuss various methods of survival, then have groups discuss and break down their best ideas with neighbouring groups until the most effective ideas surface, planning for the known unknowns with various contingencies. It would be also be useful to start a thread on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] I'm sure.

I feel like some should go to ground, changing appearances as well as possible (haircuts, clothing) and heading out in small of no more than three￼. Heading off in different directions, including further into the wilderness. The goal would be to not be discovered unless given the right signal that we're not being disected and tortured. Which would be￼￼￼ an agreed upon phrase or phrases added to agreed upon wiki article(s) to be checked semi-regularly among other sites.

That's a lot of mouths to feed. I don't know how to make money online easily with my skillset. Uh. Monetise a viral video or 1000 identical dudes in a forest. Go extremely public extremely quickly and march in a city. They hopefully won't just blackbag us all if we appear on live tv.
