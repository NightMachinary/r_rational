First time 2, second 4,third 8,fourth 16,fifth 32, 6 64, 7 128, 8 256, 9 512. You're right my bad, thought for some reason you had to take off the first count (1).

Everything you can carry is duplicated so you're right on the sim card. At least 12 hours so it could be longer. I was thinking about making it so you know that the next time you go somewhere where 1024 of you won't be discovered for at least 12 hours this will happen but then I think everyone would buy gold to duplicate.

I think going public is an interesting attempt to avoid capture. If you permanently livestream your squad it will be hard for someone to kidnap you. Not sure how likely that is anyway, especially since there are so many, though obviously no one will believe your story.

I wonder how much groups of 20 would retread the same ground. I wonder how much dialogue benefits clones.

Assuming that you successfully go live and don't get kidnapped what are your plans? What do you do with 1023 brothers who believe that your bed is theirs as are your friends, family and password.

In this scenario it's not clear who the original is either since at the moment of duplication you're briefly unconscious.
