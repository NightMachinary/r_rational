Anecdotally, dialogue helps me to process things so I assume it will help thousands of me sift through our ideas. Yes, we'd likely retread old ground. Using dicerolls to make decisions for us will help to avoid some but not all unwitting psychological influences that lead us to traps.

I'm sure it would be seen as a hoax by many. So the idea would be to take the march to as many cities as possible until enough people are convinced. The messages of the march? “Don't blackbag any of us, we come in peace. We were recently duplicated a lot. This isn't a biological thing, do fibre analyses of our clothes, look at the identifiers on our cash and check our phones - all perfect duplicates. Some weird spacetime and/or god/gods thing happened, we will do non harmful tests in exhange for enough money to get us set up and self-sustaining. We counted how many of us there are so we will know if you get rid of any of us. We will get the word out if you do.”

The optimum endstate I think would be to live in a self-sustaining compound with myselves. From there, group off to take on projects and enrich ourselves and our group. With luck none of us get killed in the meantime.

The hardest part of this is the personal relationships. We would all likely understand how difficult it would be to have a normal family life- can't be having family time split 501 ways. It wouldn't be fair on anyone. As such I would assume there would be an agreement to avoid hidden-from-other-me interactions with family and to not hog time with them. I would hope that they could see us as a cohesive unit and keep in touch with the group. We can, of course, diverge and make new friends as time goes on... it seems difficult.
