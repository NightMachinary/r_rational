No warning. No time to plan.

Just, suddenly, I'm in a new body.

Panic, but quietly. Look around. Nobody else panicing?

Deep breath. Stay calm. Stay /calm/. Check pocket. Cellphone? Good.

...no idea what the unlock code on this phone is. /Not/ good.

Try thinking 'unlock phone'. Let muscle memory, habit, whatever you want to call it, guide my actions. If that /works/, it means a number of things. Lots of them will be important later. But for now... web browser. Gmail account. I remember my own password. I - wait. There's an email to me? From me? "READ FIRST?"

...

...huh. So there's not just /one/ of me in a new body. There's a lot. None of us have memories from each other, so... copies?

Basic plan, then.

Assume (hope?) that the copy process is temporary. That the host body's original mind is there, buried underneath, and merely suppressed for a time. (Try to purposefully relax my hold on this brain. Let the original mind get back. I certainly never planned this).

Seek out any potential problems or issues that my fresh perspective on this person's life can solve. Try to leave this body, this life, in a better state than I found it. Try to deal with this person's life... employment will be tricky, but using my host's muscle memory, I can probably manage to fake it for a few days at least.

Hope like anything that this won't /last/ a few days. But I'll try not to get my host fired before they're able to regain control.

But if I find anything that my original self (or any other selves) need to know, then I can coordinate that with my gmail account.

(I may need to convince Google that yes, I really am logging in from a thousand different locations at the same time. If that fails, I'll create a personal subreddit and only grant access to accounts that send my primary account a private message containing my time travel password).
