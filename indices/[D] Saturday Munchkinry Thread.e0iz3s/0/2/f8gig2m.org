I sure hope this never ever happens, because there's no way those 1000 people that have been overwritten all have no social connections that will notice things are very very wrong. Considering these individuals are randomly selected, and my copies don't keep the memories of the people they overwrote, they won't be able to fake anything well. If the targets had jobs, odds are that my copies would have no idea how to do those jobs. If the targets had families or friends, my copies wouldn't share any of the memories they had with the original targets.

At best, my 1000 copies will all fake having amnesia to explain why they don't remember anything that they are supposed to know. But that in itself is a massive red flag: one person having amnesia is already somewhat odd. 1000 people having it at once? Highly suspicious. People will investigate, looking for any connection between the 1000 amnesiacs. And then things will get worse.

It wouldn't be long before someone notices that all 1000 amnesiacs have strangely identical personalities. That they respond almost identically to various stimuli (because they are all copies of my mind). Theories about deliberate possession will arise, and then my 1000 clones will have to deal with very bereaved families and loved ones harassing them, demanding the return of the original targets. And if any of my copies cracks under interrogation and reveals my name? I will be very very screwed.

EDIT: Honestly the best thing I could hope for is those 1000 copies kill themselves to save me, the original. But knowing myself, that's not gonna happen.
