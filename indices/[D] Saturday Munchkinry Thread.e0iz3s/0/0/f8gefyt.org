You haven't said /which/ city, but I'll assume that it's the city I currently live in, which complicates things, because it's not that big of a city, and a thousand random people means a little less than one and a half percent of the city population.

We immediately attempt coordination, but if we don't know what the heck is going on, that might be difficult. The logical thing to do for any of the copies is to stop whatever they're in the middle of to get in contact with the prime instance, which means the prime instance will naturally be in charge of coordinating all the copies. Knowing the scope of what's happened from reading the prompt, I'm really not sure that we can keep it contained, which really limits what's possible. It partly depends on when it happens: if it's one in the morning, the prime instance will probably be awake, and the copies will then /also/ be awake and able to investigate/coordinate without much interference or immediate risk of detection. If it's during the day, there will probably be a lot of accidents from my mind suddenly being in a body that's driving, along with other scenarios that are easy to envisage but which I can't be assed to run the probabilities on.

Emptying bank accounts is dubiously ethical but also the first thing that I would probably do. There's an argument that the people previous inhabiting the bodies are completely dead and thus their wills (or equivalent) should be executed, but there's also an argument to be made that they've been replaced by a new person who's entitled to their stuff, and if there are suddenly a thousand people with nothing to their name, that's a huge problem. Unsurprisingly, there's not much in the legal code about overwriting minds.

Once most of the copies have checked in with the prime instance, some of us can start working on an FAQ, some can start working on public relations, and some can make plans for housing, food, and basic necessities. Others will work on getting everyone settled in the short-term, meaning getting everyone's phone numbers, names, and descriptions in a spreadsheet, getting new, unique accounts spun up for each of them, requisitioning computers, and so on.

My skills are, unfortunately, fairly narrow. I'm an okay writer and a middling, out of practice software engineer, with the latter obviously being far more practical and scaling a lot better. Still, my city, in the wake of an event that kills a thousand people, would be suffering a real glut of labor-doable-by-me, mixed with a loss of labor in vital sectors that I personally can't replace. That's assuming that in the long term, we would be able to stay free. Moving seems like it would be in order, preferably to the middle of nowhere using combined funds, where we can live in a commune together at minimal cost, working remotely on various problems. I'm pretty sure that I would get along well with myself. We would divvy up necessary occupations, with a few of us specializing in different areas that would be necessary for the group, in a form of vertical integration. We would buy the things we like in bulk, which would be nice.

I think it would be /great/ to have sleeper cells (or agents), but unless I'm given fifteen minutes or so to make plans before the event, I don't think it's doable, and once the government inevitably gets wind of it, we would get rooted out pretty quickly, since I have virtually no knowledge of spycraft and the copies would all hail from my relatively small city, which presumably would have a lot of eyeballs turned toward it.

*tl;dr: Compound in the middle of nowhere with good internet, working remote and/or setting up small companies if those companies can function with myself filling every role.*
