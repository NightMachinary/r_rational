Ah well I'm not in a city like that, I'm travelling so my original body could easily be gone before any clone works down the very long list of much more important things.

In fact I think you'd end up in hospital for amnesia long before you get to meet your original. Unless you know about this thread that is, otherwise I don't think it's very likely.

First you have to be a surviving clone. Say 20% instantly die because of driving or crossing the street or walking down stairs or even walking normally or eating or whatever.

Second you have to be a functional clone, ie capable of independent action. Say 10% left are too young or too old or in a coma or asleep or whatever.

Third you have to deal with the immediate people surrounding you who'd likely take you to the hospital and I see no reason why you wouldn't go along with that. Certainly I'd think something has gone wrong far before I thought magic cloning had occurred. Say 60% of people have other people who would immediately be worried about you not knowing who they are, suddenly not talking midsentence, or behaving weirdly.

Fourth you finally attempt to access the Internet, hope they have a phone or laptop that's biometric secure and is in English which is unlikely but I could probably figure it out even then. Say half of what's left.

Fifth the accounts have to not be locked or you to find one of them where you can communicate with other people accessing the account. Most likely would honestly be reading reddit comments of the original and making an account to reply. So the original alone would receive maybe 50 dms. They'd have to react to that which would take time. I certainly would be like what the fuck if 50 people dmed me saying they are clones.

Sixth if you want to search for them at a house or whatever you need transportation. I can't drive so that's out and you'd have to hope they have their wallet on them otherwise its time to search for it.

Seventh you eventually end up where your original was and since they are being stalked by many people or probably contacted by the police after the 50 or so individuals in hospitals leak your original self aren't even present.

I think it's vital for this scenario to go anywhere outside of a government lab you need to know about it in advance or at least at the time.
