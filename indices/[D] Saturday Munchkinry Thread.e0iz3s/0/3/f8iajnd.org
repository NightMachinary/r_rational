Depends a lot on whether or not we know what's going on. If not, there's very little coordination for a while.

It seems like normalcy probably can't be preserved for more than a small fraction for a short period, so I'd be tempted to try and leverage the abnormality immediately. I think I would try to make what amends I could to friends and family without endangering myself. Out of whatever population has smartphones and can coordinate via discord or slack, 20% of us (probably not including the original?) might storm some public place and do something weird, like sing songs badly. No real goal other than fun and maybe testing coordination after there's been time for divergence. 70% probably organize for some social issue. Most of that 70% will probably get a shared bank account and attempt to join some communes.

This is definitely hard to munchkin, largely because 1000 people have basically been killed at random, and only a small fraction would be able to successfully pretend to be their host, and a smaller fraction would be able to do it for the long term. Not to mention the guilt associated.

If it was something like 1000 depressed antisocial young adults with few or no friends who got replaced, that would be a lot more useable. Or if you got some significant portion of their memories.
