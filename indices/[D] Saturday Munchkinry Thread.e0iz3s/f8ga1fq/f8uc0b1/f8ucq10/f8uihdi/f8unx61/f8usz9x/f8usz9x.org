I wouldn't know there was an original self.

However I can see how through the natural process of attempting to access my email and other things like that I might be able to see other people accessing it. Unfortunately I think it's quite likely that security measures will lock the account before I can understand what's happening.

At that point, if I haven't immediately died or become injured from the suddenness of the transition, or if I'm not disabled or a baby or too old or otherwise don't have access to the Internet (could I end up a fetus), then I guess I'd work something out.

But I'd be occupied by the people around me asking what's going on and me not speaking their language never mind knowing who they are
