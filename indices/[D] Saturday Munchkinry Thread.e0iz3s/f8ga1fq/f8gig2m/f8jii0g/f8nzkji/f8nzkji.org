In this scenario, I would be the least useful clone. The copies are literally me but better, barring any physical disabilities or difficult circumstances. We might set up a website so we could communicate with one another and help out one another, but I would largely be not involved because I would have nothing to offer my copies. At best, since my copies are me, they know how to do my job, so they might help me out of sheer boredom/nostalgia even though I can't do anything to repay them that another copy couldn't do better.

It's kinda mundane really, but the more exciting ways of cooperation tend to be illegal (like insider trading using copies) or insane (like experimenting on ourselves in the same way as that recent short story about Emily and Control did).
