Your mind as it currently is (memories, values, etc) gets instanced into 1000 random individuals in a city. There is no mental link, telepathy, hive mind control or method of replicating this instancing. Your brain state is copied and pasted. It's just yourself in 1001 bodies. Lower brain functions and things like hand-eye coordination are remapped to your brain state so that the new bodies don't immediately start seizing or asphyxiating.

How do you coordinate yourselves to maximise your values?
