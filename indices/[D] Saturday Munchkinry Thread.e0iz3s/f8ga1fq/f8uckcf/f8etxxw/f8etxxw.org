Hi, just joined this sub.

In Worm, a super powers setting where most people are street level but some reach continent-level. There are things that surpass that power level but they aren't relevant to daily life.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/bh5cxj/dumbfounded_pho_profile/][Dumbfounded]]: Hearing her voice makes people's base instincts stronger over time, and the effects fade over hours or days afterwards. She can sing to affect specific instincts, or scream to affect many instincts randomly. It is fairly obvious that her power is working on you, for most instincts. Those with great self discipline can resist it, to a point.

People grow resistant to other mind-affecting powers while affected by her power, if that power can only affect human minds (rather than animal minds).

Her power affects herself, to a lesser degree. She cannot turn it off (other than by not speaking).

edit:\\
A couple tricks I came up with:

- Using the contagious yawning response to stun everyone around her.\\
- Increasing an addict's reward mechanism today, to make them desperate for their addiction tomorrow.\\
- Pavlovian Conditioning herself and her companions.\\
- Reduce people's abiilty to strategize in a battle by increasing their fight/flight/freeze response.
