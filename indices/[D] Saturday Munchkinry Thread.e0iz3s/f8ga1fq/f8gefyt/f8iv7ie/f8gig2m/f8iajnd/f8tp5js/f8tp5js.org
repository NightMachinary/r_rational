How would I (one of the 1000 clones) know that this is what happened? Wouldn't the more natural assumption be that the original me got shifted into a different body rather than duplicated and shifted?

I guess the best answer would be that I'd check my various online accounts for posts that I don't remember making. If I see one, I'd register an email account and send myself an email containing personal information in an attempt to verify that the person making those posts is really me. At which point original me would probably figure out WTF is going on and start trying to coordinate these thousands of clones. Given the little time I've thought about it, our plan would probably be to try to maintain as much of our new bodies prior life as possible, given that I would very much like to be someone else and this is apparently my chance for that.
