You definitely do not have to have watched The Avengers and no characters from the Marvel universe are (or will be) a part of the story. The crossover is thematic, rather than direct.

Being exposed to MLP would likely make the fic more enjoyable but I set out from day one with the intent for it not to be a prerequisite to enjoyment. I hope I've succeeded, but I'll let you be the judge of that!
