Yes , sometimes its more convenient to go to war , but then going to war its not a bad decision its the right one.Though take into account that war is not plain odds of victory , there are probabilities of damage , and the other can precomit to cause as much damage to you as posible if you enter war regardless of if it benefits them.

Anyway I don't think war never happens , I haven't though that much about that possibility.There is a lot of posts on lesswrong and other places about that kind of thing , negotiating tactics etc.

Also since this conversation was maybe boring and I don't have much more to say , here is a fun related story written by scott: [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/21/repost-the-demiurges-older-brother/]]\\
Though the strategy there is very farfeched and most likely wouldn't happen.
