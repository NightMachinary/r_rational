If i want paperclips and other agent wants molecular smiley faces .

If war would damage both parties .

We do a values hand shake instead and both become agents that want to turn the universe into half paperclips half molecular smiley faces .

Which is the action that maximizes paperclips . Since war means less paperclips than that . Paperclip maximizers are perfectly rational . Rationality is not about goals but how to achieve them .
