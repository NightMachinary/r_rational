Isn't that really trivial compared to the resources a few sections of dyson sphere require?\\
Maybe you need a big ship(or maybe not for nearby stars , especially if you send multiple cheap things that you don't care if they fail).\\
But you certainly don't need a monstrously big sip ,just a relatively sturdy one , and you don't have to send probes as fast as possible .\\
It will be big for human scales , but something big for something that can do asteroid mining and is building a Dyson sphere is probably too much.\\
At some point you are exponentially increasing the danger for small changes of speed , and if you are getting\\
light blueshifted into gamma rays you certainly are going too close to c , especially if you are getting microwave background radiation blueshifted into gamma rays.\\
And I mean its not like gamma rays are that difficult to block , you just need shield in front of the ship ,its a problem for small spacecraft and nanomachines, but for big ships impacts are more concerning .

Even if you take 10 years to reach alpha centauri for example its worth if you get there before you can send faster and more expensive stuff.

Also you can just send a big cloud of nanomachines and some of them will eventually arrive , launching them its easy and cheap.
