What would a being whith perfect flexibility do ?. I think that's an incoherent concept , the same way that non deterministic versions of free will are incoherent .

Would an agent that chooses goals randomly be flexible ?.

What criterion has the agent to follow to change goals ?

Why can't that criterion be whatever goals maximize paperclips ?.
