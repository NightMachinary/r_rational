  But if its a paperclip maxmimizer , it just maximizes paperclips(Its on the name) A magical humanlike spirit doesn't come into the code and becomes attached to its paperclips designs. IF it maximizes the number of paperclips it maximizes the number of paperclips , and takes whatever action it thinks will result into more paperclips.

I'm sorry, but then what /is/ a paperclip? How does the AI define an object a paperclip, and distinguishes it sharply from non-paperclips? It seems to me all it can do (all /we/ do as well) is attribute a certain degree of paperclip-ness to objects, and accept as paperclips those which exceed a threshold. But that also means that it make sense it would design and produce paperclips according to what maximises the paperclip-ness as well; which would probably map roughly to their functionality, durability, etc.

Plus let's not forget that the "paperclip" idea is just an over-the-top example. In reality it could be an /anything/ maximizer, with a higher likelihood of it being a maximizer for something a bit more complex than paperclips...
