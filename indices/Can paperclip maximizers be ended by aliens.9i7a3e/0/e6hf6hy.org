There is a story out there, two paperclip maximizers battling. One wants to make paperclips, the other thumbtacks.

But not with ships! No, the smaller/younger one, the one less powerful -it had less time to accumulate ressources- uses precommitment. It precommits to reduce the final number of paperclips for the other guy by increasing entropy a lot - destroying matter for example.

The conflict is resolved by trading partial fulfilment of utility functions: the thumbtacker, instead of destroying matter and making no thumbtacks, gets to make a certain finite number of thumbtacks and in return allows the rest of matter to be made into paperclips.

Eg: the universe is very very susceptible to conversion, its downright easy to send a couple probes to every galaxy in your galactic event horizon even with only one solar system of stuff. You will */loose/* with conventional containment tactics if you are lightspeed limited. The only way to do it is colonize the universe earlier.
