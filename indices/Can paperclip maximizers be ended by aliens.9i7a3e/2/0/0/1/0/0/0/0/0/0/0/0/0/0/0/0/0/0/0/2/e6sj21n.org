the ones that transcend rationality

The thing Im trying to say its that those don't exist .

Or well that those trascend rationality and therefore the agi is not irrational for not pursuing them.

Humans do things as a means to a series of complicated things evolution programed in us that sometimes happen to increase or genetic fitness and sometimes don't because evolution is stupid and hasnt had time to optimize us for the modern world .

Paperclipers do things as a mean to make more paperclips . The code that I described trivialy does that , and its not obiously less competent than humans in any way .
