Yeah, I agree with that post. But the point is exactly that our goals aren't set in stone, and that they are in fact often conflicting and one can take over each other. That's why I mentioned Godel. You can have a goal "protect my tribe", but that can become "my tribe is all of humanity and I need to help it" or "my tribe is Germans and those evil Jews are our enemy!". The difference is just in how your rational mind then /interprets/ that goal, how it processes the information it gathers and thus decides on the best path to follow to achieve the goal. But once the decision is taken, the elaborated goal is almost as strong as the basic drive - in fact stronger, because it's fully conscious and rationalised. That's why I say hard-coded goals aren't rigid but flexible. They can be so twisted and repurposed they end up being little more than very general guidelines.
