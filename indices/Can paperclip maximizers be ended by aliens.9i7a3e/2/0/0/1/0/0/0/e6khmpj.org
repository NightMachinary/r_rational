IMHO big cloud of nanomachines = sure to fail. Radiation will totally do them in. And depending on how big the cloud is, it'll be less efficient than a smaller single pod of lower total mass (plus, it's just easier to propel a single pod with a solar sail + laser or a nuclear or antimatter engine).

The Dyson sphere... probably, but that's a sure return in energy, not a sink. Let's put it this way, is the AI trying to produce paperclips /as fast as possible/, or just /as many paperclips as possible/, regardless of speed? In the latter case, it makes far more sense to play the long game. Also there's the issue of the risk of any such separate nuclei of the AI eventually mutating and developing their own independent individuality - being separated by light years of space that prevent communication - which could even make them a competitor and thus a threat in the long run. I say "mutating" because I think if you start talking nanomachines and programs that copy themselves over and over then similar mechanisms to Darwinian evolution kick in - random mutations become possible through copying errors, and environmental factors will affect for example the nanomachines' ability to duplicate themselves perfectly.
