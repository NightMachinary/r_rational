Well, it all depends imho at what the 'cap' for such a maximizer is. I don't believe much in endlessly divergent exponential intelligence explosions, nor in the possibility that the laws of physics are infinitely exploitable. If there's a limit (be it thermodynamic, the laws of relativity, the indeterminacy principle, etc.) then at some point the maximizer should hit it. Or it could have its own internal architecture's limits, that for some reason it is unable to overcome - a blind spot, if we want. Anyway, I'd expect its growth to taper off after a while, and its expansion to become maybe linear instead of exponential. That would leave it an opening. If the cap it hit is universal, then the best anyone else can do is be on the same level, more or less, and keep it at bay, or fight a long, drawn out war. If the cap it hit is specific to its own limits, though, then it may as well find someone who's much more powerful and who just obliterates it for good.
