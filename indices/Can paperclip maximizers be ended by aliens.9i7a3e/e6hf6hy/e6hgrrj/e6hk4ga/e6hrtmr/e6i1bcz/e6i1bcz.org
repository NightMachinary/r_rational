  That... might actually work, and it's really clever. But man, /what a gamble/.

Thanks.

  Why would they care, before we become a danger?

Because it is so, so much easier to destroy a paperclip maximizer by ensuring it doesn't get built in the first place, rather than waiting until after it has become an existential threat. Since humanity is on the verge of building such a paperclip maximizer (at most 3 centuries away?), now is really the right time for such an alien civilization to intervene and stop us from doing that.

  It's a reference to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]]. And it's supposed to be /through/ friendship. Friendship isn't the goal. It's the means, built into the core directives of the AI. So of course torturing people isn't friendship.

I read that story, and it depends a lot on your perspective on what uploading is. If you consider uploading as the process of turning yourself into a digital lifeform, then yeah, that's a story of a friendly AI trying to do what is best for humanity by turning them into digital lifeforms.

If you consider uploading as the process of creating a perfect digital copy of yourself that isn't actually you + killing you at the same time, then it is an entirely different story. One where the superintelligent AI gets around its "inability" to kill humans by iteratively convincing people in unhappy situations to kill themselves, gradually and inevitably turning life on earth into hell on earth due to sudden depopulation. And so with each iteration the remaining humans are more and more indirectly tortured by the AI until they either give in and kill themselves, or die from a variety of ailments. Until finally the last remaining human dies, and the AI is at last allowed to maximize its utility function by turning the entire earth and beyond into more resources for itself.

​

In short: it is a story where an AI (indirectly) tortures sapient beings until they "say they are friends" by uploading (killing) themselves. Not so different from what I wrote.
