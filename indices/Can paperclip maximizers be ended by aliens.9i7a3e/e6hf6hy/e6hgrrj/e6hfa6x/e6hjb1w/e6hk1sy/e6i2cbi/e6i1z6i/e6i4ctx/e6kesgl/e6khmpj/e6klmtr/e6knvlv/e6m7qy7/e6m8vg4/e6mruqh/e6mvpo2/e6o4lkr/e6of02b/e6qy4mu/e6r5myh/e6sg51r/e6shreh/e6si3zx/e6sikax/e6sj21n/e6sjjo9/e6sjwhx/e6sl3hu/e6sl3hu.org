That's only if the forces of the two agents are perfectly balanced.

Suppose at the moment of their meeting the paperclip agent is strong enough that it has a 60-40 chance of winning the war. Then it can either agree to the deal, and take a 100% chance of turning 50% of the universe into paperclips, or go to war, and take a 60% chance of turning 100% of it. At which point the other agent has to defend since it's either 40% to turn 100% or 100% to turn 0%.

Suppose the agent adjusts the deal to match their strengths. So if winning odds are 60-40, it proposes to split the universe 60-40. Then again, the deal will be accepted only if both agents have the same exact estimate of each other's strength. But even for a superintelligence that's absolutely impossible. Superintelligence doesn't mean having perfect information, just very good (not perfect either) deliberation capabilities given the information they possess. And since we're talking about a meeting across space, some parts of each agent's forces will be outside of the other agent's lightcone, so there are actually physical limits to their estimates. Information passed between the agents of course don't count: they both have an incentive to lie and puff themselves up. As long as their estimates for the odds of conflict don't match, it can lead to a situation where a perceived loss makes it more convenient for one agent to go to war.

For example, agent 1 estimates its odds of victory as 60-40, and suggests a compromise of splitting the universe 60-40 as a result. However agent 2 only estimates the odds as 59-41, so it has to choose between taking a 100% chance at 40%, or a 41% chance at 100%. So it decides that war is more convenient. War breaks out.
