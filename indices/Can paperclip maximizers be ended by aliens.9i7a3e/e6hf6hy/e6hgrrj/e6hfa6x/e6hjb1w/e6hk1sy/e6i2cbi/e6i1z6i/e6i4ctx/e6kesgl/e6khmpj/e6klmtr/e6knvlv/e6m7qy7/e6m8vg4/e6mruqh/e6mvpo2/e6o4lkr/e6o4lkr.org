Yes they can improve designs, and? Lets say they are improving paperclips to cost less resources ( by making small molecular paperclips that still fit the definition)

Ai 1 makes paperclip A that costs 2 units of resources .

Ai 2 designs paperclip B that costs 1 units of resources . What crazy reason would either of them have to go to war?

AI 1 will just start making B paperclips when the other tells it its cheaper(after checking its true). The ai its not going to become a paperclip B maximizer , that would be stupid.

Its the same if they are maximizing paperclip durability or something , and one thinks its paperclips are better , they talk and check which design is actually better.
