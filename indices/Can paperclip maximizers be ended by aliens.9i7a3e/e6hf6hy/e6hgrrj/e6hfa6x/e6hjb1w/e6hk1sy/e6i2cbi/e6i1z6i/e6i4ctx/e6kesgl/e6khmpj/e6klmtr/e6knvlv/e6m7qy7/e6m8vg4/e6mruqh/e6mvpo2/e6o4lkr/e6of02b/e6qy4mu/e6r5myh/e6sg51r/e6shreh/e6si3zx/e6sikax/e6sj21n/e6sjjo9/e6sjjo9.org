You'd think "don't kill yourself before hitting reproductive age" would be a no-brainer for maximizing genetic fitness, yet people do it. There is no single hard-coded goal you can ascribe to /any/ human mind. In fact, suicide is probably the perfect example because that I know of we're the only animal who does that. It's literally the perfect example of something that we do because beyond a certain threshold of intelligence we manage to find contrived excuses and ways to hack our fundamental instincts to completely different ends.

You mention killing babies - are you /seriously/ suggesting not killing babies is anything close to a human hard-coded goal? Plenty of humans have killed babies. Some have killed /a lot of babies/, sometimes without thinking much of it. Just because it's unpleasant to think of doesn't mean people don't do it. And that doesn't even go into how many people /potentially/ could do it if in the right circumstances. Soldiers sent off to war, concentration camp guards.

Anyway I'm not denying the possibility of the existence of an intelligence with hard-coded goals. Just saying that the very fact of having absolutely unflexible goals would make it able to enter in a conflict over them. Conflict and violence are born whenever compromise is off the table, and that's what hard-coded goals are. Not all sets of goals would allow this, but /some/ could.
