Well, it would have to divert resources for that, and if the probes aren't effective enough, it's pointless. The probes need to have a good success rate for their mass. Plus, the actual radius is influenced by the speed at which the probes are sent; however, higher speeds require higher energies.

The fundamental problem is, of course, to avoid failure. A small probe carrying nanomachines is very vulnerable, because cosmic rays would do a number on it. The longer the travel time, the worse the damage. In addition, the faster the probe, the more blue-shifted the radiation coming from the forward direction (mainly the light of whatever star it's travelling towards and the microwave background radiation). When you start getting in the gamma rays and higher, the added radiation damage becomes a serious issue. And that's not even considering how deadly even the tiniest of impacts will be at those speeds.

So, in order for your probes to be more reliable, they need to be more massive. Shielding, redundant systems, self-repairing systems, stuff like that. But that means increasing the amount of energy. At the very beginning, it simply would not possess enough to spend on that. After it build a few sections of a Dyson sphere around its home star, that may be a possibility.
