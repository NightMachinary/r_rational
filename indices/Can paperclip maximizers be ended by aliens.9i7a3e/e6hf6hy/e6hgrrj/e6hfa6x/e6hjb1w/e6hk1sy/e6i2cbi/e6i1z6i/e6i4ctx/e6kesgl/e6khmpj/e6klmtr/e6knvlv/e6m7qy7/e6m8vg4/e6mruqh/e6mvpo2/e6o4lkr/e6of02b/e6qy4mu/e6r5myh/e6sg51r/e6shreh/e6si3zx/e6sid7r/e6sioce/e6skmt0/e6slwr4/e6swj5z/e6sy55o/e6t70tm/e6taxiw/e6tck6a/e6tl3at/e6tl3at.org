Well, humans both cooperate /and/ go to war. I'm not saying war is a certainty, just that it's not off the table.

I think an important factor is also how inclined the AIs are to "play it safe". Do they apply a discount rate to future paperclips? Do they prefer a 100% chance of a 50% yield over a 50% chance of a 100% yield? Do they play the game conservatively or aggressively? I don't think there's necessarily an optimal answer to these questions, in situations in which the margins are small.

Also consider the possibility of border war. The AIs don't need to try to annihilate each other, they don't harbour hate or desire for revenge, so they may just have some local scuffle over contested systems if it's locally convenient but ignore each other or even cooperate elsewhere.
