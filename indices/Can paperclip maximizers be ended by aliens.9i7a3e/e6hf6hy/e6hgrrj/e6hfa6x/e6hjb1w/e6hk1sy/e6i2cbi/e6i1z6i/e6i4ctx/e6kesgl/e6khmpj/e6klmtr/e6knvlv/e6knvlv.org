  It would have to be a bug , a paperclip maximizer doesn't become a competitor by becoming independent

Is it okay with maximizing the number of paperclips, or does it want them to be /its/ paperclips? Like, for example, it improves on the design, and consider /other/ paperclips dissatisfactory? In which case a long enough separation would produce two different competing paperclips designs and it'd be war.

  The problem whith waiting is that you loose material , since it exits your Hubble volume which means less paperclips in total .

Speed is still a factor though, so it'd be interesting to see what the tradeoff is there. If by waiting a bit you can afford later to send very high speed probes, you're actually gaining time overall.

(BTW right now I'm playing a Determined Exterminator machine civilization on Stellaris so this is all very relevant to me XD)
