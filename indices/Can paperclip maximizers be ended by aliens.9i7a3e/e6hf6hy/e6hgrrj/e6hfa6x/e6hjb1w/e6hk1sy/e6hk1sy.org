Expansion in terms of occupied volume, sure. But usually one thinks of 'growth' in these cases more as for example energy production and consumption. So the first stage of it would be consolidating one's hold within the bounds of that constant in a local neighbourhood (Earth, the Solar System), and only later worry about outward expansion.
