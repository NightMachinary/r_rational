It is possible.

Space is big, like really big. Even if we're talking about just one galaxy.

So detecting a hegemonizing swarm might take a long time, unless the "good" hegemonizing swarm has been expanding for a while. And even then, unless the "bad" swarm has easily exploited security vulnerabilities, it might take a while longer to bring enough force to bear to subdue / conquer the "bad" swarm, if that is even possible.

You may note that I have "good" and "bad" in quotes, because the solution to the problem is nearly as bad as the problem itself.
