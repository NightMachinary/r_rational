I've played through the game before and know what it's about. The way I see it, all this angst about AI comes from a combination of pop culture and media intellectuals hyping the issue. Elon Musk talks about AI a lot, as did Stephen Hawking, may he rest in peace. They've massively overblown the issue, mostly because they see themselves as intellectuals. And what does an intellectual fear most of all? Somebody who does what they're best at better than them. The vast majority of us put up with other people who know more than we do all the time though. We're still here.

The thing is, there's a lot of flaws in the logic behind modern prosophobia / technophobia or whatever you want to call it. It's just "Nothing to fear about AI" doesn't really make headlines.

I've actually had the privilege of working with some multi-million dollar machine learning algorithms recently. While I didn't help build them, I talked to many people who did and it's immediately apparent that the growth of the algorithm is entirely restricted to the confines of the model it is built off of. The overnight rise to god-like levels of superintelligence simply isn't possible. The AI would essentially have to build another AI from the ground up, the same way humans would build the AI.
