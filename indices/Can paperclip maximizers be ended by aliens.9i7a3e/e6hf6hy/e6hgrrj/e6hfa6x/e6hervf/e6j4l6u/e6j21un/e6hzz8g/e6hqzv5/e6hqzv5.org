  Another paperclip optimizer from Betelgeuse that happens to be more powerful at the time
#+end_quote

If another paper clipper wasn't already apparent (because it would leave a large portion of space only visible in IR) then by the time one paperclipper finds another they'd both have probably consumed large swathes of their respective galaxies. As for who wins it's hard to say. It seems like resources may be the only thing that matters here because technological capacity may max out pretty quickly but it's hard to say that with any real confidence.

  An alien task force whose job is to put paperclip maximizers to a stop
#+end_quote

It strikes me that any such alien force is only going to notice a paperclipper from earth by the time it's already consumed much of the local galactic group, since its civilization would need to be very, /very/ far away or arise in the future. Simply because given there's many strong incentives for both a civilization and individual people/faction within a civilization to expand in a obvious fashion the lack of evidence of this requires either really improbably assumptions be made about /all/ alien civs or they be staggeringly rare.

  Humans nuking the thing before it consumes Earth???

Even in the extremely unlikely event humans are able to mount a coordinated response to an uncontained UFAI, the only possible effective countermeasure would be introducing a rival AGI. An AGI is going to spread it's nanites out as quickly and widely as possible, so even putting aside that it can just hide underground it's too widely distributed to meaningfully attack.
