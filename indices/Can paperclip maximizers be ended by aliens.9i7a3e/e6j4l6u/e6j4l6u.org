I don't really put much weight into the paperclip maximizer idea in general, just because it assumes a complex intelligence can be driven by simple goals. The idea that complex organisms have complex goals is a big deal in psychology.

Humans are "built" with the goal of making as many new humans as possible as a fundamental objective. You are descended from the first dividing cell, and every organism before you has been set on reproducing. Every generation has honed you towards being an adequate self-replicating machine. However, humans still care about a lot more than reproducing.
