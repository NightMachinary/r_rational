Of course, it's entirely /possible/ that they might have done that. But it's also possible that they just never had the need to. We don't know how common life or technological civilizations are. We could be the only ones. There could be a lot of them. Or there could be only two or three. Maybe they never even really thought to pursue the creation of intelligence that could be likened to theirs because it just doesn't resonate with their system of values. Maybe no one else's both stupid and clever as us. There's a bunch of reason why this hypothetical civilization couldn't have met the problem before, but still have, in theory, the weapons to fight it. "They didn't show up yet" isn't sufficient evidence, it relies on a lot of other assumptions.
