While stories are being mentioned, one which came to mind: search (for instance in Google) for "The Demiurge's Older Brother".

Edit: In response to the original question, particularly regarding other paperclippers, one can prove by contradiction: if an effective paperclipper could come about, and nothing could stop a paperclipper, then if two paperclippers meet you have an ultimate-spear-meets-ultimate-shield issue. One has to be significantly hindered by the other, or in other words, making your values be paperclipper values doesn't make you unstoppable, just determine how you use power that you grasp, same as anyone else. Or to put it another way, being able to amass enough power to crush all of humanity like a bug does not equate to having reached the upper limit of how much power is possessable.
