  I can only see this AI imprisoning sapient beings and torturing them until they say they are friends. But yeah I suppose it would kill off the paperclip maximizers.

It's a reference to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]]. And it's supposed to be /through/ friendship. Friendship isn't the goal. It's the means, built into the core directives of the AI. So of course torturing people isn't friendship.

  If such a force exists, and is somehow strong enough to defeat paperclip maximizers, wouldn't it be far far easier for them to just stop humanity before they create a paperclip maximizer? Why aren't they here yet?

Why would they care, before we become a danger?

  In this case, they can threaten any paperclip maximizer with the weapon: either the paperclip maximizer destroys itself, leaving the universe with some amount of paperclips used by civilizations, or the aliens use the weapon and destroy the entire universe, resulting in 0 paperclips.

That... might actually work, and it's really clever. But man, /what a gamble/.
