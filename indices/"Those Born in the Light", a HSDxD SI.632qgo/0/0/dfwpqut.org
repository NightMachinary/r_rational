I think you've been burned by the amount of crappy SI fiction there is, but the genre doesn't have an inherent conflict with rationalism, it's just that a lot of authors write these stories as a form of wish fullfillment, rather than making them good stories in their own right.

Truly good SI fics, which deviate from canon significantly, exist, and those are usually the only ones worth reading because it means that author feels comfortable enough to write his own storyline rather than piggybacking off of a pre-set line of events without taking the character's actions into consideration. Bad authors simply aren't good at modeling the characters they have taken from other authors.

I think SI fics are interesting because the character represents an outside context problem, so a good author is required to make antagonists adapt their methods in reaction to the SI's knowledge and capabilities. It's essentially very similar to time loop fics like MoL, except that the loop only occurs once.

But yeah I see why you'd think that, I hope the rant helped.
